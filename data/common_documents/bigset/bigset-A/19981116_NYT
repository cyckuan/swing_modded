IT'S WAIT AND SEE RE SOWARD'S ANKLE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC wide receiver R. Jay Soward had the boot
removed from his severely sprained ankle and coach Paul Hackett
said Sunday he is counting on having his talented receiver
available for the UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Soward will be ready remains unknown to the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Although Soward will do some light running when USC holds its
next practice Tuesday, he is listed as no better than ``probable''
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find out on Tuesday because he will try and go,''
Hackett said. ``Let's just see where it is. I'm counting on him
playing. I'm not going to rule him out until I see some evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward walked gingerly on the practice field Sunday night, after
wearing a boot on his right ankle for nearly a week, and certainly
didn't seem close to playing shape. But earlier Sunday, he seemed
to be walking without a limp.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he has drawn up his game plan with the expectation
he will have a healthy Soward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the game plan together with the assumption he would be
as big a part of it as all year,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be an impressive task for an injured Soward. He was
supposed to be involved in 13 of USC's first 20 plays against
Stanford, before getting hurt early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Morton's improving: Tailback Chad Morton, who has been
bothered by a sprained ankle since the Washington game, is about 90
percent recovered, according to Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to face the fact that he won't be 100 percent,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Morton practiced Sunday but came out early, because Hackett said
he was ``nervous'' Morton might aggravate the ankle during some
contact drills.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he didn't know if Morton would have played if USC
had a game last weekend, saying his ankle was about 60 percent
recovered. Morton is sure to play against UCLA, however. He's
expected to return kickoffs and punts for the Trojans, since
Soward's status is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rank stat: USC is 14-15-1 against ranked UCLA teams, and
8-7-1 when UCLA is ranked in the Associated Press Top 10. USC has
won seven of the past eight games when UCLA is ranked in the Top
10.
</P>
<P>
   __ Battle of the bands: In the first event of rivalry week, the
USC band defeated the UCLA band 32-25 Sunday at Cromwell Field.
</P>
<P>
   __ Guyness injures knee: Little-used wide receiver Stanley
Guyness tore ligaments in his knee during last Thursday's scrimmage
and will be lost for the remainder of the season. Guyness is not
expected to resume practicing until next summer at the earliest.

   CLINTON SAYS US WILL WORK TO OUST SADDAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By GREG McDONALD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton upped the ante Sunday in the
deadly game being played out with Saddam Hussein, saying he plans
to intensify efforts to remove the Iraqi president from power when
the latest crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling back from the brink of war, Clinton called off a
Saturday airstrike against Iraq after Saddam sent an urgent series
of letters to the United Nations promising to comply
unconditionally with demands that he allow weapons inspections to
resume
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, who came under fire for not ``pulling the trigger''
on Saddam, as one member of Congress put it, said the United States
and its allies would ``remain vigilant, keep up the pressure and be
ready to act'' immediately if Iraq shows any signs of reneging on
its latest commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has backed down, but that is not enough. Now Iraq must
live up to its obligations,'' Clinton told reporters Sunday at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by Defense Secretary William Cohen and other members of
his national security team, Clinton stopped short of calling for
Saddam's overthrow. But he made it clear that the United States
will follow through with financial support and other efforts aimed
at stirring up opposition to Saddam from within Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the latest crisis ``demonstrates, unfortunately,
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein remains an impediment to the
well-being of his people and a threat to the peace of the region
and the security of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the long term,'' he added, ``the best way to address that
threat is through a government in Baghdad _ a new government _ that
is committed to represent and respect its people, not repress them,
that is committed to peace in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks were echoed by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who said he would keep British forces in the gulf region on
alert to provide support to U.S. forces if military action is
eventually called for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be sure that what the Iraqis are saying they will
do ... This is not over yet,'' he cautioned, adding that every
promise Iraq has made this time must be ``bolted down'' before U.S.
and British forces are withdrawn from the immediate area.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations officials said they expect to have international
inspectors, who were pulled out of Iraq completely last week, back
in Baghdad within the next two days. Richard Butler, who is in
charge of the U.N. inspection effort, said he was ordering the
inspectors to return to Iraq on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Butler said he believed it would take longer than that to
get enough personnel and equipment in place again to carry out the
kind of surprise inspections that have already uncovered and led to
the destruction of various chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest crisis began on Oct. 31 when Saddam said he would no
longer allow inspections to continue and called on the U.N. to end
economic and other sanctions imposed against his country. Saddam
claimed again that he was not producing weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday that there is no
doubt, however, that Iraq is continuing to manufacture biological
weapons like VX nerve gas and missiles capable of delivering them
to nearby nations. He said inspectors have also found plenty of
evidence that Iraq is continuing an aggressive biological and
nuclear procurement effort abroad in violation of the agreement it
signed in 1991 ending the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aborted an airstrike against Iraq Saturday as U.S.
bombers were on their way to selected targets and fighter planes
aboard the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower in the Persian Gulf were
being prepared for takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen confirmed to reporters that the order to strike had
already been given early Saturday and the planned attack was nearly
played out ``right up to the end'' when Iraq sent its first letter
to the U.N. promising to back down. But the initial letter was
unacceptable, he said, and Iraq was forced to send a follow-up
statement pledging unconditional cooperation before Clinton issued
a final order for U.S. forces to stand down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was close, very close,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the buildup of American forces in the region would
continue through the Thanksgiving holiday in case military action
becomes necessary. By Thanksgiving, 22 U.S. Navy ships will be in
the Persian Gulf along with the Eisenhower. Altogether, 45,000 U.S.
military personnel will be on station in the region.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Iraqi ambassador Nizar Hamdoon claimed a
partial victory for Saddam, saying that his leader had at least
``succeeded in getting a good hearing'' about his frustration with
continued international sanctions that were put in place after the
war.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamdoon acknowledged that inspectors would be allowed to go
``anywhere they want.'' Asked what forced Iraq to back down this
time, Hamdoon said, ``We have decided to give it a chance because
peace, stability, preventing war, I think, is a noble goal.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's decision to call off military strikes was
welcomed by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan as ``courageous'' and
``statesmanlike,'' it was strongly criticized by some Republican
senators who have long advocated using force against Saddam to
remove him from power.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said he thought it was a mistake to reverse
course on the brink of airstrikes and called on Clinton to push
ahead with destruction of sites known to be part of Saddam's
weapons programs. He also called for strikes against Saddam's
military forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have the forces moving there now, we ought to use
them,'' Lugar said, adding that diplomacy with Saddam has been a
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're in the dodge and weave period again,'' he said on
NBC's Meet the Press. ``We've been embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also called for assassination to be
considered as an option to get rid of Saddam, even though U.S. law
bans it.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the criticism, Clinton agreed that military action
would ``significantly degrade the capability of Saddam Hussein to
develop weapons of mass destruction.'' But he said it would also
mark the end of the U.N. presence in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Following the U.N. Security Council meeting Sunday, Annan said
that member nations were satisfied that Iraq had agreed
unconditionally to allow inspections to continue. But he conceded
that he could not guarantee that the new agreement will work. ``I
cannot tell you that there will not be a next time,'' he said.
``But if there is a next time, I'm not sure there will be enough
time for diplomatic appeals.''

SEAHAWKS GO DOWN IN BOATLOAD OF MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ When the Seahawks fail to make the NFL
playoffs for yet another season _ and this underachieving team is
definitely stumbling down that all-too-familiar road _ they can
dial up Sunday's loss to the Oakland Raiders for reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders scored on each of their final three possessions to
steal a 20-17 victory before a near-deranged crowd of 51,527 at the
Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad enough that the Seahawks lost to the Raiders for the
second time in three weeks. What was worse was how they did it.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks were penalized a season-high 14 times for 144
yards, one shy of the club record set in 1979 against the Denver
Broncos. The worst, and most costly, was a 15-yard penalty against
cornerback Fred Thomas for roughing the passer with 35 seconds left
in the game. It gave the Raiders the ball at the Seahawks 35-yard
line and set up Greg Davis' game-winning 38-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The offense scored only 10 points after Joey Galloway returned
the first punt of the game 56 yards for a touchdown and did not
convert any of its 13 third-down situations.
</P>
<P>
   The defense yielded 13 fourth-quarter points, on two field goals
by Davis and a 25-yard run by Harvey Williams, and for the second
time in three weeks made Raiders backup quarterback Donald Hollas
look better than he is.
</P>
<P>
   The special teams gave up a 63-yard punt return for a TD to
Desmond Howard.
</P>
<P>
   The sum of all this ineptness was a loss that will be harder to
shake than any of the Seahawks' previous four losses, and likely
will linger into an offseason where another year of failed
expectations could cost head coach Dennis Erickson his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to let a team beat you, but it's another thing
to contribute to it yourself,'' said Warren Moon, who played his
final game as a 41-year-old quarterback _ he turns 42 on Wednesday
_ and contributed to the unraveling by throwing three
interceptions. ``We contributed too much today. It's just getting
old.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems that cost the Seahawks Sunday's game were not a
one-game aberration, but a continuation of the deficiencies that
have plagued the team all season. While the Raiders boosted their
record to 7-3, the Seahawks fell to 5-5 with games in the next two
weeks against the Dallas Cowboys and Tennessee Oilers, both
playoff-caliber teams.
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs? The look on Erickson's face said even more than his
acerbic answer when asked about the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts us deep in the hole,'' said Erickson, the Seahawks'
fourth-year coach. ``There is no room for error now. This is a
terrible loss because we had a chance to win and didn't. We did
dumb things that cost us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Moon threw a 12-yard TD pass to tight end Christian
Fauria to tie the score at 17 with 1:01 left to play, the Seahawks
were thinking overtime and perhaps one last chance for redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the unthinkable happened.
</P>
<P>
   Hollas the Seahawks beater completed a 12-yard pass to rookie
fullback Jon Ritchie. Hollas the Seahawks tormentor then scrambled
12 yards to the 50. On the next play, Thomas blitzed, Hollas ducked
and the Seahawks' cornerback left his feet. Mistake No. 1. Mistake
No. 2 was worse: Thomas slapped Hollas in the face mask, then
grabbed Hollas' helmet on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than an incomplete pass, the Raiders got 15 yards and a
first down at the Seattle 35. After Hollas' 15-yard pass to Tim
Brown moved the ball to the 20, Raiders rookie coach Jon Gruden
took no chances, sending Davis on for the game-winning kick even
though 25 seconds remained on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have never left my feet,'' said Thomas, who was
playing more than usual because starter Willie Williams left at the
end of the third quarter with a strained hamstring. ``He adjusted
to me and I reached out and grabbed him around the neck. It was a
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what it boiled down to,'' Thomas offered in a near
whisper, ``was it cost us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another game that couldn't be explained:
</P>
<P>
   -- Two weeks ago, the Seahawks turned the ball over five times
in a 31-18 loss to the Raiders at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   -- In their Week 4 loss at Pittsburgh, it was four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   -- The following week in Kansas City, it was four more turnovers
in a loss to the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   -- A week later, it was 12 penalties for 93 yards in a loss to
Denver at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   -- Last week, even in a win over the Chiefs, the Seahawks had 13
penalties for 96 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That's 27 penalties in the past two weeks, and 17 turnovers in
their five losses.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask the Seahawks to explain what transpired, or what's
wrong with the foot-shooting offense that has now scored only 17
TDs in 10 games. They have no answers. They are tired of offering
excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding ways to lose games,'' defensive end Michael
Sinclair said. ``We can win if we just cut out the stupid penalties
and the stupid turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Seahawks seem destined to prove on an almost weekly
basis, that is easier said than done.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TEMPE, Ariz. _ High up in the press box at the top of Sun Devil
Stadium, defensive coordinator Dave Campo knew exactly what was
coming. So he did the first thing that leaped to his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put my hands over my eyes,'' Campo admitted. ``I couldn't
watch. Figured I'd find out what happened by the noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in the right corner of the end zone, left cornerback Kevin
Smith had a good hunch of his own. So he leaped into the air with
receiver Rob Moore and did all that he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bumped? Tangled? Nudged? I don't know,'' Smith said. ``I think
the ball hit me. I just don't know where. But I made a play. That's
what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer's last, desperate toss to Moore on a fade route as
time ran out hit Smith in the back and fell harmlessly to the turf,
and this time the Cowboys were not whipsawed by the Cardinals in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Arizona fans celebrated Kevin Butler's winning field
goal that bounced magically off an upright by tearing down the goal
post, marching it through the downtown streets and dumping it into
a dry riverbed. A season later, it was the Cowboys dancing away in
jubilation before a referee could think twice and throw a flag for
pass interference against Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard our guys yelling in the booth, I pulled off my
headset and got out of there,'' Campo said. ``Game over. We got
what we came for. Nothing else matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. What counts in the standings is a 35-28 victory over what
had to pass for the Cowboys' only remaining challenger in the toxic
waste dump that is their division.
</P>
<P>
   What the NFC East needs is a war with Iraq to distract the world
from the scandalous state of affairs in which only Dallas has a
record that is above the .500 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pretty much sums up our division,'' said Smith. ``But
that's not saying a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It's like saying: ``You don't sweat much for a fat guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a very sincere compliment.
</P>
<P>
   In constructing their 7-3 record, the Cowboys have not won a
single game against a team that sits with a winning record today.
And after bolting to a 28-0 lead and then hanging on by a whisker
to beat the Cardinals on Sunday, the Cowboys showed both offensive
potency and reasons to be concerned about the defense. Very
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   When injury forced Deion Sanders to miss all of the third
quarter and most of the fourth, the Cowboys' ability to defend
plummeted faster then Newt Gingrich. Dallas came into the game
minus Sanders' backup, Kevin Mathis (broken forearm), and when
Smith suffered a separated shoulder in the second quarter, the
situation in the secondary began to look more panicky than an
unannounced fire drill.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' official injury report said that Deion suffered a
sprained left ``great'' toe.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the rest of us simply have big toes. But with Deion,
he'll tell you that just about everything else on him is great. So
why not his toes, too? In light of the way Plummer made like a
little piggy going to market in Sanders absence, maybe it's a
wonderful or fabulous digit. Maybe he's ``toe-rrific.'' What's
obvious is that the Cowboys' secondary is quite vulnerable without
him.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Williams wound up spending too much time at the right
corner in Deion's spot and was victimized by Moore and Frank
Sanders. And Kenny Wheaton was roaming around looking lost at times
in the Cowboys' nickel defense package.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-degree heat and the Cardinals' no-huddle offense in the
second half took their toll, and Plummer took considerable
liberties, scrambling, darting and making plays. He finished with
465 yards and three touchdowns on 31-of-56 passing and simply ran
out of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a great young quarterback,'' Campo said. ``Sure, we
did have some breakdowns. But that kid made plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's 57-yard heave to Moore on the final possession was
Montana-esque in its execution and would have tied the score except
that the beaten Wheaton recovered from a slip and got up to make a
saving leg tackle at the five-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer spiked the ball to stop the clock with nine seconds to
play. Sanders dropped a pass in the back of the end zone, and then
there was the final toss, the confusion, the ball hitting Smith,
the survival by the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   What should have been a cruise in the back seat of a limo with a
28-0 lead wound up being a roller-coaster ride on which keeping
their lunch down was considered a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I think that could happen?'' asked Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey. ``No, I didn't. In the end, it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this week. But maybe sometime.

NO GLORY IN BATTLE OF POOP ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Although he will live to regret the words, if he
hasn't already, Mike Price recently gave resonance, if not meaning,
to what shapes up Saturday as one of the more insignificant Apple
Cups in some time.
</P>
<P>
   You might have heard that the Cougar coach, in the depths of his
lamentations about a Washington State season gone to ashes,
recently identified himself as the ``King of Poop Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether his phrase is original _ a vast computer library sweep
did not turn up its like in literature, though we did not check
``South Park'' scripts _ it has captured the fancy of the week.
</P>
<P>
   With the 5-5 Huskies and 3-7 Cougars meeting in the storm-addled
Palouse, the point of winning Saturday is not so much to gain
something as it is to avoid humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies seek to avoid their first losing season since bushy
sideburns, while the Cougars seek to avoid becoming the first team
to go in a single season from Rose Bowl entrant to membership in
the Big Sky Conference.
</P>
<P>
   So to rally their troops, Price and his Husky counterpart, Jim
Lambright, now share the same battle cry:
</P>
<P>
   ``To your horses, men _ the Battle of Poop Island is upon us!''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it doesn't have the ring of say, ``Our swords shall run
with the blood of the infidels,'' or whatever it would have been
that Jim Walden would say at these moments.
</P>
<P>
   It works for this week, and you can bet that it will not be
stolen by another traditional-rival game.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the sentiment increases the ante a bit. If the Cougars
win, Price abdicates the title. As royal football succession has it
in this state, the loser of the game and current Prince of Poop
Island, Lambright, would ascend to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   The barbed hook in that designation is that it comes at the end
of the season, so it must be endured for a bleak winter. Not to
mention the recruiting season.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine going into the Compton neighborhood in Los Angeles,
where the mother of a prospective recruit says, ``You're the king
of what?!''
</P>
<P>
   So indeed, some serious football business will take place
Saturday, even if the rest of the college football nation cares
not. To the loser goes some imaginative real estate upon which the
emotional taxes are high.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies would prefer to look at Saturday another way. A
sixth seasonal win would give them the NCAA minimum requirement for
a bowl bid (remember, the NCAA and the various computer rankings do
not factor in pride, dignity or plain common sense in giving a 6-5
team a reward for mediocrity).
</P>
<P>
   This season, a 6-5 Pac-10 team, of which there appears to be
about 13, is eligible for games in Honolulu or Las Vegas, which
would seem to be a lovely parting gift for all those seniors who
were said to be going out on a bad note. On my departure from
college, I got stuck with the bill for the keg and the broken
dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the pending Husky reward, despite all their
frailties, vulnerabilities and shortcomings revealed in
Washington's worst season in 10 years. The portion exposed Saturday
during the 36-24 home loss to third-ranked UCLA was summarized well
by defensive back Nigel Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just overpowered us,'' said Burton, uttering a phrase
almost unimaginable a few years ago in connection with the Bruins,
traditionally as soft as their powder blues. Instead it is the
Huskies who are soft, from lines to linebackers to runners to
receivers to quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Husky coaches have often used the term ``war daddies'' to
describe the ferocious players and attitudes that populate national
championship teams, including the 1991 Husky group led by the
ultimate war daddy, Steve Emtman.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of players don't go 0-5 in November, which is the
cumulative UW record in the past two stretch drives. Lately, these
kinds of players attend UCLA, Oregon and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   If the Huskies are to regain their lost stature, they have to
recruit players of that ilk. Then it will matter less what kinds of
strategies or plays the coaches concoct; nor will it matter much
how many seniors play vs. how many redshirt freshmen play.
</P>
<P>
   For two years now, by scores of 52-28 and 36-24, the Bruins have
overpowered Washington. The last time the Bruins beat Washington
two straight, by a combined score of 71-31, was in 1987 and '88,
and coach Don James vowed to recruit bigger, faster and especially
tougher athletes.
</P>
<P>
   They came with consequences, and they also came with a national
championship. That is the standard dance with the devil in which
all big-time college football programs must engage. Otherwise, the
reward of 7-4 and 6-5 and Vegas must be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the future and the Apple Cup is now. Speaking of
now, it appears as good a moment as any to offer the season's Most
Valuable Player award to Barbara Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   If the UW athletic director had not acceded to Lambright's
demand to remove Miami (now 6-2 and ranked in the top 25) from the
1998 non-conference schedule that already included BYU and
Nebraska, and then replace the Hurricanes with patsy Utah State,
the Huskies would be a decent bet to be 4-6.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean that the battle for Poop Island would already
have been decided, leaving no angle whatsoever for the Apple Cup.

OFFENSIVE LINE HEARD THE CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA offensive coordinator Al Borges walked into
the cramped locker room at halftime, consulted with coach Bob
Toledo for a few minutes, then confronted the Bruins offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting it on you,'' Borges said. ``We're calling you
out and you need to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Kris Farris, the junior left tackle, had one thought: FINALLY.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been begging for that for the last year,'' Farris said.
``And we proved them right.''
</P>
<P>
   In its finest performance of the season, UCLA's offensive line
generated 206 rushing yards and flawlessly protected quarterback
Cade McNown against the nation's fiercest pass rush. Farris and
friends were so good the Bruins ran eight consecutive plays on the
most important possession, after Washington had closed to 26-17.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the game was different from their previous
visit to Husky Stadium, in 1996, when Washington squeezed UCLA's
ground game and overpowered the Bruins' defense in a 41-21 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never been so physically manhandled as I was in that game,''
Farris said. ``That was my main motivating factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Farris tried to rewrite history in Seattle, he'll
attempt to re-create it Saturday against USC. Once again the Bruins
will place their Fiesta Bowl fate in the care of the offensive
line, considered the best in the Pacific-10 and one of the best in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It is an interesting mix of mass. At 6-foot-9 and 310 pounds,
Farris is as talented as he is big. Center Shawn Stuart and right
guard Andy Meyers, the inseparable fifth-year seniors _ at least
until Stuart's offseason marriage _ form the line's heart and soul.
Right tackle Brian Polak and left guard Oscar Cabrera are
first-year starters, impressionable and impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Think these guys were important in Seattle? Wait until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA hasn't won seven consecutive games against USC because of
more talented players or luckier breaks or anything that needs
video replay to decipher. No, the Bruins have won seven straight
because their linemen _ Vaughn Parker, Jonathan Ogden, Chad
Overhasuer, all of them _ have dominated the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   In those seven games, USC has rushed for 813 yards while UCLA
has rushed for 1,300.
</P>
<P>
   Broken down by game, USC averages 116.1 rushing yards and UCLA
averages 185.7. The Bruins have run for 200 yards three times, USC
zero.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in the seven-game streak _ when time stopped and the
stars realigned and a UCLA walk-on named John Barnes threw for 385
yards _ have the Trojans outrushed UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Bruins won the ground game 191-144, and they won
the game 31-24.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Washington was a quiz. Final exams come Saturday
against the Pac-10's best defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have to set the tempo this week,'' Meyers said.
``SC's defense is phenomenal and we have our work cut out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Trojans. They're yielding 136 rushing yards per game _
fourth in the conference _ but they have not faced an offense as
balanced as UCLA's since their Florida State-Arizona State
doubleheader six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be just like last year against SC,'' Farris
said. ``If we can control the line, we'll win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   'Nuf said.
</P>
<P>

UW WOMEN BEAT IOWA IN OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jamie Redd said she wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   It apparently didn't faze her that the 24-point lead the
University of Washington women's basketball team built against Iowa
midway through the second half Sunday at Hec Edmundson Pavilion had
dwindled to seven with 2:56 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Redd wanted the ball.
</P>
<P>
   So the Huskies overloaded the left side of the court, giving the
right side to Redd, and the senior guard responded with a 10-foot
jumper for the eventual winning points in an 84-76 UW victory
before 1,963 fans.
</P>
<P>
   With Redd's 20 points and take-charge attitude and major
offensive contributions from fellow seniors Amber Hall (21 points)
and center Malinda Lynch (16), the Huskies overcame Cara
Consuegra's torrid second-half shooting to win their 21st
regular-season opener in 25 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Consuegra, scoreless in the first half, tallied 19 in the second
half to throw a scare into the Huskies, who didn't use the
30-second shot clock well during Iowa's comeback from a 67-43
deficit with 12:49 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this wasn't the first game, I would be concerned about
it,'' Husky coach June Daugherty said. ``We have put in a new
offense and defense and need more time to recognize that when we do
have a (comfortable) lead, we have to stay assertive and aggressive
but move the ball more and get better shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The up-tempo Huskies weren't able to downshift, while the
depleted Hawkeyes caught a second wind and closed to 76-69 with
fewer than three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   With two players injured and freshman forward Jerica Watson
suspended for one game, Hawkeyes coach Angie Lee started three
freshmen, a sophomore and a senior. Only one Iowa reserve played.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' game plan was to run their shorthanded visitors
from the Big Ten into the ground. But Iowa was able to rest during
breaks to shoot 38 free throws as Washington committed 29 fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches emerged from the opener with good vibes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final three minutes, we had to decide as a team if we
were going to play not to lose,'' Daugherty said. ``There were
times last year when we played not to lose and got real tentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sunday) we showed that we have confidence in each other and
got it done. That's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lee of her young (eight freshman) team, ``I can't tell you
how excited I am about this group. They could have folded early in
the second half, but they showed a lot of character by hanging in
there, clawing and digging their way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa held its own early in the game before showing signs of
getting blown out.
</P>
<P>
   Husky freshman guard Julia Gray hit a short shot to give
Washington a 32-30 lead at 4:48 and start an 18-6 run that put UW
in front 48-36 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The run continued after intermission as a 19-7 burst boosted
Washington's lead to 67-43.
</P>
<P>
   Consuegra scored 14 of her points during a six-minute stretch
that got Iowa back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is an exceptional guard,'' Daugherty said, ``one of the
best shooters in the Big Ten.''
</P>
<P>
   And Redd, beginning her final collegiate season ranked sixth on
the Huskies' all-time scoring list, is one of the premier scorers
in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Although 16 of her points came in the first half, the four she
scored late might have been the most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are afraid to take those shots,'' Daugherty
said. ``But not Jamie.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lee, ``I have always respected Jamie Redd's talent, and
when the game got close, what did she do? She clears out the side
and takes it on. She has done that to us before.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Herrig, the only returning starter from Iowa's
league-champion team, scored 14 points in the first half but only
three in the second.
</P>
<P>
   UW freshman forward Heather Reichmann played 13 minutes and drew
praise from her coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stats show she only got four rebounds,'' Daugherty said,
``but she got in there and put a body on Harrig and (forward
Beatrice) Bullock.''
</P>
<P>
   The UW reserves scored 22 points and had 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Another Husky bright spot was their turnover/assist ratio _ 12
turnovers and 23 assists.

 MacCULLOCH HAS HUSKIES THINKING BIG  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The schedule, scoreboard and uniforms say Washington
Huskies. But the players who open their college basketball season
against North Carolina Wilmington Monday night at Hec Edmundson
Pavilion carry another banner, too.
</P>
<P>
   They are Todd's team.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have fallen in line behind Todd MacCulloch, placing
their considerable hopes _ Pac-10 title contention and continued
NCAA tourney success _ squarely on the pasty shoulders of the
7-foot, 280-pound Canadian center.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Mark Sanford's play dictated UW success. Last
season, Donald Watts was the closer. MacCulloch is the answer man
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say it's his team,'' 6-6 forward Thalo Green said of
the Husky big man. ``If he's producing like (he has), the ball
should be in his hands more than any other player.''
</P>
<P>
   Said 6-8 forward Chris Wolcott: ``Our offense is built around
him. He's the go-to guy in any situation.''
</P>
<P>
   On a UW team ranked from seventh to 18th nationally in preseason
polls, there are two sets of experienced forwards, two able point
guards and a Watts clone in Deon Luton. MacCulloch is the only
piece that isn't interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   The UW center wasn't bad before. He led the nation in field-goal
percentage (65 and 67.6 percent) the past two seasons. He topped
the Huskies in scoring (18.6 ppg) last season. But entering his
senior year, he says his game is superior to what it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably 20 percent better,'' MacCulloch said. ``I think
I'm a better shooter outside of 10 feet. I'm trying to shoot the
jumper farther out, not just take the layup or jump hook. If they
respect my shot, maybe I'll go around them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for becoming the team barometer, the Winnipeg native is
circumspect: ``It that's what people think, it makes me proud. If
we have a good year, I'll probably get a lot of the credit. If we
have a bad year, it will be the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch, however, has big plans for this Husky team. Most
preseason polls peg the Huskies as the league runner-up to
Stanford. The center says the ultimate is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm most excited about is if we get the most out of the
players and they do what they're capable of doing, we can win the
Pac-10 championship,'' he said. ``You always say that, but this
year it's more of a reality than it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates note his added confidence. Coaches applaud his
decreased body fat. MacCulloch never stopped playing, joining the
Canadian national team once the Huskies were ousted in the NCAA's
Sweet 16 by Connecticut and a buzzer-beating shot. He ran endless
stairs to keep himself in shape. He toured New Zealand, Australia,
France and Greece. He became more worldly.
</P>
<P>
   In practice and exhibition games, UW teammates have been
pleasantly surprised by the new and improved MacCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running harder, he's stronger than ever and he's shooting
better, if that's possible,'' Watts said. ``He took things
seriously in the offseason, and you can tell. It's obvious he's
thinking about being the best he can be and taken responsibility
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Green: ``He's definitely more aggressive. He goes to the
hoop more. He dunks more. Last year, he would turn and fade away
with his shot. Now he takes the contact and goes to the rim more.''
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch has been picked to eight preseason All-America lists,
earning a repeat selection to the Playboy magazine team. He says
several relatives across the continent bought last year's issue,
and own only that one Playboy. One modest uncle keeps the adult
magazine in a brown paper bag and will turn only to the basketball
article upon request.
</P>
<P>
   The center's steady progress at Washington is best measured by
Stanford's 7-1 Tim Young. The two players came into the league
together, with Young initially regarded as the more physically
mature player. MacCulloch now is viewed on equal footing, if not
higher, according to preseason honor-team selections.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch bemoans the loss of 7-1 Patrick Femerling, who passed
up his final UW season to turn pro in his native Germany. They were
roommates and close friends, as well as teammates. Others saw
Femerling's departure as a resolution to possible playing-time
conflicts. Not MacCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sad to see him go,'' he said. ``It hurts our team. We'd
be deeper at the center position if he was still around. But he had
a big decision to make ... and we have to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   With his friend playing for pay and his own Husky career winding
down, MacCulloch says he has allowed himself to briefly ponder the
NBA. A dream come true would be to play for one of the two Canadian
teams, the Vancouver Grizzlies or Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch, who once scored 76 points in a high school game,
made Washington his college choice over Notre Dame, Nebraska and
Utah, drawn mostly to Seattle because of his affection for Husky
coach Bob Bender. Still, the center was a project, unable to lift
weights or meet running standards upon his campus arrival. Husky
followers feared another Flosi Sigurdsson or Uwe Sledz, imported
centers who had undistinguished UW careers, had joined the program.
</P>
<P>
   Bender had faith MacCulloch would be a contributor, but says any
thoughts his big center might be able to play 30 minutes per game
some day were far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, he's improved,'' Bender said. ``I think he really
sees how all the hard work is going to pay off and how he can lead
us to great heights.''
</P>
<P>
   With his soft touch and nimble feet, MacCulloch has given the
Huskies a true center, a fan-pleasing throwback to the days of Bob
Houbregs and Bruno Boin. He also has borrowed from more modern-day
UW players, working out occasionally with James Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   A 19-year NBA player with three championship rings, Edwards used
humility to prolong his career well past the norm. MacCulloch could
take a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``James is a great role model for Todd, with the way James'
career went,'' Bender said. ``Understand who you are, and you'll
have great success. How many rings did James have and how long did
he play? He realized who he was. Some people want to be somebody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the Huskies. Happily, they are Todd's team.

KILLER INSTINCT A NO-SHOW FOR DYSFUNCTIONAL HAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ If this wasn't the week for the Seahawks to
finally demonstrate some shred of killer instinct, then the
question is: When?
</P>
<P>
   Was it supposed to be next week against the resurgent Cowboys,
who are pulling off the impossible by making Michael Irvin, Emmitt
Smith, Troy Aikman and Jerry Jones a sentimental NFL story?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but these Seahawks aren't rolling into ``Big D'' with
anything more than a mountain of insecurity and a laundry list of
questions, some of which cannot be answered, not after Sunday's
20-17 brain lock against the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Allen paid how much? For whom, for what?
</P>
<P>
   Was the Hawks' killer instinct supposed to emerge in two weeks
against the Oilers who, with destroyer running back Eddie George
and quarterback Steve McNair, have their Tennessee cross hairs
trained on a playoff berth?
</P>
<P>
   Or was that Seahawk killer instinct supposed to come Dec. 6
against the Jets, that dangerous Gang Green group run by that
smart-mouthed coach nicknamed ``The Tuna,'' who seem to take
special delight in making Chicken of the Sea out of Dennis Erickson
and the Hawks?
</P>
<P>
   It is already too late. It is OT for the 5-5 Seahawks, who are
batting their usual .500, which is absolutely not good enough.
Everybody knows it, especially the owner, who no doubt will review
the videotapes so he can weed out all the broken or dysfunctional
parts of this high-priced team that is going, once again, nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   How many third downs did Warren Moon and the Hawk offense
convert into firsts? None. That's 0-for-13. That's ridiculous, just
as the offense's mere 17 touchdowns in 10 games is ridiculous. But
that 0-for-13 all but tells the story of why this stagnant offense
cannot put away a game _ even one kick-started by Joey Galloway
with a first-quarter, 56-yard punt return for touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if Ronnie Harris was fired after fumbling away a
punt that lost the game to the Raiders two weeks ago at the
Kingdome, what happens to cornerback Fred Thomas?
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably cost us the game,'' said Thomas, who made the
egregious mistake of trying to take Raider QB Donald Hollas' head
off after he had thrown the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But no. With 38 seconds left, the game tied at 17 and the
Raiders on the 50, Thomas' 15-yard roughing penalty put the Raiders
on the Seahawk 35-yard line. On the next play, Hollas hooked up
with receiver Tim Brown for a 15-yard completion, which set up the
Raiders' game-winning, 38-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, good-guy Harris was in Atlanta this weekend, returning
punts for the 8-2 (dare we say Super Bowl-bound?) Falcons, so maybe
getting cut from the Hawks isn't so bad, but still ...
</P>
<P>
   If Allen thought he could just open his wallet and field a
contender two years into his brave, new and deep-pocket ownership,
reality has hit with a deafening finality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no slack in the rope whatsoever,'' veteran linebacker
Michael Sinclair said after Sunday's cold slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like putting yourself behind the eight ball,''
said tight end Christian Fauria. ``Now we have to win all of our
games and wish for a bunch of other things to happen for us to have
a chance of making the playoffs. Talk about doing something
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Stupid? We haven't even gone there yet. Now we will. Their 14
penalties cost them so much ground (141 yards), the Hawks were
halfway back to Seattle before the ecstatic Silver-and-Black fans
were hurling what little beer remained in their mugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Raider faithful were in their glory here. For them, this was
a November football game that will go a long way toward propelling
the Raiders into the playoffs for the first time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the out-of-contention-since-1986 Seahawks are looking
at a December full of doubt and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' said lineman Pete Kendall, ``We don't go into the
tank.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tank might not be such a bad place for these fellas, so
many of whom have coughed up mistakes and miscues that no amount of
chastising by Chad Brown seems able to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   If Thomas had not committed that critical penalty, the game
probably would have gone to overtime. Maybe there, the Hawks would
have pulled out the win. Maybe this column would have been entirely
different, with no thought as to which possible new head coaches
Allen and Seahawk president Bob Whitsitt will call this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? Before Thomas brain-locked, the Seahawks
already were showing signs that they still are a sputtering,
pressing, unconfident, lack-of-killer-instinct team.
</P>
<P>
   That includes Moon, who has been unable to put this should-be
playoff contender on any sort of roll, sore ribs or no sore ribs.
</P>
<P>
   And that includes Ricky Watters, whose footing was so bad on the
perfectly dry Oakland Coliseum grass that the new REI store in
Redmond should send him a pair of crampons.
</P>
<P>
   And veterans Brian Habib and Howard Ballard were starring in an
offensive line so jumpy, you'd think they were auditioning for
``Riverdance,'' not an AFC playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   It's overtime for the Hawks now. And every good NFL team with
playoff aspirations knows it's way too early for that.

UW ADMINISTRATION BACKS LAMBRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jim Lambright is the first Washington football coach
in 22 years to enter an Apple Cup without a winning record. He is
also a coach confident of support from the right people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good, five-year contract,'' Lambright said Sunday
night as the UW had its first practice for Saturday's game at
Washington State. ``All the people that count are on my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambright gets considerable criticism from fans on call-in radio
shows, which hardly makes him unique among coaches. There is also a
segment of UW donors displeased with a 5-5 record, endangering
Washington's 21-year streak of winning seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Lambright is 43-24-1 in his six seasons at Washington, and
Sunday, two of his most influential bosses expressed support for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everybody else, I wish we'd won more games,'' said UW
president Richard McCormick. ``But I do believe we're on the right
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had received feedback on Lambright, McCormick said,
``Essentially nothing. A little blurb of gossip here or there, but
essentially nothing. I haven't gotten E-mail about it, I haven't
gotten letters about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence in (athletic director) Barbara
Hedges as well as in Jim Lambright and the intercollegiate athletic
program. I don't micro-manage them any more than the English
department, and I'm not going to start now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedges, who has been reluctant recently to address the issue,
said Sunday night, ``Speculation is just speculation. That's all it
is. Jim was the football coach last week, he will be next week, and
he will be for a long time. Nothing has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, Lambright worked on a four-year rollover contract
renewed annually early in the year. Through '97, a delay ensued in
activating the rollover as Lambright sought to be paid on a level
with Pac-10 coaches like Arizona State's Bruce Snyder and
Stanford's Tyrone Willingham.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Washington awarded him a new deal with an annual
package of $566,333, including a base salary of $176,000.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Huskies have been closer knit than last year's team,
but have recorded their worst record under Lambright. Ten '97
players were drafted by the NFL, leaving a young team depleted by
Pac-10 sanctions and some recruiting mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the tolerance level of fans hasn't always been high,
especially those who compare Lambright to predecessor Don James in
his last years at Washington. Crowds at Husky Stadium have been
slightly smaller this year, many fans leave earlier and some boo
play-calling or kicking-game problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that wants to call Barbara's office can call and get
an endorsement,'' Lambright said. ``That's all talk by people who
don't even necessarily buy a ticket to the game. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real good about a young team, my support in the job,
and we've got a great jump in recruiting right now. I think we'll
have one of the best recruiting classes we've had in a long time. I
have not one worry about my support from the important people.''

AT&AMP;T SPIN-OFF LUCENT TECHNOLOGY RIDES INTO HEART OF
SILICON  VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - NY TIMES   &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paranoia seems an odd trait for Lucent Technologies _ a $30
billion company with an AT&AMP;T pedigree, a market value of $109
billion and the adoration of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucent knows it faces a herd of up-and-coming competitors
and must stay vigilant to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping tabs from its headquarters in New Jersey is hard,
however, because most of Lucent's potential competitors are here in
the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   So the nation's largest telecommunications equipment company,
eager to protect its valuable market share, is setting up shop in
its competitors' own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey company has spent the past year beefing up its
presence in Silicon Valley _ building new facilities, acquiring
local companies, setting up research labs and aligning with local
universities like Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent is preparing to go head-to-head with local hotshots like
Cisco Systems, Ascend Communications and 3Com Corp. for a share of
a multibillion-dollar industry that will transform the way people
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   It's developing new products and technologies such as wireless
telephone systems at its facilities in the Bay Area and soon will
open a Lucent Venture Fund office in Menlo Park to finance startup
tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company now employs more than 3,000 people in the Bay Area
and plans to add several hundred more during the next few years.
That's still a small number when compared with Cisco's 16,000
employees and 3Com's 13,500 employees, but it's more than Ascend's
1,820, and it's enough to show those companies that Lucent means
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very conscious of what Lucent is doing out here,'' said
an executive from one of the area's largest companies.
</P>
<P>
   What Lucent is trying to do is compete in the data networking
business, a relatively new task for the company. Lucent and others
are working to create products that seamlessly integrate voice,
video and data networks.
</P>
<P>
   Data networking products will give companies enhanced services,
such as universal messaging, plus the ability to control all phone
calls, Internet access and video-conferencing from a single
network.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy for developing the products out here, says Lucent
CEO Richard McGinn, is to siphon off some of the creativity, energy
and brain power that's made Silicon Valley the premier place for
innovation. Harnessing what McGinn calls the ``intellectual
horsepower'' of the Valley will help Lucent compete in the brave
new world of telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture of the Valley fits in very well with what we want
to do,'' McGinn said. He cited the area's educated workforce, rich
talent pool and impressive universities as reasons for having a
presence here.
</P>
<P>
   Synergy aside, industry watchers say Lucent needs to be in the
Valley because that's where most of the breakthrough technology is
happening and where customers expect their suppliers to be located.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest issues for Lucent near-term is the ability
to become a stronger player in data networking,'' said Gregory S.
Geiling, who follows Lucent at J.P. Morgan Securities in New York.
``With the West Coast being such a hotbed of data networking, in
order to be in the flow of information and to have the
relationships with companies and customers, Lucent needs to be out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in Silicon Valley also will allow the company to keep
close tabs on its competitors. Lucent has had explosive growth
since it was spun off from AT&AMP;T Corp. two years ago and is
desperate to sustain that pace.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Revenue has soared from $23.3 billion in 1996 to $30 billion
in 1998. The company's market value is $109 billion, and its stock
has defied the recent market downturn. Shares are up more than 90
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has been so successful because its products run
everything from traditional phone systems to wireless phones to the
Internet. The company is the largest U.S. provider of telecom
equipment, and its customer list reads like a who's who of the
technology and telecom industries _ SBC Communications Corp., Intel
Corp., AT&AMP;T, AirTouch, Apple, Sun Microsystems all use Lucent
products.
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing, and the products that Lucent primarily
focused on _ equipment for circuit-switched telephone systems _ are
going the way of the record player. Lucent says it is committed to
being at the forefront of this new market but faces challenges from
other companies that have been focused on data networking for much
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's core business, providing equipment to telephone
companies, is a slow-moving one that hasn't changed much in several
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Data networking, on the other hand, moves on Internet time, and
companies that want to survive need to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, competitors question whether Lucent can compete in
the fast-moving world of data networking, which spits out products
at a significantly quicker pace than the company is accustomed.
Companies like Cisco refer to Lucent as an ``old world company.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers also wonder whether Lucent, which now has
130,000 employees worldwide, will be able to keep up with the
industry's lightning-fast pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big challenge is transitioning to this data networking
base successfully. Product development cycles are a lot quicker,
competition is fierce, and focus on technology is very important.
As they transition to data, they have to be quicker,'' Geiling
said.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials admit that Lucent needs to move at a rapid
clip, but they shake off the notion that it's too mired in its ways
to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge is to continue to execute with speed,'' said
Carly Fiorina, president of Lucent's Global Service Provider
business, the company's largest division. ``We're limited only by
our own movement.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep up momentum and stay ahead of competitors, Lucent has
acquired several Bay Area companies with a large presence in
markets the company wants to compete in.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucent wants to do more than just absorb other companies'
technology. McGinn has committed $4.5 billion to research and
development this year, and much of that money will make its way out
here.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lucent quietly opened a division in Milpitas that
was charged with finding ways to deliver more bandwidth to
customers. Nine months later, the division is preparing to ship
wireless antennas that enable customers to make calls, access the
Internet and do video-conferencing using microwave transmissions.
The antenna _ one of the company's most anticipated products _ is
headed to local phone companies, Internet service providers and
anyone else who needs a lot of bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   The product also is unique in that it was conceived, designed,
built, tested and marketed at the building in Milpitas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to integrate all things together, to take research
and development and sales and fuse it into one team and one
environment,'' said Larry Schwerin, general manager of the wireless
broadband division. While demand for bandwidth is the current rage,
Lucent also wants to develop products that customers don't even
know they want.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which announced more than 30 products this year, is
building a research lab facility in Menlo Park to develop new
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The 43,000-square-foot building, which will be housed in the
Stanford Research Park, is expected to open next summer with about
125 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The division will focus on developing sophisticated products
that use the Internet to transmit data but are of better quality
and more reliable than what's already available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to go after things where you can't forecast the
market because it's so new,'' said Ronald Schmidt, who will co-lead
the research lab along with William Coughran Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Lucent's timing could not be better. By moving into
the Bay Area, the company is closing a geographic gap and
positioning itself to compete vigorously in the data networking
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent is one of the largest telecom vendors; they have the
advantage of size; they have good stock currency and are in a great
position if they need to do acquisitions,'' said Geiling.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Sirlin, an analyst with Shroder &AMP; Co. in New York, is a
bit more blunt about Lucent's future. ``They are going to give
Cisco and Nortel a run for their money,'' he said. Lucent ``doesn't
have a choice. Lucent will either be successful in data networking
or they won't be successful. Period.''

LUCENT SET TO GO ON BUYING BINGE  &HT;     BY DEBORAH SOLOMON
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - LUCENT SIDEBAR   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies has been doing more than just gobbling up
space and talented engineers in Silicon Valley. It's also been
buying local companies with expertise in the markets in which
Lucent wants to compete _ and it's poised to go on an even bigger
buying spree.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lucent bought Livingston, a data networking company
in Pleasanton that makes products that connect computer users to
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition helped fill a hole in Lucent's business
portfolio and gave it access to an even broader customer base.
</P>
<P>
   Three months earlier, Lucent bought Octel Communications Corp.
of Milpitas, a leader in voice mail and messaging. That acquisition
gave Lucent access to large corporate accounts, such as Bell
Canada, Hewlett-Packard and Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   But those purchases may pale in comparison with what industry
watchers expect Lucent to do in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   There is much speculation that the company soon will make
another big acquisition in the data networking or wireless
business, now that it will no longer be penalized for certain
stock-swap takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Under accounting rules, spin-offs are barred for two years from
``pooling of interest'' transactions. It forces companies to &LR;  take
charges against earnings and sticks them with a big tax &LR;  bill. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Large deals have been out of reach for Lucent because they
would have been too expensive, but on October 1, Lucent turned 2
years old and the shackles came off.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area companies such as Ascend and 3Com have been mentioned
as potential takeover targets for Lucent, as have foreign telecom
companies such as Siemens, Alcatel and Nokia. For now, however, the
company is keeping mum on which companies it might be courting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have acquired 10 companies in the past 30 months, and we're
going to continue to acquire firms to add technology, distribution
and new customer groups, in addition to wonderfully talented
people,'' said Lucent CEO Richard McGinn. ``We don't have an
acquisition strategy. We have a business strategy to invest in the
fastest-growing areas, such as hardware and data networking.''
</P>
<P>
   Data networking, with a growth rate of 25 percent a year, is
probably the most obvious target for Lucent acquisitions. Lucent
also would do well to buy businesses with expertise in Internet
protocol routing technology and asynchronous transfer mode. Both
those technologies provide the plumbing for routing telephone calls
and data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent's been rumored to buy almost everybody that's out
here,'' said Gregory Geiling, who follows Lucent for J.P. Morgan
Securities in New York. ``My gut reaction is that any immediate
acquisition would focus on data networking. Lucent is one of the
largest telecom vendors, and they have the advantage of size, they
have good stock currency and are in a great position to do
acquisitions.''

 CHRON - THE NET FILES   A Web of Conspiracy Theories 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has all the makings of an Oliver Stone movie.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of unlikely events during the past few weeks that
have conspiracy theorists frothing, a controversial plan to
privatize the Internet domain-naming business takes effect, a key
architect of the plan dies, a congressman launches an inquiry into
the plan, and another key figure behind the scheme mysteriously
resigns (maybe).
</P>
<P>
   The latest wrinkle came last weekend, when a staffer for Ira
Magaziner, President Clinton's Internet czar, said Magaziner will
resign this year to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   The normally loquacious Magaziner isn't commenting on his
reported departure. Although he routinely uses the speed-dial
button on his phone to answer interview requests, he has been
virtually unreachable by phone and e-mail the past few days. There
has been no formal statement about his apparent resignation.
</P>
<P>
   According to a staffer in his office, Magaziner is in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The public-policy wonk, who also authored the &UR;  &LR; Clinton
administration's ill-fated health care plan, was a leading figure
in a controversial plan to transfer Web domain-naming rights from
the federal government to a global, nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Network Solutions, a Virginia company working
under a federal contract, would lose its exclusive right to sell
Web addresses ending in .com, .org, .net, .gov and .edu. Instead, a
worldwide nonprofit group named the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers would decide who could sell domain names
as well as new ones. Network Solutions could continue to sell them,
but so could other firms.
</P>
<P>
   Although the transfer officially took effect October 1, nothing
has really changed. ICANN has said it needs six months to get fully
staffed and running.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Network Solutions continues to control the
multimillion-dollar domain-naming business _ a crucial element in
the fledgling e-commerce field.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Magaziner resign?
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of theories.
</P>
<P>
   One is that Magaziner quit in frustration because the transition
didn't go as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that Magaziner never wanted the transfer to take
place _ that he was acting on behalf of the government, which
wanted to maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another is that Magaziner was ousted because the plan got
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he just wanted to spend more time with his family.
There had been whispers for months that Magaziner was on his way
out.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding the conspiracy theorists is the October 16 death of Jon
Postel, 55, the reclusive technical wizard nicknamed the ``guardian
of the Internet's infrastructure.'' Postel died from complications
following heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, which
maintains a vast database of all domain names, Postel was another
key figure in the domain-name transition plan.
</P>
<P>
   The same day Postel died, House Commerce Committee Chairman
Thomas Bliley, R-Va., opened an inquiry into the domain-name
transfer. He was responding to complaints that the process was
drafted behind closed doors with minimal public input.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``I am concerned about the manner in which the process of
privatizing the governance of (domain names) has apparently
unraveled,'' &UR;  &LR; Bliley wrote in letters to Magaziner and Secretary of
Commerce William Daley. ``A loss of credibility in the Internet
community at large will seriously undermine the ability of (ICANN)
and the stability of the Internet itself.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Others claim that the process was akin to the movie ``Star
Chamber.'' Issues quietly were discussed among a group of
unidentified people, who posted their conclusions online. ``It was
like a military operation,'' said Naseem Javed, president of ABC
Namebank International Inc., a brand-name consulting firm in
Ontario, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domain names are the single most important element of
e-commerce, so how come the Clinton administration did such a poor
job of handling this issue?'' Javed said. ``The process was a
laid-back, hush-hush affair that maintained a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   What really hasn't changed is the role of Network Solutions, a
publicly held company in Herndon, Va., with a market value of $1
billion. Network Solutions is busy expanding into Japan and Germany
_ the next-most-important markets for e-commerce after the United
States.
</P>

   Network Solutions officials say they support Magaziner's
transition plan. They say competition will fuel growth in the
domain-naming business and that it will benefit everyone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they predict that 100 million domain names will be
registered by 2000. Currently, more than 4 million domain names are
registered, and NSI has registered about 3 million of them. It
currently costs $70 to register a domain name for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, any number of companies will have the right to dole
out names.
</P>
<P>
   Until then ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a damn thing has changed,'' said an angry Eric Gullichsen,
director of Tonic Domain Name Registry. Tonic sells domain names
ending in .to, which is short for Tonga, a country that registers
domain names. ``The transition plan was a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest focus on Magaziner's handling of the transition plan
overshadows his many good works.

   The longtime White House adviser is credited with alerting the
Clinton administration to the economic importance of the Internet
and setting an e-commerce policy into motion. He also encouraged
the Clinton administration to rethink its strict limits on the
export of encrypted software.

   ``Ira heightened awareness of the Net in the Beltway. Without
him, I doubt we would have a law banning new Internet taxes, and a
general hands-off attitude,'' said Erik Olbeter, director of
telecom policy at the Economic Strategy Institute, a think tank in
Washington, D.C. ``He has set the framework for continued strong
growth of the Internet.''

Magazine Online ( &LR; www.wholepop.com &LR; ). Based on a published book,
this free Web zine is comprised of ``indispensable trivia,
worthless thingamajigs, weird side-trips and preposterous graphics

DIGITAL BAY/TOM ABATE  
 COMPUTER INDUSTRY STANDARD DOUBLE-TALK NOT TO BE TRUSTED
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - DIGITAL BAY   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer industry kicked off a week of hype last night &UR;  &LR; in
Las Vegas, but as we listen to the keynote speeches from Comdex, we
have to ask: Can we believe these guys?
</P>
<P>
   If the testimony at the Microsoft antitrust trial in Washington
has proven anything, it's that high-tech execs routinely get up on
stage and feed us bull.
</P>
<P>
   At the Macworld Expo in Boston a year ago, Apple Interim CEO
Steve Jobs put a happy face on his alliance with Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates. But under oath at the Microsoft trial, Apple execs say
they were bullied into smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe people are cynical enough to tune out the words and just
enjoy the multimedia slide shows that usually accompany the
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is that top execs aren't the only ones who
flip-flop. Just last week, Guy Kawasaki made industry observers
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki used to be Apple's evangelist. He made a career out of
rallying Mac loyalists and railing against Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kawasaki, who runs a business-resource Web site called
Garage.Com, has joined an advisory board to help Microsoft recruit
software developers. He'll be joined by former Apple exec Heidi
Roizen.
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki shilling for the Evil Empire makes me wonder what's
next. Maybe Newt Gingrich will find the hidden virtues in Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HONESTY THE BEST POLICY?_ Sometimes concealment isn't the best
executive strategy. Richard Gilbert, CEO of Copper Mountain, is
up-front about his desire to grow his DSL company by selling it to
any of a half-dozen network-hardware vendors.
</P>
<P>
   DSL is a technology for sending high-speed data and voice
traffic over ordinary phone lines. DSL startups have had a hard
time competing with Pacific Bell, which owns those copper lines.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert seems to think it takes a networking giant to fight a
giant network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to merge with somebody with routers and switches,'' he
told my colleague Deborah Solomon. ``There are six or seven
companies that would be logical for us to merge with,'' he said,
naming Cisco Systems, Lucent Technologies, Northern Telecom, Ascend
Communications, Siemens, Alcatel and Ericsson.
</P>
<P>
   Copper Mountain has invited some of these prospects in for a
look-see, but if Gilbert can't make a merger deal, he said he may
take the company public in 1999 _ providing Wall Street is in the
mood for 3-year-old startups that have some revenues, if not
profits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SMART REGION_San Francisco will host a conference on December
10-11, where 400 government and business leaders will consider ways
to spur the creation of broadband networks in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband networks are high-speed ``pipelines'' for getting
electronic data to businesses, schools and homes. The conference,
being organized by the Bay Area Council, is supposed to get civic
and commercial leaders talking about how they might stitch together
the existing fiber optic and coaxial cables _ owned by companies,
utilities and others _ into a single high-speed network ringing the
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think that such broadband networks will be the
catalyst for electronic commerce in the next century, just as
canals, railroads and highways were the arteries of commerce in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many companies and municipalities digging up the
streets and laying cable, there ought to be some way to work
together,'' said John Eger, a San Diego telecommunications expert
and keynote speaker at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's easier said than done when you think about
asking Pacific Gas and Electric to collaborate with CalTrans, or
TCI to share with Pacific Bell, much less getting San Francisco and
Oakland on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Eger: ``If we don't walk away from the conference with
a working plan than we've failed.''

PUTTING A STOP TO SPAM  &HT;     BY BENNY EVANGELISTA
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - SPAM   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a little more than a decade, Sunil Paul has been a space
station designer, a government policy wonk and a guru of the
once-hot ``push'' technology.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he hopes to become known as the ``spammer jammer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail has been abused and turned into a medium for
spamming,'' said Paul, whose latest startup, Bright Light
Technologies Inc. of San Francisco, is developing programs to fight
unsolicited commercial e-mail, popularly known as spam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most offensive and most obvious way that your
privacy has been violated on the Net,'' said Paul, 33, who is known
for his previous startup, FreeLoader Inc., and for being America
Online's first Internet-products director.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Light, which is on track to market spam-fighting programs
by the end of the year, is a year-old startup that employs tactics
similar to those used by antivirus software-makers. It compiles
lists of known spammers, so they can be blocked by the Internet
service providers before they get to the intended victim.
</P>
<P>
   In a South of Market building, Bright Light has created spam
central, cataloging tens of thousands of known spam e-mail
addresses. The company has set up tens of thousands of e-mail
accounts as ``bait'' for the spammers who send annoying messages
about pornographic sites or get-rich-quick schemes. The e-mail
accounts ``harvest'' addresses of spammers, so Bright Light's
technology can block them.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said he hopes to have hundreds of thousands of spammer
addresses in the databank by the end of the year. The intelligence
center is what Paul calls his ``secret sauce'' for Bright Light's
main product, Spam Wall, designed for Internet service providers
and corporations to use to block spam.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Light already has signed up two major service providers,
Concentric Network and USA.NET, as customers and is working with
AT&AMP;T WorldNet Service and EarthLink Network to help develop the
product.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Plaskon, product management director for the 1.2-million
member AT&AMP;T WorldNet Service, said his company is interested in
Bright Light because its ``very unique product'' seems like a
potentially forceful weapon in the war against spam. AT&AMP;T intends
to use Spam Wall, depending on the results of continuing tests, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working on minimizing spam for two years, and it
seems like it's guerrilla warfare,'' Plaskon said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul got the idea for Bright Light last summer when both he and
his wife, Michelle Odom, were getting spammed at their America
Online addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it was very infuriating,'' Paul said during a
recent interview. ``Somebody out there has figured out who I am and
has sent me stuff that there's no way on Earth I'd be interested
in, and there's nothing I can do about it. If I send them a loud,
obnoxious letter, they love it. It's like, `Great, we know you're
really alive; we'll send you some more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, he said, his wife asked him, ``Can't you do something
about this?''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting spam became another test of his lifelong abilities to
come up with ideas that go against the norm. Even as a teen growing
up in the country music capital of the world, Nashville, Tenn., the
native of India preferred listening to rock.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1987 from Vanderbilt University with a
bachelor's in electrical engineering, Paul hooked on with NASA as a
contractor helping to design the space station. But he said he
became frustrated that ``we would spend a year designing some facet
of the space station and Congress would come along and redesign
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So he joined the Office of Technology Assessment, a
congressional advisory think tank, because ``I wanted a role in
making sure our public policy was guided by informed decision
making rather than politics. Just at that time, ``the Internet
started receiving attention, mainly by policy wonks and engineers,
and I happened to be both,'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   He left the OTA in early 1994 to become the first Internet
product manager at AOL, which then had only 300,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one of the first meetings I had about future planning, I
said someday we're going to have to figure out how to get a Web
browser, and everybody's like, `Oh, how are you going to get a Web
browser on 9600 baud, there's no way we're going to have a Web
browser,''' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he left in late 1995, the online service had a
browser, a Web site and 3 million customers
</P>
<P>
   Paul and colleague Marcus Pincus left AOL _ and about $1 million
in unvested stock options _ to co-found FreeLoader Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Their original idea was to develop a Web browser that would
automatically retrieve information from the Web, ``pushing'' to the
desktop instead of requiring the computer user to spend time
``pulling'' it from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   FreeLoader and chief rival PointCast Inc. of Sunnyvale made
``push technology'' the hottest buzz phrase of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Pincus and Paul used the buzz to quickly raise $3.1 million in
investments, generate publicity in publications such as the Wall
Street Journal and become courted by the likes of Yahoo Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight months after starting the company, without having
made a dime &UR;  &LR; in profits, they sold FreeLoader for a cool $38
million to Individual Inc., a news-retrieval service.
</P>
<P>
   The deal seemed a good idea at the time, especially because
rival PointCast had the lead in both product development and
financing. But Individual ended up folding FreeLoader eight months
later after a corporate shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's own profit from the sale has plummetted with Individual's
stock. The stock options he got in the deal are probably worth
about $3 million to $4 million now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Paul believes that FreeLoader and push technology
failed for the same reason that his latest venture is drawing
attention _ advertisers turned it into a way to shove their
products in front of computer users' faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Push got spammed to death, and the users lost control,'' Paul
said. ``The real reason push never took off is that it didn't
address the needs of real users and instead fell victim to the
needs of advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unchecked, spam could ``snuff the magic out of the
Internet,'' he said. Already, an estimated 10 billion pieces of
spam shoot through the Internet each year, according to industry
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have never visited a porn site in their lives get
porn spam,'' Paul said. ``A spammer doesn't care whether you're a
kid, whether you're a man or a woman, whether you're black or
white. All that matters is that the cost of sending spam is almost
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright Light may have a good idea, but one analyst who has
followed the electronic messaging industry for 15 years said the
company has to prove it has a product that appeals to a broader
market than just Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations already are using some form of e-mail filtering
technology that weeds out spam, said Phil Schacter, a senior
analyst with the Burton Group, a research group based in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they do something to start interesting enterprise
customers, they're looking at a fairly limited market,'' Schacter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, though, remains confident about the market and has rounded
up $5.5 million in investment funding from influential Silicon
Valley venture capitalists like Bud Colligan of &UR;  &LR; Accel Partners and
Esther Dyson of EDventure Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bright Light is concentrating on spam, Paul said he
sees future business possibilities in other forms of e-mail
monitoring and management for companies.
</P>
<P>
   And if not, Paul said he's always coming up with new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day in the shower, there's at least one or two new
ideas,'' he said. ``The hard part is turning those ideas into
something that can be real.''

 CHRON - EPIGRAM  
 EPIGRAM TO MAKE HOME-NETWORKING AFFORDABLE, EASY  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's Comdex trade show will no doubt feature enough
gee-whiz gadgets and high-tech products to satisfy any geek's
heart, but a local company plans to unveil a technology that even
the most technophobic person can understand, afford and put to use.
</P>
<P>
   Epigram Inc., a Sunnyvale startup, will demonstrate the
home-networking technology it's been developing for the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The product, a silicon chip set, will enable homeowners and
small businesses to link computers together using existing phone
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Once the computers are all talking to one another, they can
share devices such as modems and printers. The technology will
allow users to talk on the phone at the same time they're surfing
the Web, and the connection will be super fast _ 10 megabits per
second, about 200 times faster than a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   Although many companies are developing home-networking products,
industry analysts say Epigram's technology is easier to install and
more affordable than some of what's currently available.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the products on the market require that customers rewire
their homes or businesses in order to create a shared network. It's
a time-consuming project that can cost anywhere from $2,000 to
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Epigram, which will sell the technology to network-card
manufacturers like 3Com Corp. and Texas Instruments, says the
product probably will retail for about $100. Customers will buy a
networking card at a retail store, snap it into a port on the
computer and connect a traditional phone wire between the computer
and existing wall jack. &UR;  &LR; Jeffrey Thermond, president and CEO of
Epigram, said the products will be available in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Once the computers are networked, they can share information and
be connected to the television, stereo or any appliance the user
wants to control from the PC. The ultimate couch potato can even
set up the network to change TV channels with the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very cool on a real practical level,'' said Thermond.
``In homes, many times there are multiple people who want to use
the Internet but you can only have one person using the modem at a
time. This product changes that, and everyone can use the same
modem at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Epigram is not alone in this new world of affordable
home-networking. It faces a serious threat from Tut Systems Inc., a
Pleasant Hill company that's also developing ways to link PCs into
high-speed networks over phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where more than 18 million homes have more than one
PC, Thermond said he thinks there will be enough market share to go
around.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research predicts that home-networking will be a $1
billion business by 2002, and manufacturers are beginning to take
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 3Com Corp., Texas Instruments Inc. and Northern
Telecom Ltd. all said they would use Epigram's technology in their
products. Lucent Technologies Inc. has said it will use Tut's
products.

 CHRON - ORACLE  
 ORACLE'S ELLISON HAS A TRICK UP HIS SLEEVE  &HT;     By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a speech today at Comdex, the giant computer show, Ellison is
expected to announce plans to make it possible to run Oracle's new
database software program without an operating system such as
Microsoft's Windows NT. ``We're not trying to say we're better than
NT. We're trying to say you don't need an operating system,''
Ellison said in a press briefing at his Pacific Heights home last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the No.2 software maker said that Oracle is talking
with Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq and Dell Computer
about selling ``server appliances'' _ computers that perform
limited functions and don't run a general-purpose operating system.
They're often called ``appliances'' because, like consumer
appliances, they are easy to set up and maintain and are sold as
plug-and-play devices.
</P>
<P>
   In Oracle's case, the server would be used to run Oracle 8i, the
company's new Internet-friendly database program, and Oracle
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Talking with reporters in a sleek dining room offering sweeping
views of the Bay, Ellison said the server, to be available by early
spring, will lower the costs of owning and maintaining a database
because it will be considerably less complex than a traditional
server. Traditional servers generally require expensive technical
support to run and maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry has ``become sensitized to the cost of
labor. A way to get around this is to simplify everything,''
Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   Server appliances are targeted at small businesses or businesses
with lots of branches that want to share Internet access and such
resources as printers.
</P>
<P>
   Generally these businesses don't have the technical staff needed
to maintain a network at each location.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle of Redwood Shores isn't alone in the market for the
devices. Chip giant Intel is offering a server appliance that is
used only to connect users to a printer.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Whistle Communications of Foster City and
Hewlett-Packard of Palo Alto offer small, inexpensive servers that
perform limited functions.
</P>
<P>
   Research firm Dataquest estimates the market for these and other
networking appliances, now about $2 billion, could grow to $16
billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mazzola, a spokesman for Dell Computer, confirmed that the
company is talking with Oracle about manufacturing the server
appliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense for Dell because we're trying to make it easier
for customers to deploy systems,'' Mazzola said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides selling the Oracle server appliance, Ellison is offering
to manage it for customers at ``a low, fixed fee.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not disclose pricing for the server or the management
service.
</P>
<P>
   The server appliance is one part of Ellison's strategy to make
it easy and relatively inexpensive to run Oracle's database and
application programs.
</P>
<P>
   By January, he will launch Oracle Business Online, charging
customers $395 to $895 per user per month to run Oracle
applications.

FLAT IS THE WORD AT COMDEX IN VEGAS 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - COMDEX   By Benny Evangelista and Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flatter, faster, lighter, cheaper and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the words that will be uttered countless thousands of
times this week as 220,000 people descend on Las Vegas to try to
make sense of some 100,000 new or enhanced technology products on
display at the 20th annual Comdex computer trade show.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates kicked off the six-day geekfest
last night with a keynote speech that turned into an 80-minute
infomercial for upcoming Microsoft products like Office 2000, SQL
Server 7.0 and Windows CE. Unlike spring Comdex, where a Windows 98
demo crashed, this time everything worked.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by videotaped appearances by talk show host Jay Leno and
director George Lucas, Gates said the future of technology depends
on keeping the average consumer in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're enhancing people's lives, connecting people from Maine
to mainland China,'' Gates said. ``But as computers become more
powerful, we must keep them simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Comdex is the high-tech industry's chance to show off products
and give consumers a glimpse of the gadgets they'll covet in the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   One buzzword is flatter, for flat panel displays. These computer
monitors, as thin as a book, are expected to be one of the hottest
items during the six-day trade show because they've dropped below
$1,000 for the first time, making them half of what they cost last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Optiquest Inc. for example, will unveil a 15.1-inch liquid LCD
display that is only three inches deep, 75 percent thinner than a
standard computer monitor. Other manufacturers like Sony, IBM and
Panasonic are also displaying new flat panel screens, which are
expected to be hot sellers next year as they get cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're able to reclaim four square feet off any desk where
you have one of those big monitors, that's prime real estate,''
said William Sell, general manager of Comdex.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitors will show off faster 40-speed CD-ROMs that can write
and rewrite data like a floppy disk, and the next-generation DVD
players. Advanced digital cameras, universal serial bus devices and
speech recognition products are also expected to be hot items at
this year's show.
</P>
<P>
   Faster also applies to new handheld PalmPilots and similar
devices that boot up instantly, Sells said. In fact, the show has
created a new ``instant on'' category on the show floor for such
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Another hot-button item will be lighter notebook computers from
makers like Hewlett-Packard, which will show off an ultra-light
1.4-pound notebook with 10 hours of batterly life, said analyst Tim
Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies Research International of
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, Toshiba and Sony will also weigh in with mini-notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Although attendance is expected to be slightly up this year,
companies from economically strapped Asia are sending smaller
contingents to Comdex.
</P>
<P>
   And some big U.S. companies have opted to go smaller rather than
competing in the din of the big showroom floors.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp., for one, decided against having a booth for the
first time in years. Instead, the chipmaker will try to inspire the
computer industry to think ``out of the box'' by showing some
concept PCs in odd shapes and colors. The machines, running Intel's
next generation technology, are designed to show how computers can
be both attractive and easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can get value out of the show, without having the
full-blown booth,'' said Intel spokesman Bill Calder.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's main presence will come when its chief executive, Craig
Barrett, delivers an unconventional keynote on Tuesday. He'll serve
on the ``Technically Incorrect'' panel with, among others, comedian
Bill Maher and magician Penn Jillette.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies say their booths _ which are expensive to buy,
set up and staff _ are not worth the effort. But they still send
representatives, as Comdex is the one place the entire computer
industry gathers, and attendees' PalmPilots have already filled
with appointments.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, for example, dropped out of Comdex after last year's show
because it had become too big for Big Blue. Still, IBM spokesman
Dave Berman said the company will have a ``very limited presence''
in town, hosting a Tuesday  &LR; lunch briefing tomorrow on new software
products for Windows 2000 and Lotus.
</P>
<P>
   This year's show may also test technology against the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Every November, the Leonid meteor shower lights up the night
sky. But every 32 or 33 years, the Leonids provide an even more
spectacular display. Their last major storm came in 1966, before
hundreds of satellites were orbiting the earth, providing service
for pagers, television, spy agencies, global positioning systems
and many other uses.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the Leonids could ``sandblast'' satellites.
Alarmists fear even worse. Either way, it could wreak havoc with
communications at Comdex and around the globe.

</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-SADDAM (Washington) _ With his latest act of brinkmanship,

   IRAQ-U.S.-SOLDIERS (Kuwait City) _ It seems like the middle of

some of them are getting sick of Saddam Hussein.

is one of the world's most important nesting areas for sea turtles,
and Mexican environmentalists view its ivory sands and emerald

people in the United States see Yosemite or the Grand Canyon. But
in February, after months of secret negotiations, the state

SNAKEBIT KINGS ARE HOPEFUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ In the aftermath of their latest loss,
Saturday night at home to Carolina, there was an uncharacteristic
feeling in the Los Angeles Kings' locker room. Call it cautious
optimism, borne from the fact that Saturday the Kings actually
showed a little spunk.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell whether or not the optimism is misguided,
though no amount of hopefulness can erase the fact that the Kings
(5-9-3) are scoreless in their last 22 power plays and have lost
three consecutive games as they head into tonight's meeting with
the Mighty Ducks (5-6-4) at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The most graphic example of how snake-bitten the Kings are came
during a first-period power play in the Carolina loss, when
Philippe Boucher sent the puck toward the glass in the Hurricanes'
zone - and through one of the small holes in the Plexiglas through
which photographers point their lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that can go wrong does go wrong,'' coach Larry
Robinson said, shaking his head. ``A prime example is we've got
guys that, just for fun, try to put the puck through that little
hole (during practice). And they can't do it. On the power play, we
shoot the puck to keep it in, it goes through the hole. What can
you say? I personally have never seen anything like this.''

CSUN NOTES: BUBB TO GET 11 MONTHS PAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As part of the settlement stemming from his
resignation, former Cal State Northridge athletic director Paul
Bubb will receive 11 months salary, school spokesman John Chandler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb was paid $86,700 annually, according to CSUN human
resources director Steve Montgomery. Based on his salary over the
11 months, Bubb will collect $79,475 from the school.
</P>
<P>
   According to the breakdown, Bubb receives three months pay for
standard services provided to the university during his three-year
tenure as athletic director _ one month for each year.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb receives 5{ months pay for his time spent at the school
before he became athletic director, Chandler said. Once again, it's
one month for each year of employment.
</P>
<P>
   And Bubb received 2{ months pay from accrued vacation time,
Chandler said. Chandler added Bubb's agreement includes a paid trip
to the NCAA convention later in the academic year.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb, 41, resigned Nov. 3 in the wake of the scandal involving
then women's basketball coach Michael Abraham. Abraham was arrested
Oct. 27 and charged by the FBI with trafficking in crack cocaine.
Abraham was placed on paid administrative leave but resigned his
post Nov. 6
</P>
<P>
   Bubb resigned under pressure from CSUN president Blenda Wilson.
Bubb was in Springfield, Mo., Saturday for CSUN's football game
against Southwest Missouri State and is expected to travel to Idaho
State next week. University officials said school funds were not
being used to make the trips.
</P>
<P>
   __ Postseason blues?: After beginning the season 0-4, CSUN's
men's soccer team won 11 of 12 heading into its regular-season
finale at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. But don't expect the NCAA
selection committee to come calling in regard to the NCAA
Tournament, and much of that is the Matadors' fault.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, which will rejoin the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
next season, played as an independent this season after coach
Marwan Ass'ad called the conference to tell it not to include the
Matadors in the 1998 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   It stemmed from the uncertainty of the program following the
infamous dropping and reinstating of four sports, including men's
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   But CSUN athletic officials and MPSF officials said the Matadors
probably would make the NCAAs if the team were affiliated with the
MPSF this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Women's basketball: Fresh off an 83-72 victory over Oakland
(Minn.) University in Saturday's season opener, CSUN's women's team
returns to the court tonight (7:05) against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The win marked the first time the Matadors (1-0) won their
opener since 1989, and CSUN hasn't started the season with two wins
since 1988.

COWBOYS WIN AS PLUMMER MISFIRES ON LATE PASS
</HEADLINE>
 GAMER-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ When the ball bounced through the hands of
Cardinals receiver Rob Moore and fell harmlessly to the ground,
most of the relieved Cowboys first checked for a penalty flag and
then got the heck out of Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders and his sore left toe limped to
the middle of the field and led a few players in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Both reactions were fitting.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who saw the Cardinals battle back from 28 points
down to come within a fingertip (or a pass-interference penalty) of
tying the game on the final play, survived with a 35-28 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (the ball hit the ground) but I wasn't sure,'' Gailey
said. ``Then I saw our guys jumping up and down. I said (to myself)
`Thank God'.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo refused to watch the
climactic play, which was broken up by much-criticized cornerback
Kevin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did survive,'' Campo said. ``We were fortunate to get out
of here with a victory. I had my hands over my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Paining the Cowboys was seeing Cardinals quarterback Jake
Plummer target an injury-depleted secondary to rally his team with
465 yards and three touchdown passes. The yards were the
second-most ever allowed by the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve cornerback Charlie Williams played in place of the
All-Pro Sanders, who missed much of the second half with a sprained
big toe, and Smith was slowed by a separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   That the Cowboys escaped with a victory and accomplished their
goal of increasing their lead in the NFC East despite hardships
helped ease the disappointment of almost blowing a 28-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (7-3) moved two games ahead of the second-place
Cardinals (5-5) and a step closer to reclaiming the division after
their five-year dominance ended last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our guys hung in there and found a way to win,''
Gailey said. ``I'm impressed with what we did from an intangible
standpoint. I thought we overcame a lot of injuries. We obviously
have some things to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will need to improve fast as they embark upon the
toughest part of their schedule starting Sunday against the
Seahawks (5-5). A Thanksgiving Day matchup with the Vikings (9-1)
comes after that, followed by road games against the Saints (5-5)
and Chiefs (4-5).
</P>
<P>
   The four-game stretch is expected to answer many questions about
the Cowboys, who so far have feasted on their lowly division
opponents. The Cowboys have breezed through six NFC East games
undefeated and finished 4-0 on the road in the division for the
first time since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the Showdown in the Desert, this game looked to be
turning into a waltz. The Cowboys, who outscored their division
opponents 96-17 in the first five games, appeared to be having
another easy time of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys put on a show for much of the first half, as they
led 14-0 after the first quarter and 28-0 with 3:29 left in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman, who completed 14 of 18 passes in the
game for 208 yards, including a touchdown pass to fullback Daryl
Johnston, threw the ball at ease.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith had no trouble on the ground, rushing
for 72 yards and two touchdowns in the first half en route to a
118-yard night. Gailey befuddled the Cardinals' defense with passes
to little-used tight ends Eric Bjornson and David LaFleur.
</P>
<P>
   He also surprised them with the option play. Receiver Ernie
Mills took a handoff from Aikman and pitched the ball to Smith for
a 14-yard gain to set up the game's first touchdown. A gimpy
Sanders even set up a score with an interception.
</P>
<P>
   Everything seemed be going great, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had to keep playing,'' Gailey said ``But I didn't
think they could come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer got things started with a touchdown pass to receiver
Frank Sanders in the waning moments of the first half. The
Cardinals made the score 28-14 when they took the second-half
kickoff and marched 60 yards to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys tried to break their momentum with a touchdown from
Smith, who notched his first three-touchdown game since
Thanksgiving Day 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, however, was just getting started. A touchdown pass to
Rob Moore on Williams narrowed the Cowboys' lead to 35-21 with :04
left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer put the Cardinals in position for the final frenetic
moments with a touchdown pass to running back Adrian Murrell at the
3:09 mark of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cardinals came back down the field after the Cowboys
were unable to run out the clock, Smith knew he would be the
target, as he has been all season. With three seconds left and
facing a third down at the 5-yard line, Plummer lofted a fade pass
to Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, supported by television replays, believed that
Smith interfered with Moore on the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a jump ball and you have to fight for it,'' Smith said.
``That's what it was. If you were a fan watching the game, you
might think this was the Cardinals' day. But he didn't catch the
ball and that's all that matters. It was the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew!

BILLS RUB SALT IN PATRIOTS' WOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ If it was all about guts and determination
and playing shorthanded, the Patriots were winners Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But football is not always about those things. First and
foremost, it's about making plays. And when it truly counted
Sunday, the Patriots did not make them.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 13-10 loss to the Doug Flutie-led Buffalo Bills
at Bills Stadium that left New England 5-5 and in fourth place in
the AFC East. The Patriots have lost four of their last five games,
and added three more players to their burgeoning injury list.
</P>
<P>
   The first-place Miami Dolphins (7-3) play in Foxborough next
Monday night and the week after, the Patriots host a rematch with
the Bills (6-4, tied for second with the Jets, who were upset by
the lowly Colts Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   It all looks very bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this,'' said an emotional Drew Bledsoe following
the loss, ``I am proud to be part of this team because of the
effort (that) was extended today.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they tried to put a positive spin on the defeat, the
locker room was somber as the Patriots seemed stunned to lose a
game that was well within their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The banged-up defensive line, which had tackles playing end and
ends playing tackle, was just trying to make it through the day
without being embarrassed. And the linebacking corps wasn't much
better off, as both Chris Slade (ankle) and Todd Collins (groin)
were out. That allowed the Bills, behind the smashmouth blocking of
fullback Sam Gash, to run for 213 yards on 46 carries for a
4.6-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had eight regulars out of action, and defensive end
Willie McGinest lasted only four plays before he was done for the
day, aggravating a groin injury. To make things worse, right tackle
Zefross Moss sprained his left knee in the second quarter and
cornerback Steve Israel suffered a mild concussion in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Bills converted 56 percent of their third-down
opportunities, 12 via the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie threw for one touchdown and completed 14 of 26 passes for
178 yards and two interceptions, but he ran for 49 yards, eluded
pressure when he had to, and made some big plays. And guess what?
He won again.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots receiver Shawn Jefferson was the first to take the
blame for the loss. And perhaps he should have been.
</P>
<P>
   With the game on the line on a fourth-and-10 play from the Bills
34 and 2:57 left in the game, Bledsoe dropped back and found
Jefferson on a sideline pattern. The ball hit Jefferson in the
hands and at the same moment cornerback Donovan Greer undercut
Jefferson's feet. The ball came loose as Jefferson hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make a play when I had to,'' said Jefferson. ``I blew
it. It's tough when we go out and fight like that. My teammates
played good enough to win it and then I don't catch it. That loss
is on me. You have to make the plays when you have to and I didn't.
We dug ourselves a hole and I certainly didn't help matters this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Vincent Brisby, who returned to the lineup after
missing four games with a broken right finger, also dropped a pass
on the final drive, which began at the Patriots 27. On second and
10 from the Bills 42, Brisby, who had been trying to cradle balls
into his chest rather than catch them with his bandaged hand, saw
the ball go right through his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take full responsibility for this loss,'' said Brisby. ``It
was a play I needed to make. It was a catchable ball.''
</P>
<P>
   There were many drops by Patriots receivers and the offense
missed many opportunities. There were seven straight incompletions
on the final drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Drew made a bunch of throws and we had plenty of
chances to make plays,'' said coach Pete Carroll. ``The last drive
we were marching down field and we got two passes right in the
hands of guys and we've got to make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   New England could have been blown out, but twice Flutie marched
the Bills downfield and threw interceptions into the end zone. The
first, late in the third quarter, was by Willie Clay on a pass
intended for Andre Reed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots went three downs and out, and the Bills came
right back to score on a 10-yard Flutie pass to Jay Riemersma,
which put the Bills up, 13-3, with 1:57 remaining in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots would make it interesting. Their only touchdown
came on one of the prettiest plays of the game, when Bledsoe hit
Tony Simmons for a 37-yard play on which the rookie receiver made
the catch at the 18 on a crossing pattern, broke one tackle, and
eluded Ken Irvin before lunging into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   One play earlier, Simmons had been penalized for illegal
touching of the ball after he went out of bounds, then leaped back
in bounds into the end zone and caught a Bledsoe pass, which was
disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   On their next possession, the Bills went from their 28 to the
Patriots 3 as Thurman Thomas (11 carries for 76 yards) was
unstoppable up the middle. But Flutie again threw an interception
in the end zone, as Lawyer Milloy picked off a ball intended for
Eric Moulds with 4:41 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriot offense could not capitalize as the Bills' Bruce
Smith sacked Bledsoe twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills got the ball back following a punt, and on
fourth-and-4 from the Patriots 27, Bills coach Wade Phillips
decided to go for it. But Patriots first-round pick Tebucky Jones
made a huge play when he deflected a Flutie pass intended for Reed
that would have given the Bills a first down and sealed New
England's fate. But the Patriots' last chance fell short.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, a pair of Steve Christie field goals gave the
Bills a 6-0 lead, answered once by Vinatieri, who hit a 38-yarder
on a kick that was held up in the wind but managed to fall over the
crossbar. Vinatieri battled the elements all day, missing two other
first-half tries.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Shawn Stuckey, who was activated off the Patriots
practice squad, made a big play when he recovered a fumble on the
kickoff following Vinatieri's field goal at the Buffalo 20. But the
Patriots could do nothing. Running back Robert Edwards (14 carries,
50 yards) dropped a sure first-down pass on third and 12 and
Vinatieri saw his 39-yard attempt go wide right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Nature got the best of me today,'' said Vinatieri.
``They didn't go where I wanted them to go. I tried to adjust by
kicking them left a little, but that didn't always work.''

BUFFALO FINDS ROAD TO VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Bills coach Wade Phillips had a different
take on Sunday's game with the Patriots than most of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a defensive coach,'' Phillips said. ``To me this is
pretty; 13-10, we win. We control the game with our offense and
hold them to 200 yards (actually 206). That's pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   This Buffalo victory encapsulated everything that has been wrong
with the Patriots in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   1.) They could not get their defense off the field. The Bills
controlled the ball, 37:17 to 22:43.
</P>
<P>
   2.) They could not run the ball, gaining 48 yards on 16 carries.
</P>
<P>
   3.) They could not stop the pass, as Buffalo collected 11 first
downs passing to eight for New England, even though the Patriots
threw the ball more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed when we didn't run the ball well against
the Jets last week, and we wanted to run it better in this game,''
said Phillips. ``We thought we could. Our running game was very
good. I thought it let us keep control. And defensively, we shut
them down. You hold that team to 200 yards offense and you've done
a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills' explanation of how they won was the same as those
given by the Falcons, Jets, and Dolphins in recent weeks: There is
a forumla for stopping the Patriots offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do things to keep (Drew) Bledsoe from getting in a
rhythm,'' said Bills defensive end Marcus Wiley. ``You keep him off
balance. You just don't want him to go back there, set up, and
throw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coverage was great today,'' said defensive end Bruce
Smith, who was terrific as usual when the game was on the line,
getting two big sacks near the finish when the Patriots had a
chance to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce is a special player,'' said Phillips. ``When it is on
the line near the end of the game, that's when he seems to make
plays. You need heart to do that. Even though they had two guys
trying to block him most of the game, he still made the big
sacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bills, like other teams that have played the Patriots
recently, said Bledsoe doesn't throw the ball as effectively when
he has to move away from his primary target and look at his second
and third options. He was just 12 of 31 Sunday, and tight end Ben
Coates (4 catches for 70 yards) was the only receiver Bledsoe could
count on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coverage was pretty good,'' said Bills safety Henry Jones.
``We had a good idea going into the game of what they like to do,
and when they like to do it. But you still have to keep them from
executing. Coates is tough. I had to cover him, and he's got six
inches and 70 pounds on me. He's a monster. And it seems like
Bledsoe throws a bullet every time he throws to Ben.''
</P>
<P>
   The game easily could have been a blowout for the Bills, but
Doug Flutie kept the Patriots in the game by throwing two
interceptions in the Patriots end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made one bad throw and one bad decision,'' Flutie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug should have done something else with the ball on those
plays,'' said Phillips. ``We should have come out of there with at
least two field goals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the last couple of weeks,'' said Flutie, ``we were
scoring every time we got close. The last two games we struggled.
It's an up-and-down thing. Who knows? Maybe next game we will start
finishing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie had a marvelous game running the ball, as did his primary
backs, Antowain Smith and old reliable Thurman Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we could run the ball,'' said guard Ruben Brown, ``and
we stayed with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference from last week,'' injured offensive tackle John
Fina said, referring to the Bills' loss to the Jets, ``is that the
offense made a commitment to running the ball, and stayed with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's offensive line hammered the Patriots from tackle to
tackle, as the Bills averaged a huge 5.4 yards per carry. It has
been awhile since the Patriots defensive front has been slammed
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do anything different,'' said tackle Robert Hicks.
``It was just straight-ahead power stuff. We just knocked them off
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind, which was blowing hard all day, was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the ball got up in the air a little bit, it started
to move side to side,'' said Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made passes bob and weave,'' said Flutie. ``There were some
dropped passes out there and I think the wind had something to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that first (interception), I saw Andre (Reed) waiting wide
open in the back of the end zone and I just tried to flip it in the
air and make it easy for him. But the wind caught it, and it must
have stayed up there five seconds. If I had turned my body and
drilled the ball in there, we would have had a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I did on the touchdown pass (to Jay Riemersma). I
saw him coming open behind the linebacker and I just drilled it in
there so the wind couldn't bother it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are in trouble. Unless they get Terry Glenn, Willie
McGinest, and Chris Slade back in a hurry, they will drop out of
the playoff chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were beat up and this was a good time to play
them,'' said Jones. ``But if they get some of those injured guys
back in a couple of weeks,'' when the teams meet again in
Foxborough, ``it could be a different story.''

INJURIES MAKING ALL THE DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Before we go anywhere, I just want to say
that I disagree with the football cognoscenti, some of whom I,
like, you know, work with.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of this macho stuff. This team is 5-5 and sinking fast
and it is about the injuries. First and foremost. Everything else,
including the motivational ability and general competence of the
head coach, is basically tied for second.
</P>
<P>
   The Lombardi myth is just that _ myth. The same goes for the
Parcells myth. ``During the season, football players play
football,'' says the Tuna, the idea being that being hurt is all in
your head.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tired of it. All injuries are not equal. A team can only
lose so many key people before it becomes dysfunctional. The
Patriots went into Sunday's game without Tony Carter, Chris Slade,
Todd Collins, Troy Brown, and Mark Wheeler. They had to go with an
impaired Willie McGinest, and before the game had progressed very
far, he was rendered hors de combat once again (so much for the
pass rush). Oh, and did I mention Terry Glenn? If the Patriots had
somehow managed to win this game, I would have considered it to be
somewhere between the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes and the 1955
Grace Kelly on the Top 10 List of Miraculous Occurrences.
</P>
<P>
   You must accept the fact that, as presently constituted, the
Patriots just aren't very good. They are scrappy and plucky and
perhaps even lovable and all that, but right now they just aren't
very good. And Sunday they were just good enough to lose by a 13-10
score to the Buffalo Bills, who had better not get too full of
themselves, either, if you get my drift.
</P>
<P>
   But they won it. The Buffalo locker room was chock full of
smiling, happy people. The Patriots' room, as you might expect,
could have served as the stand-in for the Stanetsky Memorial
Chapels. And the coach was predictably solemn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This loss hurt bad,'' acknowledged Pete Carroll. ``We had
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The last chance began at the Buffalo 34 with 1:50 remaining. In
the next 19 seconds, Drew Bledsoe basically did what he was
supposed to do. He threw the ball where people had very good
chances to catch it at least twice. He was 0 for 4, the last gasp
being a ball he threw on the right sideline to Shawn Jefferson. It
would have required a makeable, professional catch. Buffalo
defensive back Donovan Greer took Jefferson's legs out from under
him, and the veteran wideout couldn't hold the ball.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only drop. ``There were dropped balls all day
long,'' said Carroll, in a refreshing lapse into postgame candor.
``We had the opportunity to win the game. We even gave ourselves a
last shot.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the defense twice intercepted Doug Flutie in
the end zone. On the negative side, they offered very little
opposition as he marched the team into scoring position. In fact,
just prior to the second interception the Bills had maintained
possession of the football for a staggering 8 minutes 30 seconds,
moving from their 28-yard line to the New England 4, in large
measure by ramming the pigskin down their throats. Does a New
England Patriots team with a healthy Willie McGinest, a healthy
Chris Slade, a healthy Todd Collins, and a healthy several other
guys who were playing hurt (e.g. Henry Thomas) allow this
fair-to-middlin' Buffalo team to do this when it matters?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that this team is in Very Serious Trouble,
and it would have been in even worse difficulty if the Colts had
not risen up to humble the Jets on the last play of their game
Sunday. But they're still in fourth place with six games to go, and
they have nothing going for them.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells is fond of saying you are what your record says
you are, but, like most bromides, it's only half-true. The record
says 5-5, but we know better. What matters is that the team is 1-4
since that Kansas City game, which is starting to recede farther
and farther in memory. (A week ago it felt as if it had taken place
during World War II. Now we're back to the Mexican War. Do I hear
French &AMP; Indian, anybody?) That team no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   This team can't score. This team allowed Buffalo to rack up 213
yards on the ground. This team was completely outplayed in three of
the game's four periods. Granted, any stat can be manipulated, but
I ask you to consider strongly the fact that in periods one, three,
and four the combined possession edge in favor of the home team was
32:24 to 12:36. Rah-rah-sis-boom-bah: the Patriots picked off two
horrible Flutie passes in the end zone. Thank the Grid God for
that, or else this would have been a major rout. It sure felt like
one. If you had never looked at the scoreboard, you would have
thought Buffalo was winning by four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Most players are programmed to rock no boats, conversationally
speaking, so the victorious Bills chose to be diplomatic. ``So
they're 5-5,'' said Bruce Smith. ``It's not over for them. They've
got six games left to go, and I'm sure that's how they're going to
approach it.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt. I don't expect the Patriots to quit. They are trying,
and they will continue to try. ``This team ain't gonna go in the
tank,'' hissed a feisty Carroll. ``We will keep battling. We've
just got to get another win, and keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Another truth is that nobody in this division is very good.
Competitive? Oh, absolutely, and it's now awesomely so with
Indianapolis flexing a few biceps. But it's competitive mediocrity,
and that makes the Patriots' plight so frustrating. If everyone
were completely healthy, the Patriots probably would be the best
team. Right now, with Indy coming on, they might be the worst.
</P>
<P>
   So forget about Shawn Jefferson and whether he should or
shouldn't have caught that last ball. If the Patriots were any good
right now, it never would have come to that in the first place.
They're just not very good _ either unit _ and it's nobody's fault.

BRUINS DISCOVER WHERE THEY RANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a span of 2 1/2 hours, in the time it took for the
Bruins to play Dallas at the FleetCenter Saturday night, the team
went from being unbeaten in four games (2-0-2) to being winless in
two (0-1-1).
</P>
<P>
   After a 3-1 loss to the Stars on the heels of Friday night's tie
with the Rangers, Boston is now one game below .500 with a record
of 6-7-4. The club doesn't play again until Thursday when it hosts
the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars provided the Bruins with a stern test of how they
stack up against the NHL elite, and the verdict was familiar _
terrific effort, decent execution, solid goaltending, but not
nearly enough finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is you can't make excuses,'' said center Jason
Allison. ``You've got to find a way to win. I wasn't unhappy with
the effort. I was unhappy with the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Anson Carter and Kyle McLaren, who missed all of training
camp and a good portion of the team's schedule while haggling over
contracts, get their legs under them, chances are the team's status
will improve. Interestingly, Allison said he doesn't feel right
yet, though he joined the team at the end of the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've started to get back physically, although I've been sick
lately and that's been a little downer,'' he said. ``I don't feel
comfortable around the net yet. That'll come, I'm not worried. For
me, I feel like I'm in the game but I'm not reacting as much as
thinking too much. I'm panicking; well, not panicking, but when I'm
around the net, I'm thinking, `What am I going to do with it?'
instead of just reacting like I normally would.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he recovers from the flu and has a few more hard practices
and games, Allison said he expects to feel more like his old self.
It will help that Carter will carry some of the offensive load.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should get better and better as the games go on,'' he said.
``Our division is so tight. We have to find a way to win games like
(the two weekend contests). We were kind of disappointed with the
Rangers' game. We were outplaying them big-time and we had a little
lapse of three minutes and all of a sudden the game was turned
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``And against Dallas, with not finishing, it's disappointing
that way. We're playing well but we're finding ways not to win
games. The bottom line is we weren't able to score one of those
goals we could've had and they capitalized on a bad bounce. We're
not playing too badly but it's disappointing when you should win a
game and you don't. I think the last two we probably should've
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull scored a pair of goals, one that was scored
accidentally by Allison and one that was probably the best goal
Dafoe has given up this season. Dafoe followed Hull as he skated
down the right side and thought the Dallas right wing had gone too
far past the net to score. However, he banked a high shot off the
top of Dafoe's mask into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out and gave him nothing to shoot at and I pretty much
thought I had him all the way to the goal line where he had no
angle but, as I said, he had a little bit of an angle and a little
bit of room between my gloves and that's exactly where he put it,''
Dafoe said. ``If you give him enough room for the puck to go
through, he'll put it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe thought the Bruins were victims of bad breaks _ the first
a puck that bounced off Ray Bourque and then Allison. The second
was a puck that hit referee Richard Trottier and bounced to Mike
Modano, who set up Hull's second goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we played a very good game, but two bad breaks cost us
two points,'' he said. ``We've been playing well. In New York, we
played very hard to catch up after being down, 3-1, late in the
third. Then we played one of the best teams in hockey and we
matched them very well the whole way. We're not discouraged. We're
disappointed. I'm very disappointed. That was kind of a devastating
way to lose a game so we're going to have a sour taste in our
mouths for the next few days but we'll get back to work (Monday)
and we'll get ready for Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Steve Heinze was probably the most frustrated Bruin
because he was unable to finish myriad chances, including a
breakaway on which goalie Roman Turek made a splendid save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We matched up decently,'' said Heinze, who set up Boston's
lone goal with a crushing hit on Dallas forward Mike Keane that
freed up the puck. ``We stuck to our game as far as neutral zone
forecheck and the cycling down low and not throwing pucks in the
middle. They have a real good system and they work real hard
together. We addressed that and had a decent effort but we didn't
win, we lost.''

RAGE BLAST BLIZZARD

   HARTFORD _ When the Philadelphia Rage came to town 1 1/2 weeks
ago, they were cordial guests, and easily fell to defeat at the
hands of the New England Blizzard. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Rage roared into town Sunday and blasted the Blizzard,
80-72, before 8,524 at the Hartford Civic Center, in a game that
was far more humiliating than the score indicates. In fact, it was
almost as if the Rage had swallowed a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde solution
that transformed them.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that shooting guard Teresa Edwards, who was kept to 10
points in the last meeting, scored a game-high 24 points and had
five steals.
</P>
<P>
   Chasity Melvin and Beth Morgan came off the bench to toss in 21
and 12 points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what accounted for the team's transformation, Rage coach
Anne Donovan just shrugged and said her question was not why her
team looked so good Sunday, but why they looked so bad last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the team here last time was a totally different
team,'' she said. ``That was one day that I have never seen before.
But this is the team that comes to play and that comes to practice
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Blizzard coach K.C. Jones said the team's layoff (since losing
to Columbus Nov. 6) didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a week and a half off to get our game together,'' he
said. ``But a lot of rust set in, and we were not ready to play
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   He credited the combination of Melvin and Morgan for thwarting
the Blizzard's attempts to take the ball to the basket. The
Blizzard (1-2) made just two of eight 3-point attempts, and let the
shot clock expire three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just a step slow in reacting to something that we've
worked on for the past two days now,'' Jones said. ``It looked like
we forgot everything we went over.''
</P>
<P>
   Blizzard point guard Jennifer Rizzotti, who was held to 5 points
and spent the day feeding the ball to her hapless teammates, agreed
that the team looked rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really an excuse, because we're professionals, but I
think we're glad we don't have that much of a layoff for the rest
of the season,'' she said. ``But either way, we have to adjust,
whether it's two games back to back, or a week off.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Young, who leads the ABL in career points with 1,818,
led New England with 17 points. Joining her in double digits were
Kara Wolters (13), Jannon Roland (11), and Dale Hodges (10). And
though the Blizzard outrebounded the Rage, 35-29, their downfall
came in turnovers. The Rage had eight, while the Blizzard had 17.
</P>
<P>
   So New England spent most of the game trying to claw its way
back. The Blizzard's last lead was 16-15 in the first quarter. They
came back to tie it the next quarter, but after Melvin scored with
a layup and followed with a free throw, the game was sealed. The
Rage built their lead to 18 with four minutes to go.

`A' FOR EFFORT ISN'T PASSING GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ As the New England Patriots learned
Sunday, there are no medals for trying.
</P>
<P>
   If there were, the Patriots would deserve one. But instead they
received nothing but defeat and bitter disappointment on a gloomy
Sunday at Bills Stadium, where the Patriots lost for the fourth
time in five weeks. They may have lost more than a game this time.
They may have lost their season.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League is a harsh place to make a living,
and the Patriots have spent three years now making it as hard on
themselves as possible. Season after season they have put
themselves on the brink of playoff extinction by mid-November
before rallying to survive. That has always been a fool's bet, but
they got used to winning it. Sunday, they went bust.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots lost courageously to the Buffalo Bills. They lost
with a depleted defensive line and a receiving corps playing
without its shining star, Terry Glenn. They lost despite twice
blunting Doug Flutie with his team knocking on their goal line. But
the bottom line is they lost, and in a bottom line business, that
is all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo 13, New England 10. Division loss No. 3. Where that
leaves Pete Carroll's fourth-place Patriots is closer to the
cellar-dwelling Indianapolis Colts than the division-leading Miami
Dolphins. Those are just the facts, ma'am, just the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is 7-3 with a win over the Patriots going into Monday
night's showdown in Foxborough. New England is 5-5 and hasn't
beaten a division team other than the Colts. Those are grim facts
to face with six games to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put ourselves in some difficult situations the last few
years,'' quarterback Drew Bledsoe said after his team had done it
again by being outgained by nearly 200 yards (391-206), allowing
Buffalo to continue a season-long trend of converting on third down
(56 percent), and being dominated in the running game, 213 yards to
48.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to dig ourselves out of them but we haven't
done it yet this time. We're 5-5. We've got to win the rest of our
games.''
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of that is slim. It is slim because of the
reality of the team's injury situation but more important, it is
slim because of the reality that this team has failed to make the
big plays when it has needed them all season.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't make them in Denver or in Miami or against the Jets
or certainly against Atlanta, and they didn't make them Sunday
either.
</P>
<P>
   One week it is the defense that fails. The next week it is the
offense. Of late it has been the latter more than the former. Twice
that defense was battered by Flutie and the Bills only to intercept
him in the end zone to keep its hopes alive. But each time the
offense responded with a three-and-out series.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the defense stopped Flutie again on fourth and 4 at
the Patriots 27 with 2:57 to play, that same offense drove to the
Bills 34 only to throw seven straight incompletions with a
drive-saving interference call sandwiched in between to briefly
keep them alive.
</P>
<P>
   But with the ball on the Bills 34 on fourth down, Shawn
Jefferson had a pass go through his hands, down his body, and off
his knee _ and it was over. The play had not been made.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   Same plot. Same story. Same ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make the play,'' a contrite Jefferson said. ``I feel
miserable. I let my teammates down today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we've dug a hole for ourselves in the division, but the
bottom line is I didn't make the plays at the end of the game. My
teammates played well enough to win. I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were only that simple. It is not. This has been building
for several years now, this tempting of the football fates. Fall
after fall, the Patriots have danced with the devil, seeming to
believe they would always win the games when they had to.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they still will. Perhaps they will win six straight and
finish 11-5 and be the talk of the town. But don't count on it this
time, because this time everything is different.
</P>
<P>
   Something is wrong in Foxborough, and it is not just that a
dozen Patriots are injured with more sure to come, although that
has certainly made things more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to say the Patriots lost Sunday because they
had so many injuries along the defensive line and in the receiving
corps. Clearly both areas were greatly weakened, but at the end of
the day New England was in a position to tie the game or even win
it with a catch or two and instead threw seven straight
incompletions and dropped the last pass of the afternoon at the
Bills 24-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Did injuries beat them?
</P>
<P>
   No, they beat themselves, with an assist from Flutie and the
Bills' barreling running game. They beat themselves by being cocky
for too long. They beat themselves by always believing things would
change next week. Or the next. Or the next.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it seemed nothing was changing they could not see it
because always there was a next week.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just injuries or third downs that are the problem
hanging over our heads,'' cornerback Ty Law said forthrightly.
``It's the whole big picture. This is definitely a much lower spot
(than the past two years). Our backs were to the wall and we didn't
come through. It was the same old thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Same old story. Same old ending. Same sad facts. The Patriots
fought hard all right, but trying is the minimum not the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Trying is what you're supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Winning is what they're paid to do.
</P>
<P>
   In life, half a loaf is better than none. In the NFL, half a
loaf is grounds for impeachment.

FLUTIE CAN'T LOSE WITH BUFFALO FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ If you changed the man's last name, this
might be a different story. The man knows that. Football fans can
be hostile when it comes to watching quarterbacks. So when they
watch one complete 14 of 26 passes and throw two hideous
interceptions in the end zone, they usually call that man names
that do not appear on his birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   That did not happen Sunday at Bills Stadium. It would have
happened if Doug ``Smith'' were the Buffalo quarterback. Doug
``Johnson'' would have heard a howling 15-miles-per-hour wind as
well as fans howling obscenities. Doug ``Robinson'' would have been
asked to leave in no uncertain terms.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the adopted home of Doug Flutie. It is his own
football wonderland. Do bad things happen here? Yes. Do bad things
happen because of Flutie? Never.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here will look at the bright side of the things I
did today,'' Flutie said after the Bills beat the Patriots, 13-10.
``It's good to be in an atmosphere like that.''
</P>
<P>
   You can be that insulated when people come from four directions
and two countries to watch you play. There were 72,020 people here
Sunday. Many came from the east, all the way from Natick, Mass., to
watch Flutie. There were some who came from the north, Canadians
who crossed the Peace Bridge to see the most popular Bill in
western New York. And then there were Bills fans coming from the
south and west, from Erie, Pa., and the Buffalo suburbs. Just to
see Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   The former Natick High and Boston College star was brilliant at
times. On one first-quarter play, Flutie was reminiscent of an
improvising kid playing football on a fall afternoon. He scrambled
for 10 yards to the Buffalo 36. It seemed as if the play would end
there. It didn't. Instead, Flutie looked to his left and saw
Thurman Thomas near the sideline. ``He was looking right at me,''
Flutie said. So Flutie threw him the ball. That's right. He
lateraled to his left and Thomas caught it. A 10-yard gain turned
into a 20-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   After the play, a few Patriots pointed to the line of scrimmage
as if to say, ``He was over the line of scrimmage; he's not allowed
to throw that.'' He was allowed. He was allowed because he
lateraled behind him. You rarely see that in the NFL. It happens
often in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that one time when I was with British Columbia,'' Flutie
said. He mentioned that it was one of his favorite laterals and
that it went for 20 yards, too. In any country, that kind of play
excites fans. Those in the Bills Stadium press box were told before
the game that it was unprofessional to cheer in a working press
box. Many of those people shouted (and quietly cheered) when Flutie
made that play.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a yin-yang type of afternoon. Everyone cheered; no
one booed. They could have booed when Flutie, facing the team that
he played for from 1987-89, threw an interception in the third
quarter. The Bills were on the New England 13. They led, 6-3, and
could have put the Patriots away with a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just laid it up there,'' Flutie said of his errant throw,
``and it sat up there for about five days and the wind just held it
up.'' Andre Reed was the intended receiver, but Patriots safety
Willie Clay wound up with the ball in the end zone. Flutie said it
was a bad throw afterward; the harsh critics in the crowd said
nothing when the play happened. They were also silent when Flutie,
at the New England 4 in the fourth quarter, tried to throw to Kevin
Williams. ``I threw late,'' Flutie said. Lawyer Milloy wound up
with that ball.
</P>
<P>
   Boos? Please. Are you well? No one here is going to boo Doug
Flutie. Anyway, he did throw for a touchdown, a 10-yarder to tight
end Jay Riemersma. He also was able to stay behind an offensive
line that produced 213 rushing yards, 49 of them by Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback was not sacked. The quarterback was rarely
rushed. The quarterback was nearly perfect in the eyes of those who
came to see him. In less than two weeks, he will be in New England
to meet the Patriots again. He said that game will be more
sentimental than this one because it will be in Foxborough, and the
fans of New England ``have always been loyal.'' Even if he didn't
play well.
</P>
<P>
   When Flutie had led his team to its sixth win in the last seven
games, he went to his locker and picked up a stat sheet. He looked
at it and said to himself, ``Drew (Bledsoe) was 12 of 31?''
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white sheet with the numbers on it did not lie.
Bledsoe completed 12 of 31 passes. He'll hear about that Monday. It
won't matter that his receivers had a severe case of the drops.
He'll be criticized like most quarterbacks are criticized. There is
an alternative: He could move here and change his last name.

BLEDSOE'S BEEN COMING UP EMPTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N. Y. _ Once again, as in recent games against
Miami and the Jets, Drew Bledsoe and the Patriots offense had a
chance in the fourth quarter of a close game to do what they are
expected to do at this mature stage of their football lives _ make
the play to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple fact of the matter is that when we had a chance to
make plays, on third downs and late in the game, we didn't make the
plays,'' said Bledsoe. ``And if you don't make the plays, you don't
win the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what happened Sunday at Bills Stadium, as Buffalo
beat New England, 13-10. Mediocrity looms a constant companion for
the 5-5 Patriots as the late-game drive that would cement this
offense into confident cohesion may never become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make it happen,'' Shawn Jefferson said. ``I didn't
make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   One game an interception, another game a dropped pass, still
another game an incompletion, another game a missed block or sack.
It's always something.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unacceptable,'' Bledsoe said, ``and it's the same way for
everybody on this team. It's unacceptable for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unacceptable, but common.
</P>
<P>
   Ten, 20, 30, maybe 40 times Jefferson _ the latest Patriot
offensive player in the bull's-eye _ would take the blame for the
loss for his fourth-down drop of a Bledsoe pass on New England's
final offensive play of the game. ``It was my fault; my teammates
made the plays but I didn't,'' Jefferson said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense indeed made plays when it had to. Henry Thomas, who
should be given five stars for courage, hopped off his crutches and
saved a touchdown with a tackle of Thurman Thomas at the 2-yard
line on the first play of the second quarter. Lawyer Milloy picked
off Doug Flutie in the end zone late in the fourth quarter to give
the ball back to the offense.
</P>
<P>
   But the offense foundered and the ball was right back in the
Bills' hands. So this time the defense stopped the Bills on a
fourth-and-4 on the Patriot 27-yard line with 2:57 to play. Once
again, Bledsoe and the offense had another chance. Once again,
nothing came of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected when we got the ball at the start of that drive
that we'd move the ball,'' said Jefferson. ``We thought we'd get it
down there, at least to field goal range. We had a chance there at
the end, and it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As an offense, we couldn't hold up our end of the bargain,''
said Bledsoe. ``That's very disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointing, but now routine.
</P>
<P>
   It looked promising, that final drive, a 22-yard completion to
Jefferson, an interference call on the Bills' Henry Jones on a
Bledsoe pass to Ben Coates. New England had a first down at the
Buffalo 34 with 1:46 left. Plenty of time, even though New England
was out of timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Good offenses get it done from there, most of all in
``must-win'' games, as Bledsoe and so many of his mates had called
this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Drew made a bunch of throws and we had plenty of
chances to make plays,'' said coach Pete Carroll. ``The last drive
we were fighting our way down the field and we got two passes right
in guys' hands and we've got to make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of those dropped passes was to Vincent Brisby,
returning from a month's absence with his broken right index finger
heavily padded and taped. ``The bottom line in the NFL is making
the plays when you have to,'' said Brisby, ``and there came the
time when we had the opportunity to make the plays and we didn't
make them. I'm one who can really say I didn't make the plays when
I had the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Brisby drop was not fatal. Jefferson's was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say all the other guys on offense made the plays,'' said
Jefferson. ``I'm the one who didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Time after time in these close games, the plot resurfaces.
Missed plays, missed passes, missed blocks, missed reads, dropped
balls. Words change from week to week _ the drama, too _ but the
curtain comes down on the same ending. New England's offense came
up short.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a head coach in the NFL; when you don't win, you take
heat,'' said Bledsoe when asked about the greeting Carroll can
expect back in New England this week. ``He knows that, he's known
that all along.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe then switched from Carroll to himself, saying,
``It's the same as playing quarterback; when you don't win, you
take the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bledsoe will, deservedly, because this is his offense and
these are his games to win. ``This one hurts,'' said Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have to win their final six games, said Bledsoe,
``and go 11-5. Is that reasonable? No. But football players aren't
reasonable people.''
</P>
<P>
   Six straight wins certainly aren't reasonable as long as the
Patriots offense can't score touchdowns and New England can't put
together those final drives in the waning moments that all good
offenses do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams aren't afraid of us anymore,'' said Brisby.
</P>
<P>
   For good reason.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Pariots owner Bob Kraft has filed tampering
charges against Jets coach Bill Parcells concerning a phone call
Parcells had with quarterback Drew Bledsoe after the teams played
Oct. 19 at Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots apparently are maintaining that Parcells informed
the Miami Dolphins that wide receiver Terry Glenn would not play
against Miami the following week.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells calls the charge ``ridiculous,'' though both he and
Bledsoe confirmed the topic came up in the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said two weeks ago that his chat with Bledsoe was a
harmless, friendly conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he said the same thing after the Jets' 24-23 loss to
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him (Bledsoe). We had a three-minute conversation. He
mentioned Terry Glenn. I never talked to (Dolphins coach) Jimmy
Johnson. It is ridiculous,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he called Bledsoe three days after the Jets' 24-14
victory over the Patriots to thank the quarterback for shaking
hands with him after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells and Bledsoe had not spoken since Parcells left New
England and joined the Jets following the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   The league office said it is looking into the matter.

CBS PAINTS CLEAR PICTURE OF PATRIOTS' TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ CBS sports captured several key reasons that the
Patriots have become unglued this season.
</P>
<P>
   One is the team's inability to play in pain. A first-quarter
graphic detailed seven injured players, including Terry Glenn and
Willie McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the greatest injury report in the league, not only for
the number of players, but also for the quality,'' said CBS
commentator Phil Simms.
</P>
<P>
   But before Simms wallowed in Patriots pity, he told a story
about Bill Parcells when he coached Simms and the New York Giants.
Simms was the team's quarterback and several teammates were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parcells came in the locker room and was saying how everybody
felt sorry for us, '' Simms said. ``But then he told us nobody
really cared. On Monday mornings all anyone wanted to know is did
we win or did we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Gumbel, CBS' play-by-play announcer, was struck by the
coldness, and called Parcells a ``heartless coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms responded: ``Yeah, that's true, but he taught us to stop
feeling sorry for ourselves'' ... and figure out some way to win.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells and the Giants were able to do that, but not these
Patriots. They lost another key game and sustained yet another key
injury _ this time to Zefross Moss, who sprained a knee in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With Sunday's defeat, the Patriots have lost four of their last
five games and coach Pete Carroll is being asked to answer or
accept the blame.
</P>
<P>
   If Carroll were on what CBS's Mike Lombardi called the ``hot
seat'' two weeks ago, there's no telling what he's sitting on after
the Bills' 13-10 win.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Bob Kraft was less critical, telling CBS that he
would evaluate Carroll at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Carroll said that criticism and firings are part
of the business and that he ``has to learn to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't appear to be dealing too well Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With the ball deep in Buffalo territory, the Patriots had a
first down with about four minutes remaining in the second quarter.
An illegal procedure penalty moved the Patriots back five yards.
After Drew Bledsoe failed to connect on two passes, Adam Vinatieri
missed his second 39-yard field goal of the game.
</P>
<P>
   CBS cameras showed Carroll throughout the series ranting and
raving on the sideline, screaming at referees.
</P>
<P>
   During the telecast, Kraft reiterated, through sideline reporter
Armen Keteyian, that he would sell the team unless he received $70
million in taxpayers' money to help pay for land and infrastructure
improvements around a propsed new stadium in Foxborough. The state
legislature has offered $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Kraft said he really didn't want to threaten the
Patriots' fans, he wants the team to remain in New England. He said
he wouldn't move the team to the West Coast for even a $100 million
franchise relocation fee plus $40 million in annual ticket
revenues. Some things just don't change with the Patriots: stadium
talk, an unimpressive team, and owners' egos.
</P>
<P>
   The final problem that CBS brought to national attention was the
continuing Kraft vs. Parcells saga. Lombardi reported that the
Patriots filed tampering charges against Parcells last week,
claiming the Jets' coach passed information on Glenn's injury to
Miami coach Jimmy Johnson a few weeks back.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't really matter at this point. But it suggests that the
Patriots are looking for answers for their malaise everywhere but
Foxborough.

THOMAS: GOOD TRY, BAD ANKLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Henry Thomas hurt so bad he could barely
put his legs into his pants as he was dressing in the Patriots
locker room following Sunday's 13-10 loss to the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year veteran, who has sprained and re-sprained his right
ankle, played virtually the entire game. After playing right tackle
much of this season, Thomas went back to his old position of nose
tackle with both Chad Eaton and Mark Wheeler out of action because
of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas blamed himself for the Bills being able to run up the
middle as well as they did. Buffalo gained 213 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some miscommunication and I take the blame for
that,'' said Thomas. ``I was overzealous on the play side on a
couple of those plays. I made bonehead plays like I had never
played there in my life. I just overread it and left the middle
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Thomas, who has been around the NFL for more than a decade,
was stunned by the Patriots' growing casualty list.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new twist for me,'' said Thomas. ``We certainly gave
it a great effort, but it was going to take a stupendous effort to
win and we didn't do that. I know that nobody is going to quit on
this team, but the only thing that would bode well for us right now
is victories. We can't give in to good efforts. We have to find a
way to win the rest of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots used Ferric Collons at one end, Willie McGinest at
the other. Four plays into the game, McGinest reaggravated his
groin injury and was done for the day. Greg Spires moved into
McGinest's spot. Chris Sullivan started inside along with Thomas.
At one point, rookie Leonta Rheams was in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point it got a little confusing, but for the most part
everybody knew where they were supposed to be and they did a good
job,'' Thomas said.

NONE OF TOP 5 LOOKS LIKE NO. 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Does anyone deserve to be No. 1 in college football?
Consider what happened over the weekend:
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Tennessee was basically beaten at home by Arkansas until
Razorbacks quarterback Clint Stoerner stumbled after taking a snap
in the final minutes of a game in which Arkansas blew a 21-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Stoerner stumble, he fumbled _ without being
touched. A minute later, Tennessee's Travis Henry dived into the
end zone for the winning touchdown in a remarkable 28-24 Vol
victory.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Kansas State turned the ball over five times against a
Nebraska team that was playing without its starting quarterback and
tailback, but hung on for a 40-30 win (more about that later).
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 UCLA didn't get one touchdown pass from Heisman Trophy
hopeful quarterback Cade McNown but still beat Washington, 36-24.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4. Florida and No. 5 Florida State had a couple of dull
efforts in beating hapless South Carolina and Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing a computer is going to help pick the teams
that will play for the national title in the Fiesta Bowl, because
if this were left up to the writers and coaches, the argument over
who's No. 1 and No. 2 probably would last until Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   How good is Kansas State? Hard to say. The Wildcats were good
enough to beat their first tough opponent of the season in
Nebraska. But this is a banged-up, young Nebraska team that has
lost three regular-season games for the first time since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State may have gotten past Nebraska, beating the Huskers
for the first time since 1968, but Missouri is waiting in Columbia
next week. Despite their 17-14 loss to Texas A&AMP;M Saturday, the
Tigers made it clear they are ready for the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to go against K-State right now,'' said Missouri
safety Caldrinoff Easter. ``We're going to put our hard hats on and
go after it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How do the oddsmakers do it? Kansas State was established as the
favorite over Nebraska, with the point spread at about 10 1/2. The
Wildcats led by 4 with time winding down when Huskers quarterback
 &UR; Eric Crouch &LR;  fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was picked up by linebacker  &UR; Jeff Kelly &LR; , who ran 23
yards to the 1-foot line before being pushed out of bounds _ or at
least that's the way it appeared on instant replay. But the
officials didn't see it that way, signaling a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Wildcats were up by 10 and bettors from Scituate to the
Strip in Vegas were nervous as can be. A simple extra point by the
best kicker in college football,  &UR; Martin Gramatica &LR; , could mean a
lot of money won or lost.
</P>
<P>
   But no. With the crowd surging near the field and the goal posts
swaying, Kansas State quarterback  &UR; Michael Bishop &LR;  took a knee on
the extra point attempt. So did all those bettors who took Kansas
State and gave the points.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team no one wants to play right now is Michigan. The
Wolverines are on an unbelievable roll. Their 27-10 win over
Wisconsin was their eighth straight and they are blowing teams
away. In handing Wisconsin its first loss, the Wolverines held
running back  &UR; Ron Dayne  &LR; to 53 yards rushing, which tied his
third-lowest total. A win over Ohio State next week will give the
Wolverines their second straight Rose Bowl appearance ... Poor
Temple. Just when the Owls showed the barest sign of life under
first-year coach  &UR; Bobby Wallace &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Auburn had the audacity to ask
permission to talk to Wallace about the vacancy created when  &UR; Terry
Bowden  &LR; quit last month. ``I explained that I was talking to
Auburn,'' said Wallace, a former Auburn assistant who won three
national titles at North Alabama before coming to Temple this
season. ``But my heart was still with my players.'' Gee, Bobby.
Considering the Owls' 42-7 loss to Miami, it didn't seem to work
too well Saturday ... Saturday was a nice day for quarterbacks from
Kentucky. Look at the numbers posted by Kentucky's  &UR; Tim Couch  &LR; and
Louisville's  &UR; Chris Redman &LR; . The pair combined for 11 touchdown
passes and 1,084 yards while completing 88 of 109 passes. That's a
good season for some QBs ... Someone finally figured a way to shut
down Air Force. In Saturday's WAC showdown, Wyoming held the
Falcons, who had scored 30 or more points in every game this
season, to 10. The problem was that Wyoming only managed to score
3. ... Cheers to Cincinnati, which finally won, outshooting
Houston, 44-43, in a game that produced 1,044 yards of offense ...
Duke quarterback  &UR; Bobby Campbell  &LR; had the longest day of his
career, throwing seven interceptions in a 42-35 loss to Maryland
... They're celebrating in Starkville this morning. Missisippi
State's 26-14 win over Alabama marked the first time since 1914
that the Bulldogs won their third straight over the Tide.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the postseason is not a possibility for Boston College,
some postseason honors are within reach. Take running back  &UR; Mike
Cloud &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who could earn some mention on All-America teams. Other
than Texas running back  &UR; Ricky Williams &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has had a better
year running the ball than Cloud? With 179 yards and one touchdown
in the Eagles' 23-15 win over Pittsburgh Saturday, Cloud has 1,547
yards on the season, a Big East record ... The Eagles can salvage
some positives from this season if they can win their season finale
at West Virginia. A good subplot will be Cloud vs.  &UR; Amos
Zereoue &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a matchup of the two most prolific single-season rushers
in Big East history ... UCLA's victory over Washington may put the
Bruins in line for a Rose Bowl berth, which would normally be cause
for celebration. But this year the Bruins don't want to be in
Pasadena Jan. 1. They would rather be playing in Tempe in the
Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4 for the national championship ... Kentucky's
game with Tennessee this Saturday will have less significance than
it did a day ago. The Wildcats were struck by tragedy early Sunday
morning when a truck carrying two players on a deer-hunting trip
flipped over, killing defensive lineman  &UR; Arthur Steinmetz &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
was sitting out the season after transferring from Michigan State,
and seriously injuring starting center  &UR; Jason Watts &LR;  ... Say this
about the Syracuse Orangemen: They play exciting games. Just when
their fans were ready to bury them after what looked like a loss to
Virginia Tech, quarterback  &UR; Donovan McNabb  &LR; came up with a magic
play, hitting tight end  &UR; Stephen Brominski  &LR; with a 13-yard
touchdown pass on the last play of the game for a stunning 28-26
victory over the No. 16 Hokies that keeps Syracuse in the hunt for
the Big East title ... Cheers for Division 3 Mount Union, which
beat Baldwin-Wallace Saturday for its 38th straight win, a Division
3 record.

GRANT KNOWS JUST HOW GOOD JONES CAN BE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. _ The last thing Otis Grant needed Saturday
night was a brave referee.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that's what Arthur Mercante Sr. turned out to be,
to the everlasting discomfort of Grant's face, his fans, and his
faculties.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 rounds the World Boxing Organization middleweight
champion tried to find a way to do something with light heavyweight
champion Roy Jones Jr. and the best he could come up with was to
take unending shots in the face or under the rib cage and press on.
</P>
<P>
   This led to the inevitable. It led to a nasty welt under his
left eye that began to puff like an adder's neck and to two
knockdowns, both of which came with such lightning speed that Grant
went down with such force his feet rolled up over his head.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases he got up, but the second time he was driven to
the floor again seconds later just as the bell ending the 10th
round sounded. As it did, Grant's longtime trainer, Russ Anber,
threw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   These days the towel signifies nothing in boxing. Once it was
the universal white flag of surrender but no more. So Mercante
kicked it back out, insisting Grant could go on.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Anber would not be dissuaded. His opinion was
that the World Boxing Association and World Boxing Council titles
Jones owns were not worth the damage his fighter was taking to try
and win them and so he insisted Otis Grant would not be coming out
for round 11 for a very good reason _ he simply couldn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he needed to put on a Rocky Balboa show,'' Anber
said of the fighter he has handled since Grant was 13. ``Roy proved
without a shadow of a doubt he is the best pound-for-pound fighter
on the planet Earth today. I didn't need to have my man flattened
to figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Mercante did, but few others required that kind of
affirmation of Jones's superiority. Grant had alluded to it even
before the fight, in the days prior to the sounding of the first
bell.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was over in three minutes, although technically Jones
(34-1) needed 10 rounds to beat back Grant's challenge. By the time
Anber had made his position known, his fighter had landed a grand
total of 66 punches, an average of 6.6 a round. Of those, one was a
jab. One out of the 137 he threw. As percentages go, that was about
as slim a margin as possible without pitching a shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't reach him with my jab,'' Grant (37-2-1) said. ``It
fell short. I only caught him a couple times. It was a helpless
feeling but credit Roy. The stuff we thought would work with him
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because while Grant was landing 27 percent of his 248
punches, Jones was peppering him, landing 44 percent of the 392 he
threw. From start to finish, Jones did whatever he wanted. At times
that was to pummel poor Grant with body shots and some stinging
combinations. Other times it was to give him a break, rather than a
broken nose.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Grant seemed in trouble, Jones would cool his jets,
cutting back on his assault for a round before opening up again.
One time, the lull reached the point where Mercante stepped in and
ordered Jones to pick up the pace, which made you wonder what he
had against Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to punish a guy unless I have to,'' Jones said.
``If you're here to brutalize a guy, you shouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was there to make $2 million and to showcase his vast
array of skills, skills his proponents contend have made him the
best fighter in the world. But just before he appeared, another
fighter stepped in to make his own case.
</P>
<P>
   International Boxing Federation lightweight champion Shane
Mosley preceded Jones and battered former super featherweight
champion James Leija for nine rounds before Leija's corner also
decided their man had had enough and surrendered with their fighter
slumped in his corner. By then, Mosley had dropped Leija (37-4-2)
three times, cut his left eyebrow, and dominated him so completely
that when the fight was stopped, Leija's promoter, Lester Bedford,
asked an HBO executive, ``Did the kid do enough to come back
against somebody human?''
</P>
<P>
   He did, but he won't be back as soon as Mosley, who will sign a
seven-fight deal with HBO this week. That adds the best lightweight
in the world to a star-studded HBO stable that includes Jones,
Mosley (30-0), WBC heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, welterweight
champion Oscar De La Hoya, featherweight champion Prince Naseem
Hamed, up-and-coming David Reid, and Angel Manfredy, plus a host of
boxers promoted by Dino Duva and Cedric Kushner.
</P>
<P>
   Of all of them, three are battling for recognition as best in
the world _ Jones, Mosley, and De La Hoya. Although cases can be
made for each, Jones was adamant about his choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the man, I'm best in the world,'' Jones said. ``I do what
I have to do to win. That's just me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone might agree with that but he'll get no fight from
Otis Grant. At least not anymore.

UNDERGROUND BASE IN COLORADO AVOIDS MILITARY DOWNSIZING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL TAYLOR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ It feels like the world's largest bomb
shelter _ a complex of nearly five acres, carved deep in the belly
of a mountain and accessible only by a craggy rock tunnel and a
series of 25-ton blast doors.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Cheyenne Mountain are 15 buildings, each one clad in
steel almost a half-inch thick. The buildings sit on 1,319 coil
springs, each about five feet tall, originally designed to allow
these windowless structures to sway and bounce in the event of an
earthquake or a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the threat of a multimegaton bomb, launched from
manned bombers, has largely passed. And so at first glance,
Cheyenne Mountain seems, near the end of the 20th century, like the
ultimate waste of Pentagon money _ a Cold War relic, waiting for an
attack from an obsolete enemy.
</P>
<P>
   But while Navy bases and Army posts around the nation have been
shutting their doors with an almost military regularity _ the huge
presence in the Bay Area is almost gone _ Cheyenne Mountain and a
collection of several other bases in Colorado Springs have found a
way to maintain their importance in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheyenne Mountain complex, which opened in 1966, is home to
the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Like a glimpse
backward at ``Dr. Strangelove,'' NORAD's elaborate computers serve
as the eyes and ears of the defense and space establishment,
keeping track of missiles and spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Yes, we've had this question before,'' says Army Major
Michael Birmingham, the spokesman for Cheyenne Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; But it turns out that Cheyenne Mountain is not just another
Cold War anachronism. In fact,  &LR; But its mission is as up to the
minute as the defense-and-space establishment can get, even if
their missile-seeking satellites are 30 years old. In addition to
watching out for ICBMs, Cheyenne Mountain keeps track of more than
8,200 satellites, along with the flotsam from 40 years of rocketry
that now constitutes a huge orbiting pile of space junk.
</P>
<P>
   When the space shuttle goes up on a mission, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration first checks with NORAD to get
a safe launch window so the craft doesn't run into a piece of
orbiting hardware.
</P>
<P>
   NORAD also keeps track of all aircraft flying in and out of
North America and, to that end, is lending a hand in the fight
against airborne drug-smuggling; and it detects missiles launched
in various theaters of war around the globe _ Cheyenne Mountain was
the first to ``see'' Iraq's Scud launches in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the military's harshest critics say that Cheyenne
Mountain is one of the stars of the dwindling stock of defense
installations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an age of (base) close-downs and obsolescence, this is the
one that earns its keep,'' says John Pike of the Federation of
American Scientists in Washington. ``There are an awful lot of
bases that are completely superfluous, and this isn't one of them.
It would be on a very short list of a dozen or so places that
probably won't ever close because you always want to know what's
going on out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And having a robust military presence is good for Colorado
Springs. More than 40 percent of the economy of this city of
345,000 ``can be attributed directly to the Department of
Defense,'' says Bill Croom, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel
who is the liaison between the city's Chamber of Commerce and the
military installations.
</P>
<P>
   Just south of town is Fort Carson, an Army post of more than
18,000 troops spread out over 376,000 acres. Carson is headquarters
to the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 10th Special Forces
Group, among other units, and next year will house the headquarters
for the National Guard organizations of Oklahoma, Arkansas and
Oregon. Fort Carson has another 236,000 acres about 150 miles
southeast of Colorado Springs it uses to train troops.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Colorado Springs airport, Peterson Air Force Base has
10,000 troops and is headquarters for the U.S. Space Command and
the Air Force Space Command. East of Colorado Springs is Schriever
Air Force Base, with 4,000 people, and about 15 miles north of the
city is the Air Force Academy, with 4,000 cadets and 6,000 faculty
and staff.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  On a recent weekend, the hotels were filled and fighter jets
crisscrossed the skies over the Air Force Academy football stadium
as the town geared up for the annual joust with the Naval Academy.
It's a military town _ or, at least, as military as a town gets in
this age of downsizing. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Base closing has become such an emotional issue,'' Croom
says, ``and any time you tell a town this is going to happen, it
goes through shock, denial, anger _ the typical human reaction.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But  &LR; Colorado Springs saw base-closings coming long before
anyone else, and, Croom says, ``because of this, we raised $500,000
(for lobbying) and presented the Colorado Springs case in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is that while Fort Carson is occasionally threatened,
everything else in Colorado Springs appears to be safe because the
Air Force, the predominant service here, is geared almost entirely
toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of what makes Cheyenne Mountain such a contradiction
a Cold War facility that evolved into ``Star Wars'' technology, all
inside a granite mountain millions of years old.
</P>
<P>
   When you are in the tunnel, heading for that cluster of 15
buildings, moisture seeps from the rock and is soaked up by acres
of soft white sheeting material hung from the ceiling, looking much
like a Christo sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Protruding from the rock faces are 115,000 ``rock bolts,'' from
six to 32 feet long, that are periodically tightened to prevent a
cave-in.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, the mountain is powered by electricity it buys
from Colorado Springs. But come doomsday, they can button this
place up in about half an hour, switch on the six 1,750-kilowatt
generators and support a full crew of 800 people _ food, water,
cots _ for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Cheyenne Mountain's reservoirs, hollowed from the rock, hold 6
million gallons of water and another half-million of diesel fuel.
The ventilation system filters out nuclear, chemical and biological
agents. Communications go through two blast-hardened microwave
antennas and two underground coaxial cables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything here is geared to 30 minutes, which is the time it
takes for an ICBM to come over from the Soviet Union,'' said Air
Force Colonel Gary Shugart, Cheyenne Mountain chief of staff,
perhaps unintentionally referring to the mountain's original
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none ever has, and the missile ``burns'' that the
NORAD officers do see on their screens denote routine Russian
missile tests.
</P>
<P>
   In the command center is a room not much bigger than a large
living room, separated by glass, and studded with video screens
showing the position of satellites and the odd missile launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Hollywood made that movie, `War Games,' they came here
and looked at the war room, and they left disappointed,'' Shugart
says. ``It wasn't big enough. So they went home and did their own
giant cavern that had little to do with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   But what of the reality of the Russian military machine, widely
perceived as having fallen on hard times, just like the rest of the
country? Some defense experts worry that Russia's missile apparatus
is now so poorly maintained that a glitch in a Russian computer
could easily send an ICBM mistakenly streaking for California. The
glitch problem is compounded by the year 2000 problem, and no one
knows what may happen if a missile-delivery computer thinks it's
1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main concern right now is from a Russian launch,'' Pike
says. ``Since the Russians stopped collecting taxes, they got
behind in paying people, and a lot of their hardware is not
maintained as well as you'd like it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, senior U.S. defense experts contend that the
one thing Russia is not scrimping on is its missile system.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Russian military is decaying, the thing that looks
fully funded is their Strategic Rocket Force,'' says retired Air
Force General James McCarthy, now a professor of national security
at the Air Force Academy.

DEMOCRATS: A PARTY SO HAPPY IT COULD BURST 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were cheers in the White House when this year's election
returns came in. Across Capitol Hill and across the nation,
Democrats seized on the results _ five new seats in Congress, the
toppling of some of the nation's most conservative senators, a few
gains across the South _ as if they were the first signs of spring.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was, in retrospect, peculiar, for two reasons: The
first is that the Democratic Party has arguably not undergone the
kind of rejuvenation that some of its leaders discerned in the
results of Nov. 3. And the second is, even if it has, there are
good reasons why its leaders might not want to get too excited
about it.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one recurring lesson in U.S. politics over the past
decade, it is that few things are more hazardous than success.
Politicians are forever ignoring history, claiming mandates that
voters never intended and then paying a price for their
miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   It took President Clinton almost two years to recover from his
failed effort to persuade Congress to adopt a national health care
plan, inspired by the exuberant reaction the idea got when he
broached it in New Hampshire in 1992. The seeds of House Speaker
Newt Gingrich's demise were planted when he and the Republicans won
control of Congress in 1994 and confidently proceeded to overplay
their hand.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Clinton in 1992 and Gingrich in 1994, the
Democrats have clutched at a slender reed this time: Clinton and
Gingrich defeated real opponents, while the Democrats merely beat
expectations, doing better than the Republicans said they would.
Still, Democrats across the country were talking last week about a
new, post-Gingrich political paradigm: the decline of the right and
the ascendancy of a new Democratic center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the Democrats, are changed for the next decade, for the
better _ It took us 10 years to learn the lesson,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who upset Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in one of
the contests that most cheered the party.
</P>
<P>
   Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a
centrist group closely identified with Clinton, described the vote
as nothing short of a political coming of age. ``The Clinton-New
Democrat redefining of the center has finally taken hold,'' he
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take another election cycle or two to judge
whether From and Schumer are correct about the ideological remaking
of their party.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic leaders, however, have a different
interpretation of the election. And the contrasting views augur a
resurgence of the ideological dissension that Clinton managed to
quiet in 1992 to become president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Clinton took advantage of the fact that the Democrats
had been out of the White House since 1980 and were thus starved
for victory. He could largely ignore liberal Democratic
constituencies and move to the center, where, as he liked to say
back then, elections are won. Gingrich's success in 1994 helped
silence the Democrats' liberal wing again: In that atmosphere of
Republican triumph, it was hard to persuasively argue that the path
back to power was on the left.
</P>
<P>
   But last week it was possible to argue just that. In an
interview, the Rev. Jesse Jackson declared, with considerable
justification, that the Democratic Party had succeeded because its
traditional constituents _ blacks, women, union members _ had come
back to the polls. The election was proof, Jackson said, in a swipe
at Clinton and his supporters, that the party had made a mistake
with what he described as the ``push away from labor, push away
from blacks'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, we put all our players back on the field again _
labor, women, blacks, Hispanics, businesses that have benefited
from growth _ and with our full team we won,'' said Jackson. He
added that he was thinking about running for president again. And
he said he would push the party to embrace universal health care
and to funnel money from criminal justice into school construction.
``I intend between now and the year 2000 to force the party
leadership to come to grips with those issues,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who have been trying to moderate their party's course
and who took the election as a testament to their success said they
were unconcerned by such remarks. Still, it was clear from their
comments last week that they would like to avoid a reprise of the
Democratic infighting that has buoyed Republicans in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our constituencies are all too familiar with the liabilities
of being out of office,'' said William Carrick, a Democratic
consultant based in Los Angeles. ``They would much prefer to be
somewhat disappointed by office holders occasionally than be in
love with a bunch of people who weren't in office.''
</P>
<P>
   From, who has enjoyed less than warm relations with Jackson over
the years, said: ``I just don't see a constituency for massive
spending. It doesn't mean people aren't going to be out there
calling for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The display of Democratic self-confidence _ some Democrats are
even predicting the party will take back the House in 2000 _ would
be risky even if the party had enjoyed an extraordinarily
successful election night. But it did not. The Republicans continue
to control both houses of Congress. They hold most governorships.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Democrats the outlook for the 2000 Presidential
election isn't all that great. The Democrats' main contender, Vice
President Al Gore, is, like Clinton, under investigation for
campaign finance abuses, an inquiry that shows no sign of going
away anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the scrutiny means that Gore is unlikely to
reprise some of the more innovative, and effective, methods the
Clinton White House came up with to raise and spend money in the
1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And both Gore and his main rival, House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, are familiar figures in U.S. politics by now _ perhaps
too familiar to voters ready for a change.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Democrats are taking heart from exceedingly modest
gains. They managed not to slip below 40 seats in the Senate and
give the Republicans a filibuster-proof majority. While they won a
gubernatorial election in California, they lost in Texas, Florida,
Illinois, Michigan and New York.
</P>
<P>
   And Democratic gains this time came largely because of
Republican missteps. It was the Republicans, after all, who allowed
expectations to rise so high that even a modest Democratic showing
was portrayed as a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't notice this election as having been notable _ except
notable for how much the Republicans overestimated,'' said Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the Republicans who decided, at the last minute, to
shift the focus to Clinton's morals. That was, even Republicans now
say, a political miscalculation of the highest order. ``The joke
here is that Republicans tried to turn it into a referendum on the
president, and the president won,'' said Republican consultant
Stuart Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Stevens was speaking, Republicans were pushing ahead
with impeachment proceedings in Washington. ``The Republicans seem
to be digging themselves in ever deeper,'' said historian Arthur M.
Schlesinger Jr. ``I would think the one thing they learned from the
election is it is a great mistake to extend the impeachment
process. But they seem to have the bit between their teeth on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, then it might not matter how much
skirmishing the Democrats do in their moment of almost-victory. The
Republicans might help them out again.

DISCOMBOBULATED COWBOYS HOLD OFF PRECOCIOUS CARDS
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The last 30 minutes, the Dallas Cowboys would say
after the 35-28 survival, were all a gulp and a blur.
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders limping. Jake Plummer scrambling. Charlie Williams
just trying to show he belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Fights in the grandstands. Frank Sanders reaching to snatch
yet-another pass. Kevin Smith, up to his posterior in alligators
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough. It was crazy,'' said safety Darren Woodson, who
had a swirling, dizzying, front-row seat. ``We just couldn't
believe the tide had turned that much.''
</P>
<P>
   True, the Cowboys had all but blown a robust,
certain-to-be-NFL-head-turning 28-point lead. Players were wounded.
The pass rush was nil. Coverages were discombobulated.
</P>
<P>
   But with three seconds left in the game, the Cowboys' Kevin
Smith knew. He just knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming after me,'' the cornerback remembered telling
himself.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't have to belong, of course, to the Psychic Defensive
Backs Hotline to have figured that out. All season long, opposing
quarterbacks have looked upon Smith as an amply stocked cookie jar,
to be plundered whenever the urge strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer is nobody's fool. A fade pass to the end zone in Smith's
direction on the final play of the game was likely to produce (a) a
game-tying touchdown, or (b) a defensive pass-interference call.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were complaining about interference all day long, every
time there was an incompletion, trying to put it in the officials'
heads,'' Smith lamented.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a flag on the last play, I guess, would have been
predictable. Yet, it would have been unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals beefed. It was the thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referee should be under investigation for that call,''
linebacker Jamir Miller barked.
</P>
<P>
   But as the intended receiver, Rob Moore, said, reluctantly,
``The biggest thing is that the official was right there. So if he
felt it wasn't a flag, then it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a close call, but we didn't get it ... so I have to
live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Over in the Cowboys' locker room, the final play drew only
lukewarm debate. The only true steam was coming out of the showers,
where the NFC East leaders couldn't dress fast enough to get to the
waiting team plane.
</P>
<P>
   In a championship season, you live and you learn. You slay the
dragons and you dodge the roadside sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no lessons from this one,'' Woodson said. ``It's a
win. That's all you take from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my credit goes to Jake Plummer and their offense. They
never quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson was already dressed. It was like the Ralph Neely line
from the Cowboys vs. Chargers, 1972, a similar, 34-28
survival-fest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quick, start the plane before they score again,'' Neely said.
</P>
<P>
   Once they, too, were sheep. Now the Cardinals have a roar.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Cowboys had not seen a quarterback like Plummer,
not one disposed to launch 56 passes (completing 31 for 465 yards),
not one who could so consistently elude their whiff of a pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of scripting alibis for the visitors, they also were
banged up. Smith had an injured shoulder that made it painful for
him to bump receivers coming off the line. Sanders played only
briefly in the second half and was last spotted limping through the
locker room wearing a big fluffy slipper on one foot and a red
alligator-skin shoe on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole game changed when Deion went out,'' Woodson
correctly said. ``It made us a totally different team. It was tough
on us. We had to make adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Some adjusted. Some didn't. The aforementioned Williams was
scorched for two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys survived. The verdict should not be taken
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, this is the NFL,'' defensive coordinator Dave Campo said.
``Not every game is going to be 13-12.''
</P>
<P>
   The least-scored-upon defense in the league had just been
thrashed for 465 yards in the air and had nearly set a franchise
record for largest lead squandered in one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Cardinals grumbled after flags that didn't get
thrown, the Cowboys sought the big picture _ namely, that last year
there is no way they would have held on and won this game.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's end was a blur. Cardinals charging officials. Cowboys
sprinting for exits. Kevin Smith, with a wince, half-expecting to
see a flag that never came.
</P>
<P>
   The precocious Cardinals roared, but the Cowboys never broke.
</P>
<P>
   That means something, it says here.

DEFENSE, NOT IRVIN'S SHUTOUT SHOULD BE TEAM'S CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Michael Irvin smiled. If it was forced, he
wouldn't have been alone in a winning locker room where the
prevailing postgame mood was extremely low-voltage and certainly
lacking in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy . . . we won,'' said Irvin, who along the offensive
way Sunday saw his club-record streak of consecutive games with a
reception end at 117.
</P>
<P>
   Figure this:
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Dallas Cowboys were at their most productive
best: five red-zone trips, five touchdowns. It was the top show of
the season. The top in several seasons. But it almost wasn't enough
to beat the Arizona Cardinals, and it wasn't enough for Irvin to
make even a one-catch contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Still wearing a smile, Irvin sounded not miffed, but a tad hurt
when he said: ``You work a lot of years to build something, and
then you lose it without even having an opportunity to make a play.
I guess that's the one regret.''
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly not the only regret for the Cowboys. There were
many more, all of them on defense. In an incredible afternoon on
several fronts, the Cowboys survived a frantic rally from young
Jake Plummer, and in the end were hanging by fingernails to beat
the Cardinals, 35-28.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL standings, the victory kept the Cowboys unbeaten
against divisional foes and now basically uncatchable in the NFC
East. Plus, at 7-3, they remain in the chase for home-field
consideration in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Dallas defensive collapse was so severe (leads
of 28-0 and 35-14 were unsafe), the victory was rather hollow. Only
questionable judgment by a referee in the end zone _ he failed to
call pass interference on the game's final play _ kept the Cowboys
out of possible overtime and, yes, a very possible loss.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, coach Chad Gailey tried to play up the angle of ``it
feels great to win,'' but even he would later backtrack a bit.
Asked if it were a bittersweet victory, Gailey paused and said:
``It does kinda feel that way, but I hate to get bent out of shape
right now about it. It's best to take the victory, and then go home
and start to evaluate what happened, and get to work fixing it.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty on defense to fix. But worse yet for a
first-year head coach would be any boat-rocking from a team leader
like Irvin. It is a fact that Irvin's role in the offense has not
been prominent of late, and then Sunday came the shutout on
receptions. Actually, the Cowboys threw to Irvin only once, an
unsuccessful slant late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the offense couldn't have been better for
most of Sunday. In Gailey's offensive philosophy, the star-system
is not necessarily in place.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Aikman threw only 18 passes, as the running game was
featured. Aikman made the most of his chances, hitting 14,
including 13 consecutive at one time. The biggest of the game was a
42-yard beauty to Billy Davis in the third quarter that set up the
Cowboys' fifth touchdown. At the time, Arizona was starting to
roll, having cut the lead to 28-14.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis said after the game he was bothered by Irvin not being
involved in the offensive process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense played well for the most part, but when Mike is a
part of it, we're that much better,'' he said. ``We've got to get
him involved some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased the offense continues to grow and that today we
cashed in with touchdowns,'' he said. ``But Michael means so much
to us. I still say that will come. We are an offense that wants to
develop a lot of weapons, but Michael remains the biggest weapon.
And the other teams know that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Aikman also considers 18 pass attempts extremely low,
but he added, ``What we were doing worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin appeared to take the same approach. And at the moment,
Irvin deserves credit for the way he has handled the whole scene.
His famous sideline antics of the past few years are long gone. And
after the game, there was no pouting. More than anything, this is a
show of respect for Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone handed me a stat sheet and I saw Michael didn't have a
catch _ I was shocked,'' Gailey said. ``We threw to a lot of people
today and scored a lot of points, and I couldn't believe Michael
didn't have a catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Even stranger, the long-awaited offensive breakthrough came
Sunday without Irvin being a factor. That, of course, can and will
change. The new worry is what to do about the Dallas defense.

COWBOYS' HURT SECONDARY HUNG ON FOR DEAR LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ On the last gut-wrenching play, with his defense
a mere 5 yards from blowing the biggest lead in Dallas Cowboys
history, all Dave Campo could do was send in the defensive
formation and cover his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't bear to watch,'' said Campo, the Cowboys' defensive
coordinator. ``I just looked at our guys on the sidelines to see
what their reaction would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Three cheers for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Their injury-riddled secondary had allowed Cardinals quarterback
Jake Plummer to pass for 465 yards and three touchdowns. But when
cornerback Kevin Smith kept Rob Moore from coming down with the
last-gasp pass in the end zone, the giddy Cowboys ran off the field
Sunday with a 35-28 victory against the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who once trailed 28-0, got back in the game by
taking advantage of injuries to Cowboys cornerbacks. Smith suffered
a slightly separated shoulder in the second quarter and competed in
the second half, ``unable to play bump-and-run coverage like I'm
supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders missed much of the second half after spraining a
big toe in the first quarter. This forced Campo to play Charlie
Williams at the other cornerback position.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer relentlessly attacked this alignment and had 314 yards
passing in the second half. Williams allowed touchdown passes to
Frank Sanders and Rob Moore, and was called for defensive holding
on another series that led to a Cardinals touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sanders wound up with career-high 11 receptions for 190
yards. And Plummer's yardage total was the second-highest ever
against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my injury, they had the freedom to do some things on the
corner,'' said Sanders, who didn't return until the last two
minutes of the game. ``When I left the game, they went to that
corner. Let's be honest. The first half wasn't like the second
half.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cardinals looked out of it when they took the ball at
their own 20 with 52 seconds remaining. But Plummer _ who Sanders
called ``a young Fran Tarkenton'' _ wasn't done. He completed a
58-yard pass to Rob Moore that got the Cardinals down to the
Cowboys' 5-yard line. The play looked like a sure touchdown, but
Kenny Wheaton, who had slipped in coverage on the pass, ran Moore
down at the 5 with 11 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and George (Teague) had great coverage but it was
underthrown and (Moore) took George's momentum and pushed him to
get the ball,'' said Wheaton, who had missed a tackle on Adrian
Murrell's 7-yard touchdown reception on the previous series. ``I
just couldn't let him get in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see (Wheaton),'' Moore said. ``I saw Eric Metcalf
make a block, so I figured I was in the end zone. Then at the last
second, I saw a guy flash in my periphery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had three chances to score from the Cowboys' 5.
But they fell short. Smith provided the last defensive stand when
Plummer's jump pass to Moore fell incomplete off Smith's back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were going to throw the flag, but when I looked
around, there was not a flag on the ground,'' Smith said. ``But it
is over with. We won the game and that's all that matters.''

UPDATE HOLIDAY TRADITIONS BY DOWNLOADING TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Thanksgiving brings on the year-end holiday season, those of
us possessed of at least one scintilla of tradition begin
anticipating all the customary private and public holiday
practices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, family traditions _ like families _ vary widely. For
instance, does any family beyond mine take part of Thanksgiving
afternoon to get rid of the last leftover Halloween candy by
hauling it into the back yard and _ using pitching- or sand-wedges
_ lofting it into various neighbors' yards? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I thought not. (What's wrong with you people? No spirit?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Public traditions, of course, are more broadly practiced than
our candy-chipping event. Entire neighborhoods, for instance, on
the day after Thanksgiving will leap into vans and SUVs and race to
the nearest shopping mall to buy Christmas presents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then these people try to get home in time to see the local TV
news, whose reporters, editors and anchors are so bereft of news
ideas they inevitably will devote a fair amount of time on that
particular Friday to what they will never fail to remind us is
``the biggest shopping day of the year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (In fact, I hereby dare local TV news crews across the country
to avoid this bozo story each year. If your viewers care about this
news they can read about it in their local newspapers because
newspaper reporters and editors generally are so bereft of news
ideas that they inevitably will devote a fair amount of space then
to what they will never fail to remind us is ``the biggest shopping
day of the year.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Repetition is another big holiday tradition in my family.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are lots of other private and public holiday
traditions, depending on whether one is celebrating Christmas,
Hanukkah, Kwanza, Ramadan or _ my personal favorite _ the Dec. 2
enunciation of the Monroe Doctrine, which this year will be 175
years old. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But whether the tradition is sugary foods, expensive presents,
songs sung by carolers or gaudy decorations, it's clear to me that
our customs have failed to keep up with modern times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our holiday traditions need to be digitized, optimized,
multi-mediaed and surge-protected. They should be cable-readied,
cellularized and hermetically sealed. They need to be updated so
they speak our new modular, magnetically swiped, universal
price-coded language. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should begin this reformation with the annual trek to
the supermarket that many people make to pick out a boulder-size
hunk of frozen dead turkey carcass. Oh, OK, putting ``dead'' and
``carcass'' in the same description is no doubt redundant, but so
is this annual ritual. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Can't we simply order a digitally pre-stuffed bird from some Web
site or other and have it downloaded to our freezer? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, as we do this, perhaps the whole family can gather around
the computer, share a cup of steaming instant wassail and have a
small, nonviolent competition to see who can be the first to find,
say, the Web site showing those nude pictures of Dr. Laura. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think of how much more modern we'd feel with this new tradition
than we do when we simply join the other hunter-gatherers at the
grocery store. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No more wreathes and lights on our houses. Instead, using the
latest technology, let's display decorated hologram trees on our
front yards. And so forth. Yes, what this country needs is a new
tradition or six. And I intend to start inventing more just as soon
as I finish cutting up all the calamari and tofu my family always
expects in the Thanksgiving turkey stuffing. &QL;
</P>
<P>

IRVIN'S STREAK COMES TO HALT AT 117 GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. AND KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The uneven victory against Arizona was even more
bittersweet for Dallas Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin, whose streak
of catching a pass in 117 consecutive games ended.
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated Irvin, who had only one pass thrown in his
direction, said the most important thing was that the team won.
Running back Emmitt Smith agreed, but said he had sympathy for his
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got 35 points and he doesn't have any catches,'' Smith
said. ``That's very surprising. I feel for him. I know he's
frustrated.'' LINE PLAY SOLID
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the game, injuries forced to Cowboys to play
first-year starters Mike Kiselak at center, Flozell Adams at right
guard, and Tony Hutson at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   But the line nevertheless held up against the Cardinals'
defensive line, allowing no sacks, and springing Smith for his
sixth 100-yard day of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Kiselak was starting in place of Clay Shiver. Adams has started
since early in the year. Hutson saw action Sunday when Erik
Williams sprained his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kept stepping in there and playing,'' Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey said of the club's replacements on offense and on
defense. ``That's a credit to our coaches and those guys for being
ready to play.'' ANOTHER 100 FOR SMITH
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith rushed 26 times for 118 yards, the sixth game this
season he has rushed for more than 100 yards. Smith passed Franco
Harris and is seventh on the all-time rushing list with 12,223
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also had three rushing touchdowns, giving him 127 for his
career and passing Jim Brown for third on the all-time list. He is
behind Marcus Allen and Jerry Rice. VIOLENT CROWD
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a while, it appeared some Cardinals fans
actually took exception to fans cheering for the Cowboys. Stadium
security was called to break up several fights in the stands. One
fight in the upper deck turned extremely violent and ended with a
fan being carried from Sun Devil Stadium on a stretcher. GAILEY'S
BAG OF TRICKS
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, known for his wide-open ways, showed Sunday he has a
little Barry Switzer in him, calling the option play twice in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, receiver Ernie Mills, lining up in the
backfield, took a hand off from quarterback Troy Aikman, veered
right and pitched the ball to Emmitt Smith for a 9-yard gain,
setting up the Cowboys' first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The second time, Mills kept the ball and ran for 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he brought the play with him from Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy by the name of the Kordell Stewart use to run it,''
Gailey said. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Aikman threw his 136th career touchdown pass to move in front
of Don Meredith into third place on the team's all-time list behind
Danny White and Roger Staubach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aikman completed 13 consecutive passes, one short of the team
record of 14 by Steve Pelleur.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cowboys nose guard Artie Smith was credited with a blocked
field goal on the miss by Cardinals kicker Joe Nedney in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Country Day School star Patrick Jeffers saw action in
the Cowboys' regular offense for the first time this season and
recorded his first career catch as a Cowboy. INJURY REPORT
</P>
<P>
   CB Deion Sanders (sprained left big toe) _ returned to game,
will be re-evaluated today.
</P>
<P>
   OT Erik Williams (sprained left knee) _ returned to game, will
be re-evaluated today.
</P>
<P>
   CB Kevin Smith (separated left shoulder) _ returned to game,
will be re-evaluated today.

TITLE IN HAND, AGGIES TURN TO LONGHORNS
</HEADLINE>
 12 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M football coach R.C. Slocum awoke Sunday knowing his
team's traditional regular-season finale against Texas would be
followed, for a second consecutive year, by a berth in the Big 12
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dec. 5 trip to St. Louis, said Slocum, must be placed in
proper perspective as the Aggies, ranked sixth in The Associated
Press media poll, prepare for a Nov. 27 game against No. 25 Texas
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll help some of our fans out with making their motel
reservations,'' Slocum said of the title game matchup against No. 2
Kansas State in St. Louis. ``It won't make a lot of difference to
us as coaches and players in terms of getting ready for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still a big, big game. We're going to have to win that
game for us to get accomplished what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   From a national standpoint, some of the luster was removed from
the A&AMP;M-Texas game when the Longhorns fell to Texas Tech, 42-35,
and were eliminated from the South Division race. A&AMP;M tight end Dan
Campbell said he actually spent Saturday night rooting for the
Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down, we wanted them to win so we could have the big
showdown in Austin,'' said Campbell, a Glen Rose native. ``You
don't get a chance to play in many games like that and it would be
nice for the state of Texas to have a big game that everyone in the
nation would watch, instead of just people within the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, like Slocum, predicted the Aggies will not suffer a
motivational dropoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we've taken care of our business, it's still a big
game for us,'' Campbell said. ``For an Aggie, your season isn't
complete unless you beat Texas.'' MOMENTUM TURNER
</P>
<P>
   Tech coach Spike Dykes credited a successful onside kick in the
third quarter against Texas with ``opening the floodgates'' for an
offense that had produced only four field goals on its first nine
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play after the recovery, quarterback Rob Peters hit
receiver Derek Dorris with a 44-yard touchdown strike, erasing a
14-12 deficit. Tech scored four touchdowns in its final seven
possessions, including all three of its fourth-quarter drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a mode where we needed a big momentum swing, and
that gave us a pretty good shot in the arm,'' Dykes said, adding
that it was a wrinkle added during the Red Raiders' open date.
EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Texas linebacker Anthony Hicks is doubtful for the A&AMP;M game
after suffering a strained knee on a crackback block against Tech.
The play resulted in a 15-yard penalty against the Red Raiders. ...
Oklahoma tailback De'Mond Parker, a junior who has topped the
1,000-yard rushing mark in each of his three seasons, has scheduled
a news conference tomorrow to announce whether he will return next
season or make himself available for the 1999 NFL draft.

STARS SAY OUTLOOK GOOD ON ZUBOV'S INJURY (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov had no swelling in his left
knee Sunday and likely sustained only minor damage from a hit he
received in Saturday's 3-1 victory against the Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov left the game in the second period after he collided
knee-to-knee with Bruins forward Dmitri Kristich. Zubov had a
magnetic-resonance-imaging exam on the injured knee Sunday, but
results are not expected to be available until Monday. After a
physical exam, trainer Dave Surprenant said he believes Zubov's
outlook is good.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' next game is Friday, so Zubov might not have to miss
a game, but Surprenant said he would withhold judgment until seeing
the MRI results.
</P>
<P>
   The play will be reviewed by the NHL, but Kristich's chances of
a suspension appear slim because Zubov wasn't seriouly injured and
Kristich does not have a reputation of making cheap hits. FULL REST
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he is giving his players three
days to recuperate after they played three big games in four
nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have some optionals, but not a full practice until
Wednesday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second five-day break between games of the young
season for the Stars and they follow it beginning Friday by playing
back-to-back games and five in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get in a rhythm right now, but what are you going
to do,'' Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``You just have to play
the schedule that they give you.'' RECORD-BREAKING
</P>
<P>
   In four of the past five games, the Stars have set franchise or
NHL records:
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 4 vs. San Jose Sharks _ Stars lose 4-0 while allowing only
nine shots. The nine shots allowed is the fewest in Stars franchise
history and the fewest shots allowed by a team in a losing effort
in NHL history. The five saves is the fewest in a game by any NHL
team.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 7 vs. LA Kings _ Tony Hrkac scores eight seconds into the
game, breaking the Stars' franchise record of 10 seconds, set in
1986 by Kent Nilsson.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 13 vs. Detroit Red Wings _ Nieuwendyk breaks Hrkac's record
by scoring seven seconds into the game. ``Hrkac let me hear about
that one,'' Nieuwendyk said.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 14 vs. Boston Bruins _ Brett Hull records his 1,000th NHL
point, making him and father Bobby (1,170 points) the only
father-son combination to each score 1,000 points.

RUNNER'S HOPES DASHED WHEN CHILD CROSSES HIS PATH
</HEADLINE>
 RUNNER-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Lake Worth cross-country runner Randy Todd
is a hero. Many might not realize it, especially those lucky enough
to have run in the state cross-country championships Saturday in
Round Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Todd should have been there. A three-time district champion, the
senior was on his way to qualifying in the Region II championship
Nov. 7 at Vandergriff Park in Arlington. Running strong in second
place and ready for the most grueling part of the race, the
unthinkable stopped Todd dead in his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him in the corner of my eye. I thought someone would
grab him,'' Todd said. ``Then he started to run, and I knew I was
going to hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   The rain was coming down hard and the course was sloppy when
Todd collided with a small child who wandered onto the course. The
young boy was no more than 3 or 4 years old, according to Todd and
eyewitness Bill Fuller, an avid cross-country fan and father of an
Aledo runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life. It was
wild,'' Fuller said. ``This little kid runs out in front of them, a
couple of the first runners were able to miss him. Randy had
nowhere to go. He slammed on his brakes and then stood there
protecting the kid. It was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller's friend was finally able to snatch the child off the
course. By then it was too late. Todd lost precious time and his
focus was shattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I hit the kid I felt really bad; all I could do was make
sure he wasn't going to get trampled on by the other runners,''
Todd said. ``What it did do was make me lose focus on the race./
</P>
<P>
   Todd finished 13th, three spots out of a state berth. He never
saw the child again or his parents. He was told the parents were
looking for him after the race, but Todd went home without an
apology _ or thank you _ and without an ever-elusive state berth.
He could have protested to race officials, but said: ``I don't want
to weasel my way into this. I just consider this a fact of life;
you just have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd, also the place-kicker on Lake Worth's playoff football
team, has hopes of attending the United States Naval Academy in
Annapolis, Md., next fall, where he wants to be a fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the perfect place for a hero.

<P>
   Five months in, the NBA lockout is proving more annoyance than
nightmare for the Dallas Mavericks' business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Club executives say only a handful of fans have canceled their
season tickets, with renewals running at more than 90 percent;
corporate sponsorships have held steady; and broadcast revenues _
thanks to contract guarantees _ continue to roll in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing well,'' said Terdema Ussery, Mavericks president
and chief executive offer.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest financial break the Mavericks and other NBA teams
have gotten is that they are being paid television rights money
even while arenas remain dark.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs recently received their first, regularly scheduled fee
payments for this season from their network broadcasting partners,
NBC and Turner Sports, for national television rights.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the payments are up-front loans, not grants: the
networks would be compensated for any games scheduled to be
broadcast that are canceled and not made up as TV games later in
the season.
</P>
<P>
   NBC does not air its first game until Christmas Day, so it might
not miss any games if the season starts by then. Its regular
schedule starts in earnest in January. NBC probably would not be
able to make up any TV games lost to a lockout because its weekend
sports schedule in the new year is full, a network official said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner had lost seven scheduled NBA telecasts through Friday, ,
and network officials said that a small number of games probably
could be made up with telecasts later in the season _ if there is a
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks also continue to earn revenues from their local TV
contract with Fox Sports Southwest on which 53 games were scheduled
for broadcast this season. Fox Sports executives wouldn't discuss
details of their payment arrangement with the Mavericks, but did
say the network won't end up paying for games that are not played.
</P>
<P>
   While the lockout hasn't cost the Mavericks any TV money yet, it
has meant millions of dollars in lost ticket and concessions
revenue from games that will not be played.
</P>
<P>
   Season ticketholders will receive refunds, plus 6 percent
interest, for tickets purchased to games not played. That might be
why only six people, Ussery said, have called to cancel their
season tickets because of the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were afraid there would be a lot more,'' Ussery said.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks officials said season-ticket sales, which won't be
tallied until the start of the season, appear on pace to at least
match last year's total of 8,600. More than 90 percent of last
year's season ticketholders have renewed their commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have lost no major corporate sponsors this year
and only ``three or four'' smaller corporate sponsors, Ussery said.
And those lost sponsors were not related to the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the normal course of business,'' Ussery said.
</P>
<P>
   The club has gained an equivalent number of new sponsors, he
added, offsetting the losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reaching out more than normal,'' Ussery explained.
``We're trying to assure (sponsors) that no matter what, they'll
get value for their money.''

ADD IT UP: BIG 12 BOWLS 'EM OVER
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout the Big 12 Conference, coaches and players are doing
the math.
</P>
<P>
   Seven teams have at least seven victories. The conference has
only six guaranteed bowl berths.
</P>
<P>
   Like panicked participants in a game of musical chairs, most are
fearful they will be the one left standing, cold and at home for
the holidays, when the music stops.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Texas Tech players, who were denied a postseason
appearance last year because of self-imposed sanctions by school
administrators, celebrated a 42-35 upset of No. 25 Texas like they
had won the state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't just another win,'' said Tech tailback Ricky
Williams. ``This was a major step toward ... going to a bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the Red Raiders (7-3, 4-3) crossed that bridge Oct.
10 when they ran their record to 6-0 and became the Big 12's first
bowl-eligible team. Scan the list of bowl games with open-ended
affiliations or ties to a league that will not fill all of its
allotted slots and you will find that there should be at least
eight available vacancies in the 1998 postseason.
</P>
<P>
   By filling one of those, the Big 12 would find destinations for
all of its bowl-eligible teams. Regardless of its identity, the Big
12's wild-card entry would be a state school with a large fan base
that has spent multiple weeks in the Top 25 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let a bowl guy do the math.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one from the Big 12 is going to be left out,'' said Bob
Gennarelli, assistant executive director of the Builders Square
Alamo Bowl, which matches a Big 12 team against a Big Ten opponent
Dec. 29. ``There's enough open slots to find a place for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But the unanswered question is who winds up where. Texas' loss
clouds the situation for Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl officials,
who like the idea of a Texas-Arkansas matchup Jan. 1. But they
don't like it well enough to invite a 7-4 team, which is what the
Longhorns would be with a Nov. 27 loss to No. 6 Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   By upsetting the Aggies, however, the Longhorns (7-3, 5-2)
probably punch their ticket for a date in Dallas. The Cotton Bowl
has first choice among Big 12 teams after the champion heads to the
Bowl Championship Series. If form holds and that team is Kansas
State, the Cotton Bowl could easily justify picking Texas over A&AMP;M
or Nebraska because the Longhorns would have beaten both the Aggies
(10-1, 7-0) and Cornhuskers (8-3, 4-3).
</P>
<P>
   If Texas falls, look for Nebraska to head to Dallas. A&AMP;M played
there last season and neither A&AMP;M administrators nor Cotton Bowl
officials are enamored with the idea of a repeat visit if other
options are available. Such thinking probably will push the Aggies
to the Culligan Holiday Bowl, Dec. 30 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Tech, in all likelihood, is bound for the Sanford Independence
Bowl, Dec. 31 in Shreveport, La. Most league insiders seem to
believe Independence Bowl officials will lean on the Red Raiders'
regional appeal to sell tickets, thereby freeing Colorado (7-3,
4-3) to be the team to fill a spot in a bowl not aligned with the
Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   Openings should be available in the Aloha, Oahu, Music City,
Motor City, Liberty and Las Vegas bowls, among others. But all is
subject to change until the final gun sounds in the final
conference championship game played on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Tech coach Spike Dykes declared it ``darned
important'' that his team notched victory No. 7 against Texas. By
doing so, the Red Raiders ended a three-game losing streak and put
themselves in position to finish 8-3 by knocking off struggling
Oklahoma (4-6, 2-5) in Saturday's regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   The more victories they accumulate, Dykes reasons, the better
their eventual bowl destination. He discussed the issue at length
Saturday with Pesky Hill, an Independence Bowl scout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about all the scenarios and he told me, `It's a
simple deal.' An hour and a half later, he was still talking,''
Dykes said. ``Finally, he said, `I guess it's really not all that
simple.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What is simple is this: Big 12 teams with 7-4 records will not
wind up home for the holidays. But they are advised to keep on
winning unless they want to ring in the new year fighting frostbite
in Boise, Idaho _ home of the Humanitarian Bowl. December wind
chills there can reach 50-below. And nobody wants to do the math on
that.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 15, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL-GENERAL &LR;  (Moved in `a' category.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   URBAN-SPRAWL-REVIEW (Seattle) _ On Election Day, voters from
California to New Jersey indicated that the urban sprawl
controversy is becoming a political force. Voters across the nation
and across party lines acted to stop the march of new malls, homes
and business parks and to tax themselves to buy open space as a
hedge against future development. By Timothy Egan.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REVIEW (Washington) _ A Capitol existentialist drama:
the public wants the drive to impeach President Clinton to end, as
do most House Democrats and many Republicans. Yet the Republicans
and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have such a strange
synergy that they just cannot seem to stop egging each other on and
on and on. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-SUCCESS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Should the Democrats be
rejoicing in their unexpectedly strong showing in the midterm
elections? If there is one recurring lesson in U.S. politics over
the past decade, it is that success can be dangerous. Politicians
are forever ignoring history and reading meaning into election
results that really aren't that significant, claiming mandates
voters never intended, and than paying a price for it. By Adam
Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-ADVERTISING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Today's ads seem larded with
unbridled cynicism. Liquor ads promote ``responsible drinking.''
Cigarette makers offer not only the surgeon general's warning on
every pack, but also, on company-run web sites, advice on quitting.
Health clubs run ads warning customers not to let a prudent
diet-and-exercise regime give way to anorexia or bulimia. Are these
ads meant to drive away potential customers? Of course not:
advertising agencies just want to talk the jaded, skeptical talk of
the '90s. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   FBI-TERROR-REVIEW (Washington) _ Many senior FBI agents have
misgivings about Attorney General Janet Reno's latest task force,
which is the second time she has ordered a broad investigation into
a conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence. They fear it could
drive the FBI closer to the ill-defined boundary separating
legitimate criminal inquiries from those into political causes and
unpopular ideas. By David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC-HOUSING-REVIEW (Undated) _ The new federal law to revive
the nation's troubled public housing contains a provision that
local officials warn could paralyze that effort: it requires cities
to mix working families with poorer families from project to
project. By Randy Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ALTERNATIVE-MEDICINE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is alternative medicine
getting a free ride? Studies that support the value of
alternative-medicine remedies are seen as less rigorous than those
conducted on conventional drugs and other medical treatments. By
Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  _ (Moved in `i' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-FILM-TITLES-REVIEW _ American movies are often retitled
overseas with more literal titles. But the results can be jarring,
especially in Chinese. ``Leaving Las Vegas'' became ``I'm Drunk and
You're a Prostitute.'' ``Field of Dreams'' was ``Imaginary Dead
Baseball Players Live in My Cornfield.'' ``The Crying Game'' was
``Oh No! My Girlfriend Has a Penis!'' ``Interview With the
Vampire'' became ``So, You Are a Lawyer.'' ``George of the Jungle''
was ``Big Dumb Monkey Man Keeps Whacking Tree With Genitals.''
``Barb Wire'' became ``Delicate Orbs of Womanhood Bigger Than Your
Head Can Hurt You.'' By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.S.-REVIEW (United Nations) _ For more than a year, it has
been evident to governments in every region of the world that the
Clinton administration's policy of sanctions forever against Iraq
has run its course. A look at several other ways that the Iraq
problem might be resolved. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-U.S.-REVIEW (Moscow) _ U.S. to Russia: drop dead. Whether
it's tough love, Russia fatigue or a simple capitulation to
domestic political pressure, the United States seems willing for
the first time during the Yeltsin years to let the Russian
government fall flat on its face. By Michael Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-GAYS-REVIEW (London) _ The issue of homosexuality in
British political life has been forced into the open as never
before. In recent weeks, Britain has been informed that three,
possibly four, of the Cabinet ministers it thought were
heterosexual were in fact homosexual (a fifth has been openly gay
for years). By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   DALAILAMA-CHINA-REVIEW (Lhasa) _ Despite years of Chinese
efforts to discredit Tibet's religious leader and years of
persecution of Tibetans who support him, Tibetans still express
such fanatical devotion to the Dalai Lama that China cannot ignore
him. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   WATERLOO-STATION-REVIEW (Paris) _ The French objection to the
name of the Chunnel railroad terminal in England: Waterloo. By Alan
Riding.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-POPCULTURE-REVIEW (Beijing) _ A first-hand
observation of the growth of American popular culture and
consumerism in China. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   STENDHAL By Jonathan Keates. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   In his youth, Henri Beyle (1783-1842) appeared destined for a
career as a scientist. But circumstances intervened, and he became
a Napoleonic soldier and, eventually, the novelist we know as
Stendhal. Keates' ``prose twirls through Stendhal's peripatetic
career like a gentleman's stick, striking sparks when it taps a
point home,'' Frederick Brown said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN BY THE RIVER By Edna O'Brien. Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the author's native Ireland, this novel focuses on Mary
McNamara, a pregnant country girl whose situation is even more
desperate than that of other expectant teen-age mothers: she is to
bear her father's child. After a neighbor learns of Mary's plight
and takes her to England for a legal abortion, Mary becomes a pawn
in an Irish political battle that is as much about
self-righteousness and spite as it is about morality. Last year our
reviewer, Hilary Mantel, called this a ``forlorn, unsparing and
consciously exquisite novel of rural despair.''
</P>
<P>
   DEEPER: Adventures on the Net By John Seabrook. Touchstone/Simon
&AMP; Schuster, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The author chronicles his two-year odyssey in cyberspace, a
journey that transformed him from an idealistic enthusiast to an
educated skeptic. ``He is an elegant and lucid writer,'' David S.
Bennahum said in these pages in 1997. The same publisher has also
reissued LIFE ON THE SCREEN: Identity in the Age of the Internet,
by Sherry Turkle ($14), and WHERE WIZARDS STAY UP LATE: The Origins
of the Internet, by Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon ($13). Turkle, a
psychologist and sociologist, explores the ways in which the
virtual world both expands and constricts the user's sense of self.
``The result is almost an archeology of changing cultural responses
to the computer,'' Bernard Sharratt wrote in the Book Review in
1995. The history of computers is examined further by Hafner and
Lyon, who describe how the Internet ultimately grew out of Arpanet,
a network that originated with the Eisenhower administration's
Advanced Research Projects Agency. ``The book compiles a great deal
of much-needed information,'' Stephen Manes said here in 1996. The
future of technology is the subject of WHAT WILL BE: How the New
World of Information Will Change Our Lives, by Michael L. Dertouzos
(Harper Edge/HarperSanFrancisco, $14). Here, the founder of MIT's
Laboratory for Computer Science sees the Internet as the
21st-century equivalent of the village marketplace. He
``refreshingly attempts a return to basics, eschewing hype,'' Rick
Prelinger said in these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   THE MANIKIN By Joanna Scott. Owl/Holt, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to the false skeletons taxidermists use when
stuffing dead creatures, which are everywhere in this novel. They
fill an old house that was once owned by a natural historian and is
the scene for a Gothic tale, set in 1927, involving the housekeeper
and her daughter. In 1996, our reviewer, Peter S. Prescott, wrote
of one of the author's passages, ``We haven't heard a voice like
that since Ovid wrote his `Metamorphoses.'''
</P>
<P>
   I'M LOSING YOU By Bruce Wagner. Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriters, actors, casting directors and numerous other
Hollywood types populate this satiric novel, which deals with the
vicissitudes of life in the film industry. ``The author's
achievement is that almost every character is fascinating, no
matter how hideous,'' Anita Gates said in the Book Review in 1996.
The reality of the business is examined just as acidly in HELLO, HE
LIED: And Other Truths From the Hollywood Trenches, by Lynda Obst
(Broadway, $13). The author, a film producer, counsels other women
while recalling her own experiences. The result is a ``smart,
amusing new memoir,'' David McClintick wrote here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   THE LIFE OF GOD: As Told by Himself By Franco Ferrucci.
Translated by Raymond Rosenthal and Franco Ferrucci. University of
Chicago, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   This elegiac novel is a kind of travelogue through the human
universe, executed by the mind that created it but ultimately
cannot control it. In 1996 our reviewer, Jack Miles, called the
novel ``the synthesis of a charming writer's Italy-centered
education and the expression of his boundless hopes for, and
poignant disappointment in, his own human kind.''
</P>
<P>
   A FACE AT THE WINDOW By Dennis McFarland. Broadway, $13.
</P>
<P>
   Cookson Selway, the narrator, is haunted, both literally and
figuratively. Although he has given up drugs and alcohol, he feels
the tugs of his unhappy childhood and of the three disgruntled
spirits who inhabit his London hotel. This ghost story is
``thoroughly satisfying,'' Isabel Colegate wrote in these pages
last year.
</P>
<P>
   FROM BONDAGE: Volume 3 of ``Mercy of a Rude Stream'' By Henry
Roth. Picador USA, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This posthumously published novel by the author of ``Call It
Sleep'' continues the autobiographical story of Ira Stigman, the
young son of immigrant Jewish parents who becomes a celebrated
writer. This volume ``is clearly indispensable to the appreciation
of Roth's unique life and work,'' Frank Kermode said in the Book
Review in 1996.

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Nov. 7, 1998,
at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and

criticism from publishing houses.)

IMPEACHMENT MANEUVERS: WRAPPING THINGS UP, IN KNOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Call it ``No Exit,'' the Capitol's own
existentialist drama. The American public has signaled that it
wants the drive to impeach President Clinton to end. So do most
House Democrats. So do many Republicans. Yet the Republicans and
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have such a strange
synergy that they just cannot seem to stop egging each other on and
on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Take the dispute over which witnesses should appear before the
committee as it examines Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and whether he lied about it in various legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it was the Democrats who first said they were
interested in casting the spotlight on Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr to pose tough questions to perhaps the most unpopular man in
America on the conduct of his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the committee chairman, obliged _ with
a twist. Days after House Democrats made gains in mid-term
elections, he announced a scaled-back impeachment inquiry that
would feature Starr not simply as one of the major witnesses, but
as the only one. Republicans are hoping Starr's appearance Thursday
will backfire on the Democrats, with the prosecutor making a
compelling case against Clinton. Setting the stage last week, Starr
sent more evidence to the committee, this time concerning
allegations by Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats on the committee are now protesting that it is
unfair to question only the prosecutor and bring forward no
witnesses who might rebut him. So some Republicans are now looking
to add other major witnesses like deputy White House counsel Bruce
Lindsey, a long-time confidant of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Nov. 3 election, this kind of point-counterpoint had
some political utility. Republicans and Democrats alike were trying
to use the Clinton scandal to rev up their core voters and send
them to the polls. Now that the people have spoken, pragmatism
might dictate that the committee find a graceful exit from its
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But packed with hard-line conservatives and liberals, the
committee has always been one of the most ideologically divided in
the House. And the impeachment inquiry has only ratcheted up the
tensions and manuevering. ``There's very little middle in the
Judiciary Committee,'' sighed Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., a moderate
not on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   So Hyde and his Republicans seem grimly determined to push on
and charge Clinton with undermining the nation's legal system. And
the Democrats do not intend to help them.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said last week that even
though he wanted the inquiry brought to an end, that did not mean
he would not criticize it as slipshod and flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise,'' he said, ``you get accused of being complicit
with this whole thing and liking it and saying its fine and putting
on the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. I'm not going to do
that.''

 By JAMES BARRON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald, the patron saint of rich, bored Jazz Age
cosmopolites, looked back wistfully to the years before World War
I, when, he said, Americans had not yet been ``corrupted by
advertising.'' One can only wonder what he would say now, when the
messages from Madison Avenue suddenly seem larded with cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Liquor ads promote ``responsible drinking'' (a term that may
goad the irresponsible into ordering a double, straight up).
Cigarette makers print the Surgeon General's mandatory warning on
every pack, and offer, on company-run Web sites, advice on
quitting. Health clubs run ads warning customers not to let
diet-and-exercise regimes give way to anorexia or bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   Are these ads meant to drive away potential customers? Of course
not; ad agencies just want to talk the jaded, skeptical talk of the
'90s. ``Consumers are cynical and literate,'' said Richard
Kirshenbaum, a New York advertising-agency executive who, with his
partner, Jonathan Bond, wrote a book titled ``Under the Radar:
Talking to Today's Cynical Consumer'' (Wiley, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, consumers would respond to the ad,''
Kirshenbaum added. ``Today, they're talking about the strategy
behind the ad. Everyone has a marketing degree and is a critical
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue has certainly ratcheted up the cynicism, which
means that more ads than ever rely on irony and a particular kind
of edgy, self-deprecating humor. The struggling UPN television
network tried to promote its sitcom, ``The Secret Diary of Desmond
Pfeiffer,'' with the slogan, ``The critics hate it, you'll love
it.'' (The show has already been canceled.)
</P>
<P>
   Last season ABC introduced a high-concept ad campaign with the
smarty-pants slogan ``TV is good.'' This season the bright yellow
ads carry the slightly milder slogan, ``We love TV.'' But the
anti-authority tone is the same: ``If TV is bad for you,'' one ad
asks, ``how come every hospital room has one?''
</P>
<P>
   And Beck's beer is poking fun at its Teutonic origins. ``Germans
don't do laid back,'' the announcer says after a guy in a suit and
tie misses the point of a relaxation tape. ``They do beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirshenbaum worries that all this tone is old news by now. He
says he first used it 10 years ago for Kenneth Cole, a New York
shoe designer. The ad said: ``Imelda Marcos bought 2,700 pairs of
shoes. She could have at least had the courtesy to buy a pair of
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Acknowledging that someone bought a huge amount of shoes, but
not yours, that's the core of how cynical people need or want to be
spoken to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a but, and it is nothing less than a nightmare for
Madison Avenue. ``Now that mainstream advertisers are adopting this
stance, consumers will tune this out,'' Kirshenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue is scrambling to find new ways to get past them.
``One way of distinguishing yourself is to take a shot at
yourself,'' said Todd Gitlin, a professor of media studies at New
York University. ``In the process you're recognizing that people
are flooded with claims which are largely absurd or only
metaphorically interesting. By incorporating the skepticism into
your ad, you are inviting the consumer into a sort of collusion,
saying you and I both know that advertising is a crock, but we're
taking you seriously as one who's not a dummy. We're not dummies
either, we're all non-dummies together, and aren't we a swell bunch
of folks to hang out with?''
</P>
<P>
   Kirshenbaum makes much the same point _ in a strikingly
different way. ``Having an interesting and relevant corporate
posture is what's appealing to consumers today,'' he said, adding
that his agency now spends time working up corporate strategy.
``It's not just about an ad anymore. It's about the message behind
the company, the brand and the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media ecology at NYU, sees
this tack as the latest refinement of a time-honored public
relations technique. ``If they really cared, they wouldn't run
smoking ads in the first place,'' he said. ``They'd get out of that
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But he argues that cynicism allows companies to have it both
ways. ``The tobacco companies, for example, can do a certain amount
of repair work on their hideous image by seeming to offer
responsible advice about smoking,'' Miller said. ``The same is the
case with the liquor industry. But obviously, these new ads will
not do their old ads any harm. They're not ever as punchy as the
standard ads, nor could they be, because self-indulgence is always
more tempting than self-restraint.''

WHERE THE FBI FEARS TO TREAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By DAVID JOHNSTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the aftermath of last month's deadly sniper
attack on an obstetrician in upstate New York, Attorney General
Janet Reno announced last week that she was setting up a new
investigative unit to examine the possibility that the doctor was
the victim of a broader anti-abortion plot.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, the National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include
a dozen Justice Department lawyers and involve several
law-enforcement agencies. But the main work of looking into the
shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his suburban Buffalo home and
how it fits a larger pattern of organized violence will be done by
the FBI, which has jurisdiction over domestic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   For many in the FBI, that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the old image of gung-ho FBI agents turning their
surveillance machinery on political groups, a number of senior FBI
agents privately expressed misgivings about the attorney general's
latest task force, the second she has ordered to begin a broad
investigation into a conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials fear that expanding the investigation could drive
the agency over the ill-defined boundary that separates inquiries
into criminal activity from those into political causes and
unpopular ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Today's agents are eager to disassociate themselves from the old
J. Edgar Hoover days of trampling the civil rights of political
dissidents in the guise of serious investigations. They do not want
the agency drawn into the middle of the bitter ideological war
between anti-abortion groups and abortion rights advocates, who
have long asserted the existence of an organized campaign against
clinics and doctors. Many of those calling for government help were
once themselves subjects of FBI interest as anti-war and civil
rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   Senior agency officials, including Director Louis Freeh, were
starting their careers in the early 1970s and watched in dismay as
the FBI was shaken by revelations about Cointelpro, the
counterintelligence program that allowed agents to spy on, burgle,
wiretap and infiltrate anti-war and civil rights groups like
Students for a Democratic Society and the Student Nonviolence
Coordinating Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials are dubious that a conspiracy exists to kill
doctors who perform abortions. They came up empty handed when Reno
ordered the first federal inquiry in 1994 after the killing of a
Florida doctor and his bodyguard. The Justice Department conducted
a two-year grand jury investigation; agents pursued some
anti-abortion activists using surveillance teams. But investigators
never found a specific plot against abortion clinics and staff
members.
</P>
<P>
   Violence at abortion clinics is only part of the problem. The
FBI has in recent years found itself thrown into a minefield of
politically tinged cases involving the volatile worlds of
anti-government militias, environmental and Christian extremists,
white separatists, animal rights activists and Islamic
fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI is very quick to jump from investigating crime to
investigating political association,'' said David Cole, a law
professor at Georgetown University. ``When you move from
investigating crimes to investigating groups, that all-important
nexus to criminal conduct gets lost, the focus gets broader and
broader and you start sweeping in all kinds of lawful political
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to terrorist attacks like the bombings of the World
Trade Center in 1993, the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995
and the Olympic park in Atlanta in 1996, the agency has increased
efforts to deter such incidents in a major prevention program.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, the Justice Department, the FBI and other law
enforcement agencies said they operate under domestic security
guidelines that require investigators to find a ``reasonable
indication'' that a group is planning to break the law before they
can open an inquiry into an organization. Before the authorities
can use such intrusive tactics as wiretapping or property searches,
they must have specific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Yet FBI agents throughout the country have quietly evaluated the
threat posed by a variety of extremist groups through its links to
local authorities and informal interviews with the leaders of some
groups. Their conclusion is that most of these groups pose little
real danger.
</P>
<P>
   Much more difficult to investigate are lone terrorists inflamed
by the oratory of extremist ideology but who belong to no group,
drifting along society's frayed margins, ``off the grid,'' as some
agents describe it, without the usual ties to family, friends or
work.
</P>
<P>
   The profile fits Eric Robert Rudolph, the fugitive wanted for
bombings at the Atlanta Olympics, a gay nightclub and two abortion
clinics. He has kept his beliefs mostly to himself, although
acquaintances hint that he was familiar with religious extremism
and hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, James Charles Kopp, who is being sought as a
material witness in the killing of Slepian, left a trail of clues
about his motives. He was an early follower of Randall Terry, a
leader of Operation Rescue. Later, Kopp was associated with the
Lambs of Christ, an another militant anti-abortion group.
</P>
<P>
   One law-enforcement official said that the government should do
what it does best. ``We should investigate violations,'' he said.
``We shouldn't investigate groups.''

PUBLIC HOUSING REFORM: MIXING UP THE PROJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new law to revive the nation's troubled public housing had a
simple goal when it was first proposed several years go: Allow more
working poor families into projects that had become dominated _
some would say decimated _ by very poor welfare families.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale, first pushed by Republicans, was that working
families would be role models for their neighbors, would help
stabilize projects and, by paying higher rents, would help housing
authorities financially.
</P>
<P>
   But buried in the 300-page bill that President Clinton signed in
October is a provision that local officials warn could paralyze
that effort: It requires cities to mix working families with poorer
families in each and every project.
</P>
<P>
   Cities say this provision will be self-defeating because it will
mean having to persuade working families to move into the worst
projects, while trying to keep working families already living in
the better projects from fleeing when the poorest of the poor move
in.
</P>
<P>
   Inserted during last-minute congressional negotiations by Andrew
Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development, the
provision has been hailed by the Clinton administration as a tool
to reach an even more important goal than income-mixing: racial
desegregation. That's because, generally, the poorest tenants tend
to be black and Hispanic; among the working poor, a greater
proportion are white.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said cities will have to find ways to make it work. ``They
will not get a penny from this department as long as they maintain
segregated housing,'' he said in an interview, referring to race.
Calling the law ``a revolutionary integration plan,'' he said it
would keep public housing from becoming even more of what it
already is: separate worlds, one for working families, another for
those on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Public housing in almost every city, he said, is characterized
by far too many `` `white' buildings and `black' buildings and
`Latino' buildings and `welfare' buildings.'' Ideally, he said,
every building should reflect the racial makeup of each city's
public housing system.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo's provision calls only for economic integration. But the
Clinton administration has portrayed it as being much more about
race. In September, Clinton urged a public housing law that would
``deconcentrate poverty, mix incomes and thereby mix people of all
races and ethnicities.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that racial imbalances remain widespread in
public housing and that years of official discrimination are
largely to blame. Cuomo complains that local housing officials
oppose his initiative because they do not want to desegregate. But
the local officials insist the law won't work.
</P>
<P>
   They say there's a big difference between rooting out
discrimination and trying to make people live where they don't want
to live in the name of racial balance. And, they warn that at its
worst, the law could turn public housing into a political
battleground, as mandatory busing once did for public education.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the last decade, even New York City, praised as having some
of the best public housing, has seen its proportion of working
tenants fall from half to less than a third, in part because of
federal rules favoring the poorest applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The new law allows cities to offer sweeteners to working
families _ like lower rents or moving costs _ to lure them to less
desirable buildings. But many city officials say that while they
favor economic integration and racial integration, too, it is
unrealistic to enforce the same numerical goals in every project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are places that working families are just not going to
want to go,'' said a housing official in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Smith, executive director of the Los Angeles Housing
Authority, said, ``I think given the traditional image of public
housing, it's going to be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law says that 40 percent of newly vacant apartments must
go to the poorest, those making less than 30 percent of an area's
median income. (In New York, this means $15,000 for a family of
four. Familes making near that amount could be working minimum-wage
jobs, but those making much less tend to be on welfare.) The other
60 percent of vacancies can go to those making more _ people who
almost certainly have jobs. In New York, this could mean families
earning up to $40,000, in South Texas up to $25,000 and in Chicago
up to $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ventrone, the staff director for the
Republican-controlled House subcommittee on housing, calls Cuomo's
provision ''an extraordinary example of HUD micromanagement which
is contrary to one of the main purposes of the bill'' _ to give
decision-making power to cities so they can find ways to attract
working families.
</P>
<P>
   Even some advocates for the poorest of the poor are wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly necessary for someone to say it,'' said David
Bryce, deputy director of the National Housing Law Center, ``and it
would be nice if someone could do something about it, but the
reality is that it's incredibly complex. You've got to factor in
what people of color want for themselves. You can say segregation
is bad _ and forced segregation is certainly bad _ but you can't
leap from that to say that you must desegregrate all public housing
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   But other housing advocates, including Jeff Lubell, an analyst
for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit
research group, say the law must find some way _ if not Cuomo's way
_ to address racial segregation or risk worsening the imbalance
when cities bring in working families, more of whom will be white.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all you achieve through the new targeting rules,'' Lubell
said, ``is lower-income familes in some of the higher-income
developments and other developments remaining largely very poor and
minority, then is that really a good policy?''

JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERS MAY FLUNK DRUG TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By GINA KOLATA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In San Diego on Tuesday, two major drug companies rolled out
studies showing the safety and effectiveness of a new class of
prescription pain relievers; they had been duly tested on thousands
of patients, some for up to a year. Such testing was a minimum
requirement before the drugs could be prescribed to millions of
Americans. If the Food and Drug Administration approves, the drugs
can be sold.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, the prestigious Journal of the American Medical
Association held a news conference in Washington to hail the
publication of six papers ``evaluating'' studies of alternative
medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
   These treatments were already on the market. The studies came
after the fact. The testing involved only dozens of patients and
only weeks of trials. Yet these studies, which any large drug
company would have considered tentative and inconclusive, were
presented as resolving questions of safety and efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying editorial, titled ``Alternative Medicine Meets
Science,'' used decisive words like ``found,'' as in the study
``found'' that moxibustion _ the burning of herbs to stimulate
acupuncture points _ is helpful for breach pregnancy; that a
particular treatment ``is helpful'' for a medical condition; that
researchers were able to ``document'' that a mixture of Chinese
herbs ``improves symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a double standard? One thing is sure: the issue has
stirred up supporters and skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Phil Fontanarosa, an editor of the Journal of the American
Medical Association who helped write its editorial, said that ``the
trials were all well done and the usual caveats were in place.''
The resulting news coverage was exuberant. But Fontanarosa said
that was the result of interest in the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly, said some critics of alternative medicine, who were
stung by what they saw as an exaggeration of the importance of such
modest studies.
</P>
<P>
   Double standard? ``Absolutely,'' said Dr. Richard Friedman,
director of the psychopharmacology clinic at Cornell Hospital-New
York Medical Center. With all the hoopla, the message that
alternative treatments were still a scientific terra incognita got
lost. ``The public will be sold'' on the notion that such
treatments have passed muster, Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Hathcock, the director of nutritional and regulatory
science for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, argued that the
double standard works the other way by hurting the vitamin and
mineral industry. His group represents the dietary supplement
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hathcock said that an epidemiological study came out about a
month ago linking folic acid in the diet with protection from colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with a high official at the National Cancer
Institute, and he said, `That's very intriguing, we're very
interested, but it needs to be confirmed with a clinical trial,'''
Hathcock said. ``I said, `Give me a break. There is no risk, and
the effective period is 15 years.''' A study is likely to take that
long to assess the effects of folic acid on colon cancer rates.
</P>
<P>
   If a treatment has a low risk, the consumer does not have be as
certain of the benefit in order to use it, said Dr. Stephen
DeFelice, chairman of the Foundation for Innovation in Medicine in
Cranford, N.J. With actual pharmaceuticals, ``we require more
evidence because it is an unknown entity, an artificial molecule,''
he said. Drugs ``are not nature's way of handling disease,''
DeFelice added.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative medicine is different, he said. ``These things are
not nearly as toxic as drugs,'' said DeFelice, adding that ``when
we go for benefits, we accept less evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to say that most Americans are indifferent about
evidence on whether alternative treatments work, said Lisa Meyer, a
spokeswoman for the Council for Responsible Nutrition. ``People are
hungry for additional information,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of America's acceptance of alternative medicine trace it
to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which
enabled makers of supplements containing herbs, amino acids,
botanical extracts, vitamins and minerals to sell them without the
approval of the FDA. These companies also can claim benefits for
their products _ without any supporting scientific studies. But
unlike manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and devices, they are not
required to report adverse effects to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   With no regulations forcing them to test for product safety, no
protocol for tracking bad side effects and no requirement that
products demonstrate effectiveness, the alternative medicine
industry has been able to sidestep the rules of drug development.
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Dr. Allen Roses, a vice president at the drug
company Glaxo Wellcome Inc., say that is inherently dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   If an alternative medicine company is selling its product as a
substitute for a drug, they should show that it works and that its
benefits outweigh its risks, said Roses, who questioned studies
like those in the medical journal. One of those studies involved
116 patients divided into three groups and studied for 14 weeks.
Such a study, he said, cannot detect deleterious side effects that,
as so often happens with drugs, occur only in a small percentage of
people or only after people take the drug for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to take anything, it should be based on
efficacy and not on hope,'' Roses said. ``You are crushing people's
hope by giving them a treatment that is not efficacious and
implying it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a clash of two cultures, said Dr. William
Wardell, the executive director of the Covance Institute for Drug
Development Studies in Princeton, N.J. ``The culture for
conventional medicine comes out of a history of fraud and
disaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presumption is that drugs are ineffective and unsafe
unless they are proven to be effective and safe,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative medicine's philosophy has been the presumption that
treatments are safe and effective unless proven otherwise. Now,
Wardell said, ``There is a confusion of gullibility with
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If sales go up from $2 million to $67 million, people say,
`This proves it works,''' he said. ``If you can put yourself in the
mind of a marketer, it's true. It works.''

DREAMS OF FIELDS: THE NEW POLITICS OF URBAN SPRAWL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) 
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga., Md., Ga., N.J., Ore., Ariz.)  (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What author Tom Wolfe did for radical chic in the
1960s, narcissism in the '70s, and greed in the '80s, he may now be
doing for runaway real-estate development in his new novel on
America at century's end. Urban sprawl, with all its strip-mall
excess and soul-deadening homogeneity, is not just a central
backdrop, but almost a character in ``A Man in Full,'' the author's
latest pen poke at contemporary life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you could tell you were leaving one community and
entering another was when the franchises started repeating and you
spotted another 7-Eleven, another Wendy's, another Costco, another
Home Depot,'' Wolfe writes. He was describing the San Francisco Bay
Area, but it could have been any metropolitan region in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day, voters from Southern California to New Jersey
showed that the sprawl issue may have become a political driving
force no less than a narrative function in the fictional world of
Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   Voters across the country and across party lines, from desert
suburbs in the West to leafy cul de sacs in the East, voted to stop
the march of new malls, homes and business parks at the borders of
their communities, and to tax themselves to buy open space as a
hedge against future development.
</P>
<P>
   For Vice President Al Gore, who has been ratcheting up the
sprawl issue as a top green concern, edging aside more contentious
and somewhat abstract environmental concepts like global warming,
the votes are seen as the start of a winning national campaign.
Who, after all, could be against what the Sierra Club now describes
as an attempt to return to Beaver Cleaver's America, albeit with
smaller lot sizes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to the conclusion that what we really are faced with
here is a systematic change from a pattern of uncontrolled sprawl
toward a brand new path that makes quality of life the goal of all
our urban, suburban and farmland policies,'' Gore said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans such as New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman have
also listened to the same complaints around the barbecue. At the
very edge of what the author Joel Garreau famously labeled ``Edge
Cities,'' people say their new communities have become too
dependent on the automobile, too removed from nature, too close to
the clutter of boxy retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   Paving paradise, almost a reflex reaction in Southern
California, was halted by a huge majority in Ventura County, where
voters approved a series of urban boundaries around the
fast-growing new cities wedged between Los Angeles and Santa
Barbara, and stripped their elected supervisors of the power to
approve new subdivisions and put it in the hands of voters instead.
</P>
<P>
   Developers now will have to get voter approval to push the flood
of tile-roofed subdivisions any further into land that has some of
the last big lemon groves in California. About 80 percent of the
county will be off-limits to developers, unless voters say
differently, supporters of the measure said. The Los Angeles Times
heralded the vote as a ``revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the most-densely populated state in the nation,
voters in 43 cities and six counties decided to raises their taxes
to buy and preserve open space. Statewide, by a two-to-one margin,
voters also approved spending nearly $1 billion over 10 years to
buy half of the Garden State's remaining garden space.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, voters approved nearly 200 state and local ballot
initiatives on curbing sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Al Gore talking growth management for the next two
years and beyond may be no more appealing than hearing another flat
tax speech from Steve Forbes. The vice president has been pounding
the anti-sprawl bully pulpit for months, proclaiming the dawn of
``an American movement to build more liveable communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is seen by his supporters as a key to all those Jeep
Cherokee driving suburbanites with few political passions beyond
the afternoon traffic jam. The elections earlier this month, based
largely on grass-roots initiatives, have only bolstered Gore's
case, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
   But before Gore tries to lay a Democratic claim to an issue that
cuts beyond most political lines, he will have to go through the
Republican governor of New Jersey. Just five years ago, Whitman was
held up by her party as a young Margaret Thatcher, with tax cuts as
her banner.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a year into a second term, Whitman has made protecting open
space the primary issue _ and perhaps her legacy _ for the state.
In what may be an act of heresy to the tax-cutting wing of her
party, the governor has been campaigning for tax increases to keep
land out of the hands of developers. Initially, she proposed an
increase in the gas tax, but has settled on the kind of selective
property tax increases that were approved across New Jersey on
election day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to understand that once land is gone, it's gone
forever,'' said Whitman while pushing the new open space measures.
She could have been just another doorbeller from the Sierra Club,
which, in response to a survey of members, has put sprawl at the
top of its list of environmental concerns. The club says 400,000
acres of open space are lost to development every year.
</P>
<P>
   The successful anti-sprawl campaigns steered away from talk of
government control or zoning arcana. They dwelled instead on images
of lemon groves and tawny hills in Southern California, pumpkin
patches and horse farms in New Jersey, and wind-whipped dunes in
Cape Cod _ all just beyond the exurban fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to subvert the American dream _ we're trying
to get back to it,'' said Larry Bohlen, co-chairman of the Sierra
Club's national campaign to fight sprawl. ``It's that `Leave it to
Beaver' town where all the kids walk to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of these measures, led in California by home builders
and developers, say the new political calculation could change in
the blink of an eye if the economy turns bad. In bad times, people
are less likely to vote to restrict growth.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in Oregon, which pioneered boundaries around all its major
cities in the 1970s, voters have upheld the state's far-reaching
anti-sprawl laws even during the depths of two recessions over the
last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Developers say the votes this month were not so much an
anti-growth chorus as they were a reflection of the frustration
people feel over traffic and crowded schools.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the opponents say they are stunned by how quickly
suburban growth has become a pejorative. ``We seem to be at a point
now where the word sprawl has been totally demonized,'' said
Clayton Traylor, vice president for political issues for the
National Association of Home Builders, which has 195,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Washington politicians may find it difficult to nationalize what
is basically a local issue. Gore has raised the possibility of
using the Federal tax code or major transportation bills to
discourage growth that goes against community planning goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we adopted national policies that spend lots of
taxpayer money to subsidize out-of-control sprawl,'' Gore said.
``They suck the life out of urban areas, increase congestion in the
suburbs and raise taxes on farms.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is vague on what, precisely, could be done on a national
level. But whatever he attempts to do will be met by stiff
opposition if it ends up slowing development, Traylor said.
Building lobbies for highways and some conservatives were outraged
that the $217 billion transportation bill that was just approved by
Congress contained a small amount of money for bike paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the vice president or anyone else at the
federal level tries to turn off the spigot for new infrastructure,
we'll be there to fight them,'' Traylor said.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, however, turning off the spigot proved to be a
winning political cry, as supporters of new developments were
hastily dispatched on election day. A Republican who favored two
huge projects in Anne Arundel County, County Executive John Gary,
was voted out office, while Republicans who vowed to pull the plug
on new water and sewage systems in neighboring Calvert County took
control of the Board of Commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, developers have tried to co-opt the anti-sprawl
movement. Arizona voters narrowly approved a measure, sponsored by
the state's banking and building industry, that would set aside $20
million a year for 11 years to buy open space. But in return, the
law would ban development fees and urban growth restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The homebuilders were heartened by at least one of the sprawl
votes that went the other way. In Georgia, voters turned down a
measure to use a real estate transfer tax to preserve historical
sites and open space. Georgia is the main setting for Wolfe's
novel, a place where a huge, troubled development at the far edge
of suburban Atlanta is at the core of one man's decline.

   Israel Ratifies The Peace Accord
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Cabinet, after a two-week delay, ratified the Wye
peace memorandum almost begrudgingly and with a string of riders
attached.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, just a day later, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu opened bidding for a large housing development in the
predominantly Arab east side of Jerusalem. The move was seen as a
gesture to the disaffected right and was denounced by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu had been unable to get a solid majority of his

   Big Push to Curb A Blinding Disease

   The eye infection trachoma dims the vision of 6 million people,
making it the world's leading cause of preventable blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the World Health Organization announced a new
strategy for eventually eliminating blinding trachoma that calls
for supplying clean water to improve personal hygiene, minor eye
surgery to help repair scarring and once-a-year use of an
antibiotic, azithromycin.

   Simpson Loses Appeal
</P>
<P>
   Should a man acquitted of killing his wife get custody of the
children? There seems no reason why he shouldn't. But here's a
thornier question: What if the man is O.J. Simpson?
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, he was indeed given custody of his children,
now 10 and 13, and both have since written the court asking to stay
with their father. But an appeals court reversed that ruling,
saying that ``common sense'' dictates that the murder ``is about as
relevant as it is possible to imagine.''

   Simpson vowed to fight the decision.

   Jones Case Is Settled
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton agreed to pay Paula Corbin Jones $850,000 to
drop her legal claim that he crudely propositioned her seven years
ago. The payment settles a lawsuit that Clinton's advisers had once
mocked but that, by forcing his relationship with Monica Lewinsky
into public view, had begun to threaten his presidency.

   Msr. Jones dropped what she had called her most important

   Human, Cow Cells Mixed
</P>
<P>
   A small biotechnology company announced that it had fused human
cells with cow eggs, forcing the cells to revert to the primordial,
embryonic state from which all other cells develop.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Advanced Cell Technology of Worcester, Mass., said
the method could eventually be used to grow replacement body
tissues of any kind from a patient's own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The embryonic cells consisted of a human cell's nucleus in a cow
egg whose nucleus had been removed. The company said the hybrid
cells quickly became more humanlike, as the human nucleus took
control and displaced cow proteins with human proteins.

   Court Sidesteps School Voucher Debate
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court declined to get involved in the national
debate over whether it is constitutional to use taxpayer-financed
vouchers to send children to religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   With only Associate Justice Stephen Breyer dissenting, the court
let stand a ruling by the Wisconsin Supreme Court that held that a
program in Milwaukee in which poor students are given vouchers that
may be used at religious schools did not violate either the state
or federal constitutions. For the time being, that is the most
definitive court ruling in the nation on the voucher issue.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision to avoid involvement means that there is
still no national constitutional standard to judge voucher
programs.

   America Reduces Its Thirst
</P>
<P>
   Water use has grown in lockstep with America's population and
economy, and many have thought it would always be that way. But
according to the U.S. Geological Survey, the nation used 9 percent
less water in 1995 than in 1980, while the population grew by 16
percent. The reversal may reflect a shift in focus away from
finding ways to expand the water supply and toward reducing demand.

   Where Walter Mitty Works Out
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, where Main Street is Broadway and people get bored
in a New York minute, acting out is the most popular new way to
work out.
</P>
<P>
   Former dancers from the New York City Ballet lead classes that
let people make like ballerinas as they work to get back into their
favorite blue jeans. Retired professional football players lead
workouts where people learn to pass and dodge tackles like the
pros. Some people are enlisting in boot camps led by former
military officers. And in a class called ``Abs, Thighs and
Gossip,'' the instructor teaches in drag.
</P>
<P>
   Club owners hope the new trend in workouts _ sweaty, high-energy
theater, with props, live music and instructors who live what they
teach _ will make exercise fun and attract new members. In the New
York area, 11.2 percent of the population belong to health clubs, 2
percent more than six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighter workout, based on real fire fighting techniques,
is almost always packed. In a workout room at Crunch in Midtown
Manhattan one recent evening, a voice from a staticky radio called
for units to respond. Sirens wailed, lights flashed and Eric Torres
_ a beefy firefighter in 50 pounds of fire gear _ ordered his
battalion to prepare for battle. ``You're about to fight your first
fire, rookies,'' he said. ``Get ready to hustle.''
</P>
<P>
   The students scale the equivalent of 80 flights of stairs as
fast as they can using a bench. They tear down imaginary walls with
weight bars, dodge imaginary backdrafts by falling to the floor and
crawling on their elbows and knees, and take turns dragging a
125-pound victim, a crash-test dummy, to safety.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the hour, the participants have worked off between
600 and 800 calories. Drenched in sweat, they are gasping so hard
that many drop to their knees. But when they recover, they swear
they feel great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun,'' said Chad Klopotek, 24. ``This workout
really kicks your butt.''

LOST, AND GAINED, IN THE TRANSLATION

<P>
   One of the reasons that movie studios make so many action
pictures is that they do well overseas. There are no translation
problems when Bruce Willis is firing an Uzi or fleeing a fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Comedies and dramas are a different story. Comedy, in
particular, frequently hangs on the thinnest of cultural threads.
But when a comic film takes off, the distributors will do
everything possible to push it overseas. Take, for instance,
``There's Something About Mary,'' one of the biggest and silliest
movies of the year, starring Cameron Diaz. To foreign audiences,
the title was mystifying. So 20th Century Fox renamed the movie
country by country.
</P>
<P>
   In Poland, blonde jokes are popular, so the title became, ``For
the Love of a Blonde.'' In France, it was, ``Mary at All Costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Neeson, the executive in charge of foreign distribution at
Fox, said Asians prefer literal titles. So in Thailand it became,
``My True Love Will Stand All Outrageous Events.'' In Hong Kong it
was called, ``Enjoy Yourself in the Game of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   That's poetic by the standards of Hong Kong, where the demand
for literal descriptions has produced some jarring results. The
Cantonese title for ``Leaving Las Vegas'' translates to ``I'm Drunk
and You're a Prostitute.'' ``Field of Dreams'' was ``Imaginary Dead
Baseball Players Live in My Cornfield.'' For truth in advertising,
you could not beat the title for ``The Crying Game'' _ ``Oh No! My
Girlfriend Has a Penis!''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the Chinese seem to find unintended meanings in
American movies. ``Interview With the Vampire,'' for instance,
became, ``So, You Are a Lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no arguing with the Chinese take on ``Babe'': ``The
Happy Dumpling-To-Be Who Talks and Solves Agricultural Problems.''
Or ``My Best Friend's Wedding'': ``Help! My Pretend Boyfriend Is
Gay.'' Or ``George of the Jungle'': ``Big Dumb Monkey Man Keeps
Whacking Tree With Genitals.'' Or even ``Batman and Robin'': ``Come
to My Cave and Wear this Rubber Codpiece, Cute Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But still, there is that poetic side, as with the Pamela
Anderson Lee vehicle called ``Barb Wire.'' The Chinese saw it as
``Delicate Orbs of Womanhood Bigger Than Your Head Can Hurt You.''

GUNS TO BUTTER: SIX FRAUGHT WAYS TO CONTAIN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ It was not supposed to turn out this way. Tough
sanctions linked to aggressive arms inspections were intended to
keep Saddam Hussein boxed in, not to drive the United States into a
corner.
</P>
<P>
   But time and again Washington has had to turn to military action
or the threat of war to beat down a challenge from the Iraqi
leader, whose continued intention is to possess an armory of the
world's most lethal weapons. When the confrontation ends, Iraq goes
back into the box, but it is a container that gets flimsier with
each showdown.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, it has been evident to governments in
every region of the world that the Clinton administration's policy
of sanctions forever has run its course. Saddam won power by terror
and depleted Iraq's resources in war and ostentation even before he
unwisely strayed into Kuwait in 1990, and if he ever intended to
cooperate with arms inspections, he very clearly decided within the
last year that he had played the game long enough.
</P>
<P>
   For months, foreign and domestic critics of the U.S. policy on
Iraq have urged the administration to show some creativity or
flexibility _ or even naked muscle _ to steer away from a dead end.
At one extreme are those who think the time is overdue to remove
the president of Iraq by marching on Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   At the other are those like France, Russia, some large
developing countries and most Arab nations who say they no longer
see a direct military threat. They essentially urge United States
to let Saddam sell oil while policing Iraq from afar, but they are
also willing to stand back and let America bomb. In between, other
ideas lie in wait.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has found one option particularly appealing:
sporadic bombing aimed at knocking out specific sites or generally
intimidating Saddam, but not removing him from power. The problem
would be Saddam's survival, which would guarantee continued trouble
and, if many ordinary Iraqis were killed, a loss of support around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   A full-scale attack on Iraq and, perhaps, an occupation of
Baghdad is a course that the Bush administration ruled out in 1991
and the Clinton administration is not likely to choose. It has a
growing number of supporters on the conservative side of politics
in the United States, but virtually no backers abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq was greatly weakened by the Persian Gulf war, but Saddam
still has the power to force every Iraqi adult into military
service and he has been allowed to keep a formidable defensive
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Muravchik, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute
in Washington, said that even leaving aside the material and
political costs of assembling a huge army and persuading the public
to accept casualties, U.S. leaders have apparently concluded that
there is little point in ousting Saddam; the rationale is that
responsible, democratic government doesn't seem to work in the
region. But Muravchik, the author of ``Exporting Democracy,''
argues that's no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lessons learned in the 1930s about aggressors led us to
get rid of them,'' he said. ``We occupied Germany and Japan to
insure that there would be more benign governments. That clearly
was what would have been necessary in Iraq, but we didn't have the
courage to do it.'' Now, he said, it is up to dissidents to
overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
   Arab diplomats respond that a U.S.occupation of Iraq _ in the
heart of a region that still harbors resentment of the British
occupation after the fall of the Ottoman Empire following World War
I _ would be a calamity. The Iraqis under Saddam are especially
sensitive on this issue, but they are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be preposterous,'' said Clovis Maksoud, a former U.N.
representative of the Arab League who now directs American
University's Center for the Global South in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab world has two major popular causes: the completion of
the Mideast peace agreement and the end of suffering for the people
of Iraq. A military occupation would inflame a region where the
United States has little power of persuasion and little presence.
From Pakistan almost to the Mediterranean, the United States has
either no functioning U.S. embassies _ the case in Afghanistan,
Iran and Iraq _ or uneasy relations, as in Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of U.S. leverage in the gulf has prompted some
officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to
rethink the ``dual containment'' of Iraq and Iran and make
overtures to the Iranians under a more open president, Mohammed
Khatami. But sharp political differences within Iran between
Khatami's supporters and the ultra-conservative religious
leadership make any hope of using Iran as a counterweight to Iraq
problematic at best. While the U.S. overture to Iran was taking
shape, Saddam was getting bolder, not more hesitant.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who would turn over the job of deposing Saddam
to his most opportunistic enemies. Congress has authorized $97
million for military help to opposition groups like the Iraqi
National Congress and two Kurdish resistance organizations. It is
hard to find an expert on the region who thinks this course has any
hope of succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similar judgments are made about hopes that Saddam's army, or
elements of it, will turn against him. A diplomat in Baghdad said
in an interview early this year that the Iraqi president has layers
upon intersecting layers of intelligence operations and more cells
of informers than anyone can count. A hint of trouble can wipe out
not only the plotter but his whole family.
</P>
<P>
   The same fear attends the professional middle class and
virtually all government employees, who have also taken the hardest
hit from sanctions, and are increasingly bitter about what they see
as a U.S. policy indifferent to their fate. Suggestions from
outside the administration that sanctions be redrawn or at least
tinkered with to free the middle class from restrictions on travel
and a range of foreign contacts have apparently been ignored. U.S.
officials say they cannot trust the Iraqi leadership not to use
such openings for its own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. expert with years of experience in the region said that
perhaps only the manipulation of tribal differences in the Iraqi
heartland, where Saddam and his Tikriti clan are quietly loathed,
would have a hope of bringing down the regime from within. But the
United States appears to have no handle on these internal
divisions. And other scholars of the region, as well as many Iraqi
exiles, worry about who would take Saddam's place. His sons, Uday
and Qusay, described by many Iraqis as even more corrupt and
ruthless than him, wait in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over what to do about sanctions raises several
questions. Should sanctions _ above all the embargo on Iraqi oil
sales _ be withdrawn, leaving Saddam with no more propaganda
mileage to be made from his suffering people? Should this be done
before there is a strong, fail-safe arms-monitoring process in
place to keep an eye on Saddam? Or should the arms inspection
system, which Saddam has turned into his most effective pressure
point against the United Nations and the United States, be
abandoned while sanctions stay in place?
</P>
<P>
   ``No inspections _ and sanctions _ is much worse than full
inspections and diminished sanctions,'' said David Albright of the
independent Institute for Science and International Security in
Washington. His views are widely shared by experts wary of those
who believe that standard intelligence methods would be as
effective as inspectors who, as Clinton says, have destroyed more
Iraqi arms that the gulf war did.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the world just abandoned both sanctions and
inspections? There are those who believe that Iraq is no longer an
immediate military threat and that the penalties being paid by the
Iraqi people are too high to justify for much longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration will never let this happen, officials
say. And within the United Nations, diplomats from many regions
fear the precedent it would set. ``You don't bargain with the
Security Council,'' a Scandinavian diplomat said last week, a day
before the Nordic countries joined in warning Saddam to get back in
line. The sanctions-with-inspections program created for Iraq was
once seen as a useful model for dealing with tyrants in a world no
longer eager to mount peacekeeping missions. Many diplomats do not
want to see it tossed out because of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   All of this leaves still one more alternative, and it may well
be the one that becomes reality. This option assumes that the
United States manages to keep sanctions in place indefinitely, but
with dwindling support from other nations. The sanctions are
already eroding. Hardly a week goes by when the press in India, an
old ally of Iraq, doesn't trumpet a new agreement with Baghdad.
Indians are selling Iraqis food and computers, and high-level
visits have resumed. Turkey is trading through the Kurdish regions
of northern Iraq, recent visitors say, and illicit commerce through
Iranian coastal waters is flourishing again.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a new ferry service from Dubai linked Iraq to the
gulf nations by sea for the first time since 1991. When Sfouq
Rashid, an Iraqi passenger, disembarked at the Iraqi port of Umm
Qasr on Tuesday, he told a Reuters reporter proudly: ``This service
extends a ray of hope for the Iraqi people. God willing, it will
break the siege on Iraq.''

   MOSCOW _ When the Kremlin finds itself in a tight economic
squeeze, it acts a lot like the sheriff in the Mel Brooks comedy
``Blazing Saddles.'' Pursued by a furious lynch mob, the sheriff
puts a gun to his own head and threatens to pull the trigger if the
crowd doesn't back off.
</P>
<P>
   As a bitter winter closes in, Russia has again tried to take
itself hostage. Kremlin aides have drawn ghastly scenarios of the
troubles that they say will swamp their nation if the West refuses
to supply billions in fresh aid.
</P>
<P>
   Rubles will roll off the printing presses, they warn, spurring
hyperinflation. The nation will default on billions of dollars of
foreign loans, leaving Western banks high and dry. The oratory has
even been salted with talk of the collapse of the Russian state and
the breakdown of nuclear controls.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the scare tactics have not worked. Call it
tough love, Russia fatigue or a simple capitulation to domestic
U.S. political pressure: For the first time in President Boris
Yeltsin's tenure, the United States seems prepared to let his
government fall flat on its face.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Washington has turned its back on
Russia. It is still spending hundreds of millions of dollars to
help safeguard nuclear materials. It is also sending $625 million
worth of food to keep Russians from going hungry and prevent a
breakdown of the social order.
</P>
<P>
   But having addressed the most serious security and humanitarian
problems, Washington is no longer pressing the International
Monetary Fund to provide billions of dollars in new assistance or
trying to prop up the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's hands-off approach has been spelled
out in a series of speeches by top State and Treasury department
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``International macroeconomic support of the kind we provide
through the IMF must wait until the Russian government shows itself
willing and able to make the difficult structural adjustments
necessary for recovery and growth,'' warned Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money from outside will do no good if it is inflated away or
it if pauses only briefly in Russia before ending up in Swiss bank
accounts and Riviera real estate,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In political terms, the Clinton administration's response is
hardly surprising. For most of the Yeltsin years, the Clinton
administration was closely identified with the market reformers in
the government like Anatoly Chubais, Sergei Kiriyenko and Boris
Nemtsov. Talbott went so far last year as to proclaim that Russia
had begun to turn the corner under their guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The West did more than talk. A three-year, $10-billion-dollar
program of IMF assistance was announced in 1996 just in time to
boost Yeltsin's re-election prospects. When that was not enough,
the West cobbled together a $17 billion rescue plan in July to help
buttress the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington's expectations were shaken when the rescue plan
failed. Russia's reformers were forced to devalue the ruble and, in
a dubious bit of policymaking, slapped a 90-day moratorium on the
repayment of foreign debts held by Russian banks.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the reformers were out, Yevgeny Primakov was prime minister
and a new coalition government seeded with Communists began to talk
about the need for greater state control of the economy and issued
a litany of potentially costly promises.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent billions trying to support Russia's free market
proponents without a clear victory, the West was not rushing to
spend billions more _ at least not until Primakov's team drew up a
detailed budget and economic plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Western response has been a rude shock for the Russians.
Viktor Gerashchenko, the Communist now in charge of the Central
Bank, and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov came to Washington last
month with only the vague outlines of an economic plan, hoping to
line up billions in IMF aid. They returned emptyhanded.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Clinton administration's tough approach represents a
thorough rethinking of Russia is another matter. Critics say the
administration is rightly wary of bailing out Russia, but note that
the crisis came to a head when the U.S.-backed reformers were in
the saddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no self-analysis in Talbott's speech, as if we did
not play a role in what happened in Russia,'' said Thomas Graham, a
senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
and a former U.S. diplomat in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to say if the Kremlin is really prepared to take
the tough steps that would be required to pry loose the IMF funds.
</P>
<P>
   To try to soften up Washington, the Primakov team has pushed for
ratification of the Start-2 treaty slashing long-range nuclear
arms. It has also promised to limit the printing of new rubles and
pledged budgetary discipline.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the Russia's economic strategy is mostly just
talk. A test may come next month when the government outlines its
1999 budget, which will show how it plans to deal with its huge
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not done a lot of the things that worry us the
most,'' said the U.S. official. ``But no one has seen next year's
budget and it is still not clear who is really calling the shots.''

   PARIS _ The English like to poke fun at the French, but much to
their annoyance the French usually respond with indifference, which
perhaps explains why an obscure Gaullist politician enjoyed 15
minutes of fame in England this month. Here at last was a patriot
ready to defend his nation's honor in face of provocations by the
perfidious Albion. English newspapers chortled with delight. At
last, a reaction!
</P>
<P>
   All the better, in fact, because Florent Longuepee, a
33-year-old conservative Parisian politician, was quite serious. He
wrote to British Prime Minister Tony Blair to complain that the
Eurostar train from Paris to London via the Channel Tunnel arrives
at Waterloo Station. This reminder of a famous British military
victory over the French could distress French travelers, he said.
In the name of European entente, he suggested, the station should
be renamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, this is not a joke,'' he insisted in a telephone
interview. ``Do you think General De Gaulle would have agreed to
inaugurate the Eurostar at Waterloo Station?'' Well, no. De Gaulle
would not even allow Britain to join the European Community.
</P>
<P>
   Longuepee went further (although not as far as actually taking
the Eurostar to Waterloo). If Whitehall rejected his suggestion, he
said he would propose changing the name of the Paris terminus of
the Eurostar from the Gare du Nord to the Gare de Fontenoy, after a
1745 battle in Belgium where French troops defeated the English,
even after gallantly inviting ``Messieurs les Anglais'' to fire
first.
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers, never embarrassed to joust with jingoism,
seemed cheered to learn that some of the French were still hurting
over Napoleon's 1815 trouncing at Waterloo. ``If the French really
want to rename the Gare du Nord, they should choose a more
celebrated Norman victory, say, Hastings,'' The London Times said.
And, the French were also reminded, didn't Paris also have railway
and metro stations named after great military victories (albeit not
over England)?
</P>
<P>
   Downing Street was naturally called on to respond, even though
Longuepee admitted he was not speaking for the French government.
``We only received the letter yesterday,'' a Blair spokeswoman
said, ``and it is in French, so it is being translated.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that really necessary? Isn't Blair rather proud of his fluent
French?
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister is away,'' she said. ``Anyway, there are no
plans to change the name of Waterloo Station.'' Well, of course
not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, once again, the English had a laugh at the expense of
their traditional foe. Yet once again the entire episode said more
about England (though not Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland) than
it did about France. Put differently, the English remain obsessed
by France, but the fascination is no longer mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Longuepee's initiative was ignored in France. It is
becoming rather painful for the English. They keep making funny
faces at the French. But when France looks west nowadays, it sees
only the United States.

MIDDLE AMERICA IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ I am a product of America's cities. For the first 40
years of my life, I had never been to anything like Price Club.
Dairy Queen was a once-a-year pit stop on vacations. I had never
car-pooled to a soccer game. In fact, but for a brief period a
decade ago, my husband and I never owned a car.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a year ago, we moved to China _ and somehow ended up in
middle America.
</P>
<P>
   Let me describe a typical Saturday here in Beijing, within
marching distance of the Great Hall of the People. We begin by all
piling into the sport-utility vehicle (a Chinese-made Jeep) to get
the kids to soccer. But wait: It's our turn to bring halftime
snacks! No problem; we'll just stop at the Dunkin' Donuts for donut
holes. In the People's Republic of China, I have become a soccer
mom.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, if the weather is warm, we might head to the
pool for a swim. Other families drive to stables for horseback
riding, still others to one of the many miniature golf courses for
a bit more sport.
</P>
<P>
   Later, there's a stop at the new Price Smart, Beijing's latest
cavernous, members-only supermarket, where we can buy 24 rolls of
toilet paper and vast containers of Tootsie Rolls. It's easy to
find, right next to a huge bowling alley and down the ring road
from a mall.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry? There are over 40 McDonald's. There's Dairy Queen and
Baskin-Robbins and the gleaming new Haagen-Dazs parlor that this
summer sprang up from the gritty pavement off Jian Guo Men Wai
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   So this is what the Communist Party means by ``socialism with
Chinese characteristics''! But isn't this what it's like in Des
Moines?
</P>
<P>
   Now, in case the skeptical among you think that what I'm
describing is just the lifestyle of homesick American executives,
diplomats and journalists, guess again. True, the soccer game was
mostly for Western kids. But the most jarring thing about urban
China is that it is the Chinese _ albeit better-off Chinese _ who
are packing the Pizza Huts, the Ikeas, the Putt Putt miniature golf
courses and the Clarins skin-care salons.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people here have never voted and the Communist
Party maintains a tight grip on politics, the market provides
plenty of choice in many spheres, to the small but growing number
of Chinese with disposable income. And they are making these
choices with the gusto of Bedouins who suddenly happen on a vast
reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why the fruit of middle America has been
quick to catch on in Beijing. The Chinese have seen it on imported
TV shows and longed for it for years. Middle America is
relentlessly clean and modern _ appealing in a country with a lot
of ancient relics but a shortage of functioning flush toilets. And
middlebrow Americana suits the still-limited budgets of Chinese
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus this year millions of Chinese paid $8 a head to see
``Titanic,'' but few were willing to shell out $60 (two weeks'
salary for a teacher here) to see a much-praised production of
Puccini's ``Turandot'' staged in the Forbidden City. It is probably
not a coincidence that the first joint-venture hotel in Beijing,
the Jian Guo _ which caters to both Chinese and foreigners _ was
modeled after a Holiday Inn in Arizona, not the Plaza in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most of the city is still quintessentially Chinese,
with bicycles and pedicabs vying for position with horse-drawn
carts bearing high stacks of watermelons and cabbages. At dawn, the
parks are still full of old men in Mao suits doing tai chi
exercises, and the narrow alleys are jammed with vendors selling
Chinese pancakes and odd boiled eggs that taste like salt.
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition of such scenes with American-style bowling
alleys and indoor playgrounds gives Beijing its extraordinary
character. And the Chinese add their distinctive veneer to what
would otherwise be predictably American establishments. In addition
to Frosted Flakes, the Price Smart sells frozen jiaoze and fresh
dou miao, the dumplings and bean sprouts that are staples of
Beijing cuisine. The riding stables are staffed by former officers
of the People's Liberation Army and offer surly horses that respond
only to Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   At McDonald's, workers teach children elaborate dance routines
that defy Western neurons. Grandmas, or nai nais, who would never
touch a burger nevertheless go to McDonald's to watch their
precious grandchildren scarf down Happy Meals.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, I mostly dreaded trips to fun emporiums
like Chuck E. Cheese. But somehow here I don't mind the cacophony
of Fundazzle, an indoor playground sometimes flocked with whole
schools full of Chinese children, with a climbing maze the size of
a football field and a ball pit the size of a large swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   I like the sign there that reminds Chinese to put diapers on
infants. (Most Chinese toddlers pee right onto the street through a
perpetually gaping front-to-back slit in their pants.) I like the
elaborate charts explaining to education-obsessed Chinese parents
why the games are a scientific method of improving your one and
only child's hand-eye coordination, sequencing skills or attention
span.
</P>
<P>
   As the kids play, I sometimes chat about this and that with the
other parents, who I know by their age must have spent childhoods
separated from their families or living as peasants in the
countryside during the madness of the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   We've come from such different places to be here.
</P>
<P>
   I'm perpetually surprised that so many Chinese can afford such
outings, with tickets to Fundazzle going for $5 per child in a city
where the average monthly income is officially $100. Even more that
so many flock to the new Haagen Dazs, where we hesitate to go
because the sundaes can set you back more than $10.
</P>
<P>
   But there are now Beijing residents whose spending power far
outstrips mine.
</P>
<P>
   They would not be caught dead owning our tinny Beijing Jeep, for
example, which we bought because high import duties precluded an
imported car. Some have even joined expatriate corporate executives
in whitewashed villa complexes in the suburbs of Beijing, places
with names like Celebrity Gardens and Capital Paradise, with
detached 4 bedroom homes, backyards and guards.
</P>
<P>
   We won't follow, even though I hate the city's pollution and
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban developments of Beijing feel too much like the
suburbs of St. Louis or Phoenix. You could be anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm grateful that moving someplace exotic gave me license
to get behind Price Smart's enormous orange shopping carts. Member
shopping is cheap and convenient. And, Manhattanites, if you're too
proud to do it close to home, come to China and check it out.

BEYOND THE DALAI LAMA: HIS SUCCESSOR COULD BE THE SOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By SETH FAISON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LHASA, Tibet _ In a small movie-and-noodle house on a side
street in the Tibetan portion of this holy city, a pair of young
monks in red robes were watching a Hong Kong kung fu movie and
slurping bowls of the house special when the Dalai Lama's name came
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dalai Lama is everything,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other Tibetans, this young monk worships the Dalai
Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, like a god and a king.
Despite years of Chinese efforts to discredit Tibet's religious
leader and years of persecution of Tibetans who support him,
Tibetans still express such fanatical devotion to the Dalai Lama
that it is evident that China cannot ignore him.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Washington last week, the Dalai Lama said he wanted to
negotiate with Beijing for greater self-rule in Tibet, but warned
that there is such a deep level of distrust between his exiled
forces and Beijing that real talks may not be possible for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials are so strongly opposed to the Dalai Lama
precisely because he still has strong influence here, even though
he fled in 1959. They portray him as the tool of foreign powers who
want to undermine China's unity.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little room for a compromise that would satisfy both
Chinese and Tibetans during the Dalai Lama's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   All of this creates a dilemma for the Chinese when it comes to
dealing with the issue of succession. When the Dalai Lama _ who is
63 and apparently in good health _ dies, a replacement must be
chosen within Tibet, now controlled by China. Will Chinese leaders
try to control the selection with their own candidate, whom
Tibetans may or may not believe in, or will they try to prevent the
selection of a replacement altogether?
</P>
<P>
   Tibetans cling to the ancient belief that their religious leader
is reincarnated in a young boy somewhere on the Tibetan plateau,
and he can be found only by a deeply mystical and secretive process
that by its nature is open to manipulation and earthly
interference, as it has been throughout centuries of Tibetan
history.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Tibetans chose a Dalai Lama, in the 1930s, Tibetan
elders traveled to a holy lake and waited to have visions, which
apparently came in only the most obscure way, reflecting simple
sounds _ ``ah,'' ``ka'' and ``ma'' _ that they later decided may
have been a reference to the northern area of Amdo, and perhaps to
the nearby monastery of Kumbum.
</P>
<P>
   Iffy as this may sound, the elders later explained their choice
of a young boy in Amdo, saying that he had recognized a rosary that
belonged to the previous Dalai Lama and claiming it to be his own.
The boy also identified the home monastery of the senior elder
among them, they said, despite their disguises as ordinary
tradesmen.
</P>
<P>
   When the local warlord in the region heard that elders were
looking for a reincarnation of an important Tibetan religious
leader, he demanded fantastic bribes to let the child go.
</P>
<P>
   Devout Tibetans say the procedure produced a remarkably
charismatic and graceful leader who now charms audiences around the
world with his arguments for nonviolent change in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, though
a cynic might observe that it came months after the Tiananmen
crackdown in Beijing, perhaps in part as a way to condemn that act,
which was unrelated to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The succession issue of the Dalai Lama is filled with irony,
contradiction, and paradox,'' said Cheng Li, a professor of Chinese
politics at Hamilton College in New York who is studying Tibet.
``It seems that the parties most interested _ the Chinese
authorities, Tibetan exiles and the Western world _ are all
hypocritical and inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders had a dry run for the succession issue when the
Panchen Lama, recognized as the second-most important Tibetan
religious figure, died unexpectedly at the age of 50 in 1989. The
results have been disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that exiled Tibetans might try to secretly name their
own Panchen Lama, officials in Beijing authorized a search group to
find a reincarnation whom they could control. They entrusted the
abbot of Tashilumpo Monastery, the traditional seat of power for
the Panchen Lama's sect of Tibetan Buddhism, to oversee the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A boy was duly found, in quite the same mystical fashion that
produced the Dalai Lama. But the boy's name was quietly passed to
the Dalai Lama, who approved the choice before Beijing had a chance
to announce it. Beijing was so angered that it denounced the boy,
put his parents under detention, arrested the abbot who had been in
charge of the process and announced that a new boy would be
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Advised that past disagreements over the selection of a
religious leader had sometimes been settled by drawing ivory lots
from a holy golden urn, Beijing leaders chose this method.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a spectacle: A senior official of the atheist
Communist Party overseeing an elaborate religious ceremony in
Tibet, declaring that only Beijing could be the final arbiter of
any choice. A new Panchen Lama was proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage was done. Today, most Tibetans seem to believe
the first boy, who has disappeared, to be the true reincarnation of
the Panchen Lama, and Beijing's second candidate to be a fake.
</P>
<P>
   Next time around, Chinese officials say, they may decide that
they are better off blocking the choice of any lama at all.
</P>
<P>
   Ma Chongying, the deputy director of the Minority and Religious
Affairs Bureau in Tibet, seemed to signal that as the preferred
course recently when he said, ``When the Dalai Lama dies, he dies.
There will be no replacement.''

BRITAIN'S OF TWO MINDS ON GAY SEX 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Last month, the Daily Telegraph, Britain's most
respected conservative newspaper, published a column by Tom Utley,
one of its regular contributors. Utley said the time had come for
him to make a public confession: He didn't like gay people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my suspicion is right, the great majority of us still
believe, in our heart of hearts, that there is something nasty and
wrong about homosexual intercourse,'' he wrote. ``What has changed
is that it is no longer considered respectable to say so publicly.
Whereas half a century ago, it was a jolly brave thing to invite
scorn by admitting to a weakness for the love that dared not speak
its name, today all the opprobrium is directed at those of us who
disapprove.''
</P>
<P>
   Utley added that he was expecting a deluge of mail attacking him
for his view. Instead, he said a few days later, he had been
startled to receive the opposite: more than 500 letters in support
of his editorial. ``I do think people are mildly anti-homosexual,''
said his boss, Charles Moore, the editor of the Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   While the Telegraph was having its mostly one-sided discussion,
a larger debate was being played out in Britain over the issue of
homosexuality in political life. In recent weeks, one Cabinet
minister has resigned in disgrace after being beaten up and robbed
in a park known as a gay hangout, and the nation has been informed
that at least two other Cabinet ministers it thought were
heterosexual were in fact homosexual (a fourth has been openly gay
for years).
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew quite how to cope with this news, although Prime
Minister, Tony Blair said he didn't care about the sexual
orientation of his ministers, only their job performance. The Sun,
Britain's most popular daily newspaper, took the opportunity to
declare its fear that Britain was being run by a ``gay Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun then dramatically flip-flopped, saying that it had
changed its mind and would no longer out anyone who didn't want to
be outed. But its abrupt vacillations reflected a broader disquiet
in the country, which is in a serious muddle over homosexuals and
gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and more people coming out and that's why we
have a greater tolerance now,'' said Mark Watson, communications
director of Stonewall, a group that lobbies on gay and lesbian
issues. ``But Britain has always had a problem with sex as a whole.
We're not very good at discussing it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that attitude that underlies a strain of traditional
comedy in Britain, in which sexuality is broached in innuendo or in
entendre-laden slapstick _ the ``nudge-nudge, wink-wink'' approach
lampooned so effectively by Monty Python. One of the stock
characters in the popular British Christmas pantomimes is the Dame
_ a cross-dressing man with a booming voice and hairy legs who does
things like strip down to reveal a pair of blinking light bulbs on
his chest. Everyone thinks he's hilarious; no one discusses why.
</P>
<P>
   But those things are associated with an older generation, Watson
said, and society is actually becoming more open. At the same time,
the law has failed to catch up. This is partly because until the
Labor government came to power 18 months ago, the country was run
for nearly 20 years by the Tory party, which represents an older,
more conservative generation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Britain has few laws supporting homosexual rights.
Consenting sex between two gay men in private was partly
decriminalized in 1967, although sex involving more than two men,
or sex in a public place (which technically includes hotel rooms)
is still illegal, as is sex between two men if either is under the
age of 18. Although the House of Commons voted to lower the age at
which gay men could have sex to 16 last year, the move was thwarted
by the House of Lords _ after a debate in which many of the Lords,
ex public-school boys, railed against the idea of ``buggery''
between teachers and schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are no laws protecting homosexuals against
discrimination at work, and no laws giving gay and lesbian couples
the same rights as married couples, in housing, estate taxes, and
the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a dichotomy between the laws of this country, which
are very restrictive, and what's actually happening on the
ground,'' Watson said. ``In London, certainly, there is a great
tolerance. London is probably one of the gay capitals of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Bradshaw, a young and telegenic member of Parliament from
Exeter, was a beneficiary of the newfound tolerance during the last
election, when he ran as an openly gay candidate against an openly
homophobic candidate who urged people not to let ``the pink flag
fly over Exeter.'' When Bradshaw won the election, he refused to
shake his opponent's hand.
</P>
<P>
   But if life is becoming easier for him and others, why did so
many people agree with Utley's anti-gay editorial?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a generational thing,'' Watson said. ``The Telegraph
readers are the same people who didn't embrace Blair's new Britain,
who are being left behind by what is becoming a more inclusive and
tolerant society.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as Mrs. M. Williams from
Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lancashire, one of Utley's fans, wrote
approvingly to the Telegraph: ``My sincere thanks to Tom Utley for
his clear and honest statement on homosexuality. I am sure he puts
into words the view of the vast majority.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: `Unconditional' a tough word to enforce
 &HT;    (For release Nov. 18, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, used
that word again last weekend: Unconditional. So did Great Britain's
prime minister, Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   They used it in reaction to the letter sent by Saddam Hussein to
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, a letter said to be fraught with
an annex of conditions for the return of U.N. weapons inspectors to
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In the following hours, either Baghdad backed down from those
conditions, or the Western interpreters of the conditions came to
the conclusion that they had misinterpreted the context of the
annex.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Bill Clinton called off the attack.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard Berger and Blair using the word ``unconditional,''
I was reminded of the closing days of World War II, and of how the
Allies successfully used that term on Nazi Germany, but how it was
not enforced on Imperial Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1945, the Japanese nation was in shambles,
conventionally bombed to the ground by the U.S., and now reeling
from the devastating impact of two atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Reiterating what was agreed to by Franklin Roosevelt and Winston
Churchill at the 1943 Casablanca Conference, the Allies said in
July 1945 that Japan was to surrender ``unconditionally.'' Looming
in that demand was the future of Emperor Hirohito, who, if not a
leader in the Japanese war machine, was no less than acquiescent.
</P>
<P>
   As Japanese envoys began suing for peace after the second A-bomb
struck Nagasaki, the issue of ``unconditional'' was raised. The
Japanese had but one condition, and that was to preserve the reign
and throne of Hirohito.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Truman, only four months in office as president, took a
careful look at the condition. He came to the conclusion that not
accepting the Japanese request would lengthen the war, and also
make the inevitable occupation of Japan even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Hirohito was seen as divine by the Japanese people. Truman
realized that and, after consulting with his Allies, agreed to the
one condition. As quoted in David McCullough's biography of Truman,
the president decided that if the Japanese wanted to keep Hirohito
in the palace, then ``we'd tell 'em how to keep him.''
</P>
<P>
   Accepting that one condition made it much easier to conclude the
war, to occupy Japan and to demilitarize the Japanese state of
mind.
</P>
<P>
   How often ``unconditional'' will be used by the U.S. and its
supporters in the flashpoint discord between Iraq, and the
conditions laid down to them in the aftermath of the Gulf War, is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of rigid sanctions against Hussein and the
people of Iraq, surely something can be moved. President Clinton is
on record as offering more support to militant Iraqis bent on
overthrowing Hussein, but the Iraqi leader is smarter than that.
</P>
<P>
   He probably learned from Fidel Castro that the best way to avoid
being overthrown is to either kill or export all the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   We really do not know how many of the people of Iraq would
dearly love to see Hussein gone. The out-of-country opposition is
minuscule. Either the world learns to live with Hussein, or Hussein
learns to live with the world.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, there has to be a little give-and-take. Hussein fits
the stereotype of the historical Arab trader. He wants to bargain.
Clinton and Blair do not. The United Nations probably does.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the word ``unconditional'' becomes a barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein is looking for a kernel of something, a blip in the
sanctions. Perhaps it would be best for the continued inspections
of Iraqi war potential if something having to do with a
non-military aspect of the protracted sanctions were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   This is not appeasement, nor was Truman's decision. It just made
things easier to conclude successfully. And lives were saved.

 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their long election postmortem, the religious right and
Republicans tied to it have come to the sober conclusion that the
corpse is doing just fine but the doctor is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Religious right candidates and, for the most part, religious
right issues dropped like flies in a mist of bug spray. The
problem, their mentors are concluding, is not with the candidates'
neo-theocratic and generally retro agenda. The problem is the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   We are, it seems, bad people.
</P>
<P>
   We are said to have fallen from our traditional high moral
rectitude into wastrel ways, sexually sloven, ethically numb and
willing to turn any trick for a spot of good times. We have sold
our honor for a bearish stock market, a little bump in the minimum
wage and promises to save Social Security rather than turning our
old age over to the marketers of financial sundries.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington press, which has been playing piano downstairs in
the bordello for years, professes itself shocked to learn that the
president upstairs fooled around and lied about it all over the
place. The indignant journalists can't understand why the rest of
us aren't equally offended. After all, they've spent months telling
us we would be, any moment now.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Thinkers of the right _ Bill Bennett, William Kristol
and so on _ hold that we have been morally dumbed down to the point
where outrage itself has fled our sorry character and we are
willing nowadays to let tarts and pimps prance through our lives
not only unmolested but even applauded. (See ``Hollywood.'')
</P>
<P>
   And the moguls of the family-values hustle _ Pat Robertson, Gary
Bauer, James Dobson _ know why. It's Satan, until a few years ago
merely the governor of Arkansas but now ringmaster in a national
circus of debauchery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's shabby example and our tolerance of it are said to be
driving the nation to new lows. Curiously, in what we may now
fairly begin to call The Clinton Years, our divorce, teen pregnancy
and crime rates have declined significantly. Our enrollment in
higher education has increased. The economy, even despite the drag
of swooning ones abroad, is famously robust.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe instead of being bad people we're just reasonably
balanced. Sure we'd rather have a Clinton who doesn't mess around
than one who does, but we're willing to live and let live where
human foibles seem more at issue than any great damage to the
commonweal _ the more so when we realize it's thanks only to some
pretty scary prosecutorial zeal that we know about Monica at all.
Maybe we just have a sense of fair play. Maybe, too, we know better
than to think that in letting any peccadillo go unscolded, we are
licensing all depravity. Maybe we voted in Colorado and Washington
against banning what the right calls partial-birth abortions not
because we love infanticide but because we think that practicing
medicine by referendum is one amazingly stupid idea.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1992 GOP convention, Newt Gingrich fulminated against us
for our ``multicultural nihilistic hedonism.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, Newt.

 &HT;    Botanical garden grows closer to its expansion plans
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS AND ILLUSTRATIONS
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine strolling from Piedmont Park into a
world-class greenhouse to marvel at colorful collection of tropical
orchids.
</P>
<P>
   Or crossing a flower-bordered bridge into a garden where
children are taught the importance of plants to our health.
</P>
<P>
   Or observing experts in a laboratory working to reproduce
endangered species of plants that will be retrinduced into the
wilds.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, within the next five years those
options will become reality as the Atlanta Botanical Garden inches
its way toward a $15 million goal for expanding the Midtown oasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to be able to offer something for everyone, to
strike a balance between being fun and exciting and achieving
horticultural excellence,'' said Tricia Allen, campaign chairwoman.
``A lot of people may want to look at a pretty bed of tulips but
don't care about rare plants.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Grow the Great Urban Garden'' campaign, launched two years
ago, recently turned to the public after raising $13 million in
grants and private and corporate gifts, including ones from the
Woodruff Foundation, the Fuqua family and the garden's board. Since
then, more than 1,300 individuals _ a mix of ``old faithful and
newcomer'' supporters _ have chipped in another $1.5 million, said
Allston Glenn, the garden's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in the final push to raise the final half-million
dollars, a sense or urgency looms, as one gift, a $350,000 Kresge
Foundation grant, hinges upon the garden reaching its campaign goal
within the first quarter of 1999. And with just over four months to
go, supporters remain optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been just thrilled by the response so far,'' Allen said.
``It's clear to us that people want this kind of urban garden
that's a part of Piedmont Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The garden, born in 1976 from nearly 30 of the park's western
acres along Piedmont Road, operates as a nonprofit organization,
created to develop and maintain plant collections not only for
enjoyment but also education and research. It's supported by more
than 10,000 memberships, along with admission and donations.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 acres is developed; the other half has been preserved as
woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   And that mix places the garden is an unsual predicament as it
deals with growing pains. The additions of a children's garden, an
orchid house and conference facilities are aimed at drawing more
visitors. But while some additional parking, concessions and
restrooms are planned to supplement its 125-space lot, no major
facilities are on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission here is not to pour concrete,'' Glenn said. ``The
problem is our peak times'' _ mainly on weekends in spring and
summer.
</P>
<P>
   To alleviate congestion, the staff has been working with the
Midtown Alliance to encourage public transportation to the garden.
In addition, the two are lobbying the city to build sidewalks along
the garden's side of Piedmont Road to encourage more pedestrian
traffic. The garden also plans to add a pedestrian entrance at the
exit gate, south of the entrance. And there have been discussions
about adding an entrance from Piedmont Park that would be open only
during special events.
</P>
<P>
   None of the challenges are new.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with a long-range plan of what we wanted here back
in 1993,'' said Allen, who co-chairs the campaign with Rex Fuqua.
``We knew we needed more to offer in winter. We knew we needed to
attract more families.''
</P>
<P>
   The garden then hired Environmental Planning and Design of
Pittsburgh to develop a master plan, which consists of three
phases:
</P>
<P>
   _ Phase 1: The children's garden. The centerpiece of the plan,
the $3 million garden is a partnership with Scottish Rite
Children's Medical Center that will emphasize wellness. ``Children
will be shown how food is grown in a garden, experience where it
comes from,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   The key, of course, will be to make it fun. Children will enter
the garden through the mouth of a caterpillar sculpture, followed
by a maze. In addition to vegetable plots, they will tour a bog
with endangered plants and a butterfly pavilion. An amphitheater is
included to encourage more parent-child activities on Saturday
mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Construction began last spring, and the grand opening is planned
for September.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the garden, situated between the entrance and Piedmont
Road, visitors will cross a Flower Bridge spanning the entry road
containing gates by ironsmith Andrew Crawford. Seasonal flowers
will spill from planters lining the railings of the $900,000
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Phase 2: The Orchid House. The garden's Dorothy Chapman Fuqua
Conservatory, which opened in 1989, houses more than 7,000 rare and
endangered tropical and desert plants from around the world,
including orchids. ``We've developed quite a reputation for them,''
Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   And because the plants have become a star attraction from
November to April when attendance is lowest, the garden will expand
that display with the addition of a $3 million Orchid House, which
also will be involved with research and conservation efforts.
Orchids are among the plants endangered by the destruction of
tropical rain forests. The garden staff also is involved in the
Georgia Plant Conservation Alliance, a program to preserve and
restore native plant habitats throughout the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   To focus public awareness on those efforts, plans call for a $1
million Center for Conservation and Education, to be built adjacent
to the Orchid House, where visitors will be able to observe staff
activities, such as propagating plants. ``We decided we wanted
people to be able to actually see what's going on here behind the
scenes,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Those facilities are expected to open in 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Phase 3: Visitor services: The garden also would like to
expand its educational efforts. Its auditorium, Day Hall, seats
350, and full houses are common to hear presentations by popular
experts. ``Being in the center of Atlanta and with the airport we
have, we are able to attract world renowned speakers,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for adding in 2001 a conference hall that will seat
125 and renovating existing facilities. Additional parking and
other improvements would be made by 2,003, at a total cost of $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign goal also includes a $1 million endowment as well
as funds for enhancing other programs.

 &HT;    Commentary: A Rosebud withers
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let me tell you about ``the picture.'' It has a rich history in
our family.
</P>
<P>
   Surely there are others like us who, when first married, gladly
accepted family donations of old furniture. Believe me, we were
genuinely grateful for those well-worn chairs and tables.
Otherwise, it would have been Early American Orange Crate and
Cement Block Shelves throughout our humble abode.
</P>
<P>
   After my husband's parents died, the children went home to
settle the estate. Since we still were living with this old
hand-me-down furniture, we got much of theirs. It was all
relatively new and an unexpected windfall to us _ except for ``the
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a large framed painting that hung in their living room for
decades. It's your basic nondescript pastoral scene, but it has a
large, ornate, gold-leaf frame that harkens to King Louis XV.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, I don't like it. It's a monstrosity. Evidently,
though, I failed to give that impression to others.
</P>
<P>
   As my husband and his siblings were sorting through the house,
they moved to the picture. They all quietly studied it until my
husband finally turned to his niece and said, ``I feel quite sure
Grandma would have wanted you to have this.''
</P>
<P>
   Startled, she hurried to say, ``Oh, I couldn't possibly.''
Turning to her sister, she said, ``It should go to you. That would
have made Grammy happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went, through one female relative after another. Each
one quickly distancing themselves from the possibility of owning
``the picture.'' I, on the other hand, was not there to defend
myself. I had remained at home with our children.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, under intense pressure, one of the granddaughters
agreed to take the picture. As she resignedly took it from the
wall, she turned it over and found one word written on the back in
Grammy's hand: ``Vicki.''
</P>
<P>
   Although I was 700 miles away, at that very moment I noted a
shadow move across the sun.
</P>
<P>
   And so the picture was mine. It has hung over our couch for the
last six years. With kind remembrances of the fine woman who
bequeathed it, I have looked at it every single day . . . and
longed to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, we painted our front room and have been redecorating a
bit. New wall hangings, window treatments and the like. Since the
walls have been painted, I have not rehung ``the picture.'' It
remains leaning against a back wall.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, my husband finally asked, ``So when are we going
to put the picture back up?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not,'' I said bravely.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' he uttered in disbelief. ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't go anymore. The colors are all wrong with our
walls,'' I explained. Heaven knows, I carefully took that very
thing into consideration when I chose the paint.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me forlornly and said, ``But I like that picture.
It reminds me of home.'' Never mind that nearly every piece of
furniture we have is from his home. Suddenly it's not enough
without ``the picture,'' too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, dear, but this is our home, not yours. It's time for a
new picture,'' I said firmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always kind of thought of it as my `Rosebud,' '' he said,
referring to Orson Welles' childhood sled in the film classic
Citizen Kane.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Rosebud, I thought to myself. That blasted painting has
been a perpetual thorn in my side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well then,'' I said, ``why don't we hang it out in the garage
next to your old sled?''
</P>
<P>
   This is a family newspaper, so I won't share his reply. But
you'd think after 20 years of marriage, your spouse would have a
better grasp of the fine art of compromise.

 &HT;    Giving a kick to the young world of soccer
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ There are few things more comical than watching a
gaggle of 7-year-olds playing soccer. They alternately run off in
all directions, as if playing tag, or swarm the ball like hornets
roused from the nest. They have to be not-so-gently reminded not to
score for the other team.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe there's one thing more comical than watching
7-year-olds playing soccer: watching my particular 7-year-old
playing soccer. Or, more precisely, doing his darnedest not to play
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   This is not from spectacular lack of ability but from
spectacular lack of inclination. It's not so much that Alec can't
play soccer as that, like Bartleby the Scrivener, he would prefer
not to.
</P>
<P>
   When he played in a Lollipop League last fall, Alec didn't seem
any more clueless than the other kids. Peer pressure compelled us
to sign up for soccer at the Northwest YMCA this fall. ``He isn't
signed up for soccer?'' friends asked, as if this portended ill for
his future prospects.
</P>
<P>
   At the first practice, things looked promising. Jim and I
noticed Alec all at attention, his eyes scanning the field eagerly
_ ready to take charge and drive the ball down the field, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. Turns out he was looking for someone to talk
to.
</P>
<P>
   Alec loves his cleats, his T-shirt, the name of his team (the
Sharks), the new and old friends on his team, and the sugar-high
snack after the game. It is only soccer itself he objects to.
</P>
<P>
   At this age, only one or two kids really get it, tracking the
ball like a guided missile. There's the great clump in the middle,
who show up in the vicinity of the ball even if they don't know
what to do with it. And then there's Alec, eyeing that
black-and-white sphere as if it were radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to find soccer an impolite, uncivilized game. ``There's
so much kicking and pushing for the ball,'' he protests. He thinks
players should advance the ball in polite, orderly turns, like
English gentlemen at croquet: ``It's your ball, Alec!'' ``No, no,
Andrew, please, I beg of you, it's your ball.''
</P>
<P>
   If Alec were to rewrite the rules of the game, he'd no doubt
require players to stand around discussing where the ball should
land. Failing that, he is seized by ``growing pains'' that
miraculously disappear by snack time.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, we gave him the benefit of the doubt. Not any
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks as if the old war wound is acting up again,'' said our
friend Frank, also known as Andrew's father, as Alec limped
theatrically across the field. ``Or maybe that college ball
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, when the ball heads straight for him and he has no
choice, Alec kicks it. This calls for blow-by-blow commentary. No
matter if play has moved on, Alec runs to the sideline to brag to
the coach how he blocked a shot or cut off a player.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches are unfailingly patient and encouraging, in keeping
with the YMCA's low-pressure, child-friendly philosophy. Nobody
keeps score, except the kids themselves. Alec participates in
post-game wrapup as avidly as he avoids actual play. ``He didn't
even try to block that shot!'' he'll gripe.
</P>
<P>
   Fate, it appears, has not destined me to be a soccer mom. I
suppose I should feel bad about that. What if his whole future is
blighted by his lack of finesse on the soccer field?
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, I'm sure Alec will come up with a noble
explanation for why it's not his fault. Those old war wounds, after
all, will get you every time.

 &HT;    Online shopping becomes practical
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Opening day of trout season, the first football game
of the year and the start of school are all major occasions. But
none of them touch _ for both excitement and panic _ the beginning
of the holiday shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us will end up spending Christmas Eve, elbow-to-elbow,
with other members of the last-minute club. There have always been
alternatives, including using catalogs to order gifts by mail.
Within the past few years, shopping online has become a practical
option.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a veteran online shopper, then you already have a
long list of favorite sites. But if this is the year you will make
your first tentative steps into the world of online commerce, then
may we suggest a cautious entry. Let's take a look today at some
stores you already know, along with an online merchant known for
fast and efficient service. If these first steps prove helpful,
you'll soon be recommending sites of your own.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop, L.L. Bean, didn't invent catalog shopping but
for many years it has been a favorite stop for holiday shoppers.
You'll find the Bean site at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .llbean.com/. Once you are there, you'll be able to view any
product in the catalog and, if you like what you see, you can place
your order online.
</P>
<P>
   The Bean site is worthwhile even if you feel more comfortable
ordering from a catalog and dealing with a customer service
representative by telephone. You can get a quick look at what's
available and then, if you like what you see, order a catalog at
the click of a mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in a metro area, you have undoubtedly shopped at
Macy's. You can have most of that shopping experience online. All
that's missing from the electronic version of the store are the
escalators and the canned holiday music. If you drop in at
http://www.macys.com you'll find the familiar departments of the
store, everything from the jewelry counter to the men's department.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say, while browsing the men's department, the Claiborne
Menswear Three-Button ``Bedford'' Sportcoat with Cord Effect at
$152 catches your eye. The next step would be to select a size from
36 to 46 and then click on a button to add the item to your virtual
shopping cart. Then when you're ready to place the order, simply
fill in the charge card information, and your shopping trip is
done.
</P>
<P>
   While you have never gone shopping in a brick-and-stone version
of Amazon.com, this online bookstore is worth a stop. Not
surprisingly, you'll find it at http://www.amazon.com. But you may
be surprised at the massive selection of books and music available
here, along with the speed your order is delivered.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage to this online version of the store is it is a lot
easier to find things than in a regular bookstore. You can search
by author, title or keyword. The savvy folks at Amazon.com know the
holiday business amounts to a disproportionate amount of the year's
revenues. Another nice touch is, once your order is shipped, you'll
get an e-mail telling you to watch for it. Delivery times vary, but
some books arrive in as little as two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for those of you with the budget of a newspaperman,
there's Wal-Mart. The excellent site at http://www.wal-mart
</P>
<P>
   .com/ does a good job of duplicating the stock you'd find at a
typical Wal-Mart store. And you'll be able to find the closest
Wal-Mart store to your home, or you can send in your resume to work
for the massive retailer.
</P>
<P>
   And Wal-Mart, taking into account the fear some shoppers have of
online shopping, guarantees the store will pay for any fraudulent
credit card charges not covered by the company that issues your
card.

 &HT;    Fulfilling economists' task will require analysis, luck
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What a miserable time to be an economist.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-November, economists must begin preparing forecasts for
the coming year. But given all that has happened on Wall Street and
in Washington in the last few months, every prognosticator ought to
come clean this December and admit no one has the slightest idea
what will happen in 1999. Certainly 1998 will be remembered as the
year when pundits wore more egg on their faces than Waffle House
cooks did on their aprons.
</P>
<P>
   In the political arena this year, the prophesying was especially
bad. Back in August, when President Clinton was still apologizing
for his cheap affair with a young intern, no one could have
predicted Democrats would end up dancing in the streets on election
night while House Speaker Newt Gingrich would be waltzing toward
the exit.
</P>
<P>
   In the financial markets, stock prices smashed records, then
plunged. Then recovered. Minnesota's improbable Gov.-elect Jesse
``The Body'' Ventura could relate to the typical stockholder's
situation: He's up; he's down; he's in a headlock; no, he's free.
Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   After so much volatility, most Americans would welcome less
news. How about a quiet year of solid accomplishment in Washington?
Maybe some responsible, bipartisan legislation updating banking
laws, reforming bankruptcy rules, deregulating electric utilities
and fixing Social Security?
</P>
<P>
   Could happen. But then again, the president's impeachment
hearings could drag out for months. The distraction could give
Congress new excuses for dodging difficult tasks, such as passing a
health care bill or finding ways to open up more airline
competition.
</P>
<P>
   As hard as it is to predict what may happen in Washington, the
forecaster's job will be even more difficult on Wall Street. Among
the many wild cards for 1999 are:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Y2K problem. That's the software bug that will cause many
computers to misread dates after Dec. 31, 1999. The scope of the
problem is incalculable, with some experts predicting global chaos
and others saying it will cause minor disruptions for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what actually happens on 1/1/00, just knowing the Y2K
bug is out there could hurt the economy in 1999. For example,
federal regulators already have begun advising banks to curtail
credit to small businesses that haven't debugged their computers.
Will that credit crunch choke off the small businesses that create
most new jobs?
</P>
<P>
   _ The euro. On Jan. 1, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain,
Portugal, Luxembourg, Austria, Finland, Ireland and the Netherlands
will begin the process of exchanging their national currencies for
a single new currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists wonder whether a single currency and a strong
central bank can be sustained without a strong central government.
They worry about what will happen to European interest rates and
financial markets as the transition goes forward. The United States
has an enormous stake in the economic and political stability of
Europe, but we'll have no direct say in how the euro conversion
will be handled.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deflation. Prices for basic products from steel slabs to
smoked hams have been falling, yet some economists still fear labor
shortages will lead to rising wages. So what will it be in 1999,
inflation or deflation?
</P>
<P>
   Making predictions for metro Atlanta will be difficult, too.
Will Hartsfield International Airport move forward with massive
expansion plans that could redraw the maps of south Fulton and
north Clayton counties? Will the elaborate blueprints for Midtown
finally be turned into bricks and mortar? Will real estate
developers find themselves caught in another one of our famous
cyclical busts?
</P>
<P>
   Making predictions for 1999 will require careful analysis of
reams of data. Oh, and also a very large dartboard.

 &HT;    Netscape top browser _ for now
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been a neck-and-neck race between Microsoft's
Internet Explorer and Netscape's Communicator for the title of best
browser for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six months, Internet Explorer held the title but
now Netscape has regained the technology lead. That's the opinion
of several Mac reviewers and Walter Mossberg, the esteemed personal
computing columnist for The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   All note, though, Netscape's lead is small and Microsoft has
already said it plans to copy many of the new features added by
Netscape in its next Mac version of Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   However fleeting, Communicator version 4.5 leads for now.
Communicator is really a suite of applications that includes an
e-mail program, newsgroup reader and, of course, the Navigator
browser.
</P>
<P>
   The big reason Communicator has momentarily edged out Microsoft
is a new technology called Smart Browsing. In essence, Smart
Browsing lets you find Web sites and information without typing in
complex Internet addresses. There are two primary parts of Smart
Browsing.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the ability to find sites by typing in common
names. For example, in the narrow location window, type in Apple
Computer and Navigator will take you to the company's home page.
There's no longer any need to type http://www.apple.com.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Browsing isn't perfect by a long shot, but it worked for
me most of the time. When stumped, Smart Browsing will bring up a
search results page.
</P>
<P>
   The other big part of Smart Browsing is a new button at the far
right-hand corner of the title bar. It's called What's Related.
Click on it and the Navigator will present you with a list of
similar sites.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while at the Macsurfer site, I clicked What's
Related. In a split second, it compiled a list of such sites as
MacIntouch, MacFixit and MacCentral.
</P>
<P>
   All of these sites were truly related and worthwhile. They are
presented in a pop-up list when you click on the What's Related
button. You can jump to any site listed by highlighting and
releasing.
</P>
<P>
   Navigator is now part of a large suite of software, which
includes an e-mail program called Messenger. This program too has
been improved. It now lets you quickly view messages without
opening them. The program will also automatically fill in e-mail
addresses from your address book after you type in the first few
letters.
</P>
<P>
   You can check all this out for yourself, for Navigator and its
fuller Communications suite remain free. You can download them from
Netscape's home page at http://www.netscape.com.

 &HT;    Of mice and merchants
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let your fingers do the walking this holiday season.
Why not join the millions of shoppers doing their holiday shopping
online? Remember, in cyberspace there are no crowds, no lines, you
can shop at 4 in the morning or 11 at night, and you never have to
worry about finding a place to park.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce _ known to most consumers as online shopping
_ is rapidly becoming a booming business. Whether you're looking
for books, blue jeans, CDs or chocolates, there's a retailer online
to take your order, ring up the purchase and drop the goods at your
door.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll never have to pick up the telephone or see the inside
of a mall.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, online shopping has grown to meet the
needs of Web surfers who increasingly see the Internet as a
utility. The same users who turn to the Web for quick doses of
breaking news or financial information have come to see it as a
place to shop quickly. Purchasing a book on a site like Amazon.com
takes about 10 minutes or less for returning shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web sites offer ``one click ordering'' that lets you buy an
item, pay for it and log off in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Latour Kadison, a senior online research analyst with
Forrester Research who tracks online retailing trends, says a
handful of savvy retailers were responsible for moving Web shopping
into the mainstream. ``It took the minds of people like Jeff Bezos
at Amazon (http://
</P>
<P>
   www.amazon.com), Michael Dell at Dell Computer
(http://www.dell.com) and the two guys who started CDnow
(http://www.cdnow.com) (brothers Jason and Matthew Olim) to see the
Web is much more than just an information conduit.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest report from Jupiter Communications,
shoppers are expected to spend $2.3 billion online during the 1998
holiday shopping season, more than double the $1.1 billion spent in
1997. However, Jupiter also points out only 16 percent of online
purchases during this period are gift-related, leaving a largely
untapped revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online retailing got off to a very slow start because it was
these anonymous retailers (online-only stores unfamiliar to
consumers) trying to create a market. But when traditional
marketers like Tower Records (http://www.towerrecords.com), J. Crew
(http://www.jcrew.com) and Barnes &AMP; Noble (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .barnesandnoble.com) saw the value and the volume that could be
generated from online sales, it gave the industry a huge boost
forward,'' says Kadison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon was the leader,'' she says, ``and still is in terms of
online market share. But as access explodes in the next several
years and as all these newbies come online, they are going to look
for brands they know in their offline world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadison predicts Amazon, CDnow/N2K and other Web-only retailers
will have to work twice as hard to establish their brands offline
as traditional names set up shop on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Kadison says Web retailing has introduced a need for increased
speed and convenience. Surfers no longer want to wait for long
downloads or fumble through badly designed Web sites. They expect
slick, easy-to-use sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The utility that consumers are finding is convenience,'' she
says. ``That's the most important factor to online consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Vanderbilt, group director of Jupiter's digital commerce
group, says as the online shopping market matures, retailers will
shift their strategy from acquiring shoppers to building online
loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   She says the gift-giving season is an excellent time to foster
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online retailers have been successful in capturing dollars
consumers spend on themselves,'' she says. ``But they have been
unsuccessful in getting those same customers to spend gift dollars
online.'' She thinks services such as gift registries and other
holiday services such as gift wrapping might do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winners from the losers online will be separated by
excellent technology backing up your brand strategy,'' Kadison
says. ``The top three things shoppers want are convenience, ease of
research and competitive prices. As more and more familiar
retailers such as Land's End and Nordstrom come online, it becomes
more convenient for users, and the security fears go down because
of the reputations of these established brands.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Web is a way to do almost anything quickly
and efficiently, it's still a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Web is fun and utilitarian,'' says Kadison. ``You
can do your grocery shopping online and log off right away. But you
can also play games and do other things. It's absolutely both.
That's why the Internet is going to become such a huge part of our
lives in the next century, because it serves such a variety of
needs.''

 &HT;    Magic genie can't fix car's emission
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Being a woman has certain advantages, especially when
it comes to going ``undercover'' in the world of auto repair. I
don't do this sort of thing very often but when I do, it's
eye-opening.
</P>
<P>
   The idea hit me as I was driving home from work last Friday. I
passed a repair shop with a sign stating, ``Fail Your Emissions
Test? See us.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like just the invitation I've been looking for. In
light of the subject I've been discussing for two weeks _ the
likelihood of finding shops able to tackle and repair vehicles that
fail the new emissions test _ this could be an illuminating
experience. I circled the block, pulled into the parking lot and
hastily jotted some notes anticipating the scene that would soon
unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good afternoon, ma'am!'' A smiling young man greeted me.
``What can I do for you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw your sign out front about emissions tests. I hope you
can help me. My daughter's car failed its emissions test last week.
It failed for something called NOx. Can you fix NOx?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have to look at the car and do some diagnostic
testing to see why it failed,'' he explained. ``There are several
reasons cars fail emissions tests. Do you have your failed test
report?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's in with the car. My husband said to ask you if you
have a scan tool and a five-gas analyzer? He said you need them to
test for NOx.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am, we have a scan tool but a four-gas analyzer. We've
been very successful so far identifying most problems using these
tools. We don't actually test the vehicles, we only repair them.
The equipment you're talking about is very expensive and quite
frankly, the state couldn't make up its mind so we didn't want to
invest in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you be sure the car will pass the test with only this
four-gas thing?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we can't promise, but we are relatively certain it will.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my list one last time. ``My husband said to ask if
you have ASE mechanics?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am!'' he smiled. ``We sure do.''
</P>
<P>
   Here was a neat, clean, professional-looking repair shop with
what appeared to be well-trained, professional mechanics. Yet it
was lacking the equipment to verify emission failure repair.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to check out another shop I'd passed specializing in
emissions repairs. I explained the same scenario to the gruff voice
on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go put a catalytic converter on it,'' he barked. ``That'll fix
most of 'em. If it doesn't, bring it in and I'll take a look at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great! Another failed test, another $25 _ and he'll take a
look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was getting later in the afternoon so I decided to
concentrate on some of the chain shops.
</P>
<P>
   One shop had the equipment but insisted it was not needed to
repair the vehicle, only to test it.
</P>
<P>
   Another guy offered to look at my failed test report without
charge. I explained I expected to pay for diagnosis as well as
repair; I only wanted it done with the right equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One shop told me they were not equipped to do the NOx portion of
emission repairs. I thanked him for his honesty.
</P>
<P>
   A service adviser told me that if I brought my car to them they
would hook up their computer, and my car's computer would tell them
everything they needed to know for $59.95. In all my years of
fixing cars I have never seen a car's computer that tells
everything.
</P>
<P>
   I got the biggest laugh out of the last call. I again explained
the ``failed test'' story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am,'' he spouted excitedly. ``You don't need to take your
car to a shop. You just come on down here, and we have all kinds of
stuff right here on the shelf you can put in your tank to make you
pass that test.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' I queried. ``That's great but what about whatever's
broken on my car that made me fail the test in the first place?
Don't I need to get that fixed or it will just get worse?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, ma'am. You just need to put some of this stuff in your
car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean if I use this magic stuff it will actually fix my
car?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am, this stuff will fix your car.''
</P>
<P>
   My son, Jimmy, and I were still laughing when husband John
walked in the door from work. I looked at his wrinkled uniform
indicating another hard day at the shop. I said, ``Looks like it's
time to sell the tools, honey. We've been replaced by a magic genie
in a bottle.''

 &HT;    Station wagon just rolls on; latest versions worth a look
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Station wagons reached their glory days in the 1950s,
but decades earlier, they were conceived to fetch the elite from
the train station to a hotel or spa and provide adequate space in
the rear to carry everything from an overnight case to a steamer
trunk.
</P>
<P>
   This was when those grand vehicles were clad in real wood. Even
today when an auto enthusiast gets the chance to inspect a
well-restored ``woody,'' it is a pure pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But by the late '60s and early '70s, the station wagon had
become an icon of suburbia and not always a flattering one. The
ugly image was parodied in the Chevy Chase movie ``Vacation,'' in
which the family car was a bizarre conglomeration of vehicles
painted a ghastly army green. The color fit; the station wagon had
become almost military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there's a new crop of wagons. The niche was near
extinction _ except for the popular Volvo wagon _ until European
manufacturers opted to give the concept an injection of youth and
vitality.
</P>
<P>
   European drivers love station wagons. Just like Americans, they
have lots to carry. But they don't have lots of road space. The
natural solution is a station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   There is a buffet of wagons in the marketplace. Looking for
elegance, luxury and style? Check out the Mercedes E320.
Resplendent with every option, including all-wheel drive, it can
take on the tasks of any highway sport-utility vehicle and still
fit under the portico at the country club.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a bit more of a traditionalist, Volvo offers wagons
in a variety of configurations from turbo-charged to all-wheel
drive, leather to sunroofs.
</P>
<P>
   If you need the space, but deep down you want a sports car, Audi
has a new Avant. If the Audi A4 is a sports car with a back seat,
then the Avant is a sports car with a back seat and a backpack.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a $34,000 sticker price, but its corporate cousin,
the Volkswagen Passat GLS, offers most all of the same amenities
and performance in an almost as attractive package at about
$23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do these wagons offer great performance, handling and
style, they give superior fuel economy to sport-utilities and
better insurance rates as well. And it doesn't hurt a bit that they
are really cool cars.

 &HT;    Mom98 does Windows and whole lot more

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mother is back, that is, the ``Mother of All
Windows.'' This book, published by Addison Wesley, is a
comprehensive but easy-to-understand guide to Microsoft's Windows
operating system. The latest edition features Windows 98. The book
explains Windows from the inside out in simple language. It also
includes lots of tips. The book doesn't gloss over Windows 98's
many rough spots. It points them out and gives tips on how to work
around them. Mom98, as the publisher has nicknamed its book, is 830
pages long and retails for $40.

</P>
<P>
   First, it was shooting digital deer. Now you can go fishing on
your computer. Knowledge Adventure has released a computer CD game
titled ``Go Fish'' and that's exactly what the game is about. The
game is designed for kids ages 4 through 8. Kids choose between six
different lakes. They can fish solo or participate in a tournament.
The game is available only for Windows PCs. It retails for $20.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a change. A game that started online has now been
published on a computer CD. Usually it's the other way around. The
game is ``Slingo,'' published by Hasbro Interactive. In ``Slingo,''
players spin a wheel to match numbers on a 5x5 card. They have 20
spins to either fill the card with matches or score the highest
number of points. The game is available only for Windows computers
and retails for $20.

 &HT;    Apollo 18 lets you take off for moon
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If seeing the first senior in space got your
rocket-blood pumping all over again, there's a chance to sustain
the surge with a new interactive software program that simulates an
Apollo moon mission.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo 18 was developed by AIM Software with help from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It's called Apollo
18, the Moon Mission, even though Apollo 18 never went to the moon.
The later Apollo trips were scrapped for lack of money. The 1975
voyage that docked with the Soviet Soyuz spaceship is sometimes
called Apollo 18.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM was developed with technical assistance from NASA,
which includes an authentic Apollo 18 training manual and
realistic, ``Houston, we have a problem'' type radio transmission
audio. The program also includes several landing site choices, an
unlimited number of missions and full flight simulation.
</P>
<P>
   The software program has been released in Europe. An American
release is set for January.
</P>
<P>
   The system requires Windows 95, a Pentium processor, 16
megabytes of RAM, 60 megabytes of hard disk space and a video and a
sound card. AIM has not decided what it will charge for the
software but said it will be moderately priced.
</P>
<P>
   Download time still slow
</P>
<P>
   Ever wondered why, even with faster and faster Internet hookups
Web site load time still seems to drag?
</P>
<P>
   The December issue of Yahoo! Internet Life compares load times
among some of the more active Web sites, divided into three sample
searches. The download speed was divided into ``obese,''
``regular'' and ``slim.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sample search was the newsy,
check-your-stocks-while-on-hold search. Included were
http://www.msnbc.com, http://www.cnn.com and http://usatoday
</P>
<P>
   .com.
</P>
<P>
   The MSNBC site was called the ``ultimate porker'' _ very little
text with lots of graphics that cause the articles ``to lumber onto
your screen like Marlon Brando crawling to the summit of Machu
Picchu (a remote, steep site in Peru).'' USA Today's site was
considered the quickest download of the three.
</P>
<P>
   The writer offers tips on how Web designers can speed up their
sites, including avoiding the use of moving images, and offering a
text-only option for those who want just the facts and not the
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The article also lists a few ways for those downloading the
sites to do it more quickly. You can turn off your browser's
ability to handle the heavy, time-draining graphics. This can be
done under the ``preferences'' option on your browser's tool bar.
It also suggests making your voice heard by sending e-mail to the
sluggish sites, asking them to trim the fat.
</P>
<P>
   A Barbie just for you
</P>
<P>
   Mattel Media has come out with the perfect online diversion for
the controlling but creative mind: design-your-own Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   The site, off of http://www.barbie.com, is sort of Dr.
Frankenstein meets Isaac Mizrahi. It lets you name your Barbie,
give it a personality and a hairstyle, pick its hair and eye color
and decide whether it will smile open- or close-mouthed.
</P>
<P>
   Then it lets you choose the wardrobe. Optional clothing includes
a few pieces from Barbie's denim-heavy cool-and-casual collection,
and a couple of evening selections, a lime-green suit and a purple
and gold ball gown.
</P>
<P>
   The finished product is yours to buy, but kids will need their
parents' approval and a major credit card. Mattel tosses in a
certificate to prove the authenticity of your creation.
</P>
<P>
   My Design Barbie will cost about $40, plus $8 for shipping,
which will take at least six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy group online
</P>
<P>
   A local improvisational comedy group is broadcasting its
one-hour show over the Internet, starting this month.
</P>
<P>
   Whole World Theatre, on Spring Street in Midtown, has been
operating as an improv comedy club since 1994. This month, it
started airing the Saturday night show on the Internet, calling it
``Last Hour Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Webcast is available from http://
</P>
<P>
   www.ibtv.com. Go there and click on the Whole World Theatre
icon. The Saturday shows start at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Site devoted to books
</P>
<P>
   Oprah made them more popular and Amazon.com made them easier to
buy. Now http://thebookreport.com, a Web site devoted to all things
books, is making it easier to read up on your favorite books and
authors.
</P>
<P>
   The site, an extension of a popular AOL feature, will offer
author interviews, commentary, book reviews and message boards.
</P>
<P>
   Sites devoted to books for kids and teens are expected soon.
They'll be at http://kidsreads.com and http://teenreads.com.

 &HT;    Printing a screen grab can shake family tree
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has been my experience that if you persist in
computing, you will, every so often, develop a need for software
you never gave a thought to before.
</P>
<P>
   This came about just tonight in my computing room, where my wife
was feverishly _ or at least semi-feverishly _ finishing a
presentation she is making to a computer club. Through the articles
she wrote for me on genealogical computing, she has become somewhat
of a celebrity in the field.
</P>
<P>
   In order to make a nice presentation, she needed to create some
overhead projection transparencies of screen images in her favorite
program, Family Tree Maker. This is a rather specialized function
called a screen grab, and it requires special software.
</P>
<P>
   One can use the Print Screen key, which copies the screen to the
clipboard. But you must then paste the screen to a document and
fiddle with the image until it's the right size.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, an outfit called TechSmith has persisted in sending
me upgrades of its screen grab program, now called SnagIt/32. I
have steadfastly ignored SnagIt until I suddenly needed it.
</P>
<P>
   SnagIt is a small, reasonably simple program that will capture
screen images, video images and even text when no other options are
available for cutting and pasting it. It will then send the image
to a printer, a file or the clipboard.
</P>
<P>
   It can even be set to ``auto scroll,'' which means it will grab
an entire screen, even if the screen is longer than your display,
and fit it onto a single page.
</P>
<P>
   You simply get the screen you wish on display, call up
SnagIt/32, set the output for the desired destination, and press
the screen grab hot keys. Well, not really. If you do that, your
screen grab will have the SnagIt window on top of everything else.
First minimize SnagIt, then press the hot keys.
</P>
<P>
   Of course in our operation, everything was more complicated. To
make these overhead projection sheets, you have to buy special
transparent plastic stuff on which to print. My wife, of course,
wanted color transparencies, but her computer is hooked up to a
laser printer, which doesn't do color. Mine, on the other hand, is
hooked up to a LexMark 5700 inkjet printer, which does color very
well.
</P>
<P>
   She went to an office supply store and got a package of
transparencies for inkjets _ you have to be careful to get the kind
that works with the printer you have. They're not cheap, either, at
20 sheets for $15. They are also very easily marred by fingerprints
or by putting them on top of warm coffeecake.
</P>
<P>
   To make this work, we installed SnagIt on both computers. She
grabbed the image she wanted and saved it to a bitmap file on a Zip
disc, and passed it to me. I used SnagIt to take the file from the
disk and send it to the printer.
</P>
<P>
   This operation took all night, chiefly because my print spooler
crashed about every three printings, requiring a restart of the
entire computer. We are now well into the next morning, and my
eyeballs are capsizing. However, we had a jolly time and no one
actually got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   My thanks to TechSmith, whose fine screen grab program costs a
mere $40 and can even be had in a trial version from its Web site
at http://www.techsmith.com.

 &HT;    Common sense protects you when shopping online
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This weekend, as I handed my credit card to the young
person with a nose ring at a small shop in the mall, I couldn't
help but think of all the people who are afraid to buy anything
online for fear some weird hacker will steal their credit card
number.
</P>
<P>
   Now the kid with a nose ring was probably an astrophysics
student at Georgia Tech, and the woman waiter with a nice tattoo
you saw the other day probably is a wonderful person ... but my
point still holds. There is a lot greater chance of credit card
fraud in your everyday life than there is when you buy something
from an established merchant on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When, for instance, is the last time you read about some poor
soul in Des Moines being reduced to poverty because he ordered a
parka from L.L. Bean's Web site? Newspapers, including this one,
have devoted (rightly so) plenty of space to stories about computer
researchers who have found backdoors and flaws in some of the
credit card encoding technology used on the Web. But you haven't
seen a single story about a crook who used those flaws to steal
credit card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But all that said, there are some common sense precautions that
will make your shopping online safer. Not a one of them has
anything to do with algorithms, which is a lucky thing since my
pre-med education was prematurely terminated by a math course
titled Differential Equations. I learned to doodle in that class
and _ somewhere around the four-week mark _ decided that an English
degree would be one heck of a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   This column will be upsetting to some, especially to experts,
since it is mostly common sense advice _ nothing to do with cookies
or setting new preferences for your Web browser. But the truth is
that the best way to protect yourself involves the same kind of
street smarts you'd use in buying a car or a pair of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   That leads us to the top way to protect yourself when shopping
online. Deal only with merchants you know and trust. Sure, a lot of
the no-name outfits out there are run by fine people and, yes, this
isn't fair to them. But if you restrict your dealings to major
stores and Internet merchants, the likelihood of getting ripped off
is almost zero.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with dealing with no-name firms isn't restricted to
the notion that they are likely to cheat you. More likely than
that, by far, are the chances they won't stay in business very
long. Online marketing is a brand new area of commerce and _ just
as in any new field _ plenty of companies will give a good and
honest effort and fail. If you stay with the big guys, you are less
likely to discover that you just ordered a new computer or set of
golf clubs from a company that has joined the list of failures.
</P>
<P>
   The next way to protect yourself _ ironically for all the worry
you might have about credit cards _ is to use a credit card that
offers good customer service. Most credit card companies will stop
payment on a purchase if it is not delivered or if the merchandise
was advertised deceptively. Find out the specific policies of your
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, make sure the online merchant has a way for customers
to get in contact outside of e-mail. If you have trouble with the
company, you'll want to be able to explain your case to a real
human. So consider the customer service of the merchant, and also
give extra points for a toll-free number for customers.
</P>
<P>
   If the notion of shopping online suits you _ then follow these
tips and go right ahead. The real worries from online shopping
aren't in theft and crime, but in the shock you get when the bills
arrive.

 &HT;    Whether vets went or were sent, thanks still due
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A package arrived at our house a few weeks ago addressed to my
husband. In it was a framed certificate. Titled ``Patriotism'', it
read, ``In times of your country's peril, the true and ultimate
test of patriotism and love of country can be summed up in three
simple words: 'Went, Not Sent.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was from my father-in-law, a veteran of World War II, who
left Laird Hill, along with several of his Leverett's Chapel School
buddies to sign up for service after Pearl Harbor. Though the
document which came in the mail bore his signature, identification
number, rank and dates of service, I assumed it had been ordered
from somewhere, so I called to ask where he got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote it,'' he responded. Then, he had it designed and
framed and sent copies to his son, his former brother-in-law and
those of his friends still living who volunteered for military
service during wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Why did he do it, I asked him.
</P>
<P>
   A plainspoken man, he said. ``Well, sometimes I get into a mix
with some of these old fuddy duddies my age who always like to crow
about their service time.'' Many of them, he said, ``dodged the
draft as long as they could and then kicked and squalled all the
way to the embarkation point.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he wanted to tell those veterans that he knew had raised
their hands to help in time of armed conflict that they were
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I felt needed to be said,'' he told me. ``So
I did.''
</P>
<P>
   As someone who has not served in the military, much less been
fired upon, I speak with no expertise on such matters. But I can
see and hear the pride people like my father-in-law and his
contemporaries have in their personal military history. There is
the same type of pride in those contemporaries of my husband, who
fought in Vietnam. Though, in their voices I also hear the hurt
that still lingers at our country's wish to consign their war to
some dark corner.
</P>
<P>
   What I do know is whether you ``went'' or were ``sent,'' I
benefited from your time in some faraway place among strangers
facing an enemy whose purpose was to kill you.
</P>
<P>
   And whether you ``went'' or were ``sent,'' you have my deepest
gratitude.

 &HT;    Online shopping becomes practical
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Opening day of trout season, the first football game
of the year and the start of school are all major occasions. But
none of them touch _ for both excitement and panic _ the beginning
of the holiday shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us will end up spending Christmas Eve, elbow-to-elbow,
with other members of the last-minute club. There have always been
alternatives, including using catalogs to order gifts by mail.
Within the past few years, shopping online has become a practical
option.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a veteran online shopper, then you already have a
long list of favorite sites. But if this is the year you will make
your first tentative steps into the world of online commerce, then
may we suggest a cautious entry. Let's take a look today at some
stores you already know, along with an online merchant known for
fast and efficient service. If these first steps prove helpful,
you'll soon be recommending sites of your own.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop, L.L. Bean, didn't invent catalog shopping but
for many years it has been a favorite stop for holiday shoppers.
You'll find the Bean site at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .llbean.com/. Once you are there, you'll be able to view any
product in the catalog and, if you like what you see, you can place
your order online.
</P>
<P>
   The Bean site is worthwhile even if you feel more comfortable
ordering from a catalog and dealing with a customer service
representative by telephone. You can get a quick look at what's
available and then, if you like what you see, order a catalog at
the click of a mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in a metro area, you have undoubtedly shopped at
Macy's. You can have most of that shopping experience online. All
that's missing from the electronic version of the store are the
escalators and the canned holiday music. If you drop in at
http://www.macys.com you'll find the familiar departments of the
store, everything from the jewelry counter to the men's department.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say, while browsing the men's department, the Claiborne
Menswear Three-Button ``Bedford'' Sportcoat with Cord Effect at
$152 catches your eye. The next step would be to select a size from
36 to 46 and then click on a button to add the item to your virtual
shopping cart. Then when you're ready to place the order, simply
fill in the charge card information, and your shopping trip is
done.
</P>
<P>
   While you have never gone shopping in a brick-and-stone version
of Amazon.com, this online bookstore is worth a stop. Not
surprisingly, you'll find it at http://www.amazon.com. But you may
be surprised at the massive selection of books and music available
here, along with the speed your order is delivered.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage to this online version of the store is it is a lot
easier to find things than in a regular bookstore. You can search
by author, title or keyword. The savvy folks at Amazon.com know the
holiday business amounts to a disproportionate amount of the year's
revenues. Another nice touch is, once your order is shipped, you'll
get an e-mail telling you to watch for it. Delivery times vary, but
some books arrive in as little as two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for those of you with the budget of a newspaperman,
there's Wal-Mart. The excellent site at http://www.wal-mart
</P>
<P>
   .com/ does a good job of duplicating the stock you'd find at a
typical Wal-Mart store. And you'll be able to find the closest
Wal-Mart store to your home, or you can send in your resume to work
for the massive retailer.
</P>
<P>
   And Wal-Mart, taking into account the fear some shoppers have of
online shopping, guarantees the store will pay for any fraudulent
credit card charges not covered by the company that issues your
card.

 &HT;    Netscape top browser _ for now
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been a neck-and-neck race between Microsoft's
Internet Explorer and Netscape's Communicator for the title of best
browser for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six months, Internet Explorer held the title but
now Netscape has regained the technology lead. That's the opinion
of several Mac reviewers and Walter Mossberg, the esteemed personal
computing columnist for The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   All note, though, Netscape's lead is small and Microsoft has
already said it plans to copy many of the new features added by
Netscape in its next Mac version of Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   However fleeting, Communicator version 4.5 leads for now.
Communicator is really a suite of applications that includes an
e-mail program, newsgroup reader and, of course, the Navigator
browser.
</P>
<P>
   The big reason Communicator has momentarily edged out Microsoft
is a new technology called Smart Browsing. In essence, Smart
Browsing lets you find Web sites and information without typing in
complex Internet addresses. There are two primary parts of Smart
Browsing.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the ability to find sites by typing in common
names. For example, in the narrow location window, type in Apple
Computer and Navigator will take you to the company's home page.
There's no longer any need to type http://www.apple.com.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Browsing isn't perfect by a long shot, but it worked for
me most of the time. When stumped, Smart Browsing will bring up a
search results page.
</P>
<P>
   The other big part of Smart Browsing is a new button at the far
right-hand corner of the title bar. It's called What's Related.
Click on it and the Navigator will present you with a list of
similar sites.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while at the Macsurfer site, I clicked What's
Related. In a split second, it compiled a list of such sites as
MacIntouch, MacFixit and MacCentral.
</P>
<P>
   All of these sites were truly related and worthwhile. They are
presented in a pop-up list when you click on the What's Related
button. You can jump to any site listed by highlighting and
releasing.
</P>
<P>
   Navigator is now part of a large suite of software, which
includes an e-mail program called Messenger. This program too has
been improved. It now lets you quickly view messages without
opening them. The program will also automatically fill in e-mail
addresses from your address book after you type in the first few
letters.
</P>
<P>
   You can check all this out for yourself, for Navigator and its
fuller Communications suite remain free. You can download them from
Netscape's home page at http://www.netscape.com.

available for cutting and pasting it. It will then send the image
to a printer, a file or the clipboard.
</P>
<P>
   It can even be set to ``auto scroll,'' which means it will grab
an entire screen, even if the screen is longer than your display,
and fit it onto a single page.
</P>
<P>
   You simply get the screen you wish on display, call up
SnagIt/32, set the output for the desired destination, and press
the screen grab hot keys. Well, not really. If you do that, your
screen grab will have the SnagIt window on top of everything else.
First minimize SnagIt, then press the hot keys.
</P>
<P>
   Of course in our operation, everything was more complicated. To
make these overhead projection sheets, you have to buy special
transparent plastic stuff on which to print. My wife, of course,
wanted color transparencies, but her computer is hooked up to a
laser printer, which doesn't do color. Mine, on the other hand, is
hooked up to a LexMark 5700 inkjet printer, which does color very
well.
</P>
<P>
   She went to an office supply store and got a package of
transparencies for inkjets _ you have to be careful to get the kind
that works with the printer you have. They're not cheap, either, at
20 sheets for $15. They are also very easily marred by fingerprints
or by putting them on top of warm coffeecake.
</P>
<P>
   To make this work, we installed SnagIt on both computers. She
grabbed the image she wanted and saved it to a bitmap file on a Zip
disc, and passed it to me. I used SnagIt to take the file from the
disk and send it to the printer.
</P>
<P>
   This operation took all night, chiefly because my print spooler
crashed about every three printings, requiring a restart of the
entire computer. We are now well into the next morning, and my
eyeballs are capsizing. However, we had a jolly time and no one
actually got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   My thanks to TechSmith, whose fine screen grab program costs a
mere $40 and can even be had in a trial version from its Web site
at http://www.techsmith.com.

 &HT;    Common sense protects you when shopping online
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This weekend, as I handed my credit card to the young
person with a nose ring at a small shop in the mall, I couldn't
help but think of all the people who are afraid to buy anything
online for fear some weird hacker will steal their credit card
number.
</P>
<P>
   Now the kid with a nose ring was probably an astrophysics
student at Georgia Tech, and the woman waiter with a nice tattoo
you saw the other day probably is a wonderful person ... but my
point still holds. There is a lot greater chance of credit card
fraud in your everyday life than there is when you buy something
from an established merchant on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   When, for instance, is the last time you read about some poor
soul in Des Moines being reduced to poverty because he ordered a
parka from L.L. Bean's Web site? Newspapers, including this one,
have devoted (rightly so) plenty of space to stories about computer
researchers who have found backdoors and flaws in some of the
credit card encoding technology used on the Web. But you haven't
seen a single story about a crook who used those flaws to steal
credit card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But all that said, there are some common sense precautions that
will make your shopping online safer. Not a one of them has
anything to do with algorithms, which is a lucky thing since my
pre-med education was prematurely terminated by a math course
titled Differential Equations. I learned to doodle in that class
and _ somewhere around the four-week mark _ decided that an English
degree would be one heck of a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   This column will be upsetting to some, especially to experts,
since it is mostly common sense advice _ nothing to do with cookies
or setting new preferences for your Web browser. But the truth is
that the best way to protect yourself involves the same kind of
street smarts you'd use in buying a car or a pair of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   That leads us to the top way to protect yourself when shopping
online. Deal only with merchants you know and trust. Sure, a lot of
the no-name outfits out there are run by fine people and, yes, this
isn't fair to them. But if you restrict your dealings to major
stores and Internet merchants, the likelihood of getting ripped off
is almost zero.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with dealing with no-name firms isn't restricted to
the notion that they are likely to cheat you. More likely than
that, by far, are the chances they won't stay in business very
long. Online marketing is a brand new area of commerce and _ just
as in any new field _ plenty of companies will give a good and
honest effort and fail. If you stay with the big guys, you are less
likely to discover that you just ordered a new computer or set of
golf clubs from a company that has joined the list of failures.
</P>
<P>
   The next way to protect yourself _ ironically for all the worry
you might have about credit cards _ is to use a credit card that
offers good customer service. Most credit card companies will stop
payment on a purchase if it is not delivered or if the merchandise
was advertised deceptively. Find out the specific policies of your
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, make sure the online merchant has a way for customers
to get in contact outside of e-mail. If you have trouble with the
company, you'll want to be able to explain your case to a real
human. So consider the customer service of the merchant, and also
give extra points for a toll-free number for customers.
</P>
<P>
   If the notion of shopping online suits you _ then follow these
tips and go right ahead. The real worries from online shopping
aren't in theft and crime, but in the shock you get when the bills
arrive.

 &HT;    Of mice and merchants
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let your fingers do the walking this holiday season.
Why not join the millions of shoppers doing their holiday shopping
online? Remember, in cyberspace there are no crowds, no lines, you
can shop at 4 in the morning or 11 at night, and you never have to
worry about finding a place to park.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce _ known to most consumers as online shopping
_ is rapidly becoming a booming business. Whether you're looking
for books, blue jeans, CDs or chocolates, there's a retailer online
to take your order, ring up the purchase and drop the goods at your
door.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll never have to pick up the telephone or see the inside
of a mall.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, online shopping has grown to meet the
needs of Web surfers who increasingly see the Internet as a
utility. The same users who turn to the Web for quick doses of
breaking news or financial information have come to see it as a
place to shop quickly. Purchasing a book on a site like Amazon.com
takes about 10 minutes or less for returning shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web sites offer ``one click ordering'' that lets you buy an
item, pay for it and log off in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Latour Kadison, a senior online research analyst with
Forrester Research who tracks online retailing trends, says a
handful of savvy retailers were responsible for moving Web shopping
into the mainstream. ``It took the minds of people like Jeff Bezos
at Amazon (http://
</P>
<P>
   www.amazon.com), Michael Dell at Dell Computer
(http://www.dell.com) and the two guys who started CDnow
(http://www.cdnow.com) (brothers Jason and Matthew Olim) to see the
Web is much more than just an information conduit.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest report from Jupiter Communications,
shoppers are expected to spend $2.3 billion online during the 1998
holiday shopping season, more than double the $1.1 billion spent in
1997. However, Jupiter also points out only 16 percent of online
purchases during this period are gift-related, leaving a largely
untapped revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online retailing got off to a very slow start because it was
these anonymous retailers (online-only stores unfamiliar to
consumers) trying to create a market. But when traditional
marketers like Tower Records (http://www.towerrecords.com), J. Crew
(http://www.jcrew.com) and Barnes &AMP; Noble (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .barnesandnoble.com) saw the value and the volume that could be
generated from online sales, it gave the industry a huge boost
forward,'' says Kadison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon was the leader,'' she says, ``and still is in terms of
online market share. But as access explodes in the next several
years and as all these newbies come online, they are going to look
for brands they know in their offline world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadison predicts Amazon, CDnow/N2K and other Web-only retailers
will have to work twice as hard to establish their brands offline
as traditional names set up shop on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Kadison says Web retailing has introduced a need for increased
speed and convenience. Surfers no longer want to wait for long
downloads or fumble through badly designed Web sites. They expect
slick, easy-to-use sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The utility that consumers are finding is convenience,'' she
says. ``That's the most important factor to online consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Vanderbilt, group director of Jupiter's digital commerce
group, says as the online shopping market matures, retailers will
shift their strategy from acquiring shoppers to building online
loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   She says the gift-giving season is an excellent time to foster
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online retailers have been successful in capturing dollars
consumers spend on themselves,'' she says. ``But they have been
unsuccessful in getting those same customers to spend gift dollars
online.'' She thinks services such as gift registries and other
holiday services such as gift wrapping might do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winners from the losers online will be separated by
excellent technology backing up your brand strategy,'' Kadison
says. ``The top three things shoppers want are convenience, ease of
research and competitive prices. As more and more familiar
retailers such as Land's End and Nordstrom come online, it becomes
more convenient for users, and the security fears go down because
of the reputations of these established brands.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Web is a way to do almost anything quickly
and efficiently, it's still a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Web is fun and utilitarian,'' says Kadison. ``You
can do your grocery shopping online and log off right away. But you
can also play games and do other things. It's absolutely both.
That's why the Internet is going to become such a huge part of our
lives in the next century, because it serves such a variety of
needs.''

 &HT;    Magic genie can't fix car's emission
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Being a woman has certain advantages, especially when
it comes to going ``undercover'' in the world of auto repair. I
don't do this sort of thing very often but when I do, it's
eye-opening.
</P>
<P>
   The idea hit me as I was driving home from work last Friday. I
passed a repair shop with a sign stating, ``Fail Your Emissions
Test? See us.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like just the invitation I've been looking for. In
light of the subject I've been discussing for two weeks _ the
likelihood of finding shops able to tackle and repair vehicles that
fail the new emissions test _ this could be an illuminating
experience. I circled the block, pulled into the parking lot and
hastily jotted some notes anticipating the scene that would soon
unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good afternoon, ma'am!'' A smiling young man greeted me.
``What can I do for you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw your sign out front about emissions tests. I hope you
can help me. My daughter's car failed its emissions test last week.
It failed for something called NOx. Can you fix NOx?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have to look at the car and do some diagnostic
testing to see why it failed,'' he explained. ``There are several
reasons cars fail emissions tests. Do you have your failed test
report?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's in with the car. My husband said to ask you if you
have a scan tool and a five-gas analyzer? He said you need them to
test for NOx.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am, we have a scan tool but a four-gas analyzer. We've
been very successful so far identifying most problems using these
tools. We don't actually test the vehicles, we only repair them.
The equipment you're talking about is very expensive and quite
frankly, the state couldn't make up its mind so we didn't want to
invest in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you be sure the car will pass the test with only this
four-gas thing?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we can't promise, but we are relatively certain it will.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my list one last time. ``My husband said to ask if
you have ASE mechanics?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am!'' he smiled. ``We sure do.''
</P>
<P>
   Here was a neat, clean, professional-looking repair shop with
what appeared to be well-trained, professional mechanics. Yet it
was lacking the equipment to verify emission failure repair.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to check out another shop I'd passed specializing in
emissions repairs. I explained the same scenario to the gruff voice
on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go put a catalytic converter on it,'' he barked. ``That'll fix
most of 'em. If it doesn't, bring it in and I'll take a look at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great! Another failed test, another $25 _ and he'll take a
look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was getting later in the afternoon so I decided to
concentrate on some of the chain shops.
</P>
<P>
   One shop had the equipment but insisted it was not needed to
repair the vehicle, only to test it.
</P>
<P>
   Another guy offered to look at my failed test report without
charge. I explained I expected to pay for diagnosis as well as
repair; I only wanted it done with the right equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One shop told me they were not equipped to do the NOx portion of
emission repairs. I thanked him for his honesty.
</P>
<P>
   A service adviser told me that if I brought my car to them they
would hook up their computer, and my car's computer would tell them
everything they needed to know for $59.95. In all my years of
fixing cars I have never seen a car's computer that tells
everything.
</P>
<P>
   I got the biggest laugh out of the last call. I again explained
the ``failed test'' story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am,'' he spouted excitedly. ``You don't need to take your
car to a shop. You just come on down here, and we have all kinds of
stuff right here on the shelf you can put in your tank to make you
pass that test.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' I queried. ``That's great but what about whatever's
broken on my car that made me fail the test in the first place?
Don't I need to get that fixed or it will just get worse?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, ma'am. You just need to put some of this stuff in your
car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean if I use this magic stuff it will actually fix my
car?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am, this stuff will fix your car.''
</P>
<P>
   My son, Jimmy, and I were still laughing when husband John
walked in the door from work. I looked at his wrinkled uniform
indicating another hard day at the shop. I said, ``Looks like it's
time to sell the tools, honey. We've been replaced by a magic genie
in a bottle.''

 &HT;    Station wagon just rolls on; latest versions worth a look
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Station wagons reached their glory days in the 1950s,
but decades earlier, they were conceived to fetch the elite from
the train station to a hotel or spa and provide adequate space in
the rear to carry everything from an overnight case to a steamer
trunk.
</P>
<P>
   This was when those grand vehicles were clad in real wood. Even
today when an auto enthusiast gets the chance to inspect a
well-restored ``woody,'' it is a pure pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But by the late '60s and early '70s, the station wagon had
become an icon of suburbia and not always a flattering one. The
ugly image was parodied in the Chevy Chase movie ``Vacation,'' in
which the family car was a bizarre conglomeration of vehicles
painted a ghastly army green. The color fit; the station wagon had
become almost military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there's a new crop of wagons. The niche was near
extinction _ except for the popular Volvo wagon _ until European
manufacturers opted to give the concept an injection of youth and
vitality.
</P>
<P>
   European drivers love station wagons. Just like Americans, they
have lots to carry. But they don't have lots of road space. The
natural solution is a station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   There is a buffet of wagons in the marketplace. Looking for
elegance, luxury and style? Check out the Mercedes E320.
Resplendent with every option, including all-wheel drive, it can
take on the tasks of any highway sport-utility vehicle and still
fit under the portico at the country club.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a bit more of a traditionalist, Volvo offers wagons
in a variety of configurations from turbo-charged to all-wheel
drive, leather to sunroofs.
</P>
<P>
   If you need the space, but deep down you want a sports car, Audi
has a new Avant. If the Audi A4 is a sports car with a back seat,
then the Avant is a sports car with a back seat and a backpack.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a $34,000 sticker price, but its corporate cousin,
the Volkswagen Passat GLS, offers most all of the same amenities
and performance in an almost as attractive package at about
$23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do these wagons offer great performance, handling and
style, they give superior fuel economy to sport-utilities and
better insurance rates as well. And it doesn't hurt a bit that they
are really cool cars.

 &HT;    Mom98 does Windows and whole lot more

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mother is back, that is, the ``Mother of All
Windows.'' This book, published by Addison Wesley, is a
comprehensive but easy-to-understand guide to Microsoft's Windows
operating system. The latest edition features Windows 98. The book
explains Windows from the inside out in simple language. It also
includes lots of tips. The book doesn't gloss over Windows 98's
many rough spots. It points them out and gives tips on how to work
around them. Mom98, as the publisher has nicknamed its book, is 830
pages long and retails for $40.

</P>
<P>
   First, it was shooting digital deer. Now you can go fishing on
your computer. Knowledge Adventure has released a computer CD game
titled ``Go Fish'' and that's exactly what the game is about. The
game is designed for kids ages 4 through 8. Kids choose between six
different lakes. They can fish solo or participate in a tournament.
The game is available only for Windows PCs. It retails for $20.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a change. A game that started online has now been
published on a computer CD. Usually it's the other way around. The
game is ``Slingo,'' published by Hasbro Interactive. In ``Slingo,''
players spin a wheel to match numbers on a 5x5 card. They have 20
spins to either fill the card with matches or score the highest
number of points. The game is available only for Windows computers
and retails for $20.

 &HT;    Apollo 18 lets you take off for moon
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If seeing the first senior in space got your
rocket-blood pumping all over again, there's a chance to sustain
the surge with a new interactive software program that simulates an
Apollo moon mission.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo 18 was developed by AIM Software with help from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It's called Apollo
18, the Moon Mission, even though Apollo 18 never went to the moon.
The later Apollo trips were scrapped for lack of money. The 1975
voyage that docked with the Soviet Soyuz spaceship is sometimes
called Apollo 18.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM was developed with technical assistance from NASA,
which includes an authentic Apollo 18 training manual and
realistic, ``Houston, we have a problem'' type radio transmission
audio. The program also includes several landing site choices, an
unlimited number of missions and full flight simulation.
</P>
<P>
   The software program has been released in Europe. An American
release is set for January.
</P>
<P>
   The system requires Windows 95, a Pentium processor, 16
megabytes of RAM, 60 megabytes of hard disk space and a video and a
sound card. AIM has not decided what it will charge for the
software but said it will be moderately priced.
</P>
<P>
   Download time still slow
</P>
<P>
   Ever wondered why, even with faster and faster Internet hookups
Web site load time still seems to drag?
</P>
<P>
   The December issue of Yahoo! Internet Life compares load times
among some of the more active Web sites, divided into three sample
searches. The download speed was divided into ``obese,''
``regular'' and ``slim.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sample search was the newsy,
check-your-stocks-while-on-hold search. Included were
http://www.msnbc.com, http://www.cnn.com and http://usatoday
</P>
<P>
   .com.
</P>
<P>
   The MSNBC site was called the ``ultimate porker'' _ very little
text with lots of graphics that cause the articles ``to lumber onto
your screen like Marlon Brando crawling to the summit of Machu
Picchu (a remote, steep site in Peru).'' USA Today's site was
considered the quickest download of the three.
</P>
<P>
   The writer offers tips on how Web designers can speed up their
sites, including avoiding the use of moving images, and offering a
text-only option for those who want just the facts and not the
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The article also lists a few ways for those downloading the
sites to do it more quickly. You can turn off your browser's
ability to handle the heavy, time-draining graphics. This can be
done under the ``preferences'' option on your browser's tool bar.
It also suggests making your voice heard by sending e-mail to the
sluggish sites, asking them to trim the fat.

   A Barbie just for you
</P>
<P>
   Mattel Media has come out with the perfect online diversion for
the controlling but creative mind: design-your-own Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   The site, off of http://www.barbie.com, is sort of Dr.
Frankenstein meets Isaac Mizrahi. It lets you name your Barbie,
give it a personality and a hairstyle, pick its hair and eye color
and decide whether it will smile open- or close-mouthed.
</P>
<P>
   Then it lets you choose the wardrobe. Optional clothing includes
a few pieces from Barbie's denim-heavy cool-and-casual collection,
and a couple of evening selections, a lime-green suit and a purple
and gold ball gown.
</P>
<P>
   The finished product is yours to buy, but kids will need their
parents' approval and a major credit card. Mattel tosses in a
certificate to prove the authenticity of your creation.
</P>
<P>
   My Design Barbie will cost about $40, plus $8 for shipping,
which will take at least six weeks.
</P>

   Comedy group online
</P>
<P>
   A local improvisational comedy group is broadcasting its
one-hour show over the Internet, starting this month.
</P>
<P>
   Whole World Theatre, on Spring Street in Midtown, has been
operating as an improv comedy club since 1994. This month, it
started airing the Saturday night show on the Internet, calling it
``Last Hour Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Webcast is available from http://
</P>
<P>
   www.ibtv.com. Go there and click on the Whole World Theatre
icon. The Saturday shows start at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Site devoted to books
</P>
<P>
   Oprah made them more popular and Amazon.com made them easier to
buy. Now http://thebookreport.com, a Web site devoted to all things
books, is making it easier to read up on your favorite books and
authors.
</P>
<P>
   The site, an extension of a popular AOL feature, will offer
author interviews, commentary, book reviews and message boards.
</P>
<P>
   Sites devoted to books for kids and teens are expected soon.
They'll be at http://kidsreads.com and http://teenreads.com.

 &HT;    Preserve papier-mache Santa with custom-made plastic cover
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: Last year I purchased my wife a 4-foot-tall,
lifelike-quality, papier-mache Santa Claus. It was rather costly
and I have been trying to find a company that specializes in
plastic covers. I want people to be able to enjoy it while it stays
protected. Could you give me the name of companies that might be
able to do this?
</P>
<P>
   _ Harold O'Chester
</P>
<P>
   A: Daniel Rupert at Custom Plastics, 16833 FM 1431, has made all
sorts of such covers. If he can make an acrylic cover for a stuffed
goat, your wife's Santa should be a breeze. Or if you prefer mail
order, contact Gemoat (330) 499-2023 for a custom wood-based case.
Remember plastic is lightweight, and while it provides protection
it also scratches easily and may cost $300 to $450. Are you -- ure
you would not prefer a plastic cover similar to the protective lawn
furniture covers at The Greenhouse Mall or a made-to-order one for
Mr. Claus by Bartlett Sails, 4415 Hudson Bend Road.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of fumes are given off when welding galvanized
metal? I am concerned about a nephew who does this kind of work
without a mask. _T. Moore
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds like your nephew is a candidate for metal fume fever.
</P>
<P>
   The fumes emitted from welding galvanized metal (metal coated in
zinc) or copper commonly cause this fever. Your nephew may be
inhaling metal oxides. The onset of symptoms (fever, chills,
headaches, nausea) may be three to 10 hours after exposure, says
the staff at Poison Control (800) 764-7661 and the illness lasts
from 24 to 48 hours. Metal fume fever is treated symptomatically _
a pain reliever such as Tylenol or Advil helps. Fresh air is the
best preventative and remedy. A mask is always a good idea when
welding and having a well-ventilated (outdoor) site is also a plus
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many miles does the average person walk in a lifetime?
</P>
<P>
   _Rodney Walker
</P>
<P>
   A: The average person, according to the American Podiatric
Medical Association, walks an incredible 115,000 miles in a
lifetime. That is more than four times the length of the equator.Q:
Why is it that when a case is argued before the Supreme Court it
takes six to 12 months or longer for a decision? It seems like
after the attorneys have presented their case, the justices would
spend two or three days discussing the case, vote, take a couple of
days to write opinions and then go on to something else. _J.L.
</P>
<P>
   A: The justices currently hear an average of 90 cases a year _ a
33 percent drop from a decade ago, notes UT constitutional law
professor Scot Powe. The justices vote on a case the Friday after
oral arguments. The senior justice in the majority assigns a
justice to write an opinion the following week. The opinion is
usually written in three weeks and circulated. Each justice must
sign off on the opinion or add something. A justice may write a
dissent. The majority then responds. Average time? Eighteen to 20
weeks, estimates Powe, who clerked for Justice William O. Douglas.
So your point is well taken. Sixty years ago the process was three
to eight weeks. What's taking so long? Too many law clerks (in the
1960s, two per justice; currently, four). Opinions are also more
wordy, says Powe, ``because now opinions are written in part to
suck up to law professors, as praise within the legal community is
one of the only rewards for a justice beyond what the job already
provides.'' Nice work if you can get it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long does salmonella or E. coli live on an item it has
contacted _ such as a knife or cutting board _ after it has been
washed in hot soapy water? I hear just washing an item does not
necessarily destroy it but diluted bleach water does. _Elaine
Chapko
</P>
<P>
   A: These are stubborn puppies, says epidemiologist Jim
Schuermann of the Travis County Health Department. As long as there
is a little bit of moisture, the bacteria will survive (but not
reproduce) until thoroughly washed off. These gremlins hide in the
crevices of a knife or cutting board. Your best defense is to rinse
items in a solution of a tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to find a doll for use in a medical setting. I
believe it is called a Zaadi Doll. _Beth O.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Zaadi Doll is a plush, child-size doll (male or female,
about $150 each) designed to teach children about what may happen
to them in the hospital. The Zaadi opens to reveal the body's
systems and may be used to demonstrate catheter insertion, practice
insulin injections or hook up pretend IVs. Call Anatomical Chart
Co. at (800) 621-7500.Q: Why are speed humps installed that lower
the safe speed to drive well below the street's posted speed limit?
If the safe speed to cross these is 20 mph and they are spaced
relatively close together, why bother posting a 30 mph speed limit?
_ Steven Zaveloff
</P>
<P>
   A: Speed humps are spaced intentionally to reduce the
opportunity for going in excess of the posted speed limit. The
idea, says Joan Hudson, city traffic engineer, is ``to achieve a
reduced speed (20 mph) for a segment of the road while leaving the
posted speed (30 mph).'' Think of it as the same as the speed signs
advising a reduced speed going around a curve.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What could cause my white cotton knit tops to turn yellow
after washing? I don't use bleach or fabric softener, but I do have
a water softener since my water is very hard. Can this yellowing be
removed, and is there a way to prevent it from happening in the
future? _S. Randall
</P>
<P>
   A: Lots of things could be causing the problem _ a build up of
body oil, the hard water deposits or something in the garment
itself that reacted with direct sunlight to produce the yellow
tinge. What's a girl to do? If you can isolate the problem to these
knit tops alone, consider hand washing in bottled water and drying
inside. Common recommendations in cleaning circles? Treat the
yellowing fabric with any of the following: soaking the garments in
denture cleaner and water, using dishwasher powder in lieu of
detergent, or an overnight soak of vinegar and water (10-12 parts
water to one part vinegar).
</P>
<P>
   Q: On our vacation I received a speeding ticket and, since
Disney took all my money, I can't pay for it anytime soon. I do
intend to pay; I just don't want to go to jail before I get the
money for it. Does Texas have a reciprocity agreement with Florida
on traffic violations? _J.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, a ``non-resident violator compact.'' Every state (save
six) agrees to contact violators about outstanding warrants. You
have 15 days to respond. Pay up and your troubles are over; ignore
it and your license can't be renewed. Meanwhile, if stopped by an
officer, your license may be revoked. Next time get a ticket in
Alaska, Michigan, Oregon, Wisconsin, Montana or California.Q: As a
little girl I had a record of Loretta Young reading ``The Littlest
Angel.'' Now I have grandchildren and I know it will be just as
magical for them _ no video, just their imaginations. Could you
help me find it? _M.J. Alger
</P>
<P>
   A: This cassette is available from Memory Lane at (800)
326-5343. The flip side is a narration by Gregory Peck of ``Lullaby
of Christmas.'' Enjoy!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a home business and was using a box number through a
mail outlet company. When I switched companies, I mailed in a
change of address, but the post office refuses to change. Is this
legal? Why do they refuse? I have written all the companies I do
business with but mail continues to go to the old address. _S.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Check the agreement you signed with the mail outlet. These
``commercial mail receiving agencies'' are private companies, and
the U.S. Postal Service does not/cannot govern their operation,
pricing, staffing or customer complaints. Your contract with the
private company means it_ not the Postal Service _ is responsible
for forwarding your mail. And when the company forwards your mail
it needs new postage. ``The situation should have been clarified to
the customer at the initial application date,'' says USPS
spokeswoman Fina Morales. Some companies require an advance
forwarding deposit ($20 to $50) in anticipation of these expenses.
Others in this forwarding boat? Hotels, institutions, schools and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son got a Lava lamp a few years ago that had a bluish
liquid with white wax ``globs.'' The blue has turned to a
clear-yellowish, but the globs stayed white. How can I restore the
color and do it safely without ruining the lamp? _Ann R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Time to buy a new one. You can replace the base or the globe
but not the colored liquid. Call (800) 352-LAVA. The gooey liquid
is sensitive to light, and the lamp should not be left on all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar: Think Friday the 13th is unlucky? Here are
some cures from ``Holiday Folklore, Phobias and Fun.'' Walk around
your house 13 times to chase away evil spirits. Hang your shoes out
of the window to keep harm at bay. And, my personal favorite, stand
on your head while chewing a piece of beef gristle. Swallowing it
will break the spell of bad luck today. Good news? 1999 has only
one Friday the 13th, in August.

 &HT;    Progress can be comical
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Had it been left up to me, the wheel never
would have been invented. Milk would still magically appear on the
back porch each morning in a glass bottle, and the ingredients on
my breakfast cereal would not read like a ``must have'' list for a
high school biology lab.
</P>
<P>
   Anything labeled ``New and Improved!'' makes me suspicious of
what might have been wrong with the old one, and ``Ahead of Its
Time!'' is definitely a bell ringer. Remember the Edsel?
</P>
<P>
   Stuff that was around before I got here is OK. Like radio. Baby
Snooks and her little brother, Robespierre, were my buddies.
Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve made me giggle, and Saturday mornings
would have been a washout without ``Let's Pretend.'' I can still
belt out a mean rendition of the theme song. ``Cream of Wheat is so
good to eat and we eat it every day...it's good for growing babies
and grownups too to eat. For all the family's breakfast, you can't
beat Cream of Wheat.'' Then the announcer would chime in with:
``And now, `Let's Pretend.' '' Radio, I thought, was about as avant
garde as it could get.
</P>
<P>
   Then television came along. I wasn't ready for that. Granted, I
was just a kid, but I had some real problems with it. I kept asking
people how that picture got through the wire and onto the screen.
Responses varied but none offered a viable answer. Finally, I
decided on my own that television operated on the same principle as
movies _ there were people behind the screen, only smaller.
</P>
<P>
   TV was a big letdown. Sure, there were pictures, but they
couldn't live up to what my imagination had conjured up every time
I tuned in the radio to ``Inner Sanctum'' or ``Henry Aldrich.'' For
one brief and fatuous moment, I believed the whole idea might go
away. Wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Godfrey entertained us with his ``friends'' Haleloke and
Frank Parker, and then fired Julius LaRosa as millions watched.
Sen. Joseph McCarthy began finding Communists behind every bathroom
door. ``Are you now or have you ever been...?'' The witch hunt
invaded our living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason beyond my ken, the medium caught on. Before we
knew it, we'd become a nation of mouth-breathing gapers, content to
stare at a test pattern (or the O.J. trial) if that's all that was
available.
</P>
<P>
   Then, before I knew it, the computer age was upon me. A gimmick,
I thought. A fad.
</P>
<P>
   My predictions were all satisfyingly consistent in their
inaccuracy. And now as a punishment for past absurdities, I have
been unwillingly (and unwittingly) dragged into reality. Five days
a week I am charged with the responsibility of teaching 75
eighth-graders to write...on computers.
</P>
<P>
   My history with ``bytes'' and ``megs'' is sketchy. Succinctly
put, I know two things for sure: 1. If the computers are in working
order, the kids aren't. 2. Vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the misery, the kids have discovered the Spell Check.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not goof-proof,'' I warn my budding Saroyans. ``It will
find a misspelling but it won't tell you if it's the wrong word.
Use your brain _ don't depend on the machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, in the great scheme of things, life knows when to
back off and give us poor shlemiels a good laugh. Have a gander at
what a Spell Check can do.
</P>
<P>
   Ben: (writing about his favorite football team) ``If they keep
it up they'll make it all the way to the sewer Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas: (telling why he hates sharing a bathroom with his
sister) ``Every time I want to go in there she beats me to it. And
every time I ask her what she's doing in there for so long, she
tells me she's bruising her teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Evangeline: (fascinated by explorers and uncharted lands)
``Christopher columbine was born in Italy. He sailed the ocean a
lot and discovered America by Occident.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric: (loves his pet snake and is sharing a bit of snakebite
advice with his readers) ``...if victims do not receive treatment
within a few hours they may suffer convulsions, fall into a comma,
and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanya: (writing about a handicapped child in one of our novels)
``Aaron had to collect his urine in a bottle because he was born
without a blotter.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian: (writing about his idol, Babe Ruth) ``Ruth's record 54
home runs earned him the nickname, `The Saltine of Swat.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe progress isn't so bad after all. At least I know where my
next laugh is coming from.

   BREASTCANCER _ WASHINGTON _ Unconventional methods _ such as
posters and information in hair salons _ are reaching women in poor
neighborhoods and convincing them to go for breast cancer
screening. This is among studies being presented by Atlanta
researchers at the American Public Health Association meeting in

   BOTANICAL-GARDEN _ The Atlanta Botanical Garden is inching its
ways toward meeting a $15 million capital campaign goal that will
allow the park to expand its offerings over the next five years,
culminating in a true urban garden. Construction is under way on a
Children's Garden, and next year work will begin on an Orchid
House, followed by a conservation center where visitors can witness
the research and experimentation the garden's horticulturists are
involved in. After raising $13 million in grants and corporate
gifts, the ABG recently turned to the public, and the nonprofit
organization has been overhwhelmed by the response. Still, one
grant, for $350,000, is contingent on the garden raising its
remaining funds by the first quarter of 1999, which means the
pressure is on. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25 WITH

   BOTANICAL-GARDEN _ The Atlanta Botanical Garden is inching its
ways toward meeting a $15 million capital campaign goal that will
allow the park to expand its offerings over the next five years,
culminating in a true urban garden. Construction is under way on a
Children's Garden, and next year work will begin on an Orchid
House, followed by a conservation center where visitors can witness
the research and experimentation the garden's horticulturists are
involved in. After raising $13 million in grants and corporate
gifts, the ABG recently turned to the public, and the nonprofit
organization has been overhwhelmed by the response. Still, one
grant, for $350,000, is contingent on the garden raising its
remaining funds by the first quarter of 1999, which means the
pressure is on. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25 WITH

IMPACTING STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)  
 (Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You can now  &UR; status &LR;  your transfer request 24 hours a day,''
Fidelity Investments wrote Yvonne Freund of Bellevue, Wash. She
immediately statused her vocabulary and wrote me, ``Is this
English?''
</P>
<P>
   Not Standard English. Rather, that new verbal status of  &UR; status &LR; 
is in the jargon of finger-snapping brokerese. The purpose of
making a verb out of the noun  &UR; status &LR; , meaning ``standing'' or
``condition,'' is seemingly to save space: The old way,  &UR; to learn
the status of &LR; , takes up valuable room that might be utilized for
hot stock tips.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``seemingly'' because the real purpose of most
noun-verbing is to give the illusion of modernity. ``This door is
 &UR; alarmed &LR; '' zips along much faster than ``An alarm system is
affixed to this door that will make horrific noises and summon
heavily armed police officers to haul you off to jail if you open
it.'' And yet it conjures a mental picture of a door with an
alarmed expression on its face, evoking a ``There, there, maybe you
need therapy'' from passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   If the verb  &UR; statused &LR;  is too short-handed, and  &UR; alarmed &LR;  is
ludicrous, what about  &UR; impacted &LR; ? Can you say, ``That will  &UR; impact &LR; 
an election,'' instead of ``That will  &UR; have an impact on &LR;  it''?
</P>
<P>
   I think so. The reason is that it has withstood the test of a
generation-long derision. Remember  &UR; prioritize &LR; ? That squeezing of
``give priority to'' was subjected to withering fire from
prescriptivists and other self-appointed guardians of good usage,
and we won. When a government official uses  &UR; prioritize &LR;  today, he
identifies himself as a raging bureaucrat and is hooted at by
aesthetes who find that an ``ugly'' word. (The - &UR; ize &LR;  do not have
it.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Impact &LR; , on the contrary, strikes me as losing its preceding
 &UR; have an &LR;  and succeeding  &UR; on &LR; . Although the past participle can be
traced to 1601, purists will continue to object to any use of
 &UR; impact &LR;  as a verb. My hat is off to them because they force the
language change to go through a crucible, and in the case of
 &UR; status &LR;  may stop its pompous-seeming verbification. But their
objections do not always impact new usage.
</P>
<P>
   Let's try another. ``I am encouraging you to participate,''
wrote Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services,
pushing a departmental health outing, ``by walking, running,
spectating or volunteering.''
</P>
<P>
   Saul Rosen of Bethesda, Md., said, ``Coinages are worthwhile
only when they bring added value.'' (He means ``when they add
value.'') ``This one, not!''
</P>
<P>
   I figuratively raced over to Health and Human Services, formerly
Health, Education and Welfare before they spun off Education and
 &UR; Welfare &LR;  became a word to avoid. ``My trusty Merriam-Webster Web
site tells me,'' Shalala said, ``that  &UR; spectating &LR;  is indeed a
legitimate back-formation of  &UR; spectator &LR; .'' On second thought, she
wished she had not used the gerund form and instead had encouraged
employees ``to walk, run, volunteer or spectate.''
</P>
<P>
   I was ambivalent about  &UR; spectate &LR;  (and I'm of two minds about
 &UR; ambivalent &LR; ) until I thought the new verb through in the light of
 &UR; status &LR;  and  &UR; impact &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that the verbal form is in the language: The
OED has it coined in 1709. But its use has been rare, and we should
apply Rosen's Value-Added Criterion. Does it supply a meaning not
covered by the simple ``watch'' or ``cheer''?
</P>
<P>
   Although I like  &UR; commentate &LR; , which has a more media-opinionated
connotation than the noun and verb  &UR; comment &LR; , I'd hold off on
 &UR; spectate &LR; . Too soon to buy in formal writing. Bears watching.
</P>
<P>
   SCHLUMPING ALONG
</P>
<P>
   A recent polemic by a right-wing calumniator began with a story
about a Jewish matchmaker. A character in the story, named Sammy,
was identified as ``a nebbish and a  &UR; schlumpeh &LR; .'' My New York
Times copy editor, Linda Cohn, asked, ``Do you mean  &UR; shlump &LR; ?'' I
insisted on the long form.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted a note from Sol Steinmetz, the yexicographer:
``You spelled  &UR; nebbish &LR;  correctly, but  &UR; schlumpeh &LR;  is problematic,
because actually there's no such word.'' He acknowledged the German
word  &UR; Schlampe &LR; , which means ``a slovenly female or slut,'' but
noted that I could not have applied it to Sammy because the word is
feminine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Yiddish, there's a related word,  &UR; shlumper &LR; , meaning `a
slovenly, ineffectual person,''' wrote the ever-helpful Steinmetz.
``The word I think you meant to use was the American English slang
noun  &UR; shlump &LR; , which derives from and means the same as the Yiddish
 &UR; shlumper &LR; .'' He cited Joseph Heller's usage in his 1979 novel,
``Good as Gold'': ``an odious  &UR; shlump &LR;  who made war gladly.''
</P>
<P>
   As winking wonks say in Mel Krupin's Bethesda deli, I nonconcur.
All my life I have had poor posture. This is not a source of pride;
I can hear the voice of Ida Safir, my mother, saying, ``Billy,
stand up straight _ why must you be such a  &UR; schlumpeh &LR; ?'' She may
have derived this from the Scandinavian  &UR; slumpa &LR; , ``to fall,'' the
root of the English  &UR; slump &LR; , as in ``You call a thousand-point drop
in the stock market a  &UR; slump &LR; ?'' The pronunciation of the final
syllable was more of a schwa than an  &UR; er &LR; . The meaning was ``one
who stooped'' but not necessarily ``one who is stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be that the picture of a person with shoulders hunched
forward would lead to the extension of meaning of ``slovenly,
ineffectual,'' as Steinmetz now defines the Yiddish term. At any
rate, the final syllable has been clipped in its adoption in
American slang, and  &UR; shlump &LR;  has become synonymous with  &UR; nebbish &LR; ,
``a pitifully ineffectual loser.''
</P>
<P>
   The word once served me well. In Army basic training, a
lieutenant snapped at me, ``Why can't you stand straight at
attention, soldier?'' I remembered my mother's usage, and promptly
replied, ``Because I'm a  &UR; schlumpeh &LR; , sir!'' He must have thought
it meant membership in an esoteric band of fierce warriors, because
he never bothered me after that.

   IRAQ-ASSESS (Washington) _ Who blinked? Both of them, Bill
Clinton every bit as much as Saddam Hussein, in the weekend
showdown over Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-SADDAM (Washington) _ With his latest act of brinkmanship,
Saddam Hussein is closer to what he wants most: keeping a secret
cache of biological and chemical weapons while gaining further
support for an end to the economic sanctions crippling his country.
By Tim Weiner and Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.S.-SOLDIERS (Kuwait City) _ It seems like the middle of
nowhere, dunes dotted with little more than herds of sheep and the
occasional camel carcass. But it is home to 1,500 American soldiers
_ roving the desert just 30 miles east of the Iraqi border _ and
some of them are getting sick of Saddam Hussein.

   JEWS-IDENTITY _ In an attempt to rebuild religious identity
among young Jews who are marrying non-Jews and abandoning the faith
in large numbers, Jewish leaders are planning to launch an
unprecedented program that will pay for any Jew in the world
between the ages of 15 and 26 to travel to Israel for 10 days. By

the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, economists and
analysts warn that Asia's relative stability presents its own set
of problems. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-UNREST (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Two days after troops
fired volley after volley of rounds in the direction of
demonstrators, killing a half dozen and wounding scores more,
Indonesians, diplomats and other analysts remain perplexed as to
why the military acted as harshly as it did against people who had
made no real effort to break through its lines. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-KING-HEALTH (Amman, Jordan) _ As his countrymen threw a
63rd birthday party that he could not attend, King Hussein of
Jordan has said that he is completely cured of the cancer he has
been battling for the last four months in Minnesota's Mayo Clinic.
By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-TURTLES (Xcacel, Mexico) _ This pristine Caribbean beach
is one of the world's most important nesting areas for sea turtles,
and Mexican environmentalists view its ivory sands and emerald
waters as sacred terrain, on a smaller scale but a bit the way
people in the United States see Yosemite or the Grand Canyon. But
in February, after months of secret negotiations, the state
government announced that Xcacel had been sold for $2.2 million to
a Spanish conglomerate that plans to build a 450-room hotel. The
sale has set off one of Mexico's most bitter environmental battles.

the largest, most complex structure ever assembled in space, the
international space station. By Warren E. Leary.

   CRUISE-SHIP-CRIME _ Once the exclusive playground of the very
wealthy, the cruise business has expanded over the last decade by
appealing to the vast middle class, especially families and young
adults. But as the industry has boomed to more than 5 million
passengers a year, it has presented new concerns for its ports of
call. A particular problem is allegations of sexual assaults by
crew members. By Douglas Frantz.

   REPUBS-WATTS (Norman, Okla.) _ In Washington political circles,
Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. is considered one of the Republican Party's
brightest stars. But a broader picture emerges from a look at
Watts' career back home, where despite his popularity, the former
star college quarterback has repeatedly had to defend himself
against accusations arising from bad debts, unpaid state and
federal taxes, and his role in a federal bribery case. By Jo
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   OBIT-CARMICHAEL _ Kwame Ture, the flamboyant civil rights leader
known to most Americans as Stokely Carmichael, died Sunday in
Conakry, Guinea. He was 57 and is best remembered for his use of
the phrase ``black power,'' which in 1967 ignited a white backlash
and alarmed an older generation of civil rights leaders, including
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. By Michael T. Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-PENALTY-DEBATE (Chicago) _ In the 22 years since the
nation resumed executions, the anti-death penalty movement has been
battered and bloodied. But on the edge of Lake Michigan this
weekend, death penalty opponents mounted a public relations
counterattack, bringing together for the first time 28 of the 72
men and two women who have been released from death rows across the
country since 1976, usually after many years on the soul-shredding
edge of extinction for crimes they did not commit. By Don Terry.

   WYO-COYOTE-HUNT (Rawlins, Wyo.) _ Hunters from around the nation
gather in Rawlins for the National Coyote Culling Contest, in which
hunters form teams and kill as many of the animals in one day as
possible for a $14,000 grand prize. In recent years, such ``body
count'' hunting contests have come under fire from state officials
and animal right activists.

known as servers that act as the control centers of large networks.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: My vegetarian lifestyle has been
wrecked
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ Why, after 2 1/2 years, I stopped being
a vegetarian ...
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I were driving on a state highway that cuts through
a rural area of East Texas, traveling at about the speed limit, 70
mph, on a recent afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, out of nowhere, it was as if we had been hit
from behind by a missile. Though my vision was momentarily jumbled,
I could see in the rear-view mirror the battered grill of a red
pickup truck on my bumper.
</P>
<P>
   My immediate thought was: This guy was speeding, he looked away
and before he knew it, rear-ended us.
</P>
<P>
   Then the pickup rammed us a second time, and I had a second
thought:
</P>
<P>
   This guy is trying to kill us.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I floorboarded the gas pedal. He couldn't kill us if
he couldn't catch us.
</P>
<P>
   I must have been going 100 mph, with the pickup right behind me,
when I came upon a line of three slow-moving vehicles on a hill. I
couldn't see if there was oncoming traffic so, not hesitating a
half-second, I passed on the paved shoulder on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing for our lives, I had decided I must have somehow
offended the driver of the pickup truck _ pulled out in front of
him or something _ and now he was bent on crazed revenge, the sort
of thing you read about happening to other people.
</P>
<P>
   I fully expected him to follow me around the cars on the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, never veering or braking, he crashed into the last car
in the line.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment I was certain the guy was a maniac, out to kill
himself and whoever he could take with him. I just happened to be
the first car he came upon.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in the rear-view mirror looked like a television car
crash as the pickup began to spin halfway sideways in the highway
and the car he hit careened across a ditch and into the trees.
</P>
<P>
   By then I was on my cell phone calling 911. My wife, bless her,
was remarkably calm. I, on the other hand, could have threaded a
sewing machine with it running.
</P>
<P>
   I told the 911 operator our location, what had happened and that
the last I saw of the maniac driver, he was still coming. I said I
was heading to find the nearest police.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be at the highway patrol office in the next
town.
</P>
<P>
   A patrolman checked by phone and was told that police were at
the scene of the wreck. We headed back in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with the investigating officer, we learned that four
vehicles had been involved, a number of people were hospitalized
and we were lucky to have escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   As for the driver of the pickup truck, he told the highway
patrol officer that he couldn't remember a thing about the wreck.
Later I learned from an insurance representative that he may have
had a seizure. As of this writing, the accident was still being
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Our car suffered some damage but was driveable, except that the
trunk wouldn't stay down.
</P>
<P>
   I had stopped at a store, bought a spool of heavy cord and was
in the process of tying down the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I looked up and saw a fried-chicken stand across the
street, and the thought occurred to me:
</P>
<P>
   We could have been killed. Why should I worry about a dead
chicken?
</P>
<P>
   I drove across the street, ordered a chicken dinner and haven't
thought twice about it since.
</P>

 &UR; From ``Thanksgiving 101'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this colorful and informative piece, Rodgers, a popular
cooking teacher known as Mr. Thanksgiving, offers facts and lore
about three staples of the holiday dinner: turkey, cranberries and
pumpkin. A few tidbits: Israelis eat the most turkey of any
nationality. Farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate, so females must be artificially
inseminated. Colonial Americans called cranberries ``bounce
berries'' because bounciness was an indication of a cranberry's
freshness. (slugged:

   In this second piece from Mr. Thanksgiving, Rodgers uses a Q&AMP;A

the market: fresh, frozen, hard-chilled, self-basting, free-range,
wild, etc. This is an invaluable article for the confused consumer.

   Why do we celebrate Thanksgiving on the last Thursday of
November? Because of the 19th-century crusade by Sarah Josepha
Hale, editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book,'' who persuaded Abraham
Lincoln to proclaim the holiday, history buff Malehorn tells us.
Before that Thanksgiving was a haphazard celebration _ in fact, in
colonial times the word ``celebration'' was not quite apt. It was a
somber, religious occasion, spent in prayer in chilly village
churches. (slugged:

 By HAL MALEHORN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Nearly all American schoolchildren learn the standard
Thanksgiving story: how the Pilgrims survived their first miserable
winter, and how the following fall they feasted with friendly
Indians to celebrate a successful harvest.
 &HT;    But many of us are unaware that the holiday is rooted in
European tradition, that it was a somber, religious holiday in
colonial times and that it was through the efforts of one
determined 19th century woman that it became celebrated on a fixed
day in November.
 &HT;    Many misconceptions surround that first Thanksgiving. It is
indeed true that the Pilgrims' tables were spread with nature's
bounty that 1621 autumn. But the foods were quite different from
those on which we feast today. Turkey might well have graced the
boards, but there likely was other wild game as well, so readily
available from the woods nearby.
 &HT;    Bee-tree honey and native fruits, berries and nuts also likely
satisfied appetites at that banquet, along with fish and shellfish
that abounded close to shore.
 &HT;    Corn, native to the New World, was probably prepared either as a
pudding or baked into cakes. Pumpkins (or pompions, as they were
called) were eaten boiled, for there was little molasses or flour
to bake them into pies.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving in America actually had its origins in Europe well
before any westbound voyagers from that continent ever hoisted
sail. In many parts of the Old Country, in fact, residents had for
centuries held observances of ``Harvest Home,'' a time when farmers
joined forces with neighbors to bring in their crops. This shared
labor was usually followed by festive dancing and food and drink.
 &HT;    Sometimes European governments decreed days of rejoicing among
the populace in thanks for a major victory in battle, or for the
end of a plague or for deliverance from some natural disaster.
 &HT;    In the early decades of American colonial life, Thanksgiving Day
did not always call for making merry. To the contrary, some church
fathers took a dim view of too much jollity. Attendance at worship
was required, where thanksgivers endured hours-long sermons and
prayers in chilly village churches.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving long ago was not uniformly observed on a single
date. Sometimes two or more Thanksgivings were announced within the
same calendar year. For example, during our War of Independence
special days of gratitude were proclaimed following our major
victories on the battlefield.
 &HT;    Similarly, the Continental Congress ordered a day of thanks
after our military alliance with France was signed. Several years
later there was a call for a national celebration of the British
surrender at Yorktown. On each such occasion grateful citizens
thronged to churches to express their thanks.
 &HT;    When the Constitutional Convention gathered in 1787, one
delegate proposed mandating an annual day of thanksgiving across
the land. However, as most of his fellow delegates saw the matter
as rightly belonging to the 13 states-to-be, that provision was
omitted from the landmark document.
 &HT;    In spite of this early congressional reluctance, Presidents
George Washington and James Madison each proclaimed a nationwide
thanksgiving observance. For his part, though, Thomas Jefferson,
viewing the presidency as a strictly civil post, found himself ``in
no position to direct the religious exercise of constituents.''
 &HT;    Since most thanksgiving observances early in our nationhood
occurred only at the discretion of the governor of the various
states, the time chosen for such an event ranged from September
through January. The success in fixing a single date on which to
observe Thanksgiving can be attributed to Sarah Josepha Hale,
editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book.''
 &HT;    In 1846 she began a crusade to set aside the last Thursday in
November as an official national holiday. Each autumn thereafter
she published in her magazine's pages an enthusiastic editorial on
the desirability of such an event.
 &HT;    Each year her November issue focused on that special day,
relating warm stories of family reunions. Mrs. Hale encouraged her
readers to urge their governors to agree on just one date.
 &HT;    When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Mrs. Hale's campaign
faltered for a while. But after the Union victory at Gettysburg,
President Abraham Lincoln set aside a day of thanksgiving and
prayer. Relieved at the recent repulse of Robert E. Lee's rebel
forces, Northern citizens had ample reason to rejoice.
 &HT;    Six weeks later the persistent Mrs. Hale wrote to Lincoln,
urging him to establish Thanksgiving as an annual national event.
Because the last Thursday was already being so proclaimed by
governors of most of the northern states, Mrs. Hale argued, Lincoln
should make it official.
 &HT;    And so, on Oct. 8, 1863, Lincoln decreed a national Thanksgiving
for the last Thursday in November _ not in honor of military
success, but rather ``for a year filled with blessings of fruitful
fields.''
 &HT;    The following year Lincoln renewed his proclamation, and ever
since our nation has seen fit to continue the tradition. And so
today millions of Americans gather each November to enjoy families,
friendships and abundant food _ the same blessings so important to
the Pilgrims in 1621.

 &UR; By Rick Rodgers &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From ``Thanksgiving 101,'' published by Broadway Books &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURKEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is only assumed that wild turkeys were served at that first
Thanksgiving in 1621. The firsthand accounts of the menu simply
mention ``fowl.'' We do know that the Pilgrims had venison, cod and
lobster on the table, so why don't we have surf and turf or fish
cakes instead of turkey?
</P>
<P>
   The turkey is an impressive bird, with its bronze feathers,
unusual head markings and showy tail. Even a hardened critic like
Brilliat-Savarin _ a French gourmand who, in 1825, uttered the
phrase, ``Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are'' _
said, ``The turkey is certainly one of the handsomest gifts the New
World made to the Old World. ... [It] is the largest and, if not
the most subtle, at least the most tasty of our domestic birds.''
Just looking at its corpulent figure it gives one a feeling of
abundance and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The wild turkey is native to North and Central America and was
domesticated by the Aztecs. No one knows when the first turkeys
traveled to Europe, but they seem to have been brought to Spain by
conquistadors in the early 1500s. The turkey quickly established
itself as the bird to serve at festive occasions, especially in
Italy, France and England, and was bred into a plumper version.
</P>
<P>
   This new improved turkey was brought back to the Americas, where
it was crossbred with its wild cousin to make the breed we know
today. The turkey was not a strange bird to the Pilgrims _ they
were well acquainted with it, and must have been relieved to find a
familiar food in this strange land.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows how the turkey got its name. There are many
explanations, none definitive. Some think that early explorers,
believing they were close to India, misidentified the bird and
called it tuki, an Indian name for peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Because it also resembled the guinea fowl, which came from
Africa via Turkish merchants, it could have picked up the name by
another misappropriation of origin. (Guinea fowls were also called
turkeys.) Or it could have gotten its name from one of its calls,
which sounds like ``turk, turk, turk.''
</P>
<P>
   Because turkeys were so abundant in Colonial America, they were
a major source of nourishment for our country's forefathers. In a
well-known letter to his daughter, Benjamin Franklin expressed his
dismay over the eagle's being chosen as the official United States
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the eagle's ``bad moral character,'' he went on to
say, ``I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the
representative of our country! The turkey is a much more
respectable bird, and withal a true original native of America.''
</P>
<P>
   While about 675 million pounds of turkey are served each
Thanksgiving, in recent years its healthy profile and versatility
have changed the turkey from a holiday bird to one that competes
with other meat and poultry on a year-round basis.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Americans do not eat the most turkey. In 1997, it
was estimated that Israelis ate about 25.7 pounds per capita, while
we weighed in at 18.7 pounds. Runner-up was France, at 13.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most turkeys are of the White Holland variety, which have a lot
of the white breast meat that more than 70 percent of Americans
prefer. In fact, farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate. All farm-raised female turkeys are
artificially inseminated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRANBERRIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure that cranberries were served at the first
Thanksgiving, but the cranberry was a very important food to the
Pawtuxet Indians, so historians assume that they would have offered
it as a contribution to the feast. Instinct must have taught the
Indians that the tart berries are an excellent source of Vitamin C,
because they used them in many dishes.
</P>
<P>
   They ate them raw and boiled with maple syrup, but perhaps the
most common use was in pemmican, which was a kind of low-tech
energy bar made with berries, dried venison meat and melted animal
fat. Pemmican kept well, and went with the Indians on long
journeys.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrims probably referred to cranberries as ``fenberries,''
a common fruit in old England which they resembled. The cranberry,
however, gets its modern name from the Dutch and German settlers,
who called it a ``crane berry.'' When the cranberry vines bloom,
the blossom looks like the head and bill of a crane. Eventually,
the name became cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Americans called them ``bounce berries,'' referring to
their bounciness. Bouncing berries are an indication of freshness;
bruised, old berries don't bounce.
</P>
<P>
   A recipe for cranberry sauce is included in the very first
printed American cookbook, Amelia Simmons' ``American Cookery,''
which appeared in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   Canned cranberry sauce first hit the shelves in 1912, a product
of the Cape Cod Cannery Company, which eventually became the Ocean
Spray Preserving Company. The president of the company was a Boston
lawyer, Marcus L. Urann. In 1930, Urann organized a merger between
his company and two other cranberry canneries to form the Cranberry
Canners, Inc., a cranberry farming cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative, which eventually acquired Urann's former
company name after a few months of squabbling, now provides more
than 70 percent of the world's cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever wondered how many cranberries are in a 12-ounce
bag, the number is 360, give or take a few berries.
</P>
<P>
   PUMPKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin pie was certainly not included in the first feast. The
Mayflower's stores of wheat had long been depleted, and the first
planting had failed. No wheat, no pie crust. As with so many other
foods, the Indians taught the Pilgrims about pumpkin. Along with
beans and corn, it was one of the three major foods in the Native
American diet throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   There is some argument over the pumpkin's origin. Some botanists
say it is a New World vegetable, and others claim it was known in
Europe before the Exploration Age. It is likely, however, that the
European ``pumpkins'' in the pre-Columbus era were really gourds,
and that we can truly claim the pumpkin as an American native that
deserves a place of honor at the Thanksgiving meal.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians probably roasted pumpkin over an open fire or boiled
it with maple syrup. Pumpkin pudding became one of the favorite
dishes of the Puritan era. The pumpkin flesh was scooped out, mixed
with milk, spices and syrup, then returned to the pumpkin shell,
where it was roasted for hours in hot ashes. It is easy to see
where the basic recipe for pumpkin pie filling came from.
</P>
<P>
   Known to the settlers as pompion _ the name given by French
explorers in the late 1500s _ pumpkin saved them from starvation in
the lean early years of their colony.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first recipes for pumpkin pie appeared in 1655 in a
British book called Queens Closed Open. This version represents the
then current taste for highly seasoned foods and includes thyme,
rosemary, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, cloves and apple. Amelia
Simmons included ``pompkin pie'' in the first American cookbook,
published in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the modern pumpkin pie can be dated back to 1929.
In that year, Libby, McNeil and Libby bought a small pumpkin pie
cannery, Dickinson Canning Company. The little cannery's pride and
joy was its special eating pumpkin, now called the Dickinson
variety. Eating pumpkins, very different from the jack-o'-lantern
varieties grown for their size and appearance, are elongated and
buff-colored with thin walls. The Dickinson is noted for its bright
orange color, creamy texture and fresh taste.
</P>
<P>
   Libby's took years to develop its own strain, improving upon the
Dickinson, called ``Select.'' Today, Libby's, a division of Nestle,
Inc., plants more than 4,000 acres of pumpkins annually.

 By ELIZABETH LEVANG  
 From ``Holiday Hope: Remembering Loved Ones During Special Times of
the Year,'' published by Fairview Press 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The holiday season calls up wistful memories and returns us to
faraway places, to scenes filled with the scents and sounds of
warmth and happiness. No other time of year evokes such strong
images of family togetherness.
 &HT;    For all its nostalgia and sentimentalism, however, the holiday
season is a difficult and often debilitating period for those who
are bereaved. More than anything, the holidays seem to accentuate
what others have and they have lost.
 &HT;    A time of year that once was joyous now often becomes almost
unbearable. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year's are
days to endure rather than enjoy.
 &HT;    A friend whose 17-year-old son died in a car accident once
confided, ``I'd like to rip Dec. 25 off my calendar forever.''
 &HT;    Those with loved ones who have died experience a special pain or
burden during the holidays. Your lives have been altered, and your
family togetherness has been disturbed forever. Trying to reconcile
your reality with the idealized picture of the holidays projected
by the media causes even more emotional pain.
 &HT;    The expectations put on the bereaved, both socially and
emotionally, can feel overwhelming. You may have parties to attend,
gifts to purchase and a tree to be bought and trimmed. You are
expected to get in the spirit and join in the festivities just like
everyone else, yet in your heart is a gnawing pain and the constant
fear that you won't make it.
 &HT;    A close friend once remarked how much she had come to hate
Thanksgiving. ``The family focus hurts me,'' she said. ``I feel
somehow out of place. It's a depressing and lonely time for me.
Both my parents are dead and I don't really feel like I have much
to give thanks about.''
 &HT;    Comparing yourself to others, isolating ourselves, feeling
jealous, lonely, depressed or angry are some of the reactions that
you may experience during the holiday season. Many also feel guilt
from time to time, or are totally overwhelmed with sorrow.
 &HT;    Still, there are ways to survive the holidays, and with a change
in attitude and a bit of planning, they can become tolerable, and
even enjoyable. How can you better handle your grief during the
holidays?
 &HT;    First, acknowledge your pain. You miss your loved one. It is
agonizing not to be able to spend this joyous time with him or her.
Feel free to share your pain with friends and family. By
acknowledging and sharing your feelings, you allow others to
support and care for you. Rather than pushing your feelings down
and hoping they will stay hidden, you need an opportunity to
resolve them. Only by letting the hurt out will you make room for
healing.
 &HT;    Second, take charge of your life and don't leave things to
chance. This does not mean putting yourself on a rigid schedule,
but rather deciding in advance what you would like to do and with
whom. By taking charge, you give yourself things to look forward to
rather than things to dread. Occupying yourself lends a purpose to
your days and keeps you from feeling sorry for yourself.
 &HT;    Third, think more realistically and positively. What you think
has a dramatic effect on how you feel. When you form positive yet
realistic expectations for the holidays and accept your own
limitations, you reduce the tensions and pressure you face. Now,
how do you put these three new attitudes into practice? Here are a
number of specific coping strategies:
 &HT;    + Be honest. Your feelings are legitimate. Trust that you know
what is best for yourself. If a gathering of family or friends is
too painful, make your apologies and leave.
 &HT;    + Accept and seek support. Let your family and friends know how
they can be of assistance. If hanging ornaments on the tree feels
overwhelming, ask a friend to lend a hand. If neighbors offer to
bake cookies or wrap gifts, graciously accept their help and good
intentions.
 &HT;    + Be kind to yourself. Look for ways to nurture and care for
yourself throughout the holidays. Perhaps buy yourself a special
gift, sign up for a massage or do that something you've always
wanted to do. And at the very least, treat yourself to an
occasional smile.
 &HT;    + Have a plan. Talking with friends and family about what you
want and don't want to do during the holidays can be very helpful.
Being prepared lessens anxiety.
 &HT;    + Alter traditions. Since circumstances have changed, old
traditions may need replacing. Even simple changes, like serving
another dish instead of turkey or opening gifts later in the day,
may make you more comfortable.
 &HT;    + Start a new tradition. Start afresh by adding one new
tradition each year. Attending a seasonal play, decorating a
special tree outdoors or reciting a favorite poem before opening
gifts are some examples.
 &HT;    + Shop early. Avoid the holiday atmosphere by completing
shopping early. Rely on catalogs or the telephone, or enlist the
aid of a supportive friend.
 &HT;    + Decrease your commitments. Grief saps energy, so you may need
to pare down your commitments. Consider buying instead of baking
cookies, cutting down on the number of cards you send or having an
artificial rather than a fresh tree.
 &HT;    + Cherish your memories. Religious services, Christmas concerts
or other holiday events can trigger memories of your loved one.
While some may be painful, memories need to be cherished, for they
are an enduring and intimate connection to your loved one.
 &HT;    + Give tribute. The holidays can be a special time to honor your
loved one. Donating money to a special cause, offering to help
someone in need or volunteering your time and talents to a local
charity are some ways to do this.
 &HT;    + Be hopeful. The pain and stress of the holidays is very real.
Still, with some trial and error, things will get better.
 &HT;    + Remember the life of your loved one. More than anything else
at this time of year, you may feel a strong need to know that your
loved one has not been forgotten. Setting a plate at the table,
hanging a stocking on the mantle or retelling stories about him or
her are just a few ways to reassure yourself that the spirit of
this special person lives on.

 By RICK RODGERS  
 From ``Thanksgiving 101,'' published by Broadway Books 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Rick Rodgers, often called Mr. Thanksgiving, gives holiday
cooking classes nationwide. Below he answers questions about
choosing from among the myriad types of turkey on the market.
 &HT;    + Other than gender, are there any differences between hen and
tom turkeys? Is one more tender than the other?
 &HT;    Hens are female turkeys, weighing from 8 to 16 pounds. Male
toms, bred to yield a high proportion of the white breast meat that
most Americans prefer, weigh 14 to 26 pounds. The size of the bird
relates to its age. Turkeys are often labeled ``young,'' because no
commercial turkey is much older than 26 weeks.
 &HT;    Thanks to modern animal husbandry methods, there is no
difference in flavor or tenderness between toms and hens. In the
old days, a younger bird meant a more tender one, and while an old
tom had plenty of flavor, it was also tougher.
 &HT;    + What are the differences between fresh and frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    There are actually three designations for fresh and frozen
turkeys.
 &HT;    _ ``Frozen'' turkeys have been deep-chilled at 0 degrees or
below. They are at their best if defrosted and cooked within one
year of purchase. (If you've ever wondered how your supermarket can
give away free frozen turkeys as premiums at Thanksgiving time,
it's probably because they are using up last year's surplus.)
 &HT;    _ ``Fresh'' birds have never been chilled below 26 degrees, and
have a correspondingly short shelf life. (Turkey freezes at eight
degrees lower than water does.) Fresh turkeys are readily available
at supermarkets or butchers. You rarely have to special order them
anymore, unless your butcher requires that you do so or you are
concerned about getting a certain size. Buy fresh turkey no earlier
than two days before roasting, even if the ``sell-by'' date on the
label is later. I always buy a fresh turkey.
 &HT;    _ Turkeys kept at temperatures between 0 and 26 degrees are
considered ``hard-chilled.'' You won't see turkeys labeled
hard-chilled, though, as each turkey producer is allowed to create
its own name for this designation, as long as it isn't misleading.
Holding turkey at this temperature range prolongs shelf life and
has little effect on quality.
 &HT;    + What about frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    Frozen turkeys are the least expensive, but freezing dries out
the meat, and more moisture is lost down the drain during
defrosting. Good turkey producers always inject the birds with a
moistening solution to replace the lost liquid. The best frozen
turkeys have been injected only with wholesome ingredients like
broth, vegetable oil and seasonings.
 &HT;    Also, frozen birds require advance planning to defrost. I hardly
have enough room in my refrigerator at holiday time as it is,
without a huge turkey taking up all the space while it thaws for
three to five days.
 &HT;    Considering the minor difference in price between frozen and
fresh (or hard-chilled, which is almost as good as fresh) turkeys,
why not get the best you can afford?
 &HT;    + If I do buy a frozen turkey, how do I defrost it?
 &HT;    First and foremost, never defrost a turkey at room temperature.
 &HT;    Allow enough time for the turkey to thaw. It takes a full 24
hours to defrost each five pounds of turkey in the refrigerator.
So, if you want a 25-pound turkey to be thoroughly defrosted by
Thanksgiving morning, you must buy it by the preceding Sunday at
the latest. (I'd buy it on Saturday, just to be sure.)
 &HT;    If you are in a hurry, a second-best option is to defrost the
bird in a large sink of cold water, allowing 30 minutes per pound,
changing the water and turning the turkey often. Do not add warm
water to hasten the process.
 &HT;    Don't defrost a turkey in the microwave oven. The turkey is
irregularly shaped, and some parts of the bird will cook while
others are still defrosting. Besides, most microwave ovens won't
hold a bird larger than 12 pounds.
 &HT;    + What about self-basting birds?
 &HT;    Self-basting birds, available fresh and frozen, have been
``enhanced'' (in the eyes of the producer) with flavorings, some
natural and some artificial. They purport to make the turkey moist
_ I say these make the turkey soggy and wet, and predisposed to
fall apart when lifting it from the pan.
 &HT;    They say the basting liquid makes the turkey taste better _ I
say a turkey tastes good enough without fake flavorings. I want to
promote turkeys that taste like turkey, not canned soup.
 &HT;    And I like to baste the bird, so the concept of ``self-basting''
leaves me cold. Not only does opening the oven and basting give the
cook an idea of the turkey's progress, but the hot basting liquid
helps to brown and seal the skin and hold in the juices.
 &HT;    + My farmers' market has organic, free-range birds. Are they
worth the price?
 &HT;    The terms organic and free-range are not recognized by the USDA.
Butchers, farmers and restaurants can use them as marketing terms,
but they cannot use them in labeling (although they can be written
on signs advertising the product).
 &HT;    Generally, ``organic poultry'' has been raised on organically
grown, antibiotic-free feed. ``Free-range'' turkeys, which are
often organic, have been raised in a relatively spacious
environment that gives them access to open spaces.
 &HT;    Many turkeys that are not called free-range may have been raised
in henhouses with the same amount of space. The term free-range may
make you think of wide-open skies, but it's no guarantee that the
birds have ever been outside _ it just means that the door to the
henhouse is open and they can go out if they want to.
 &HT;    These birds can be excellent, but, again, they still need to be
cooked carefully for fine results. They are significantly more
expensive than ordinary fresh turkeys, and whether they are worth
it or not is up to you.
 &HT;    + My specialty butcher carries wild turkeys. What are they like?
 &HT;    Today, most wild turkeys are actually farm-raised. They are very
full-flavored, but not gamy like hunter-bagged wild turkeys. Most
true, wild turkeys are so tough that cooks roast only the tender
breast and stew the dark meat. I like to say they are to regular
turkeys what sourdough bread is to white bread. Some people just
like the complex flavor of the former better than the latter.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys look much different from regular ones, with a high,
humped breastbone and freckled white skin. While wild turkeys may
look meaty, they actually have a very low meat-to-bone ratio. Their
weight ranges from only six to 12 pounds. Allow about 1 1/2 pounds
per person.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys are very lean and should be roasted only to 170 to
175 degrees, or the meat will dry out. The dark meat may be a
little pink, but it is safe to eat. If you prefer your dark meat
more well-done, just pop the sliced meat back into a 400-degree
oven for a few minutes _ it will probably be cooked by the time you
get around to serving the mashed potatoes.
 &HT;    + My neighbor swears by kosher turkeys. What makes them
different?
 &HT;    Kosher turkeys are raised free-range in a manner similar to
organic turkeys and are fed antibiotic-free feed. They are
slaughtered and salted according to Jewish dietary laws. Some cooks
feel that the method of slaughtering gives the birds a fresher,
cleaner taste. The salting seasons the turkeys and makes their meat
somewhat firmer than that of regular birds.
 &HT;    These extra steps are labor-intensive, so kosher turkeys always
cost more. Many kosher turkeys are frozen, so be sure to defrost
them properly to protect your investment.

WITHER THE STORMS OF YOUTH? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AL McKEE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As Northern California approaches another rainy
season, I'd like to register a complaint about the misuse of the
word ``storm'' to characterize those periods of anemic drizzle that
roll in intermittently _ and all too briefly _ from the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   A storm, where I come from, is not an hour or two of gentle
rain, but a furious, prolonged atmospheric seizure that falls on a
city like a dog on a rat.
</P>
<P>
   A good thunderstorm unfolds in three acts.
</P>
<P>
   Act 1 is the build-up. ``That cloud looks mean,'' my father used
to say when we lived in Missouri. As a young man growing up on a
farm, he was once trapped in an outhouse during a tornado, the wind
blowing so hard he could not push open the door to escape. Since
that experience, he has viewed every darkening sky with respect.
</P>
<P>
   The moment just before a storm when individuals turn from their
private concerns to a shared anticipation of what lies ahead must
be one of prehistory's earliest examples of community. There is
something distinctly tribal about a group of people _ whether
strangers or friends _ stepping outside to watch an advancing
armada of clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Act 2 is the eruption: lightning and thunder. It is here that
weather here fails to deliver. In the almost 20 years I have lived
in San Francisco, I can count the claps of thunder I've heard on
the fingers of one hand. Muffled claps, at that.
</P>
<P>
   Proper Midwestern thunder disrupts conversations. It can sound
like distant Civil War cannons or like glaciers cracking over your
head. With lightning, it provides a soul-cleansing catharsis that
someone raised on it can't get from anything else. That's why last
year's El Nino disruptions failed to satisfy the craving of storm
addicts like me. For all the records broken, El Nino hit San
Francisco stripped of its light show and without Dolby sound.
</P>
<P>
   Act 3 is the rain. Real thunderstorm rain comes down in buckets.
It comes down in pitchforks. It hammers down. In California, of
course, this kind of precipitation sends homes tobogganing down
muddy hills, so one can't, in good conscience, pine for it. But
pine we do. Secretly.
</P>
<P>
   All over the San Francisco Bay area, people from Missouri and
Iowa and Illinois, from Ohio and Indiana, from Kentucky and
Tennessee, watch the weather forecast and privately hope that one
of those weather systems pinwheeling off the jet stream into
Northern California will live up to the robust standards of our
youth.
</P>
<P>
   For even when a storm is particularly bad, when creeks jump
their banks and power lines fail, even when the outhouse door won't
push open, there is always a denouement when the rain stops and you
step outside amid dripping trees. The tender quality of the air at
that moment is made all the sweeter by the violence it replaces.
It's as if the retreating clouds have left behind an apology, as if
something up there wants it understood that the balance of man and
weather may resume _ now that nature has established who's boss.
</P>

EXPO PROMOTES HEMP DESPITE LEGAL HURDLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ron Sarnataro listened politely as the young,
long-haired vendor at the San Francisco Industrial Hemp Expo '98
mumbled into his left ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really not showing any paraphernalia at the show,''
Sarnataro told the vendor. The young man then hustled back to his
booth, suppressing disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Sarnataro said the exchange illustrated a problem dogging those
who endorse the commercial cultivation of hemp on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance to legalized hemp cultivation, he said, stems
from the confusion of industrial hemp and recreational marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a public education problem,'' said Sarnataro, who
produced the expo that ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the expo and most vendors insist that the impetus
to legalize hemp cultivation is separate from movements to legalize
marijuana for medicinal or recreational purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Hemp, they said, is a profoundly prolific plant with an almost
endless array of applications, including fiber products _ paper and
fabrics _ and oils for culinary, industrial and cosmetic
application.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to clothing, Hemp Expo vendors sold hammocks, work
gloves, backpacks, American flags, body oil, hemp-flavored
lollipops, decorative envelopes (``hempalopes'') and meals
including hemp crust pizza and ``hempen'' shepherd's pie.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hornaday of the Hemp Shak, a store with outlets in San
Louis Obispo and Claremont, estimated that as many as 50,000
products can be made from the hemp plant.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday admitted that hemp's connection to marijuana attracts
buyers who have also sampled the potent form of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that if it weren't for the popularity of marijuana then
hemp wouldn't be as popular, but we're definitely at the point
where we need to move on and get people to understand that it's not
the same thing and if you're not into marijuana then you can still
use these products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents said hemp contains less than 1 percent of THC,
the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, while the smokable pot
typically contains from 2 percent to 30 percent THC.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, they said, hemp is a superior source for many
products, such as paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make four times as much paper from an acre of hemp as
you can from an acre of trees,'' Hornaday said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarnataro added that paper from hemp is acid-free, so it won't
turn yellow and decompose like wood-based paper. And, he said, it
can be grown without pesticides or herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   While hemp cultivation _ common in the United States until the
1930s _ is against the law, ``it is legal to import fiber and it is
legal to import sterilized seeds'' for making oil, Sarnataro said.
</P>
<P>
   Hemp production was legalized in Canada last year, said David
Bata of Commercial Hemp, a quarterly trade magazine published in
Vancouver, British Columbia. He said 241 licenses to grow hemp were
issued to Canadian farmers, who planted 6,195 acres of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's Jason Freeman said the crops are used to blend
into recycled paper, make composite products for the auto industry
and manufacture body oils and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   The move to legalize hemp cultivation in the United States is
being spearheaded by Lloyd Casey, a former state senator from
Colorado who, during his term in office, introduced the first bill
to permit American farmers to plant hemp. It died in committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Myer, representing Casey's lobbying effort, said his
organization was targeting Colorado and North and South Dakota for
quick legislative endorsements of hemp.
</P>
<P>
   They added Minnesota, he said, because the state's new governor,
former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, has endorsed the crop.
</P>
<P>
   Myer said hemp cultivation is still forbidden because law
enforcement agencies mount fervent opposition.
</P>
<P>
   If no state has legalized hemp by 2000, Myer said, his group
will promote voter initiatives to legalize the plant.

SHOW MAY BE GASPING BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF FIGHT IN DIRESTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John DiResta really thought his new series was the breakout hit
that would take UPN out of intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Not gonna happen. As you read this, DiResta's show may already
have become a casualty of fall '98. In the latest Nielsen ratings,
``Di-Resta'' was the lowest-rated of all prime-time shows airing on
ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, The WB and UPN. For those scoring at home, that
would be No. 124 on the list _ 123 (and about 19 million
households) below ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't dead last, though. A bunch of stuff from the new Pax
TV network always brings up the rear in the weekly Nielsens these
days. But that's like telling a varsity runner he didn't finish
last because the fifth-graders were allowed to run in the same
race.
</P>
<P>
   DiResta knows ``DiResta'' isn't what he was hoping for when he
quit his job as a New York City transit cop last March and moved
his family to Studio City, Calif. But as he got ready for a day of
shooting at Paramount Studios on Friday, he wasn't ready to head
back to Gotham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kinda been the underdog from day one,'' he said by
telephone, ``the Rocky Balboa of sitcoms. There's nowhere to go but
up ... and it feels OK, believe it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Brave words, considering that executive producer Matt Goldman
quit the show on Thursday. DiResta said he's not sure what that
means for the future, but the departure of the show-runner 11
installments into a 13-episode order looms larger than the iceberg
that got in the way of Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The question for UPN is whether it might draw more viewers with
something else. That wouldn't seem too difficult. The national
audience for ``DiResta'' on Nov. 2 was about 830,000 households.
More people were probably painting their toenails that night.
</P>
<P>
   But UPN has already pulled the hourlong ``Mercy Point'' from its
Tuesday schedule and is filling in with two new half-hours _ a
sitcom and a show about amazing animals. The network also
jettisoned ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' and, like the
Mariners' bullpen, it is now desperately short of backup, at least
until early next year.
</P>
<P>
   That's when it plans to introduce an animated series based on
the ``Dilbert'' comic strip. Also in the works are a comedy from
the Jim Henson Co. and a medical drama from Barry Levinson and Tom
Fontana, producers of NBC's critically acclaimed ``Homicide: Life
on the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   So, sort of by default, ``DiResta'' may be around for a while.
If it is, DiResta expects UPN to take the show in a new direction,
one that is more realistic, he said, truer to his life as a
policeman in New York's subway system.
</P>
<P>
   The problem there is that the producers may lose the most
positive thing from what is at best a mediocre show: DiResta's
chemistry with Leila Kenzle, who plays his wife.
</P>
<P>
   DiResta knows tinkering is part of the game and, though the
series is based on his life, it's really out of his control. If the
ax falls, the cop-turned-comedian-turned-actor believes he can
survive in the television industry. And he isn't aiming low.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' he mused. ``If Bochco has another show in
the works . . .''
</P>
<P>
   From BBC, a sexy `Life'
</P>
<P>
   There is little about the channel lineup on TCI Digital that
makes one want to write thank-you notes to the cable gods. BBC
America is one of the exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   A partnership of England's BBC and America's Discovery Channel
Networks, BBC America is also available to some satellite dish
customers, providing a steady diet of BBC serials, comedies and
movies to viewers who like their English dialogue heavily accented.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Life,'' one of the most celebrated dramatic series to hit
England in recent years, fits the category perfectly. It makes its
American debut tonight at 8 on BBC America, delivering a steamy
drama that is equal parts ``Friends'' and ``L.A. Law,'' with maybe
a little ``Ally McBeal'' thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   The series focuses on five lawyers _ Anna, Miles, Milly, Warren
and Egg _ who live together in a big house in South London. On the
surface, they all seem to be doing OK: good jobs, good incomes,
good digs.
</P>
<P>
   But good grief! They're as messed up as Jerry's kids. Jerry
Springer, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Anna (Daniela Nardini) is a simmering sexpot. Miles (Jack
Davenport) is belligerent. Milly (Amita Dhiri)) is ambitious and
neurotic. Warren (Jason Hughes) abhors secrets, but his parents
don't know he's gay. Egg (Andrew Lincoln) would rather be writing
about soccer than writing legal briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Not a courtroom show, ``This Life'' is a gritty relationship
drama that was hailed as an accurate take on young professionals in
London when its 32 episodes _ a long run by British standards _
aired in 1996 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   BBC America will run (and rerun) the first 11 episodes this
season, and the remaining 21 beginning next fall. The really
naughty language has been excised so as not to damage America's
sensitive ears, but the steamy sex and occasional nudity still
warrant a rating of TV-MA (mature audiences).
</P>
<P>
   Because of thick accents and British slang, ``This Life'' isn't
the easiest show to follow, but after viewing the first two
episodes, it was easy to want more.

SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN FILLED WITH PERIL, ANALYSTS WARN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It sounds simple: Save the Social Security system
by letting Americans invest their retirement taxes for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the boldest idea for fixing the popular program _ turning it
into a series of privately owned investment accounts _ could
dramatically raise the costs of running a national retirement
system. It could also create a nightmare for small employers like
Shirley Hamblen, who does most of her own accounting for her
Lexington flower shop, or Rose Miller, whose employees typically
work at her Watertown beauty salon for only a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with private accounts expected to be a central focus of a
White House conference on Social Security next month, some analysts
are warning that the idea is easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be catastrophic to pass something that might have to
be repealed because not enough planning had gone into it,'' said
Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefits Research
Institute. ``An error here could severely undermine public
confidence in the Social Security system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many questions here about the details that haven't
gotten the attention they deserve,'' said Peter Diamond, an
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   As the booming stock market fattened the portfolios of many
investors in recent years, a variety of lawmakers and analysts came
to believe that workers at all wage levels could add to their
retirement income if they were allowed to pay some of the 12.4
percent Social Security tax to their own stock and bond accounts,
rather than to the government, which invests in safe but
low-yielding Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that stock market growth tops the Treasury bond rate,
the pool of money available for retirement benefits would increase.
That would ease the financial problems Social Security will face
early in the next century, when a wave of Baby Boom retirees begins
to take more in benefits than the system raises each year in taxes.
Of course, with stocks' potential for big gains comes the downside:
shrinking benefits if the market suffered a prolonged decline like
that of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But few of the plans now before Congress explain who will take
care of the details of managing a system of private accounts, which
could be the largest project ever undertaken by the US financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   At least two bills before Congress would require employers to
make sure that money deducted from each worker paycheck makes it to
the correct retirement account, in what would be a system of 148
million accounts. The bills say employers will not be compensated
for taking on this task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't like paperwork and don't want more,'' said
Ahmad Yasin, owner of Kareem's restaurant in Watertown, which
employs four people.
</P>
<P>
   Congress often creates new programs without a clear sense of how
federal agencies will make them a reality. But there is ample
precedent for failure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Congress was forced to repeal a program it passed only
a year earlier to protect the elderly from the costs of
catastrophic illness. Also in 1989, Congress repealed the so-called
Section 89 rules it had passed in 1986 to make sure that employers
offer equal health benefits to workers at all income levels. Both
times, the public complained that the law was ill-conceived and
cost it too much money.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released last week, the Employee Benefits Research
Institute warned that not a single private account proposal is
specific enough to show how much the plan would cost or how it
would affect small employers.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that support private accounts said that the EBRI report
raised the proper questions about technical hurdles in changing the
Social Security system, but that those problems could be overcome.
``We've been dealing with other issues first,'' said Michael Tanner
of the Cato Institute, a think tank. ``You've got to find the
destination before you chart the route.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to a system of private accounts, the current Social
Security program is simple and inexpensive to operate. Giving
workers their own accounts would introduce new complexities:
</P>
<P>
   _Currently, workers must contact the system only twice in their
lives: when they obtain a Social Security number, and when they
retire. With private accounts, workers would have to be tracked
every year through their careers.
</P>
<P>
   _A private system would have to keep records on 148 million
stock and bond accounts, many with small amounts of money and owned
by people who work inconsistently. Nearly half of all workers earn
less than $15,000 a year, so a 2 percent annual contribution would
have these workers set aside $300 or less each year.
</P>
<P>
   _Few workers ever call the Social Security Administration before
they retire. With private accounts, workers would want to be able
to track how much money is in their portfolios, to learn what their
investment options are, and to change their investments at times.
</P>
<P>
   _A move into stock market investing would require someone to
educate workers and to police the people who sell investments.
Today, less than half of all Americans know the difference between
a stock and a bond, said Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, in a recent speech at Harvard University.
(A share of stock represents an ownership stake in a company; a
bond represents a loan that must be repaid).
</P>
<P>
   Levitt noted the problems that struck an under-educated British
work force after that nation allowed people to opt out of the
national pension system in 1988 for private accounts. ``In what has
become known as the `mis-selling' controversy, high-pressure sales
tactics were used to persuade people to switch into unsuitable
personal pension schemes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _Currently, businesses tell the government only once a year _
when they file W-2 forms _ which employees paid how much in Social
Security taxes. A move to private accounts might force employers to
report to the government far more frequently. Workers would
probably not tolerate having money taken from their paycheck each
week but credited to their accounts only once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming a 7 percent rate of return, someone placing $100 a
month in a private account would lose $8,315 over a 40-year career
if the money was credited as one annual sum rather than monthly,
the EBRI report says.
</P>
<P>
   But asking businesses to file data more often would add to their
costs _ &UR;  &LR; roughly $900 million a year, if employers filed data
quarterly instead of in their annual W-2 reports, the EBRI report
says. Frequent reporting could also be difficult because 5.5
million of the 6.5 million US businesses still file W-2 records on
paper, rather than electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The additional costs cannot be determined until the details of
the new system are known. The more investment options, educational
brochures and opportunity to change investments that workers have,
the more the system will cost to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Several small employers said that they feared that any changes
to Social Security would saddle them with more burdens, but they
were keeping an open mind. Yasin, the restaurant owner, said, ``If
it's a better system and more efficient, then maybe I'll agree with
it. But if it's more paperwork for the same or worse, than I'd say
no to it.''

A CENTURY OF MOVIES IN SEATTLE  
 (WITH FILMS-SEATTLE-HISTORY) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ One day in 1898, an enterprising 29-year-old named
Dell Lampman opened the door to the dusty basement of G.O. Guy's
Drug Store _ a building still standing at the corner of Second and
Yesler in Seattle _ and let in a group of mostly Alaska Gold
Rush-bound miners to witness the miracle of moving pictures.
</P>
<P>
   As they found seats in the cramped room, Lampman turned off the
lights, stepped to the projector he had recently purchased in San
Francisco and began to hand crank a series of films _ celluloid
strips that averaged between 10 and 25 feet in length and amounted
to only a few seconds of screen time each.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, Lampman _ who became a North End justice
of the peace and died in 1957 at age 88 _ would remember the
subjects of his films: ``One might depict a man walking . . .
another a horse trotting. A few local scenes, gulls against the
skyline, a steamer puffing to dock.'' Admission was 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first presentation of moving pictures in Seattle.
Edison's peep-show, the ``Kinetoscope,'' had been exhibited in the
Occidental Building at Second and James as early as December 1894.
And a clip of the Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight ran on a vaudeville
bill at the People's Theater in August 1897 _ a year before the
Lampman exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   But that moment in 1898 in the basement of G.O. Guy's was the
first projected exhibition of a motion picture to a paying audience
in a movie theater _ the standard by which the 1895 Paris showing
by the Lumiere Brothers has become universally accepted as the
seminal cinematic moment, the birth of the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the 1898 Lampman showing represents the dawn of the movie
business in this city and _ though the exact month and day of the
event appear to have have been lost _ this year marks a special
anniversary that we've so far managed to forget: 100 years of
cinema in Seattle. Happy Birthday!
</P>
<P>
   Did Lampman have any inkling of what he was starting? Any clue
to where that First Picture Show might lead? In 1951, during a
celebration of the first 50 years of the movie business in Seattle,
P-I columnist Frank Lynch asked the taciturn judge, whose brief
movie career was long behind him and who seemed surprised by all
the fuss. ``It was so long ago,'' Lampman answered, ``I forget.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might have guessed, it was not exactly one of those great
historic moments that goes off with bells and whistles. It was not
even a spark that led to an instant flash fire of movie exhibition
_ that was another two years in the future. Within weeks, Lampman
and his audience were off to the Klondike and the basement theater
at G.O Guy's went dark, and back to its previous function as a
storeroom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was the beginning. Not just of a profitable and
glamorous business, but of a special relationship that has been
much celebrated (and occasionally disputed) during the past 100
years: the unique love affair between America's youngest big city
and the new art form of the 20th century. Seattle as ``Movie Town,
U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Was this love affair real or myth? To me, the evidence seems
overwhelming that it was a real as the rain that has always tended
to drive our citizens into the escape of a dark, warm theater. As
real as the heritage Seattle has always had from being the R&AMP;R
center of the Alaska Gold Rush. (Let's don't forget that in 1898,
Seattle was considered a ``theater town'' second only to New York
and Chicago).
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, it seems impossible to dispute that
movie-going just took here as it took in no other city in the
civilized world. It was Seattle's destiny not to be a great center
of film production (like Hollywood, New York or Vancouver, B.C.),
or even a great cauldron of movie talent (like Denver, San
Francisco or Nebraska) but to be a great appreciator of film, a
connoisseur of the cinema, a place that is simply mad about the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years of the Lampman show, Washington Magazine
noted Seattle seemed to have fallen ``in love'' with the little
storefront movie theaters _ not yet called nickelodeons _ that were
springing up all over town. ``If you go to one of these theaters
almost any time, you are bound to find somebody you know,'' the
Argus reported, ``whether you are a mechanic or move in the Four
Hundred.''
</P>
<P>
   And this love or fixation or affinity _ or whatever it was _
immediately began to express itself not only in terms of the
numbers of theaters but in terms of innovations. Indeed, film
historian William K. Everson once said that any reasonable person
who looked at all Seattle's ``firsts'' in the field of movie
exhibition would conclude it was the world's ``bellwether
movie-theater town.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``The Birth of a Nation'' ushered in the era of
feature filmmaking in 1915, Seattle could lay claim to the first
Wurlitzer organ used in a movie theater (The Dream Theater, 1908);
the first theater built from the ground up to show movies (the
Clemmer Theater, 1912); and the largest theater chain on the West
Coast: the Pantages Circuit (starting with Seattle's Crystal
Theater, 1902).
</P>
<P>
   When the new era arrived, Seattle welcomed it with the Coliseum
Theater, which opened at Fifth and Pike in 1915 and is arguably the
first true movie palace ever built in America. Its brilliant
designer, Seattle architect B. Marcus Priteca, would go on to
design most of the Pantages houses (including his masterpiece, the
Hollywood Pantages), and is generally regarded as the greatest of
all movie theater architects.
</P>
<P>
   By the late '20s, Seattle (not yet a big city) had a downtown
movie theater district _ Coliseum, Paramount, Fifth Avenue,
Orpheum, Palomar, Liberty, Blue Mouse, Music Box, Music Hall,
Roosevelt, Wintergarden, Embassy and Colonial _ that, in grandeur
and seating capacity, was almost the equal of Los Angeles, Chicago
or even Manhattan. And none of those cities could boast an
auditorium quite as magnificent as that of our 5th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the '30s, Seattle's reputation as a special movie town got a
big boost from MGM producer and Seattle native-son John Considine
Jr. (``Boys Town''). He appears to have been the man most
responsible for convincing the studios that his hometown
represented Hollywood's median audience _ a microcosm of the tastes
of middle-class America. ``But how will it play in Seattle?''
Considine's boss, Louis B. Mayer, would often ask.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle theater innovations and the legend grew through the
'40s, '50s and '60s, even as television began to ravage the movie
business and the city began to ruthlessly tear down its cherished
movie palaces to make parking lots. Seattle's 1951 Northgate
Theater is the nation's first true shopping center movie theater,
and its 1969 UA Cinema 70 &AMP; 150 one of the first downtown
multiplexes. In the '60s, Variety officially confirmed what Seattle
had intuitively known all along: it was America's ``largest per
capita movie-going audience.''
</P>
<P>
   In these decades, a new twist on the legend came with the
realization that Seattle might be less a median audience than a
``unique'' audience. Certain films that bombed elsewhere did giant
box office here _ and vice versa. Audiences had their own peculiar
tastes _ which could be indulged since Seattle was the only major
city in America whose movie theaters were all home owned.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, the Washington Post, New York Times, Boston Globe
and all three television networks took turns anointing Seattle as
``Movie Town, U.S.A.'' In that decade, Randy Finley's 90-seat Movie
House in the U District grew from a hippie joke to the Seven Gables
Circuit: the prototype of the modern art-house chain. The Seattle
International Film Festival premiered the best of the Australian,
New German and Dutch film movements. Seattle became Hollywood's
city of choice for the test-run of such films as ``The Stunt Man,''
``The Black Stallion'' and ``They All Laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   That particular bubble burst in the '80s. Both our home-owned
chains _ Sterling and Seven Gables _ were bought by out-of-state
interests and Seattle went from a city that owned all its theaters
to a city that owned none of its theaters virtually overnight.
Seattle's unique character as a movie town got lost in a deluge of
video stores and mediocre new multiplexes playing the same films in
the same way they played in Pittsburgh, Phoenix and Poughkeepsie.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle movie spirit seems to have come back in the '90s
in a burst of energy and creativity and a movie-theater building
boom without precedent. Seattle's screens may now all be owned by
out-of-state corporations, but there have never been so many of
them _ even in the golden age of the '30s and '40s. And the newer
multiplexes _ such as this month's luxurious new General Cinemas
Pacific Place 11 _ have sought to create an air of movie palace
luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the '90s, West Seattle movie lovers led a long,
successful fight to save the Priteca-designed Admiral Theater. The
Paramount was restored to its former glory and then some. The
Cinerama is being remodeled and will open next year as the
downtown's single-screen showcase. Since 1995, Seattle has
experienced an epidemic of tiny boutique cinemas
(``neo-nickelodeons,'' as one critic termed them) and film
festivals devoted to every imaginable ethnic background and sexual
persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a local production company _ ShadowCatcher _ made
``Smoke Signals,'' the first nationally successful film ever
produced out of Seattle. The Seattle International Film Festival
held on to its position as the nation's largest volume film
festival. A group of young Seattle filmmakers calling itself the
Northwest Film Forum initiated its own production studio and
remodeled the Grand Illusion Cinema _ a home-owned Seattle theater
_ as a venue for revival exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent Seattle visitor John Sayles once said that he believed
the Seattle character had some essential gene that loves movies
``the way Brooklyn used to love baseball.'' As we move into our
second hundred years of movies, that gene still seems dominant, the
love affair is visibly intact, the addiction to celluloid as strong
as it's ever been.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Lampman had no idea what he was starting.

TOBACCO TAX'S SURPRISE WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- And the hits just keep on coming.
</P>
<P>
   Out in California just before this month's election, the
conventionally wise told me to forget about Proposition 10, that
whatever other political earthquakes were about to occur, the
state's voters were not about to vote themselves higher cigarette
taxes _ even for the lofty purpose of paying for a serious early
childhood development program.
</P>
<P>
   Made sense. Political attention was elsewhere on the long
ballot, there was hardly any TV advertising or news coverage, and
the tax-averse statewide candidates avoided it, though successful
voter turnout work by the Democratic Party clearly was helping.
</P>
<P>
   Shame, I thought. Good idea. Maybe next time. Then it won,
upsetting still another apple cart and perhaps sending a message
back here to the Clinton administration to keep its own sights high
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 10 did not win by much. On Election Night, in the
closest of all the statewide contests, the yes vote was up by a
minuscule 13,000 or so ballots, with mostly the absentees yet to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, however, the initiative has defied the conventional
wisdom, in this case that absentee means ``conservative.'' The
margin continued to grow over the following week, and when it
inched past 60,000 votes victory was declared. At the moment the
margin is a tiny, half-percentage-point or so.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the vision credit goes to movie director and
actor Rob Reiner, a major player in the growing movement to support
pregnant women and children in the first few years of life, when
the brain is forming, and to the indefatigable tobacco-fighting
state Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a decade since the state's cigarette tax had been
increased, putting it below the national average and making it a
political target. And that last increase of 25 cents, also by
initiative, had funded an antismoking crusade in the state that is
widely cited as evidence that aggressive tactics (including higher
prices) can significantly reduce smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-cent increase is based on the realism of the Clinton
administration's effort earlier this year (blocked by Senate
filibuster) to raise the federal levy by $1.50 as part of a
national settlement of liability issues with the tobacco business.
On the one hand, a steep price hike will reduce smoking, especially
by the young, but among the addicted there will continue to be
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The details of Proposition 10 are important, and here are the
key ones:
</P>
<P>
   _The tax is conservatively assumed to generate $700 million
annually after a phase-in year, all of which will be reserved in a
special account.
</P>
<P>
   _First call on the money will be to reimburse the state's
existing antismoking and breast cancer funds to the extent a dip in
consumption is found to reduce their revenue. Not expected to be
much, if anything, but very important politically.
</P>
<P>
   _The only Sacramento bureaucracy will be a seven-member
commission charged with creating broad guidelines, auditing
results, and allocating the money based on the number of births in
each county as a share of statewide births.
</P>
<P>
   _The real work and the real money will be run through each of
California's 58 counties, with only one in five dollars earmarked
for statewide public education and training of child care workers.
The rest is for actual programs run at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now _ in the state and in the country _ the
undeniable fact that the human brain is almost entirely formed in
the first three years is mocked by the fact that hardly any social
resources are aimed at this critical period. Now, the chance has
been created that each county can integrate social services _ from
pre- and post-natal health care through immunization and on to
highest-quality, educational child care (in the home or elsewhere).
Lest people forget, the issue that dominated elections large and
small this month was education, and the public defines it broadly.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising squeaker in California should put both issues _
early childhood development and antitobacco policies _ back on the
front burner here next year.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed legislative proposals on early childhood, including a
major investment in the Early Start precursor to Head Start,
existed even before Rob Reiner along with Hillary Rodham Clinton
helped make two White House conferences on the subject major,
proselytizing successes last year.
</P>
<P>
   As noted above, the cigarette tax was not defeated in the
Senate; it was blocked by filibuster. Majorities exist to pass it,
and advocates can't wait to test sentiment in the barely Republican
House, which may be less interested next year in being so publicly
identified as an arm of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   For President Clinton, the question is one of priorities.
Already, it's clear that HMO reform, minimum wage, school
construction, and Social Security are all coming back prominently.
The antitobacco crusade and young children's health and education
should rank just as high, especially now that they have been
linked.

   Nason Snyder, the 64-year-old owner of Standard Photo in

vitamins. Eat meat only about twice a week. My weight has been
about the same since high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's doctor, Harvey Simon of Massachusetts General Hospital,
is among the multiplying legions of physicians convinced that a
daily ``baby'' aspirin gives elder Americans an important extra
edge in their effort to avoid a heart attack and the most common
kind of stroke. It may also lower the risk of colon cancer and
dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal for a 100-year-old medicine that costs about a
penny a day and carries very little risk at the low doses shown to
prevent heart attacks and strokes. Aspirin works in large part by
its immediate and lasting effect on blood platelets, making them
less likely to clump together and form a catastrophic clot in the
arteries of the heart or brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually everybody with coronary disease should be taking
aspirin daily,'' says Simon, editor of Harvard Men's Health Watch.
``For people without heart disease, I think almost everybody with
risk factors should take daily aspirin unless there is a reason not
to. That means most men above 50 _ and probably most women,
although the data don't confirm that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   While aspirin can cause stomach upset and even gastric bleeding
with chronic use, these side effects can be eliminated for most
people, doctors say, by using ``baby'' doses of 81 milligrams a
day, and by taking tablets every other day.
</P>
<P>
   Like Simon, many doctors not only prescribe daily low-dose
aspirin for their patients over age 50, they take it themselves.
``Whenever I give a talk to physicians, I ask how many take
prophylactic aspirin and most of the hands go up,'' says Dr. James
E. Dalen, vice president for health sciences at the University of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer myself,'' Dalen adds. ``I started taking it
when I was 50. I recommend it to everybody over 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts wince at such unbridled enthusiasm _ at least until
studies currently in progress answer some important questions about
daily aspirin use. But Dalen is not just any practicing doc. He is
cochairman of a 70-member panel convened by the American College of
Chest Physicians to sift and judge the evidence for prescribing
aspirin and other anti-clotting agents to both ailing and healthy
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the panel ratified what many are already doing,
declaring that people over 50 should be taking low-dose aspirin to
prevent heart attack, stroke, or transient ischemic attacks
(``little strokes'') if they have at least one risk factor for
heart disease and no condition that makes aspirin use inadvisable.
</P>
<P>
   That means the vast majority of over-50 Americans, since major
coronary risk factors include: male gender, high blood pressure,
elevated cholesterol, diabetes, cigarette smoking, family history
of heart disease or stroke, and lack of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The US Food and Drug Administration didn't go that far last
month in issuing new guidelines on aspirin use. ``The available
data do not support'' using aspirin to prevent a first-time heart
attack, the FDA concluded on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the FDA said it will advise doctors to
prescribe aspirin for:
</P>
<P>
   _Patients with angina (chest pain) at rest, for an indefinite
period.
</P>
<P>
   _Those who have had an ``occlusive'' stroke (brain damage due to
insufficient blood flow), to prevent a recurrence, for an
indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
   _Women who have had ``transient ischemic attacks'' or ``little
strokes,'' for an indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
   _Patients who have had coronary bypass surgery, starting within
six hours and continuing for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   _Individuals undergoing artery-clearing angioplasty (in coronary
vessels) or endarterectomy (in neck arteries), starting before the
procedure and continuing indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA last year advised aspirin use in individuals having
current symptoms of a heart attack, as soon as possible and once
daily for at least 30 days. In the 1980s, the FDA advised doctors
to use aspirin in patients with a prior heart attack, patients with
chest pain at rest, and men with a history of ``little strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite universal consensus on these aspirin uses and the
backing of the FDA, thousands of American patients who could be
spared heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular death are not yet
getting aspirin therapy, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 80 percent of people who have survived a heart attack or
occlusive stroke are on aspirin. We've got to get that higher,''
says Dr. Charles H. Hennekens, chief of preventive medicine at
Brigham and Women's Hospital. ``Only 40 to 50 percent of patients
having a heart attack are getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   For every 1,000 who take a 325-milligram standard aspirin tablet
early in the course of a heart attack, 23 would avoid premature
death. The survivors enjoy a 49 percent lower risk of a subsequent
nonfatal heart attack and a 46 percent lower risk of stroke _
without increased risk of brain hemorrhage due to aspirin's
anti-clotting effects.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the much-vaunted clot-buster drugs used to treat
heart attack reduce the death rate about the same amount, but cause
two or three brain hemorrhages for every 1,000 patients treated.
Moreover, the clot-busters cost from $12,000 to $88,000 for every
heart attack death that is prevented, compared to $13 for aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   Hennekens directs the Physicians Health Study, a monumental
project involving 22,071 US doctors between 40 and 84 who were
randomly assigned to take a regular aspirin tablet every other day
or a placebo. The researchers stopped the aspirin study after five
years because the effect was so dramatic: 44 percent fewer heart
attacks among the aspirin-takers.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent British study of more than 5,000 doctors failed to
reproduce the finding, perhaps because it used such a high aspirin
dose that many subjects dropped out due to stomach problems. But
two 1988 studies involving more than 24,000 subjects with no prior
heart disease found about a one-third reduction in heart attacks
among users of low-dose aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   Hennekens is a foremost aspirin enthusiast. He and other
researchers petitioned the FDA in 1992 and 1994 to expand the
official uses of aspirin. Nevertheless, he doesn't go as far as
Dalen, Simon, and many doctors in recommending routine daily
aspirin for older individuals without evidence of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a talk last week at the American Heart Association's annual
meeting in Dallas, Hennekens addressed the issue in a talk entitled
``Aspirin for Everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is no,'' he told the specialists. ``We know aspirin
reduces the risk of a first heart attack, and that reduction is as
conclusive as the reduction of a second heart attack that has been
seen in over a dozen studies. But there haven't been enough strokes
and overall deaths in these studies to know aspirin's effect on
these measures, and to make a policy recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is one of benefit versus risk. Taken together, the
four major studies so far on ``primary prevention'' (the use of
aspirin in healthy individuals to prevent a first ``event'') had
divergent results on the incidence of nonfatal strokes _ from a 13
percent reduction among aspirin-users to a 29 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   The four primary prevention studies also failed to demonstrate
that aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, as opposed
to nonfatal heart attacks, possibly because it requires even more
than the 52,000 initially healthy subjects in those studies to show
a mortality difference.
</P>
<P>
   To help resolve the risk-benefit equation _ and determine if
women benefit from primary prevention _ Hennekens and colleagues
are currently studying 40,000 female physicians, with results
expected in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many say the prudent course is for patients to weigh
with their doctors whether an aspirin a day will keep disease away.
``If I had a patient who had no risk factors except elevated
cholesterol, I'd work on the chosterol first and not be terribly
energetic about aspirin,'' says Dr. Lynn Smaha, president-elect of
the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Hennekens followed this course for himself. He
consulted with his physician and...decided to take an aspirin a
day.

FINISH THE JOB THAT BUSH LEFT UNDONE IN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Bush and Colin Powell were squeamish about killing Iraqi
soldiers as they fled north out of Kuwait in February 1991, and so
they called a halt to the Gulf War. They rejected the advice of
General Norman Schwarzkopf _ ``We could have continued to wreak
great destruction upon them; we could have ... made it in fact a
battle of annihilation.'' Instead, they declared victory.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush had called Saddam Hussein ``worse than Hitler.''
He had urged the Iraqi people to overthrow him. But when Iraqis
erupted in revolt the day the war ended, Bush declined to help
them. The ``defeated'' Saddam commenced using helicopter gunships
and napalm to murder Iraqi Kurds and Shi'ites _ right under the
eyes of 400,000 US troops. Bush refused to intervene. When Senator
George Mitchell suggested that US pilots could shoot down Saddam's
helicopters and stop the massacre, Bush flippantly replied,
``Always glad to have his opinion. Glad to hear from him.'' To
underscore his lack of interest, he went fishing in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   As the current crisis in Iraq has unfolded, many commentators
have noted President Clinton's history of drawing lines in the
sand, then allowing Saddam to cross them. On the few occasions when
Clinton has punished Iraq, his actions have been meaningless. In
1996, Saddam assaulted the Kurdish city of Irbil, located in the
northern no-fly zone. Clinton's retaliation was to lob cruise
missiles at some military sites hundreds of miles to the south. The
result, CIA director John Deutch later testified, was to leave
Saddam politically strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of Clinton's blundering, it is worth remembering:
The mother of all blunders was Bush's. Eager for the PR coup of a
``hundred-hour war,'' he left Saddam in power. He tossed away the
chance to liberate the Iraqi people by demolishing Saddam's
tyranny. Saddam was left free to butcher his foes by the tens of
thousands. And he was left hungry for revenge _ and bent on
acquiring chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is gone now, as are most of the other heads of state from
the Desert Storm coalition. But Saddam remains, more dangerous than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors from the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) have been
barred since early August from hunting down Iraq's weapons of mass
death. Though vast quantities of chemical and biological agents
have been found and destroyed over the past seven years, the
weapons monitors warn that large quantities remain secreted. Saddam
has mobile missiles already loaded with biological poisons, such as
anthrax. Thousands of tons of chemical weapons agents are still
unaccounted for. Tests have shown that Iraq has packed VX, a lethal
nerve gas, into missile warheads.
</P>
<P>
   According to UNSCOM, Iraq has 34 plants that can be converted to
the production of chemical weapons, and sufficient personnel with
the expertise to run them. According to Scott Ritter, the weapons
expert who resigned last summer to protest the administration's
repeated cave-ins, Iraq has built three nuclear devices. As of
August, the Iraqis lacked only the fissionable material needed for
the weapons' core. By now they may have acquired them on the black
market.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam and his spokesmen harp on the misery caused by the
economic sanctions against Iraq, but sanctions are nothing to him.
(Ordinary Iraqis may suffer, but Saddam and his inner circle live
in lavish comfort.) The only thing he cares about is amassing an
arsenal with which to dominate the Middle East and be avenged on
his enemies. Each time he has had to choose between ending
sanctions or protecting his secret weapons, he has chosen the
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has used chemical weapons before. During his war with
Iran, he launched missiles loaded with Sarin at Iranian cities; to
quell dissent in the Kurdish city of Halabja, he mustard-gassed
5,000 men, women, and children to death. He would do it again. He
will do it again.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons inspectors are honorable and courageous, but the
time for inspecting ran out long ago. It is now time to finish the
job George Bush left undone.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred missiles may shake up Baghdad, but they will not
do anything about hidden warheads filled with nerve agents and
biological poisons. Saddam survived a punishing bombardment in
1991; it will take more than cruise missiles to dislodge him now.
It will take, first and foremost, American backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must announce to the world that it is the intention of
the United States to liberate Iraq from Saddam's bloody grip. He
should encourage the formation of an Iraqi government-in-exile, and
begin funneling aid to Saddam's opponents. The northern and
southern no-fly zones should be proclaimed Free Iraq, and declared
off-limits to Saddam's forces _ and under US military protection.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam may be preparing to fire weapons of mass destruction.
Clinton must deter him by saying explicitly that any use of such
weapons will bring massive retaliation. At the same time, he should
order more ships, aircraft, armor, and troops to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years of American vacillation have allowed Saddam to
reestablish himself as the most powerful despot in his part of the
world. Nothing is more urgent at this moment than making it crystal
clear that the United States intends to crush him and his regime.
If we fail again, we will never be forgiven.

Y2K PROBLEM THROWS A SCARE INTO WALL STREETS BIGGEST BULL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a moment you are Dr. Ed Yardeni, chief economist of Deutsche
Bank Securities (North America). You are paid vast sums of money to
make your wealthy clients richer, and you are very good at your
job. Indeed, you may be the best economic forecaster of this
decade, so prescient is your analysis.
</P>
<P>
   You have impeccable credentials. You completed your PhD
dissertation under professor (and Nobel Laureate) James Tobin at
Yale University, taught at Columbia University's Graduate School of
Business, served as an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, and held positions at the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors and the US Treasury Department in Washington. In private
life, you served as chief economist for C.J. Lawrence, Prudential
Securities, and E.F. Hutton.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, when everyone else was moaning and groaning
about the coming recession and the size of the deficit, you looked
around and saw a world transformed by the end of the Cold War, the
technology revolution and scientific discovery and announced that a
``New Economy'' was being born. Fasten your seat belts, you told
your colleagues and clients, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is
going to take off like a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   You even put a number on it _ 5,000 Dow. Your colleagues said
that might be a tad optimistic, which in their view was just two
steps removed from out of your mind. But you had the courage of
your convictions. You saw the big picture, and the big picture was
almost limitless investment opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   And you were right. The Dow did take off like a rocket. Soon
enough (1993) it punched through the 5,000 figure with fuel to
burn. What next? Ten thousand by 2000, you said, figuring, why not?
Ten thousand Dow seemed mighty optimistic, maybe only one step
removed from lunacy, but you were unfazed. The productivity
revolution, the technology revolution, the genomics revolution, the
political landscape, demographic trends, 401(k) plans, and mutual
fund mania all pointed due north.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the Dow ramped just as you said it would. By that
time, the press was eating out of your hand. ABC News called you
the best economic forecaster in the country, Barron's sang your
praises at every turn. And all the while, the Dow just kept moving
up.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem. You were not only smart, you were
intellectually curious. Smart was fine; eggheads were in on Wall
Street. But intellectual curiosity was, let's be honest about it,
problematic. It took you to unexpected places.
</P>
<P>
   But you're Dr. Ed Yardeni and you don't care, so you begin to
consider the implications of the Year 2000 (Y2K) computer problem.
The problem is simple. In much of the embedded memory of the global
economy are computer chips and computer programs that think the
year 2000 is really the year 1900. A weird glitch, to say the
least, but an interesting glitch, given that the new economy runs
on computers.
</P>
<P>
   You begin to really study this problem and the more you look
into it, the more freaked out you become. Before long, you
transform your website (www.yardeni.com) into a Y2K Red Alert
bulletin board. There, you post articles and provide links on how
the Y2K computer problem will affect every aspect of economic,
military, and social life in the developed and underdeveloped
world. You realize that air travel, electric utilities, telephone
service, Medicare, just-in-time production capabilities, and
``mission critical'' national security operations might be rendered
dysfunctional by the glitch. And that's just for starters. It makes
your head spin because you know that nothing much is really being
done about it.
</P>
<P>
   But you're Ed Yardeni and so you become, as New York Magazine's
Jim Suroweicki called you, a Y2K Jeremiah. This summer, you go
before some big shot group and announce that the chances of a
Y2K-induced global recession (on the order of the post-OPEC 1973-74
global recession) is 70 percent. In your heart of hearts you
probably think it's more like 99 percent. Because the more you
learn about this Y2K computer problem, the more immense it becomes.
</P>
<P>
   And then, this week, you walk into your office and scan the
morning papers. There on the front page of Tuesday's Financial
Times is the following headline: ``Too late to defuse millennium
bomb, software group warns.'' The story is based on a comprehensive
report by a leading European software consulting firm on the Y2K
problem and its conclusions are grim.
</P>
<P>
   You're Ed Yardeni, Wall Street's greatest bull through much of
the 1990s and, because of the Y2K computer glitch, you have become
the King of the Bears. With each passing day, you grow more
concerned and wonder why more is not being done. You're Ed Yardeni.
You know you're right and you hope you're wrong.

IN CALIFORNIA, GOLF CAN MAKE A DREAM WEEKEND COME TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ There's a golf course here that anyone
could play every day without ever a shred of boredom or hint of
monotony. It's called the Pebble Beach Golf Links, it costs at
least $255 a round, and no one plays every day.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this course so wonderful are the varying conditions _
the way you need a sand wedge one day on the 103-yard seventh hole
and a 7-iron the next _ and the hard-to-read but well-maintained
greens. Oh, and then there are some of the most spectacular views
in the world, should your golf game leave something to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road, Spanish Bay is much the same. You go to
sleep remembering every shot, and if you're inclined to have a
little golf weekend, you can play three straight rounds here and
still want to play a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco area is lucky enough to have a few such
destinations _ perfect weekend getaways. Here are a few personal
favorites:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bodega Harbour Golf Links: Director of golf Dennis Kalkowski
likes to describe playing his course as ``the finest golfing
experience available west of Scotland and north of Pebble Beach.''
Looking at the scorecard, where par is 70 from tees that measure
only 5,685 yards, it's easy to argue with him. But Bodega is a
great example of a course that you actually need two or three days
to play. It is extremely narrow and tricky and challenging, ideal
for a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Play-and-stay packages start at $189.90 per twosome at the Inn
at the Tides and $232.41 at the Bodega Bay Lodge, or you might want
to consider renting one of the many houses that line the course for
a foursome or, even, two foursomes. If you do that, you'll see
firsthand how meticulously Bodega Harbour is cared for. For
information: 707-875-3538.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Sea Ranch Golf Links: They say you can see the ocean from
somewhere on every hole, which accounts partly for the great
drainage at Sea Ranch. The course stays playable most of the year.
And what will keep you coming back from more than a round are all
the balls you lost the first time. There are many blind shots that
beg for local knowledge on this championship course, and your best
bet is to try to coax course manager Skip Manning, a Tin Cup type,
to play along with you. Packages including a night at the Sea Ranch
Lodge and golf for two begin at $203 a night. For information:
707-785-2371.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the Little River Inn has extended its ``Golf's On Us''
package from the offseason to all seasons. It's a nine-hole course
that was designed some 50 years ago or so by some of the locals
over cocktails. Nine holes _ play it again, or use the leftover
time for enjoying the luxurious ocean-front rooms and fabulous
restaurant. Packages start at $130 in the offseason, including all
the golf you can stand, and rain checks are issued if rain cancels
your round. For information: 888-INN-LOVE.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ridgemark Golf and Country Club: The two courses here opened
in 1972, so Ridgemark is no secret to longtime golfers. That's the
primary appeal here _ two resort-style courses, meaning double the
golfing pleasure, in a cheerful, unpretentious atmosphere. There's
plenty of space in the rooms, plenty of food at the restaurant, and
plenty of golf at your door. That makes Ridgemark, with two-night
packages starting at about $395, a bargain destination. For
information: 800-637-8151.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stevinson Ranch: What a fabulous golf course in the middle of
nowhere. Founder George Kelley cites the five cuts of grass and the
daily pin placement changes as reason to play the Savannah Course
more than once in a trip. Plus there are the new cottages adjacent
to the property, at stay-and-play packages starting at $140 per
twosome for a round of golf and a night of sleep. Don't plan to
play on Christmas Day, however: It's the one day the course is
closed. For information: 888-606-7529.
</P>
<P>
   _ Silverado Country Club and Resort: A personal favorite, we
spent Christmas Day here last year. Many players hold their
collective breath every autumn wondering, ``Do golfers still have a
Dream at Silverado?'' And every fall, the resort issues its
promotional plea: Come and play golf and stay in a condominium any
night from Dec. 13 through Dec. 23 at just $139 per twosome _ a
$390 value. That package starts at about $240 now, $199 during the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   There are two courses at Silverado _ the one the seniors play in
the Transamerica and the one everybody says is the best. They're
pioneers in the art of building layers of sand on fairways to
improve drainage here, and it would take little luck for these
courses to be playable on any winter day. For information:
707-257-0200.

SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN FILLED WITH PERIL, ANALYSTS WARN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It sounds simple: Save the Social Security system
by letting Americans invest their retirement taxes for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the boldest idea for fixing the popular program _ turning it
into a series of privately owned investment accounts _ could
dramatically raise the costs of running a national retirement
system. It could also create a nightmare for small employers like
Shirley Hamblen, who does most of her own accounting for her
Lexington flower shop, or Rose Miller, whose employees typically
work at her Watertown beauty salon for only a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with private accounts expected to be a central focus of a
White House conference on Social Security next month, some analysts
are warning that the idea is easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be catastrophic to pass something that might have to
be repealed because not enough planning had gone into it,'' said
Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefits Research
Institute. ``An error here could severely undermine public
confidence in the Social Security system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many questions here about the details that haven't
gotten the attention they deserve,'' said Peter Diamond, an
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   As the booming stock market fattened the portfolios of many
investors in recent years, a variety of lawmakers and analysts came
to believe that workers at all wage levels could add to their
retirement income if they were allowed to pay some of the 12.4
percent Social Security tax to their own stock and bond accounts,
rather than to the government, which invests in safe but
low-yielding Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that stock market growth tops the Treasury bond rate,
the pool of money available for retirement benefits would increase.
That would ease the financial problems Social Security will face
early in the next century, when a wave of Baby Boom retirees begins
to take more in benefits than the system raises each year in taxes.
Of course, with stocks' potential for big gains comes the downside:
shrinking benefits if the market suffered a prolonged decline like
that of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But few of the plans now before Congress explain who will take
care of the details of managing a system of private accounts, which
could be the largest project ever undertaken by the US financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   At least two bills before Congress would require employers to
make sure that money deducted from each worker paycheck makes it to
the correct retirement account, in what would be a system of 148
million accounts. The bills say employers will not be compensated
for taking on this task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't like paperwork and don't want more,'' said
Ahmad Yasin, owner of Kareem's restaurant in Watertown, which
employs four people.
</P>
<P>
   Congress often creates new programs without a clear sense of how
federal agencies will make them a reality. But there is ample
precedent for failure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Congress was forced to repeal a program it passed only
a year earlier to protect the elderly from the costs of
catastrophic illness. Also in 1989, Congress repealed the so-called
Section 89 rules it had passed in 1986 to make sure that employers
offer equal health benefits to workers at all income levels. Both
times, the public complained that the law was ill-conceived and
cost it too much money.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released last week, the Employee Benefits Research
Institute warned that not a single private account proposal is
specific enough to show how much the plan would cost or how it
would affect small employers.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that support private accounts said that the EBRI report
raised the proper questions about technical hurdles in changing the
Social Security system, but that those problems could be overcome.
``We've been dealing with other issues first,'' said Michael Tanner
of the Cato Institute, a think tank. ``You've got to find the
destination before you chart the route.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to a system of private accounts, the current Social
Security program is simple and inexpensive to operate. Giving
workers their own accounts would introduce new complexities:
</P>
<P>
   _Currently, workers must contact the system only twice in their
lives: when they obtain a Social Security number, and when they
retire. With private accounts, workers would have to be tracked
every year through their careers.
</P>
<P>
   _A private system would have to keep records on 148 million
stock and bond accounts, many with small amounts of money and owned
by people who work inconsistently. Nearly half of all workers earn
less than $15,000 a year, so a 2 percent annual contribution would
have these workers set aside $300 or less each year.
</P>
<P>
   _Few workers ever call the Social Security Administration before
they retire. With private accounts, workers would want to be able
to track how much money is in their portfolios, to learn what their
investment options are, and to change their investments at times.
</P>
<P>
   _A move into stock market investing would require someone to
educate workers and to police the people who sell investments.
Today, less than half of all Americans know the difference between
a stock and a bond, said Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, in a recent speech at Harvard University.
(A share of stock represents an ownership stake in a company; a
bond represents a loan that must be repaid).
</P>
<P>
   Levitt noted the problems that struck an under-educated British
work force after that nation allowed people to opt out of the
national pension system in 1988 for private accounts. ``In what has
become known as the `mis-selling' controversy, high-pressure sales
tactics were used to persuade people to switch into unsuitable
personal pension schemes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _Currently, businesses tell the government only once a year _
when they file W-2 forms _ which employees paid how much in Social
Security taxes. A move to private accounts might force employers to
report to the government far more frequently. Workers would
probably not tolerate having money taken from their paycheck each
week but credited to their accounts only once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming a 7 percent rate of return, someone placing $100 a
month in a private account would lose $8,315 over a 40-year career
if the money was credited as one annual sum rather than monthly,
the EBRI report says.
</P>
<P>
   But asking businesses to file data more often would add to their
costs _ &UR;  &LR; roughly $900 million a year, if employers filed data
quarterly instead of in their annual W-2 reports, the EBRI report
says. Frequent reporting could also be difficult because 5.5
million of the 6.5 million US businesses still file W-2 records on
paper, rather than electronically.
</P>
<P>
   The additional costs cannot be determined until the details of
the new system are known. The more investment options, educational
brochures and opportunity to change investments that workers have,
the more the system will cost to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Several small employers said that they feared that any changes
to Social Security would saddle them with more burdens, but they
were keeping an open mind. Yasin, the restaurant owner, said, ``If
it's a better system and more efficient, then maybe I'll agree with
it. But if it's more paperwork for the same or worse, than I'd say
no to it.''

A CHALLENGING WEEK FOR THE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just as President Clinton had cleared away one
persistent antagonist, Paula Jones, he found another, Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein, refusing to go away.
</P>
<P>
   In the roller-coaster ride that is the Clinton presidency, the
showdown with Iraq is but one of the important challenges facing
the administration this week, giving Clinton an opportunity to
exert presidential leadership abroad while he faces daunting
questions about his credibility at home.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr will lay out
the case for impeaching the president before the House Judiciary
Committee. The day before, House Republicans will vote on their new
leadership team, which could define the legislative limits of the
Clinton legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Those developments come on the heels of a string of successes
for Clinton, not the least of which was the Nov. 3 election in
which Democrats unexpectedly gained five House seats. and Friday's
settlement in the long-running Paula Jones sexual-harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed to pay Jones, whose suit led to the presidential
impeachment inquiry, $850,000 without making an apology or
admission of wrongdoing, which she had long sought.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton allies say that settling the Jones case strengthens his
hand going into the impeachment hearings, and some others agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, he looks pretty good at this time, or he at least has
a good grip on the railing of the ship,'' said Marlin Fitzwater,
press secretary for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. ``But
there's just always the feeling with Clinton that he could fall off
at any minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things that were good for him in the last week could
turn bad for him at any moment,'' Fitzwater said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when things look bad, the president has shown an uncanny
ability to turn them to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Iraq, as far as I can tell, the
administration is handling 1,000 percent bettter than they did the
last time,'' said Boston College political scientist Marc Landy.
``The way to deal with this backyard bully is just to stare him
down, and somehow we didn't understand that the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours before he was to board Air Force One to fly to Malaysia
for a 21-nation Asia-Pacific economic summit, Clinton canceled the
trip, sending Vice President Al Gore in his place while he stays
behind to evaluate action against Hussein in the dispute with Iraq
over UN weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were in the middle of using cruise missiles and bombs,
it would have made it much more difficult for him going into that
conference, though he does have strong support internationally to
force Saddam Hussein to allow inspections,'' said James A. Thurber,
director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies
at American University.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaysia trip had been a big question mark all week, as the
United States increased its forces in the Persian Gulf in
anticipation of a possible military strike.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Joseph Lockhart said Clinton was still
planning to make the rest of what had been planned as a 10-day
trip, including stops in Japan, South Korea, and Guam.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Clinton may still be able to get out of town
before Starr lays out his case for impeachment, though it's
unlikely the president will be gone by Wednesday, when House
Republicans pick their new leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   Thurber said Starr's appearance before the Judiciary Committee
could be trouble for Republicans. ``Ken Starr may not be that cool
on the medium of television,'' he said. ``It's a high-risk
strategy, and Starr's in a tough situation. I'm sure the president
will be watching that carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Landy stressed the uncertainties facing both sides when Starr
testifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under other circumstances, I would say Ken Starr testifying
could be tremendous trouble for him,'' Landy said. ``Starr is a
very articulate, talented litigator. He will make a very cogent
case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, elections really matter, and the Republicans
presented the country with an opportunity to speak on this matter,
and they lost five House seats,'' Landy said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fitzwater said that while the elections were good for
Clinton, the House Republicans could end up stronger if they choose
a capable new leadership team. ``That could be bad for (Clinton) in
the next two months or six months,'' said Fitzwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment hearings are reeling from the election message
of two weeks ago, and on the other hand the hearings could drag on
to January,'' Fitzwater said. ``Anything could come up, attitudes
could change, and the fact of it is he still hasn't found a way out
of that yet, so on the other hand, he still has plea-bargaining
ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all those bright lights, Paula Jones was the brightest, at
least the one that's likely not to turn around on him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a good week,'' Fitzwater added. ``The question is
whether he can turn that into a good month.''

WHY DON'T WEBS CATCH SPIDERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why don't spiders get entangled in their own web?
</P>
<P>
   Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are about 17,400 species of spiders, but only half of
them build webs: 3,600 weave orb webs, the kind with the spiral
woven around those straight radii extending out from the center.
and 5,000 weave sheet webs, which are less-organized tangles that
don't have glue on them.
</P>
<P>
   The other species, like wolf spiders and jumping spiders, spin
silk homes in which they rest and hide, but have no web to trap
prey.
</P>
<P>
   Now, inspired by Sir Walter Scott, who wrote ``Oh what a tangled
web we weave...'' here's a bit of verse to explain why the
webmasters of the spider kingdom don't get caught in their own
threads.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Step into my web, said the orb-weaver to the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Just make you sure you touch the sticky parts, &UR;  &LR; and not the
radii.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ever-widening spiral of orb webs contains glue droplets, but
the radii that support the web aren't sticky at all. The spider can
sense where on its web its prey has become stuck and then race
quickly to it, traveling safely along the radii.
</P>
<P>
   Orb weavers of one species sometimes invade the web of another,
and staying on the radii, feed on prey the resident spider has
wrapped up and immobilized with its venom. They also occasionally
captures and devours the resident spider.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A spider whose web spreads out like a sheet
</P>
<P>
   Avoids getting caught thanks to hairs on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sheet webs are an irregular mesh, ``a big tangle of
crisscrossing silk strands,'' says entomologist Elizabeth Jakob of
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. There are no glue
droplets to snare prey.
</P>
<P>
   ``An insect flying into a sheet web isn't so much glued as
tangled,'' Jakob explains. ``Insects tend to go into sheet webs
flat-footed, or flat-winged, creating more surface area of contact
with the web. As they struggle they get even more entangled. It's
like a man trying to run through soft snow on his knees chased by
an enemy on skis.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of skis, the spider has tiny hairs on its feet that lets
it effectively tip-toe across the fine silk strands without sinking
into the mesh of the web and getting tangled up. It can dash across
the web and reach its prey before the unlucky bug can free itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sheet weavers sometimes invade the webs of other sheet weavers.
A battle ensues, and should one of the spiders slip off those tiny
hairs and step on a web strand with its full foot, it will be
entangled long enough to be captured and devoured.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do turtles necks work, to let them extend their heads or
withdraw them into their shells?
</P>
<P>
   T. L., Jamaica Plain, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Place a piece of string on a table and stretch it out
straight. Now, holding the bottom end still, push the top down and
curve the string to form the letter S. That's what the part of a
turtle's spinal column in its neck looks like when the animal hides
its head.
</P>
<P>
   Mammals have seven vertebrae, separate sections of the spinal
column, in their necks. Humans have seven. Even giraffes have only
seven. Turtles have 15. Ours are flat and stacked like blocks.
Turtle vertebrae are rounded, more like balls. They touch on more
rounded pivot points. That gives a turtle's neck much more
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine our neck vertebrae as a column of seven blocks, with a
string (the spinal cord of nerves and spinal fluid) running up the
middle. You can bend the column a little in any direction, but
that's about it. Now imagine the turtle's neck vertebrae as a
column of 15 tennis balls with a string through the middle. When
the turtle's head is extended, the vertebrae, like those tennis
balls, make a nice straight line. But when it withdraws its head,
the neck muscles shift the position of those round-shaped
vertebrae, and the number 1 becomes the letter S.

COULD THIS BE TV'S ROTTENEST SEASON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weren't bananas once sacred? Didn't their warm yellow color once
whisper ``all-natural'' and not ``Dharma''? And since when did they
serve as vehicles for cultural wisdom like: ``TV. Zero Calories''?
These could be the questioning thought balloons above grocery
shoppers' heads as they discover tiny ABC ads stuck onto their
bananas, clingy reminders of a medium that is in the midst of some
major slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Because as desperate as ABC is to grab the American public, as
boldly as the third-rated network is invading even the still-life
purity of the fruit section, network TV lineups this season hardly
deserve our attention. The ad slogan ``TV. Zero Calories'' has a
figurative meaning that is quite inescapable right now, as
prime-time series represent a low in psychic nutrition. Sure, ABC's
wily ad campaign, called ``We Love TV,'' may get us to put down our
bananas and tune in, but even the ad concept of the century can't
keep us turned on when faced with ``The Secret Lives of Men'' or
``Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place.'' Ultimately, the ABC
campaign itself, with hip nuggets like ``Hello? It's Free,'' offers
more passing sophistication than the TV shows themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason the season is a stinker are the nearly 40
series that premiered in September and October, which have proven
themselves to be an average lot at best. Lodged in between the
uncountably many newsmagazines, including five nights of
``Dateline,'' the class of '98 ranges from the mediocre
cookie-cutter comedy of ``Conrad Bloom'' to the dull medical-cliche
festival that is ``L.A. Doctors,'' with the jury still out on three
promising cases: ``Sports Night,'' ``Felicity,'' and ``Will &AMP;
Grace.'' The most you can say about ``Jesse'' or ``Maggie Winters''
or ``The King of Queens'' is that they're not as bad as ``Encore!
Encore!'' or ``Becker.'' And disasters like ``The Secret Diary of
Desmond Pfeiffer'' and ``Wind on Water'' have already met their
maker.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is shocking news: Of the three dozen shows
introduced in the fall of 1997, only four (``Ally McBeal,''
``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' ``Working,'' and ``Veronica's Closet'') were
renewed this year; ``Veronica's Closet'' because of its golden
Thursday-night slot and ``Working'' as NBC's token effort to
nurture an NBC-owned potential hit. We've learned not to expect
miracles in the fall harvest.
</P>
<P>
   But adding insult to injury this season has been the returning
shows, which far outnumber the new. They should be the old friends
we can rely on, especially when the freshmen are an uninspired lot.
``Frasier,'' for instance, seems to have lost its great luster,
with uncomfortably familiar scripts and unmeasured performances
from Kelsey Grammer, whose character's ego is less humorously human
as he flounders without a job. Maybe the writers are folding under
the pressures of the ``Seinfeld'' slot, which serves as the
tentpole for NBC's Thursday lineup; maybe ``Frasier'' is a show
that, in its sixth year, is simply past its peak. ``Homicide,''
too, is an old dependable that's undergoing shaky times, largely
due to the departure of key actors Andre Braugher and Reed Diamond.
It's looking dangerously like ``Homicide Lite,'' trading in its
emphasis on crime and race for a more fickle tone, the sex appeal
of new cast member Michael Michele, and its detectives' personal
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' returns on the heels of a mediocre, unrevealing
movie and with an increasingly tiresome enthusiasm for teasing
viewers with red herrings. While the imminent departure of Jimmy
Smits has added a curiosity factor to ``NYPD Blue'' in recent
weeks, it's nonetheless a drama suffering from buddy sentimentality
and cliched crimes. ``ER'' began the season with plot lines that
were annoyingly stunted and, in the case of the new character
played by Kellie Martin, formulaic, although recent weeks have
shown some improvement. And ``Chicago Hope'' has been off its game
for a while now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spin City'' and ``Working,'' both of which looked like urban
sitcoms that needed time to flourish, haven't been able to flesh
out distinctive ensembles. ``Working,'' in particular, is having
serious identity problems. ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' which has
potential as a ``Seinfeld''-ian domestic comedy with garish family
members, is in the middle of an uneven season that's depended too
much on the theme of husbandly horniness. The once witty ``Mad
About You,'' meanwhile, is nearly unwatchable, no longer such a far
cry from bottom-of-the-barrel shows like ``Two Guys, a Girl and a
Pizza Place,'' ``Caroline in the City,'' and ``Veronica's Closet.''
And ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' has thoroughly exhausted the culture-clash
humor that distinguished it last year. Its cutesiness has gotten
tired fast.
</P>
<P>
   We're at a moment when syndicated reruns of shows like
``Frasier'' and ``Mad About You'' often seem fresher than the
prime-time originals. Of all the returning series, only a handful
remain in consistently good form: ``Friends'' stays witty despite
Ross and Rachel's endless seesawing; ``Ally McBeal'' continues to
push the envelope, if sometimes too far (i.e., the Biscuit's pet
frog); ``Just Shoot Me'' is joyously mean, sharply written, and
conceptually clever; and ``The Practice'' has quickly become TV's
most beautifully acted, tightly written, and addictive drama. It
fully deserved its Emmy win.
</P>
<P>
   The ramblings of a cranky critic still grieving the end of
``Seinfeld,'' yes? But viewers are also reacting against this TV
season, unwilling to find much happiness in the return of ``Fantasy
Island.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the new shows has the buzz that distinguished ``Dharma &AMP;
Greg'' and ``Ally McBeal'' last season, and even ``Felicity,'' the
WB series that won universal praise from critics, many of whom
called it this season's ``Ally McBeal,'' has made a disappointing
ratings show. ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' ``Sports Night,'' and ``The
Hughleys'' are the only half-hour shows to generate some
excitement, but they have scored low to moderate ratings.
``Trinity,'' the much-anticipated drama from the creator of ``ER,''
has been shelved by NBC for an indefinite period. ``Jesse'' has a
hot spot between ``Friends'' and ``Frasier,'' but it's performing
only slightly better than last season's dismal ``Union Square.'' A
number of new series, including ``The Brian Benben Show,'' ``Living
in Captivity,'' and ``Costello,'' have already disappeared without
even a blink from viewers.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the returning series are facing ratings problems.
Compared with a year ago at this time, the top-rated ``ER'' has
dropped some 18 percent, ``Touched by an Angel'' is down 14
percent, ``Home Improvement'' is down 29 percent, and ``Mad About
You'' is down over 40 percent. While ``Frasier'' is up 15 percent
from last year, thanks to its new time slot, it has lost 24 percent
of the ``Seinfeld'' audience _ particularly male viewers. In the
first five weeks of the season, NBC programming in general was down
a whopping 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's not only because the post-``Seinfeld'' season
is tepid. Cable TV is responsible for a more gradual erosion of
network viewership that is entering its third decade. A few cable
products, like A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' and Comedy Central's ``South
Park,'' are becoming part of our TV lexicon, and the recording
industry recently discovered the power of VH1's ``Behind the
Music,'' which has been causing spikes in CD sales. Because cable
series and movies have won so many Emmy nominations in the 1990s,
the National Academy of Cable Programming felt confident enough to
eliminate the CableACE awards this year, after 19 years. Also, TV
viewership is now split not just among four biggies and cable, but
smaller networks like the WB and UPN, both of which grew to five
nights of programming this year, as well as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than inspiring creativity at the major networks, of
course, viewer loss has tended to trigger fear of risk, and
pandering to the demographics that will draw advertisers. Recent
reshuffling at the networks has placed bottom-line-conscious
businessmen like Scott Sassa and Mel Karmazin in top positions at
NBC and CBS, respectively, which may mean the perpetuation of those
crummy ``Friends'' clones and cheaply produced newsmagazines. It
may mean more desperation to hold on to both a guaranteed hit like
``ER,'' for which NBC is paying $13 million an episode, and
brand-name stars like Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt, each of whom now
receives $1 million per episode of ``Mad About You.'' It may leave
less room for financial gambling on inventive new shows.
</P>
<P>
   Network fluster will also mean more pushy ad campaigns like
NBC's ``Must-See TV.'' The more we reject network TV, the more ABC
will force its ``We Love TV'' notion upon us, reaching its long arm
through supermarkets and onto bananas and into fruit bowls across
the country. But the reality may be that, while we once did love
network TV unconditionally, the romance is slowly but surely going
on the blink.

FRANK STELLA IN A TRICKY PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDOVER, Mass. _ It isn't the first art car by Frank Stella.
That distinction goes to a BMW he jazzed up in 1976 at the auto
maker's behest. The other day he went down-market, spray-painting a
vintage Dodge Dynasty parked behind the Addison Gallery of American
Art at Phillips Academy, where Stella went to school. (He's class
of '54.)
</P>
<P>
   Kids from classes still to graduate painted alongside him. Like
so many graffiti artists, these privileged teenagers at one of
America's most elite private schools swirled colors over the
surface of the car that had started out a drab gray. The
redecorated Dodge was a surprise for another teenager, a faculty
member's 16-year-old daughter, who hadn't been happy about
inheriting the sedate four-door sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The colors were beginning to merge into mud by the time Stella
picked up a can and sprayed a skein of red onto the car. The red
sang out; Stella had salvaged the situation. Along came a girl
armed with a can of white, which she used to obliterate Stella's
red. The white killed the work; you could see its death throes.
Back came Stella, spraying on a tangle of black, determined to have
the last word. Or color. Which he did.
</P>
<P>
   The spray-paint episode, part of Stella's recent residency at
Andover, illustrates two things about the 62-year-old Malden-born
painter, who ranks among America's most famous living artists. One
is that ``Frank loves winning,'' as dealer Lawrence Rubin told
Stella biographer Sidney Guberman. ``He doesn't play for the fun of
playing. He plays to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is that Stella's mighty abstractions with the
roller-coaster curves may look impromptu, even random, but they're
not. They're the product of an exquisitely tuned sensibility _ the
same sensibility that knew when the car needed red.
</P>
<P>
   A fine selection of Stella's major prints is currently on view
in the Addison galleries that the artist haunted in his youth.
``Frank Stella at Tyler Graphics'' traces a 30-year collaboration
between the artist and master printer Kenneth Tyler, which resulted
in prints of the scale, complexity, and intensity of Stella's
paintings. A serendipitously selected companion show, ``Hans
Hofmann: Continuing the Search for the Real,'' focuses on one of
Stella's all-time favorites. That show includes one Hofmann on loan
from Stella's own private collection, and another that once hung in
the home of Patrick and Maud Morgan, where Stella used to hang out,
too. Patrick Morgan, painter and teacher, was Stella's mentor at
Andover.
</P>
<P>
   During his Andover residency, Stella himself turned teacher,
leading groups of students through the galleries, stopping in the
permanent collection and Hofmann shows more often than in his own.
Surrounded by Addison's treasures, he can't resist reminding the
students how lucky they are. ``This is real,'' he says. ``It's not
a slide or a book. It's here for you. We should force you to go
down to Washington to stand in line to see the Van Gogh show, and
you'd see how blessed you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andover is a tricky place,'' he continues, ``tricky'' being
one of his favorite words. ``Art is just part of the whole here. If
you say `Homer,' maybe it's Winslow, maybe it's the poet. Art at
Andover is just one way of making beauty. Science is also
beautiful. Elegant ideas are beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of Hofmann's 1962 ``Magnum Opus,'' a large
canvas with blue and yellow rectangles blazing against a background
splattered in brilliant red, Stella tells the students, ``This is
as good as it gets in painting.'' Hofmann's color has a force both
cosmic and personal. He's so famous as a pedagogue (though the
Morgans were among his many students) that his own achievement as a
painter is sometimes downplayed. But not at the Addison. Exactly
half a century ago, the gallery organized the first major museum
exhibition of Hofmann's work. At that same moment, Stella says,
``the Museum of Fine Arts was committed to the Boston School of
Mediocrity,'' Expressionist painting for which Stella has no use.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't a natural for Andover. But his parents,
first-generation Sicilian-Americans, wanted the best for him, and
so to Andover he went, a tough, scruffy, decidedly non-prep-school
type who was also accident-prone. He lost part of his left thumb
and index finger in one childhood accident, and his four front
teeth in another. The teeth are still missing in photos of him as a
young artist in New York. He's since acquired convincing stand-ins
but still speaks with a lisp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew how to paint before I got here,'' he says of his
Andover experience. ``My mother went to art school. And my father
made me paint the house.'' He once said his goal was to make paint
``look as good as it was in the can''; the works in his 1960
``Benjamin Moore'' series were all made with that brand of house
paint, which produced a slick, bouncy surface and eliminated
pictorial depth.
</P>
<P>
   He's been faithful to abstraction for most of his career. But
the audition for admission to Morgan's class consisted of painting
a still life. Stella's view of potted ivy, defined by wiry black
line and blotches of color, looks itching to move beyond observable
reality, into another realm.
</P>
<P>
   Stella bypassed Boston. ``I've never been a favorite son of the
Boston area,'' he says. He recalls the MFA's selling off a major
work of his; a museum spokesperson says the MFA has never owned
one. The point isn't which side is right. It's that a major
American artist feels his hometown hasn't supported him
sufficiently. He also recalls that Boston's Federal Reserve Bank
covered a big work of his with a temporary wall, and on it hung
small paintings ``by my mother and her Rockport friends'' (he also
adds that his mother, Constance Stella, who lives in Ipswich, has
sold more paintings this year than he has). He's had a happier
experience with MIT, which is home to two major Stellas. His 1988
``Heads or Tails,'' an acrylic and enamel on aluminum work with
aquatic references, is in the entrance to the Tang Center of the
Sloan School of Management. His 1994 ``Loohooloo'' fills all four
walls of a specially designed conference room in the Department of
Architecture. Ninety-seven feet long and projecting up to 46 inches
away from the wall, it is a complete environment that Stella
compares with the one Monet created with his huge water-lily murals
in the Orangerie in Paris.

 ANDOVER, Mass.: ... in Paris.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right after his 1958 graduation from Princeton, Stella moved to
New York, where he's been based ever since. ``It's not a restful
place,'' he says. ``But I don't know how to function anywhere else.
I don't want to live on some farm in Vermont.''
</P>
<P>
   The city dweller who didn't have a car until he was past 40
became a fan of racing _ both cars and horses. In 1983, he was
arrested in upstate New York after police clocked his Ferrari at
106 miles an hour. He plea-bargained his way out of a jail sentence
by reprising the Charles Eliot Norton lectures he'd just given at
Harvard in the gym of the local high school this time.
</P>
<P>
   His painting is also a wild ride. And his career has accelerated
to keep pace with it. A year and a half after graduating from
college, his black stripe paintings were included in ``Sixteen
Americans'' at the Museum of Modern Art, which has also given him
two major restrospectives. The black paintings were controversial.
Stella recalls that the Associated Press wanted to put a ``hoax of
modern art'' story about them on the wire, but MOMA's press office
refused to supply AP with a photo, so the story was canned. ``I
would have been instantly famous, internationally,'' Stella says.
``The press person made that decision at my expense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the black paintings,'' he says, ``my father said to me,
`There's no hope. Color is what sells.''' Nonetheless, MOMA bought
one of those controversial works: Stella's dealer, Leo Castelli,
had to reduce the price from $1,200 to $900, because the money came
from a discretionary fund that put a $1,000 ceiling on purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dim view of his early work held by his father and
the MOMA press office, Stella was almost an instant success. And
he's stayed one, reinventing himself whenever necessary. He's gone
from somber, stripe-filled rectangles to ``shaped'' canvases, then
to cacophonous reliefs that seemed to want to jump off the wall,
then to huge, spinning, free-standing works that did.
</P>
<P>
   He's a voracious looker. ``I go to museums, and inevitably
something catches my eye and I'm hooked for the rest of the day,''
he says. ``It's like with women. Some just catch your attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Stellas _ the 1995 ``Severinda'' and the 1958 ``East
Broadway'' _ bracket the Addison's grand second-floor galleries.
``East Broadway,'' soft, irregular horizontal stripes of black and
gold interrupted by a dark, calm green vertical, hangs between two
landscapes with an obvious formal link to it, in the form of strong
stripe elements. One is by Man Ray, the other by Marguerite
Thompson Zorach, whom you wouldn't have wanted to be on this
occasion. ``This is a really bad painting,'' Stella says, ``but
it's an interesting one. It must have been a piggyback gift. I
wonder what else they gave.'' His own gift of Adolph Gottlieb's
1953 ``Rectangle Landscape'' hangs nearby: Stella has enriched his
alma mater's collections considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had 360-degree vision,'' he says, pirouetting to take
in the whole gallery. ``I'm always wanting to expand my vision.''
With ``Severinda,'' he did. A giant, free-standing tidal wave of a
work, it looks ready to engulf you. Your vision surfs along the
surfaces, which contain a world's worth of imagery in the low
relief of a jigsaw puzzle. Parts of it are gritty, like cement,
while others resemble gooey frosting. If you started at one end and
described every color and shape on the piece, you'd have an epic
the length of ``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moby Dick'' is the title of one of the series in the Addison
show, excerpted from an even larger series of 135 prints,
paintings, and sculptures, each named for one of the 135 chapters
in Melville's saga. When Stella started out as an artist, he
stubbornly insisted that his works referred to nothing save
themselves; by the early '90s, he was making works with direct
allusions to the waves, fins, ropes, and ships in ``Moby-Dick'' and
calling Melville ``a chatterbox, a kind of walking repository of
everyday ideas.'' Substitute ``images'' for ``ideas'' and you could
say the same for Stella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adaptability is a good thing,'' he says. ``I have an organic
view of art.'' So he cannibalizes earlier works to make the
collages that are the basis for the prints. He incorporates
oddities like lace patterns, taken from etched magnesium plates
used in making plastic lace tablecloths. Is this converting bad
taste into good art? Not to Stella. ``I find plastic tablecloths
kind of beautiful,'' he says. ``We use them now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Stella leads a group of students into the Addison's largest
gallery. At one end hangs Thomas Eakins's 1897 portrait of
``Professor Henry A. Rowland,'' physics professor and former
Phillips Academy student. At the other end is Abbott Henderson
Thayer's 1920-21 ``Monadnock Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   As Stella compares the two, the students' heads turn from side
to side as if they were watching a match at Wimbledon. Looking at
Thayer's painting of a Renaissance angel in front of New Hampshire
scenery, he says, ``This painting is 10 times better than it should
be, an academic version of a Marsden Hartley. It's very well
painted by a guy I'd call an academic hack. You can predict this
guy is going nowhere, yet this is a pretty good painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Eakins's subject was the physicist who revolutionized the
science of spectroscopy. The artist painted Rowland holding a
diffraction grating of the spectrum, a small rainbow that brightens
a picture that's otherwise brown and browner.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two paintings illustrate ideas about the elite in
America,'' Stella says, adding, ``This is an elite institution. The
undercurrent here is performance. You're brought here to perform.''
Rowland, Stella says, represents one ideal of what Phillips Academy
grads are supposed to be _ extremely successful in a suitable
profession, one that calls for attire like the dark brown
three-piece suit Rowland wears. Standing in the middle of the
gallery, wearing clothing Goodwill would reject, Stella seems happy
to have eluded that scenario. He skipped the brown-suit bit,
plucked the rainbow out of the painting instead, and ran with it.

   Hunting, of course, is not something that everyone can
comprehend, let alone stomach. Gasparini knows this, and he
understands that most nonhunters can't overlook the central paradox
of the sportsman's life _ that people who love wildlife go out of
their way to kill it. Still, he does not want to offend, which is
why he is careful to use words like ``harvest,'' which is less
stark than ``kill,'' or ``quarry,'' which is less evocative than
``deer.'' He emphasizes that he hunts only to fill up his freezer:
His family eats no beef, only venison. And when the freezer is
full, he hunts only with a camera.
</P>
<P>
   And he hunts only with those who share his focus ``in terms of
being ethical hunters and sportsmen ... someone with the same level
of respect for nature and animals,'' Gasparini says. He would
never, for example, go hunting with someone who'd take a wild shot
at an animal and potentially wound it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take a life is not macho,'' he says. ``This is not done
lightly. It is an intense moment of sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   He will not permit a reporter to sit anywhere near him in the
woods of Sharon, where he went on a recent hunting trip. Killing an
animal, he says, ``is too personal to share.''  &UR;  &LR; But he will share
his vast store of hunting knowledge, gleaned from years of
exploring the woods with his father, his wife, and his three
children, now aged 15, 12, 10. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's probably fair to say that when average people take a walk
in the woods, they, well, (itals)walk in the woods.(unitals)  &UR;  &LR; They
might notice the pretty leaves, or some wild mushrooms, or enjoy
the stillness. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But when Gasparini takes a walk through the woods, he
(itals)intuits(unitals) the woods. During hunting season, he lives
in two time zones _ regular time and forest time, when his world
slows down and the forest comes alive. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He has cultivated an instinct about forest life so acute he
can distinguish between the sound a squirrel makes when it moves
and the sound of a chipmunk. (Squirrels take two or three jumps at
a time. Chipmunks scurry until they get where they are going.)
</P>
<P>
   He can tell when a buck has been close by its ``antler rubs'' on
the tree bark _ the scrapes bucks make to mark out their territory.
He can tell when a doe has been around by reading the impressions
of its pointed hooves in the leaves. (Buck tracks are larger and
more splayed.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Do you smell that?'' he says suddenly to his
woods-illiterate companion. ``It's a musk odor,'' he says
authoritatively. ``It's what a buck secretes.'' It's all
hard-earned knowlege, of course, accumulated after years of sitting
motionless on logs or leaves, or in trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say to me, how can you sit still for three hours? There
is plenty to keep you stimulated. The forest is alive! You hear all
the ground animals, leaves rustle, and chipmunks and squirrels. You
see the birds land on branches.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunting, he says, ``is a release, an escape for me. I go full
blast all day. Between the family and my job, it never stops.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the woods, ``there is no fax, no beeper, no telephone. No
one, except someone I'm hunting with. I'll sit there until (I'm)
one with the forest. I've had birds land on my gun barrel, on my
legs. I've had squirrels on my knee. I've had deer come brush by
me. I had a small doe (itals)step over my leg once(unitals). She
never knew I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   And the waiting is well worth it. `If there is one secret to
hunting success,'' Gasparini says, ``it's that you've got to put in
your time, before the season starts.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  As he begins his hunting trip in Connecticut, he has already
put in his time. With his group _ any combination of his father,
brother-in-law, two hunting buddies, and his 15-year-old son _ he
has staked out the area, located on an acquaintance's property in
Litchfield County. He has already ``read the woods'' for signs of
deer and built his tree stands in those spots he has deemed
``hot.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There is every reason to see a deer this evening, he says. We've
done it all. We've put in our time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Up he goes, into the tree stand, hoisting himself up 12 metal
tree-climbing pegs, positioning himself on his camouflage-colored
cushion. He rests his camouflaged bow with its attached camouflaged
arrows across his lap. For the next three hours Bob Gasparini sits,
alert as a buck himself. He waits for something to happen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing does, unless you count the squirrel that scampered by,
three quick steps. But he's not discouraged. There's still tomorrow
morning.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m., Gasparini is in his truck, driving to the woods where
he quickly jumps out and dons his Scent-Lok suit. He is rushing, a
little anxious that he won't be in the tree for morning crunch time
_ 30 to 45 minutes after dawn. He hasn't eaten breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he climbs into a different tree stand he set up maybe
a quarter-mile from the last one. He's feeling lucky, pretty sure
that he'll see deer this morning, and that Friday was just bad
luck. ``If we don't see one today, it's not because we didn't
try,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And he tries. He sits in his stand for three hours, through a
light drizzle and a chill that necessitates camo gloves. Nothing
happens. (In fact, nothing will happen for the next few hunting
trips: It will be 10 outings in the woods before Gasparini finally
takes a deer.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But later that morning, at breakfast, Gasparini is reliving the
whole experience. He factors in the wind velocity, the noise level,
the location of coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason,'' he says, perplexed. ``We should have
seen one. Everything was right. The wind. Our scent. Where are the
deer? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He allows that he's a ``little disappointed'' he didn't
(itals)see(unitals) any deer. But not very, he emphasizes, adding
his often repeated maxim: ``If you get a deer it's the icing on the
cake. You really have to believe that.''

THE SEASON OF SUPERFLUITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes resources internet addresses)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It starts with Thanksgiving, the quintessential American holiday
that is one part history, one part football, and two parts
consumption. And it ends with the chill of January.
</P>
<P>
   The intervening five weeks are that time of year when we eat
more (70 million Americans will gain weight), drink more (liquor
sales soar in December), buy more (retail sales jump 25 percent),
and throw away more (another 1 million tons a week) than any other
time during the year.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst all this conspicuous consumption is a small but growing
movement to simplify the holiday season, to turn away from the
glare of advertisements and toward family, friends, self, and
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   The movement begins this year's fight against excess on
Thursday, the fourth annual Use Less Stuff Day, and continues with
Buy Nothing Day on Nov. 27, the Friday after Thanksgiving _ once
the traditional start to the holiday shopping season and still
usually the busiest day of the year for retailers. Also at work are
groups like the Center for a New American Dream, which launched a
campaign to simplify the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Use Less Stuff Day is the brainchild of Robert Lilienfeld, a
former marketing executive for Procter &AMP; Gamble, and William
Rathje, an anthropologist at the University of Arizona. They came
up with the idea in 1994, as they surveyed the holiday detritus on
the day after Christmas and thought the season must be a time of
incredible waste.
</P>
<P>
   Lilienfeld and Rathje say they are not trying to kill the
holiday spirit, just help people pare back to a more appropriate
level of consumption. ``The idea with Use Less Stuff Day is to fit
into people's lives as much as possible,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Americans' wastefulness is prodigious. Consider EPA
figures that show in 1996 we threw out 21 million tons of edible
food and 1.8 million tons of wrapping paper, much of it
gift-wrapping paper.
</P>
<P>
   What we consume is astounding in relation to the rest of the
world. The top 20 percent of the world's richest nations accounts
for 86 percent of total consumption of resources, including 45
percent of the world's meat and fish, according to figures from the
United Nations. The United States ranks fourth in the world's
caloric intake yet 30 million Americans are hungry. Americans spend
$8 billion annually on cosmetics and it is estimated that it would
cost $6 billion to provide basic education for the world's
population.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is more to using less stuff than righting an
international imbalance, or even helping our own environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strongest thread in the simplicity and frugality movement
is taking back our lives from the commercial culture,'' says Vicki
Robin, co-author of ``Your Money or Your Life,'' a bible for the
voluntary simplicity movement. ``The latest gadget is no longer the
great prize; the prize is having time. Time is the new luxury item.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole movement reflects a backlash against too-muchness
at every level. Use Less Stuff Day, Buy Nothing Day are initiatives
that reflect the desire to shift gears. Are they going to ruin the
Christmas season or be anything more than the most minuscule gasp?
Nah, they are not going to make a difference. But will they draw
attention to a problem that exists but people don't talk about?
Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   And even Pam Rucker, a spokeswoman for the American Retail
Federation, says, ``I don't think retailers would take exception to
consumers examining what they have and spending wisely. Retailers
don't want people to spend beyond their means.''
</P>
<P>
   But still we do. Some call it ``affluenza,'' the compulsion to
have the latest, even if it costs too much, which leads to more
work, more stress, and less free time. According to the Center for
a New American Dream in Takoma Park, Md., it takes, on average, six
months to pay off credit card bills racked up during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our holiday campaign is designed to try to show people you can
shift consumption,'' says the center's Eric Brown. ``Don't you
think your grandmother might like photographs of you more than a
Whitman Sampler?''
</P>
<P>
   But in a nation where excess is normal, and new is better,
everything is magnified during the holidays. Whether influenced by
commercialism, or touched by a spirit of generosity or the festive
impulse, budgets are frequently blown as the champagne becomes
vintage French instead of domestic, and the tickets to ``The
Nutcracker'' are orchestra instead of balcony. 'Tis the season to
spend, spend, spend.
</P>
<P>
   By reducing what we buy, we of course might also reduce what we
throw away or, for that matter, recycle.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us may get a feeling of smug satisfaction as we fill the
recycling bin to the brim. But that is logic worthy of those folks
who happily drive emissions-spewing trucks and sport utility
vehicles and think it's OK because they have a ``Preserve the
Trust'' environmental license plate.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentally speaking, the best thing is to reduce not only
the amount thrown away, but also the amount recycled. ``Cloth
diapers versus disposable diapers and paper bags versus plastic
bags, those are really symbolic,'' says Lilienfeld. ``What is much
more worrisome is what goes into the bags, the number of cans,
bottles, and boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Simplicity gurus say it is precisely during our frenzied holiday
season that one can make an effort to engage in personal
downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the holidays as a microcosm of the rest of your
life, you are overcommitted timewise, you might go into debt, and
you cruise through the season on autopilot,'' says Janet Luhrs,
author of the ``Simple Living Guide'' and founder and publisher of
Simple Living Journal. ``Call a family gathering early in the
season and talk about what the holidays mean to all of you. You may
find that everyone goes along with the buying frenzy (only) because
they are not sure what else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there is demand for simplicity, and it is turning the
movement into more than a cottage industry. Books and newsletters
crowd the marketplace. In September, a conference on simplicity at
the University of Southern California drew more than 1,000 people
and others were turned away at the gates, says Carol Holst, program
director of Seeds of Simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voluntary simplicity is out of the woods and is not some
quaint fringe idea,'' says Holst, adding that support groups known
as simplicity circles are popping up around the country.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a subversive element to all of this, it may be Buy
Nothing Day. The seventh annual attempt to curb rampant consumerism
will include people doing street theater, singing carols such as
``Uh oh, we're in the red, dear,'' to the tune of ``Rudolph the
Red-nosed Reindeer'' and passing out ``gift exemption
certificates'' in shopping centers and malls, says Jonathan
Priddle, a Buy Nothing campaign manager in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   For Lilienfeld, however, Buy Nothing Day and the voluntary
simplicity movement folks ``are the vegetarians of this movement.
We can't all move back to the land, we won't all buy nothing, and
we can't all be vegetarians. Ideally, five years from now, the
president would proclaim Use Less Stuff an official day. But if
this results in people taking a minute to think about ways they can
save resources, it will be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Want to simplify your life during the holidays?
</P>
<P>
   Simplicity guru Janet Luhrs has serval suggestions including:
Call a family meeting and create an ``umbrella of values''; set a
holiday budget; keep it simple _ your home does not have to look
like it is ready for a magazine shoot to be festive; create easy
rituals like storytelling or walking in the park; add purpose to
the holidays by replacing glitz with volunteering.
</P>
<P>
   Use Less Stuff offers ``42 ways to trim your holiday wasteline''
including things as simple as buying film rolls with 36 exposuires
instead of 12 or 24; canceling 10 mail order catelogues will reduce
trash by more than three pounds a year; use Sunday comics, or color
brown paper bags as wrapping paper.
</P>
<P>
   Use Less Stuff's Robert Lilienfeld says redcing the number of
greeting cards mailed or _ or substituting paper with e-mail _ is a
good way to reduce waste. ``If you sent a card out to someone for
the last five years and you have not heard back from them, they
either moved or they just don't like you,'' he says. ``We are
looking at excess, which is very hard to define. But if you stop
sending 10 cards, at 50 cents a card, that will save you $8.20 and
you save 10 minutes time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for a New American Dream has a Simplify the Holidays
brouchure that offers suggestions on how to make the holidays less
stressful and more meaningful.

IN LOS ANGELES, POLICIES BACK UP A PLEDGE FOR JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Detective Joan McNamara took over the Los
Angeles Police Department's special unit to investigate and
prosecute its own officers for domestic violence, she was warned it
wouldn't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told there would be a lot of resistance,'' McNamara
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly were problems. A 1997 study by the department's
inspector general found that internal investigations of officers
accused of beating their romantic partners were ``flawed or
skewed'' and ``lacked objectivity.''
</P>
<P>
   When allegations were sustained, the tendency was to ``go easy''
and punishment was ``exceedingly light,'' the report said. It
concluded that 75 percent of sustained cases were not even
mentioned in performance evaluations, and officers with proven
cases against them were promoted.
</P>
<P>
   It took the O.J. Simpson trial, lawsuits alleging that the
police department didn't protect its own female officers, a new law
requiring police with domestic violence convictions to give up
their guns, and a barrage of bad publicity to convince the
department it had to change.
</P>
<P>
   Police executives say Los Angeles now is one of a handful of
police departments around the nation that have pledged to bring its
officers to justice, and backed the pledge with specific policies
on handling abusive officers.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide study of 100 police agencies conducted between
1993 and 1996, John Feltgen, the police chief in Broward County,
Fla., concluded that although there were abusers in all
departments, including his own, most police agencies ``deny
incidents of domestic violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Feltgen reviewed 911 tapes and found that calls for help from
victims living with police officers ``fell on deaf ears.'' He said
police officers ``always looked the other way when called to a
domestic violence incident involving another officer'' or reported
it as an unfounded disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is one of those few departments with a clear policy that
requires all incidents to be written up and investigated by a
supervising officer, among other measures. But unlike Los Angeles,
Boston does not have a unit dedicated to the problem. And in the
past two years, 23 domestic violence complaints have been filed
against Boston police employees, and none have been prosecuted in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often we lose cases because the victims don't want to testify,
but that doesn't mean we won't go after the officer
administratively,'' said Boston police Superintendent James Hussey.
</P>
<P>
   The International Association of Chiefs of Police is developing
a model policy on handling domestic violence, but change is
difficult to mandate, said Margaret Patten, a colonel in the
Baltimore Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long process, changing a culture,'' said Patten.
``Officers, if they caught someone robbing or stealing, would call
that person rotten. But somehow they didn't mind having a person in
their command who beats up someone they love.''
</P>
<P>
   If these people aren't flushed out of police departments, Patten
said, calls for help from women in the general community will be
met by a compromised, even hostile, response from police.
</P>
<P>
   That includes calls from women like Teresa Macias, a Santa Rosa,
Calif., mother of three who begged her local sheriff's department
to enforce the restraining order forbidding her husband, Avelino,
from contacting her.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months of her life, she filed 18 documented
reports to police showing Avelino Macias was harassing her,
stalking her, and threatening to kill her, but he was never
arrested. On April 15, 1996, Avelino Macias shot his wife in the
head with a .357 Magnum and then killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   According to her diaries, she could not understand why the
deputy who frequently responded to her calls refused to help. The
deputy had filed incomplete reports and refused to arrest Avelino,
as required by law, according to 911 recordings and internal
documents from the Santa Rosa district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out two domestic-violence restraining orders had been
filed against the deputy _ from his ex-wife and from his
ex-girlfriend.

CONFRONTING ABUSE WHEN THE BATTERER IS BEHIND A BADGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cathy felt trapped. She says it wasn't just that
she faced a husband who pulled out his gun, tried to force her to
kill him, and shot a live round only feet from their 2-year-old
child. Or that she had to fend off his attempts to beat and rape
her after the phone cord had been pulled from the wall and the car
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   It was that Cathy's husband was a policeman.
</P>
<P>
   That meant she was suspended in a kind of lawless universe _
where the broke and battered woman was too afraid to fight a man
whose tools of terror included a sophisticated computer to track
her movements, a tight network of friends at the Los Angeles Police
Department, and a gun issued to him as a peace officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all by myself, all by myself in a corner, terrified,''
recalled Cathy, whose last name has been omitted from this report
because of concerns about her safety but whose identity has been
verified by the Globe. ``I can't quite describe the absolute fear I
had of him, of the department, of losing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Cathy's story, which her now-former husband denies,
underscores a far more complex and potentially lethal aspect of
domestic violence that has until recently been a closely guarded
secret: batterers who not only wear badges, but sometimes are
protected by their own.
</P>
<P>
   It is a messy, complicated problem that the law enforcement
community is just beginning to confront. In fact, the FBI held the
first three-day conference of its kind in September, focusing on
the particular dynamics of rooting out and addressing domestic
violence when it involves police officers, as well as the acute
vulnerability of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people supposed to be enforcing the law violating the
law, and we can't tolerate it,'' said Donald Sheean, an FBI
behavioral scientist who organized the conference. ``We don't know
the exact scope of the problem, but there are strong indications
domestic violence is more prevalent among police officers, and we
need to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no hard numbers, studies indicate that
domestic violence may be more widespread in police families than in
the general population. Whatever the actual level, the problem is
especially vexing because police are the first line of defense for
the estimated 2 million women who, according to the Justice
Department, are stalked, beaten, and sometimes killed by their
intimates every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If officers are prone to violence in their own homes, women in
the larger community can't have much of a hope of getting a good
response to domestic violence,'' said Penny Harrington, director of
the National Center for Women and Policing in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1987 study, Leanore Boulin Johnson, a sociologist at the
University of Arizona, surveyed 728 officers, asking the question:
Have you been out of control and behaved violently toward your
spouse? Forty-two percent said yes. Another study published in 1992
by the academic journal Police Studies came to a similar
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan says these studies are not conclusive and that most
officers are not abusers. But he calls the studies a red flag that
indicates a serious problem is not being adequately addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Recent investigations have shown that police officers involved
in domestic violence are treated more leniently than civilians. A
1997 report by the inspector general for the Los Angeles police
showed that violent behavior toward intimates has not prevented
officers from keeping their jobs _ or even from being promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy, who says her husband began abusing her after she became a
rookie officer with the Los Angeles police and then asked him for a
divorce, believes she was victimized twice _ first by her husband,
and then by the police department she says protected him.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Cathy covered up the abuse. After some counseling, she
decided to report the violations, but the department, she says,
pressured her to drop her complaints and denied her requests for
protection. Police records show the department charged Cathy with
misconduct for lying and later, when she called 911 for help,
suspended her for being ``unnecessarily involved in a domestic
dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got so tired of being bashed, I just wanted to crawl into a
hole,'' Cathy said. The police department ``kept saying I was
causing marital problems, that I was the bad guy, and my husband
the victim. Meanwhile, I was being beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy's former husband denies that he ever physically or
sexually abused her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the best husband I could be to her for years, and she
left me,'' he said. ``She's ruined my life, and my career. ... It's
ridiculous what she's alleging.''
</P>
<P>
   He maintains that Cathy is lying for profit, because she is part
of a pending class-action lawsuit against the department alleging
that it failed to protect female officers from violence.
</P>
<P>
   But in late 1992, his superiors sent a letter to the police
chief acknowledging his violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not withstanding the long running nature of his misconduct, it
was all centered around the breakup of his 12-year marriage and no
other issues were involved,'' the letter stated. ``There is no
doubt that during the over two-year period these acts were
occurring he displayed some deplorable behavior involving violence
... and the use of a firearm.''
</P>
<P>
   After a period of suspension and psychological counseling, they
wrote, Cathy's ex-husband was no longer a danger to himself or to
anyone else and should be rehired. Their request was granted, and
today, he works as a police officer in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles police refused to comment on Cathy's case
because of the pending lawsuit by female officers alleging a
pattern of abuse, discrimination, and denial of basic protection
granted to ordinary citizens. But the department says cases like
Cathy's are a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Academics, police psychologists, and prominent law enforcement
officials believe high-stress indicators among police _ excessive
drinking, high divorce and suicide rates, post-traumatic stress
disorder _ can put someone who is already at risk over the edge.
Police, said the FBI's Sheean, still are not properly trained to
deal with exposure to repetitive violence.
</P>
<P>
   Officers also may experience ``authoritarian spillover,''
bringing home a street mindset that calls for them to be
``hypervigilant'' of danger, in control, and sometimes even
violent, said Ellen Kirschman, a Palo Alto, Calif., police
psychologist. Officers who permanently adopt this mindset are more
likely to be emotionally withdrawn and to ``objectify'' people,
including their spouse, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Wetendorf specializes in counseling victims of police
domestic violence in Duluth, Minn. At a conference last spring
sponsored by the National Center for Women and Policing, she said,
``Women tell us their abusers scream at them like they talk to
criminals on the street _ their voices and faces change. Some women
describe having the fear that the abuser has lost touch with
reality, that he has forgotten who she is in his rage.''
</P>
<P>
   She also explained why victims of police violence are more
vulnerable: The officer has a gun, knows the secret locations of
women's shelters, and understands how to work the court system.
</P>
<P>
   Others have observed that officers are trained to use their
presence to command power, their body as a weapon, and their voice
to intimidate _ training that can kick in during a family argument.
</P>
<P>
   Anne O'Dell, a former San Diego police sergeant who instructs
police around the world on domestic violence, takes Wetendorf's
observation one step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cops are the most manipulative, most sophisticated batterers
I've ever seen,'' she said. ``They know how to inflict injuries
without leaving marks, how to struggle without causing permanent
injury, how to paint their wife as crazy, volatile, bitchy, and
aggressive even before the first incident is reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Some law enforcement officials, however, take issue with the
idea that police officers are more susceptible to domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement officers are reflective of the wage-earning
population,'' said Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal
Order of Police. ``I reject that they have a hard time turning off
what they do at work if the assumption is that they are out hitting
people all day. If stress is a precipitating factor, there are lots
of high-stress jobs out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The misperception that domestic violence is more common among
police comes from departments that hire the wrong people, Pasco
says. Most officers, he says, perform heroically and anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Margot Hill, a spokeswoman for the Boston Police
Department, also rejects the idea that domestic violence occurs at
a higher rate among officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has less to do with the environment you work in than what
you lived in as a child,'' she said. ``It is a cyclical,
generational crime, and it is so difficult to change that cycle.''

CLINTON SHOWS HIS TRUE GRIT UNTIL HIGH NOON FOR NEWT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If an old-fashioned movie, complete with hero and villain, were
ever to be made about the recent events involving President
Clinton, once and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and the
electorate, it would probably go something like this:
</P>
<P>
   As the plot unfolds, Clinton, the chosen leader of his people,
is accused of an illicit sexual relationship with a young woman. In
charges the Gingrich gang, armed to the teeth with explosives and
ammunition supplied by a hired partisan named Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, sensing Clinton is wounded, prepares to triumph over
his adversary. He boasts that the people in the land will cheer
him, praise him, even adore him for hanging the scoundrel Clinton
out to dry in public, for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   He even predicts the people will proclaim him the new king.
</P>
<P>
   But wait! Just as Gingrich and his gang are preparing to string
Clinton up, the wise citizenry rises up. They are shouting, not at
Clinton but at Gingrich. They have determined that, while Clinton
may have committed an indiscreet act and lied about it, he also has
performed many good deeds for the people. And they are wise to
Gingrich's attempt to make himself the ruler of the land _ even
after they had warned him not to harm the chosen ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that all is lost, and rather than suffer the same fate
of public humiliation he had intended for his chief adversary,
Gingrich quickly abdicates his own seat of power, and exits stage
right.
</P>
<P>
   As the curtain falls, viewers are left to ponder the fate of a
man who failed to heed, if not hear, the people's warnings that
preceded his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was in life.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why Gingrich was so surprised, if not stunned,
when he awoke the morning after the election to find the people
stood not behind him, but behind Clinton. By then, it was just a
matter of time before Gingrich's conservative cohorts began to
revolt against him.
</P>
<P>
   In the real-life script, the self-described hero became the
villain, the alleged perpetrator became the flawed hero victimized
by the relentless pursuit of a power-hungry horde, and the
electorate became the rescuers of their chosen leader.
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, the script is still being written and the roles
are still evolving. After what happened to Gingrich, and to other
GOP members who lost their seat of power by joining with him, the
Republican majority in the House is now more apt to take the
message of voters seriously. There will be no impeachment of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gingrich, the final chapter in his political life may lie
beyond his decision to give up the speakership as well as his
congressional seat. A final irony to his career could come in the
special election scheduled to fill his Georgia congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   There is a possibility, for example, that the 6th District seat
Gingrich held for some 20 years could be filled by _ of all people
_ a Democrat. No doubt that grim thought crossed his mind, which is
perhaps why he endorsed Johnny Isakson as his replacement even
before he submitted his letter of resignation to the governor, who
calls special elections.
</P>
<P>
   After Gingrich's endorsement, Isakson, a former state
representative and currently chairman of the state Board of
Education, announced his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But if three or four other GOP hopefuls get into the race, it
could result in a Democrat such as Michael Coles slipping by them
to win _ an acute embarrassment to Gingrich as well as to the
entire party.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gingrich's endorsement of Isakson, one hopeful has dropped
out, but several other Republicans are still pondering a bid.
Coles, meanwhile, is seriously considering getting into the race.
He ran against Gingrich in 1996, losing by a 58-42 margin in a
district viewed as staunchly Republican.
</P>
<P>
   If the only candidates are Isakson and Coles _ and no other
Republicans come in to split the GOP vote _ Isakson will be seen as
the clear favorite to succeed Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gingrich, he can't afford to suffer any further
humiliation after the electorate's resounding rejection of his
election strategy. The ballot count turned his prediction of a gain
of up to 30 more congressional seats for the GOP into a gain of
five more seats for the Democrats _ thus crushing any hope of
impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And things could get worse. Having his seat won by a Democrat
would be the final humiliation, a tragic ending for a man who
forgot that rulers must rule with the consent of their people _ or
suffer the consequences.
</P>

BOOK OFFERS PROVOCATIVE INSIGHT ON RELATIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Andrew Sullivan's new book, ``Love Undetectable:
Notes on Friendship, Sex and Survival,'' is likely to get shelved
in the gay section or some bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be a shame, because while Sullivan approaches his
topics based on his life, which is shaped in part by his
homosexuality, ``Love Undetectable'' (Knopf, 256 pages, $23) is
full of ideas so universal they are relevant to all segments of
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always a little taken aback when someone tells me, `I have
nothing against homosexuality, I just don't understand it,'''
Sullivan said in an interview as part of a national promotional
tour. ``I always tell them, `Of course you understand it, it's just
that you're straight.'
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the experiences are exactly the same, they are just
with a different gender. The search for a relationship, the
balancing of love and friendship, the effort to fit sex somewhere
in the mess of human relationships _ these are human problems, not
gay problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, the former editor of the New Republic, always manages
to stir things up, often within the gay community itself. His new
effort, a collection of three essays, is bound to do the same. But
the Oxford-educated English transplant is able to express his ideas
so eloquently that perhaps his greatest gift is bringing
controversial ideas into the mainstream for debate.
</P>
<P>
   The title of his first essay alone _ ``When Plagues End'' _ has
already kicked up a fuss. In it, he writes about the adjustment
that HIV-positive people must make in the face of new medicines
that can keep them alive for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting some heat from that, I have to admit,''
Sullivan, 35, said. ``But anyone who reads the book can tell that I
am not saying that AIDS is over. But there is no doubt that what
has happened in the past 2 1/2 years is a massive change. An
HIV-positive diagnosis is just not the same thing it used to be,
when it was an almost certain death sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan has been HIV-positive himself for five years and has
lost many friends. But for him, facing his own fears _ and watching
friends come back from near-death to lead productive lives _ is
where the power of the future lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people are so resistant to anyone saying anything about
this, that we might live, that the worst is over. I think maybe
they are scared that we will lose sympathy or funding or that
statements of this kind will encourage irresponsibility _ all of
which are legitimate fears. But on the other hand, you can only go
on denying reality for so long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other two essays in the book, ``Virtually Abnormal'' _ a
largely psychoanalytic look at the possible origins of
homosexuality, or heterosexuality for that matter _ and ``If Love
Were All'' _ which deals with the notion that friends are just as
valuable, if not more so, than lovers _ are also likely to kick up
some dust. Not that Sullivan minds.
</P>
<P>
   He freely tosses out sentences like, ``The great modern enemy of
friendship has turned out to be love,'' meaning romantic love, or
snippets like ``sex between friends is something to be avoided at
all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, extremely good-humored for someone carrying around all
that intellectual baggage, laughed when these and others were read
back to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of that comes from being HIV-positive. Life is
just too short to engage in blather. Those are ideas, I think they
are true, why not say them? Anyone can disagree, I just happen to
think those things are true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said his goal in writing ``Love Undetectable'' was ``to
ask the hard questions.'' In this he has succeeded, even with his
willingness to re-examine Freud's take on homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is another subject that generates a tremendous amount of
resistance from gays,'' he said. ``This notion of `Did our mommies
love us too much?' That probably stems from all the playground
taunts, `Momma's boy,' `Sissy,' that kind of thing. But I was
trying to go back and see if there was any truth to that, and if
there is, so what?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be so defensive about something like that suggests to me
that you're afraid of something _ that it might be true. What if it
is? Aren't you curious? It's as much about what makes someone
heterosexual as homosexual, anyway. I find that fascinating, not
threatening.''

MEMORIES OF MARMALADE AND MILDEW
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The Summer Camp exhibition at the Museum of Our National
Heritage in Lexington, Mass. is fun, but it doesn't smell like
camp. Certain aromas bring back memories of summer camp with a
rush. Pine needles. Mildew. Burnt marshmallows. And, for me at
least, marmalade. Marmalade, marmalade, and more marmalade. On
toast for breakfast, plain or with peanut butter in sandwiches at
lunch. Were they trying to save us from scurvy?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gutman, guest curator of the Summer Camp exhibit, says
that over the years remarkably little about camping has changed.
Today's camper may be sleeping in the same cabin that her mother,
or her grandmother, slept in when she was a girl. She may be
learning the same camp songs and traditions. I suppose she could
even be eating the same brand of marmalade.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer, some 4 million young people go off to summer camp,
most of them eagerly. Gutman says he's amazed that his own
daughter, Lucy, 15, leaves behind televison, telephone, computer to
live in a cabin with no electricity. Camp continues to have a
powerful appeal to young people. ``It's still a way to have a lot
of new experiences, get away from your parents, and meet new
kids,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman spent six summers at Camp Wigwam in Harrison, Maine. ``It
had an impact on me and will for my whole life, as I think camp has
for so many people,'' he said Friday as he prepared for Sunday's
opening.
</P>
<P>
   I know that the rewards of camp can be far more lasting than
learning to swim or sail. Camp taught me _ the only child of a
single parent _ how to get along with other people. And, yes, it's
true that I still have a lot to learn, but at least camp got me
started.
</P>
<P>
   Private camps proliferated in the early decades of this century,
as did summer camps subsidized by settlement houses and religious,
social, and youth agencies. On display is an 1895 YMCA summer camp
instruction list: ``Don't take straw or derby hats to camp. They
are not comfortable to sleep in ... Don't wear a `boiled' shirt and
starched collar ... Positively no fireams allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   With his wife and co-curator, Kellie, Gutman visited 40 summer
camps and corresponded with the directors of 30 more. All the camps
were in New England, where the summer camping movement started at
the end of the last century. New England still has more camps by
far than any other part of the country. The exhibition places
camping in its context, as part of social and educational movements
that stressed the importance of fresh air, physical exercise, and
spiritual development.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items on display are fraught with camp tradition,
and thus precious. One corner of the exhibit, the Waterfront, has a
restored 1923 war canoe on loan from Camp Winona for Boys in
Bridgton, Maine. The Campfire Room is dominated by a sign from camp
Kirby in Townsend, Mass. The words are spelled out in twigs: ``Here
Let the Fires of Everlasting Friendship Burn.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutman collected old film footage and photographs of camp life
and produced videotapes for the exhibit. A tape of camp songs
(``Buckle down, Winona, buckle down ...'') provides background
noise.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing I saw when I entered the exhibit was a uniform,
under glass, from my own camp, Wohelo, on Sebago Lake in Maine. The
familiar blue overall-style shorts and blue-and-white striped
T-shirt weren't as dated as a ``boiled'' shirt and starched collar,
but the outfit seemed like something out of another era, which of
course it is. Just as nostalgia-inducing was the Arts &AMP; Crafts
corner, with its choice collection of summer campiana: rough-hewn
wooden bookends, misshapen pottery ashtrays, and the like. Visitors
are invited to add to a gimp lanyard. Gimp. I never got the hang of
it. I want to go back to camp.

ROLLING OVER A 401(K) INTO AN IRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have just left a job where I had a 401(k) account with a
value of $3,500. My new employer does not offer a 401(k) program.
My father suggested I roll over the $3,500 into a mutual fund IRA.
There are so many mutual funds that I am confused as to which one
to chose. I am 25, single, and will have a long employment future,
during which I can make additional contributions to the IRA. What
do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   J.F., Pawtucket, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your father is right, but he left out one wrinkle. You should
stipulate when you make the move from the 401(k) to an IRA that it
be set up as a ``rollover IRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Then if you leave the account alone (by which I mean that you
make no further contributions) you will retain the option at some
future time to transfer it again _ into a future employer's 401(k)
or other approved retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   Since the latter move might prove very much to your advantage,
it's well worth going to the extra trouble, especially for a person
your age. If you wish make further contributions to your retirement
savings in the meantime, you simply set up another IRA account _ a
traditional IRA if you need or want the tax savings, or a Roth IRA
if you can afford a small tax payment today to avoid a large tax
bill many years in the future.
</P>
<P>
   As for the investment vehicle, you'll want to begin with your
``core'' retirement holding. For most people this is what used to
be called a growth and income fund, and is now called a large-cap
blend, mixing growth- and value-oriented large cap stocks in the
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   I know that the superiority of index funds of recent years is
unlikely to last forever, but their outperformance of the average
managed fund will, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   So I would suggest a fund that seeks to track the performance of
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index. Two of the best, and funds with
identical expense ratios, are Fidelity Spartan Market Index and
Vanguard Index 500.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good place to start. Then, as you build your retirement
accounts through subsequent IRA contributions, you can begin to
branch out into the other market sectors that will give you a
balanced portfolio _ small- and mid-cap holdings, a few sector
funds such as health care and technology, and some international
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. On Dec. 31 I will quit my job, and I will not return to work
outside the home. I am 40. I plan to roll over my $36,000 401(k)
account into an IRA, possibly with Vanguard. It would be deposited
in a money market account and then equal amounts would be
transferred monthly into two or three stock funds for a period of
two or three years. I intend to leave this money untouched for 20
to 25 years. I am hoping to have a minimum of $200,000 by the end
of this time period. Since my husband will be employed, we also
hope to place $2,000 annually into a Roth IRA for the same 20 to 25
years. What funds would be best for the regular IRA and which would
be best for the Roth? What amount could I hope to accumulate in
this time frame?
</P>
<P>
   S.M., Bethlehem, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You should be able to very easily surpass that $200,000 goal,
since it requires average annual returns of only 8.95 percent if
you let the money work for 20 years, and 7.1 percent if it
accumulates for 25.
</P>
<P>
   As I suggested in the letter above, I'd put the about half of
the IRA into a large-cap fund, and probably an index fund. Since
you're a bit older, I'd try some very mild market timing: I'd
consider Vanguard Index Value or Vanguard Windsor II for the core
position, watching the market carefully and being ready, perhaps in
about five years, to move to Vanguard Index 500 or even, if the
market seems really undervalued or economic prospects bright, to
Index Growth.
</P>
<P>
   As for the balance, I would create three positions, each
representing 16 1/3 percent of the portfolio, in Vanguard's Mid-Cap
Index, its Small-Cap Index, and its International Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Vanguard Health Care fund, which I usually
suggest for such a long-term retirement portfolio? That's the
vehicle that I consider to have the strongest long-term growth
potential, so that's the one that you'd want to use for your Roth
IRA, plugging away at that position until it is equal in value to
the other three minor elements of the portfolio, and subsequently
dividing your Roth contributions so as to maintain that balance.
</P>
<P>
   Where are you likely to get with such a portfolio? If you
achieve 10 percent average annual returns from the IRA and make no
further contributions, that $36,000 should grow to $242,190 after
20 years, and to $390,649 after 25.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tempted to ascribe a higher growth rate to the Roth IRA,
since it's where you'll want to keep your holdings with the
potential for the strongest returns. But if you do keep the
portfolio balanced as I suggest above, the returns shouldn't be
substantially greater.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming the same 10 percent average annual returns, a 20-year
discipline of putting $2,000 a year into a Roth IRA would generate
a $119,812 pool after 20 years, and $205,730 after 25 years. If we
bump the presumption of returns up to 11 percent, the figures would
be $134,895 after 20 years and $240,391 after a quarter century.
Beyond that, I'm not willing to speculate, and neither should you.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even though you don't anticipate returning to work note
in the letter above the advantage of specifying the 401(k) rollover
as a rollover IRA rather than a traditional IRA.
</P>
<P>
   It costs you nothing and gives you an extra option.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 87 and have half of my retirement income in California
Municipal Bonds, which are in ``book entry form'' with my broker's
office. I was forced to buy the bonds this way, even though it
separates me from the issuing companies. Isn't that unethical? I
also read that my broker can use my bonds as collateral for his
requirements. What protection do I have if my broker becomes
insolvent or becomes bankrupt?
</P>
<P>
   W.B., San Diego &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The principal protection you have is through the Securities
Investor Protection Corp., or SIPC. This is an entity created by
Congress in 1970, roughly along the lines of the FDIC, with the
notable exception that the SIPC is not a government agency, but
rather a federally chartered corporation. The SIPC provides
protection of up to $500,000 on each account held by a brokerage
firm, although only $100,000 worth of the balance may be in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The SIPC has assets of $790 million, plus a $1 billion line of
credit from a consortium of banks, and a further $1 billion line of
credit through the US government. To most investors, that's a lot
of protection.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that certain brokerage accounts allow the institution
that holds your securities to lend them, but this is usually done
so as to enable other investors who wish to ``short'' the market to
get the securities with which to manage their transactions. This
practice does not effect your SIPC insurance coverage, and should
be no cause for you to worry.
</P>
<P>
   But if you feel you simply won't be secure unless you have the
securities in your possession, you can either ask your brokerage to
change the nature of your account, or you can close the account and
move the securities to a brokerage house that will do it your way.
</P>
<P>
   Doing it your way, however, has its own drawbacks. Not only
would you have to rent a safe deposit box to hold the bonds, but
you would also have to assume a lot of bookkeeping chores that are
now handled by your broker.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, I don't think you have much to worry about.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHARON, Conn. _ Bob Gasparini  &UR;  &LR; is ready to go bow-hunting for
deer. It's nearly dusk, ``crunch time,'' a kind of forest rush hour
when geese fly overhead and deer, who are most active atdawn and at
nightfall, make their way down from the ridges to their bedding
areas.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that a deer's nose is its primary defense against
predators, so he has taken every precaution to ensure he isn't one
of those careless hunters who, he says disparagingly, ``throw off
scent like a Roman candle.''
</P>
<P>
   He has washed his camouflage gear in scent-free detergent. He
has hung it outside to dry. He has packed it in an air-tight
container with a ``scent wafer'' that smells like earth. He has
showered with scent-free soap and shampoo. He has bought himself a
new set of Scent-Lok camo gear _ ``the ultimate in scent
technology, if you will.'' (It's got charcoal material woven into
the lining to absorb body odors.) He has sprayed his feet with
Scent Eliminator.
</P>
<P>
   Then he climbs into his tree, to wait.
</P>
<P>
   And he waits. And he waits some more. He listens for the
telltale crack of tree branches on the ground _ not the soft crack
made by a squirrel, but a loud crack made by hooves. He watches
golden leaves waft their way to the ground. Once every hour, he
stands up in his tree stand and stretches to keep his limbs loose.
And when it's too dark to see anymore, he lowers his bow to the
ground with a rope, then climbs down, to try again in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Bow hunting is the fastest growing form of hunting in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Gasparini, &UR;  &LR; who lives in Chelmsford, never gets a whole lot of
sleep the night before the hunting season's opening day. Make that
opening days; he does not restrict himself to only one.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, Massachusetts opening day for deer
hunting with a shotgun (Nov. &UR;  &LR; 30), for deer hunting with a bow
(Nov. 2.), and for turkey hunting with a gun and bow &UR;  &LR; (Oct. 26).
Then there are all the opening days in Connecticut. Ditto New
Hampshire and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   He tries to be in the woods for all of them or at least as many
as his family and work schedule will allow. That adds up to a lot
of nights counting sheep (actually deer or turkeys, or the
occasional pheasant) for Gasparini, because he's too pumped up to
sleep. His mind is racing. &UR;  &LR;  What will the weather be like? In what
direction will the wind blow? Where will the deer be? Where will he
be? Where will his hunting buddies be? Who'll be the first man to
move toward the other and push the deer in the opposite direction?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chess game,'' says Gasparini, 42. ``It's all based on
data.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasparini is, to understate the matter, deeply passionate about
hunting. A geneticist by vocation, he is a heavy-duty outdoorsman
by avocation. (``Just write that I'm Bob,'' he says. ``Forget the
doctor part.'') He's a 10th-generation New Englander who has hunted
since he was 7, a man for whom hunting _ preparing for it and
strategizing about it, as much as actually doing it _ is a
year-round preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   But after more than three decades, the challenge of tracking and
anticipating and psyching out wildlife can take a guy only so
far. &UR;  &LR; So Gasparini decided to raise the bar a bit higher for
himself. Two years ago he joined the approximately 27,000 hunters
across the state who are using bows to get the job done _ hunters
willing to accept the extreme discomfort of hiding 20 feet up in a
tree to stake out a deer; &UR;  &LR; of &UR;  &LR; sitting stone still for hours in the
cold; of accepting that the odds of killing a deer are definitely
in the deer's favor. (Getting a turkey with a bow, he says, ``is
almost an impossible challenge.'')
</P>
<P>
   You could say that bow hunting is to gun hunting what fly
fishing is to spin fishing, ``your purest form of hunting,'' says
Ken Brown, a member of the board of directors of the Massachusetts
Bowhunters Association. ``You're accepting a higher level of
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The main challenge is distance. You can't put very much of it
between you and a deer, since the maximum range of a bow and arrow
is 25 or 30 yards. So hunters like Gasparini must use any creative
advantage they can to hide from the animal. They have to rid
themselves of all traces of odor to ``fool the deer's nose,'' as he
puts it. They have to sit in uncomfortable tree stands to elude the
deer. They have to ``practice a lot, and get up at ungodly hours in
the morning to walk out and see nothing,'' Ken Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, deters the intrepid, upbeat,
ever-optimistic Gasparini.  &UR;  &LR; In fact one of the reasons he took up
bow hunting is that it gets him into the woods earlier: Instead of
waiting until mid-November, he can bow-hunt in Connecticut in
mid-September. Right now he is a very happy man and a busy one,
too. Now that bow-hunting season has started in Massachusetts, he
can do his hunting closer to home, cutting back on those three-hour
trips to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Now he only has to drive an hour to hunt, to places he favors in
Massachusetts like Ipswich or Ashby where he can sit in a tree for
up to six hours at a time in the sport of strategy, endurance,
skill, brains, luck, and, once in a rare while, soaring, surging
adrenalin.

TOBACCO TAX'S SURPRISE WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- And the hits just keep on coming.
</P>
<P>
   Out in California just before this month's election, the
conventionally wise told me to forget about Proposition 10, that
whatever other political earthquakes were about to occur, the
state's voters were not about to vote themselves higher cigarette
taxes _ even for the lofty purpose of paying for a serious early
childhood development program.
</P>
<P>
   Made sense. Political attention was elsewhere on the long
ballot, there was hardly any TV advertising or news coverage, and
the tax-averse statewide candidates avoided it, though successful
voter turnout work by the Democratic Party clearly was helping.
</P>
<P>
   Shame, I thought. Good idea. Maybe next time. Then it won,
upsetting still another apple cart and perhaps sending a message
back here to the Clinton administration to keep its own sights high
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 10 did not win by much. On Election Night, in the
closest of all the statewide contests, the yes vote was up by a
minuscule 13,000 or so ballots, with mostly the absentees yet to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, however, the initiative has defied the conventional
wisdom, in this case that absentee means ``conservative.'' The
margin continued to grow over the following week, and when it
inched past 60,000 votes victory was declared. At the moment the
margin is a tiny, half-percentage-point or so.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the vision credit goes to movie director and
actor Rob Reiner, a major player in the growing movement to support
pregnant women and children in the first few years of life, when
the brain is forming, and to the indefatigable tobacco-fighting
state Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a decade since the state's cigarette tax had been
increased, putting it below the national average and making it a
political target. And that last increase of 25 cents, also by
initiative, had funded an antismoking crusade in the state that is
widely cited as evidence that aggressive tactics (including higher
prices) can significantly reduce smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-cent increase is based on the realism of the Clinton
administration's effort earlier this year (blocked by Senate
filibuster) to raise the federal levy by $1.50 as part of a
national settlement of liability issues with the tobacco business.
On the one hand, a steep price hike will reduce smoking, especially
by the young, but among the addicted there will continue to be
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The details of Proposition 10 are important, and here are the
key ones:
</P>
<P>
   _The tax is conservatively assumed to generate $700 million
annually after a phase-in year, all of which will be reserved in a
special account.
</P>
<P>
   _First call on the money will be to reimburse the state's
existing antismoking and breast cancer funds to the extent a dip in
consumption is found to reduce their revenue. Not expected to be
much, if anything, but very important politically.
</P>
<P>
   _The only Sacramento bureaucracy will be a seven-member
commission charged with creating broad guidelines, auditing
results, and allocating the money based on the number of births in
each county as a share of statewide births.
</P>
<P>
   _The real work and the real money will be run through each of
California's 58 counties, with only one in five dollars earmarked
for statewide public education and training of child care workers.
The rest is for actual programs run at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now _ in the state and in the country _ the
undeniable fact that the human brain is almost entirely formed in
the first three years is mocked by the fact that hardly any social
resources are aimed at this critical period. Now, the chance has
been created that each county can integrate social services _ from
pre- and post-natal health care through immunization and on to
highest-quality, educational child care (in the home or elsewhere).
Lest people forget, the issue that dominated elections large and
small this month was education, and the public defines it broadly.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising squeaker in California should put both issues _
early childhood development and antitobacco policies _ back on the
front burner here next year.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed legislative proposals on early childhood, including a
major investment in the Early Start precursor to Head Start,
existed even before Rob Reiner along with Hillary Rodham Clinton
helped make two White House conferences on the subject major,
proselytizing successes last year.
</P>
<P>
   As noted above, the cigarette tax was not defeated in the
Senate; it was blocked by filibuster. Majorities exist to pass it,
and advocates can't wait to test sentiment in the barely Republican
House, which may be less interested next year in being so publicly
identified as an arm of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   For President Clinton, the question is one of priorities.
Already, it's clear that HMO reform, minimum wage, school
construction, and Social Security are all coming back prominently.
The antitobacco crusade and young children's health and education
should rank just as high, especially now that they have been
linked.

TRUSTEE FOR A CITY 
Ralph Lowell of Boston 
By Mark I. Gelfand 
Northeastern University Press, 322 pp., illustrated, $35 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ralph Lowell was born in July 1890, institutional Boston
was still dominated by the Yankee establishment _ even though
political Boston was changing, as signaled by the election of an
Irish-born, Roman Catholic mayor just five years before. By the
time Lowell died, on May 15, 1978, institutional Boston had changed
greatly _ in no small measure because of Lowell himself.
</P>
<P>
   In this generous but not uncritical biography, Boston College
history professor Mark I. Gelfand presents a rich and well-rounded
story of an establishment trustee who became an agent of
institutional change.
</P>
<P>
   As Gelfand describes it, Lowell's life took a sharp turn after
1940. Drawing on Lowell's diaries for 1940 and 1941, Gelfand writes
that as he turned 50, ``Lowell considered himself a failure.''
Economic success and civic leadership had ``so far eluded him'' and
Lowell ``saw little prospect of achieving either in the years that
remained.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have surprised no one had Lowell settled into the roles
that were his family legacy. For he was, as Gelfand notes, a man
``who viewed the world _ and perhaps more important, the world
viewed him _ through a lens shaped by his family name.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lowell threw himself into business and civic affairs,
and ``rose to heights of business achievement and civic esteem that
had seemed beyond the reach of a frustrated middle-aged man.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelfand reflects this transition in Lowell's life by shifting
gears himself. The first part of the book is conventionally
chronological, but the second half is arranged around the
institutions in which Lowell played critical roles _ among ``good
causes,'' Harvard College, the Museum of Fine Arts, Massachusetts
General Hospital, and the Lowell Institute; among businesses, the
Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Co. and The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   As a director or trustee at many of these institutions, Lowell
was instrumental in adding members who were not Yankees, not men,
and not white, changing their corporate face and their outlook. And
through the Lowell Institute, he was the driving force behind the
creation of WGBH-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on Lowell's remarkably candid diaries and interviews
with other key players, Gelfand provides an intriguing account of
the behind-the-scenes workings of these very buttoned-up
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell entered Harvard with the class of 1912, and his father's
cousin, A. Lawrence Lowell, became president during his freshman
year. In 1943, he was elected to Harvard's Board of Overseers and
soon became involved in controversies over a new member of the
governing Harvard Corporation (without realizing he had narrowly
missed out being named himself), granting tenure to John Kenneth
Galbraith (whom he opposed as ``a very arrogant and rude man to his
inferiors and a good deal of a bootlicker to his seniors''), and
the appointment of Nathan Pusey as president in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Pusey, then president of a small college in Wisconsin, faced
strong opposition from such prominent overseers as columnist Joseph
Alsop, critic John Mason Brown, nuclear physicist J. Robert
Oppenheimer, and Judge Charles Wyzanski. Lowell thought Pusey
sounded ``like a good risk,'' but ``fearing a divisive debate''
when Pusey's name came before the Overseers, he ``quickly grabbed
the floor ... and moved that consent be granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lowell's morning newspaper was The Boston Herald _ as
it was for most ``proper Bostonians'' _ he joined the Globe's board
in March 1949, when the aggressive Herald publisher Robert B.
``Beanie'' Choate was making ``tentative and vague proposals'' to
merge the two papers. The Globe's publisher at the time, William O.
Taylor, distrusted Choate and his associates ``and cherished the
Globe's independence.'' But merger appealed to Lowell, and he
continued to meet with Choate while going along reluctantly with
the Globe's plans to leave Newspaper Row in town for a new building
in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell finally thought he would get his way when Taylor died in
1955; he persuaded Davis Taylor, the publisher's son and successor,
to meet with Choate. But when Davis Taylor finally invited Choate
to lunch, ``he told Lowell that his purpose was to inform Choate
that `any possible combination with the Herald would be a great
mistake.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell's most important contribution to Boston, Gelfand
suggests, was that he broke out of his class and social position to
further efforts to improve racial and religious tolerance. In this
context, near the end of the book, Gelfand refers to the
oft-misquoted doggerel about how ``the Lowells talk to the Cabots
and the Cabots talk only to God,'' and offers a qualifying line in
Ralph Lowell's case: ``... and to the Cohens and Kellys too.'' In
setting out his account, Gelfand quotes a 1933 Fortune magazine
observation that ``the history of Boston is biography.'' But what
``Trustee for a City'' suggests is that the history of Boston is
also the history of its institutions.

THE ETERNAL MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those sensibilities bred on the excesses of literary realism
_ on Dickens, say, or Tolstoi _ Virginia Woolf is a hard woman to
love. Oh, she with her intricate tragedies and lyric miniatures,
she with her love and cake and death! But what is so often
mistaught or neglected about Woolf is that the whole world resides
within those careful creations: the whole modernist nightmare of
war and uncertainty and unrelenting sorrow, all captured by an
endless dinner party or a clock striking noon in a London square.
She gave us a universe wrought by Einstein and scarcely relieved by
God; and yet she knew the exquisite reach (and lethal hope) that
lay within one rose, one moment on a June morning. There may be no
other English-language novelist who strove so fiercely for
perfection, and none who came so close to finding it.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cunningham's reverence for Woolf is clear from the very
conception of ``The Hours,'' which is an homage to her 1925 novel
about war and disaffection, ``Mrs. Dalloway.'' Using the working
title that Woolf gave her novel-in-progress, he has reimagined that
classic within alternating landscapes _ contemporary New York,
mid-century Los Angeles, the encroaching tragedy of Woolf's own
suicide more than 50 years ago. And while such a bold maneuver may
suggest literary adulation headed for catastrophe, ``The Hours'' is
in fact a lovely triumph. Cunningham honors both ``Mrs. Dalloway''
and its creator with unerring sensitivity, thanks to his modesty of
intention and his sovereignly affecting prose.
</P>
<P>
   Greatly admired for his first novel, ``A Home at the End of the
World,'' Cunningham represents an enviable blend of scholar and
stylist. He understands precisely what mattered to Woolf in ``Mrs.
Dalloway'' _ the imperfect flowers and dying leaves and shifting
images of time _ but he also knows how and when to let them alone.
Acts of emulation too often set themselves up for failure; if
they've chosen an appropriately superior model, they can never come
near it, and too often they suffer from obsequious posturing or
grandiosity. With its mutable shifts among stories and decades,
``The Hours'' never suc(It's also easily admired on its own merits,
without necessitating a prior knowledge of ``Mrs. Dalloway.'')
Relying upon the fine lines of the heroic model of Woolf's plot _ a
day in the life of a middle-aged London woman _ Cunningham has
illuminated the strength of that story merely by resurrecting it.
And by insinuating Woolf's own life within his novel, her struggles
with despair and her joyful immersion in writing, he's taken the
light off his endeavor and placed it onto hers _ he's brought the
honored artist into the work itself.
</P>
<P>
   Reckless dangers, but you sense quickly that Cunningham knows
where he's headed, and that ``The Hours'' is going to succeed. The
novel opens with a breathtakingly crisp imagining of Woolf's
suicide in 1941, then shifts to his reinvention of the Clarissa
Dalloway story. This Clarissa, too, is 52; she is leaving her
Greenwich Village home on a June morning to buy the flowers; the
party is planned for that evening. The trees are shimmering and the
bones of the potter's field are still covered over; an old vagrant
woman still sings heedlessly to the throngs around her. There
remain the tellingly boorish friends, the social slights, the gifts
given and rejected. But the characters have convened in different
dances now: Clarissa has elected to share her life with Sally, her
partner of 18 years; her old friend Richard, the madman-poet who
has called her Mrs. D. for decades, is being honored that night for
his life's work. He is dying of AIDS, and hearing the same voices _
sweet choruses of death _ that so tempted Septimus Warren Smith,
Woolf's unknown soldier, before his suicide.
</P>
<P>
   What a lark, what a plunge! Somewhere on a quiet morning in LA,
1949, Laura Brown is trying to get away from her family long enough
to lose herself in reading. Her husband is a war hero; her young
son adores her with consuming focus, and now she is pregnant again.
It is her husband's birthday; she must bake a cake. She must
engage. So she closes ``Mrs. Dalloway,'' resolving to become a part
of her life: ``She will rise and be cheerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Woolf, taken to the suburbs of London for her health by her
devoted husband, is beginning a novel. It is 1923. She thinks
Clarissa Dalloway will die; perhaps she will take her own life.
Mrs. Woolf wants this to be the best book she has written. If she
can keep the inner voices and rages and headaches at bay, perhaps
she will succeed. She writes: What a lark, what a plunge!
</P>
<P>
   Infusing his three plots with an omniscient whisper, a transient
awareness of parallel images, Cunningham enhances the universality
of Woolf's novel and the mythic quality of her symbols even as he
plays with their creation and effect. The roses sought in New York
by Clarissa are duplicated, in their beauty and failure, on the
cake Laura makes for her husband; each is an ``offering,'' as Woolf
would say, that mirrors the meal planned in the author's home while
she plots her character's suicide. This gossamer map, full of
allusion and memory, is never heavy-handed. The license Cunningham
takes with his plot (that early illicit kiss, who marries whom, who
will die) feels guided by a compassionate grasp of Woolf's greater
themes: her exquisite understanding of the interplay between
sensuality and death _ between eros and thanatos _ that hovers over
her every scene.
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Hours'' has a failure of judgment or execution, it is
simply that the world wrought by ``Mrs. Dalloway'' in 1925 was too
great and heartbreaking _ too much a fall from innocence _ to be
rendered today with anything approaching that magnitude. The war
that Woolf rarely mentioned but that enshrouded her novel could
never again seem so cataclysmic; when Septimus hurls himself from
an open window, it is the wounded Greek hero made modern, an
expression of the silent agony of the 20th century that was only
beginning to make itself known. And Woolf knew precisely what she
was doing. Her ``Mrs. Dalloway,'' with its irony-laden ``triumphs
of civilisation,'' its insistently bright march through the
``pageant of the universe,'' was no mere place of pears or pudding.
It was a world where the indomitable life that Clarissa loved was
nonetheless shadowed by Septimus and his siren song _ a place where
dead soldiers washed up on the rocks, or on the streets of London.
Nothing but a return to ``Mrs. Dalloway'' itself could take us back
to that.
</P>
<P>
   And yet that, too, is Cunningham's victory: his graceful
recognition that he wants only to honor Woolf's classic, not
upgrade it or get in its way. With his elliptical evocation of
``Mrs. Dalloway,'' he has managed to pay great but quiet tribute _
reminding us of the gorgeous, ferocious beauty of what endures.

`FEAR AND LOATHING' FAILS; `FAIRIES' MARVELOUS TALE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''  &LR; _ The
inventive director Terry Gilliam and equally experimental actor
Johnny Depp try their hardest to get Hunter S. Thompson's
psychedelic style on to the screen. Using fish-eye lenses and
over-the-top acting as the cinematic equivalent of Thompson's gonzo
style doesn't work at all. It's best left on the page.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Photographing Fairies''  &LR; _ It's hard to imagine how this
deeply disturbing, marvelously textured tale of fantasy and
obsession escaped a theatrical release. Directed by Nick Willing
and starring Toby Stevens and Emily Woof, this post-World War I
thriller mines the same territory as last year's ``Fairy Tale: A
True Story,'' only it does it much, much better. This is not a
children's movie. It's dark and deep and tough and sexy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Passion in the Desert''  &LR; _ This stunningly beautiful film,
shot on location in the Sahara, is great to look at it, but it's
very, very slow. Based on a Balzac story, the tale revolves around
a relationship between a soldier and a leopard. While the desert
sequences look great, the story reads better on the page than
projected on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Can't Hardly Wait'' &LR;  _ At first, this teen comedy seems like
nothing more than a John Hughes clone. But it's much better than
that. Jennifer Love Hewitt, on the cusp of stardom, plays the
object of a young boy's affection on the eve of their high school
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Hurricane Streets'' &LR;  _ Morgan Freeman directs this harsh
story of what happens to some street thieves when one of their
robberies involves a murder. As the stakes and penalties get
higher, so does the drama.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A Letter From Death Row'' &LR;  _ Bret Michaels, of the band
Poison, produced, directed, wrote, and stars in this oft-told tale
of a death row inmate who didn't do it.

 SHARON, Conn: ... surging adrenalin.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When all conditions are right and an animal is in sight, ``you
are in the zone. You are (itals)lit(unitals),'' says Gasparini.
``You are so aware of your surroundings. It heightens your
awareness. I've heard a mouse squeak behind me that I wouldn't have
heard otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   It hardly matters to him if, &UR;  &LR; on a given day, he doesn't shoot
an animal (or ``harvest'' it, his preferred term). As Gasparini is
fond of saying, the animal is the ``icing on the cake.'' It's the
experience that counts. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hunting, of course, is not something that everyone can
comprehend, let alone stomach. Gasparini knows this, and he
understands that most nonhunters can't overlook the central paradox
of the sportsman's life _ that people who love wildlife go out of
their way to kill it. Still, he does not want to offend, which is
why he is careful to use words like ``harvest,'' which is less
stark than ``kill,'' or ``quarry,'' which is less evocative than
``deer.'' He emphasizes that he hunts only to fill up his freezer:
His family eats no beef, only venison. And when the freezer is
full, he hunts only with a camera.
</P>
<P>
   And he hunts only with those who share his focus ``in terms of
being ethical hunters and sportsmen ... someone with the same level
of respect for nature and animals,'' Gasparini says. He would
never, for example, go hunting with someone who'd take a wild shot
at an animal and potentially wound it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take a life is not macho,'' he says. ``This is not done
lightly. It is an intense moment of sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   He will not permit a reporter to sit anywhere near him in the
woods of Sharon, where he went on a recent hunting trip. Killing an
animal, he says, ``is too personal to share.''  &UR;  &LR; But he will share
his vast store of hunting knowledge, gleaned from years of
exploring the woods with his father, his wife, and his three
children, now aged 15, 12, 10. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's probably fair to say that when average people take a walk
in the woods, they, well, (itals)walk in the woods.(unitals)  &UR;  &LR; They
might notice the pretty leaves, or some wild mushrooms, or enjoy
the stillness. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But when Gasparini takes a walk through the woods, he
(itals)intuits(unitals) the woods. During hunting season, he lives
in two time zones _ regular time and forest time, when his world
slows down and the forest comes alive. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He has cultivated an instinct about forest life so acute he
can distinguish between the sound a squirrel makes when it moves
and the sound of a chipmunk. (Squirrels take two or three jumps at
a time. Chipmunks scurry until they get where they are going.)
</P>
<P>
   He can tell when a buck has been close by its ``antler rubs'' on
the tree bark _ the scrapes bucks make to mark out their territory.
He can tell when a doe has been around by reading the impressions
of its pointed hooves in the leaves. (Buck tracks are larger and
more splayed.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Do you smell that?'' he says suddenly to his
woods-illiterate companion. ``It's a musk odor,'' he says
authoritatively. ``It's what a buck secretes.'' It's all
hard-earned knowlege, of course, accumulated after years of sitting
motionless on logs or leaves, or in trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say to me, how can you sit still for three hours? There
is plenty to keep you stimulated. The forest is alive! You hear all
the ground animals, leaves rustle, and chipmunks and squirrels. You
see the birds land on branches.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunting, he says, ``is a release, an escape for me. I go full
blast all day. Between the family and my job, it never stops.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the woods, ``there is no fax, no beeper, no telephone. No
one, except someone I'm hunting with. I'll sit there until (I'm)
one with the forest. I've had birds land on my gun barrel, on my
legs. I've had squirrels on my knee. I've had deer come brush by
me. I had a small doe (itals)step over my leg once(unitals). She
never knew I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   And the waiting is well worth it. `If there is one secret to
hunting success,'' Gasparini says, ``it's that you've got to put in
your time, before the season starts.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  As he begins his hunting trip in Connecticut, he has already
put in his time. With his group _ any combination of his father,
brother-in-law, two hunting buddies, and his 15-year-old son _ he
has staked out the area, located on an acquaintance's property in
Litchfield County. He has already ``read the woods'' for signs of
deer and built his tree stands in those spots he has deemed
``hot.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There is every reason to see a deer this evening, he says. We've
done it all. We've put in our time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Up he goes, into the tree stand, hoisting himself up 12 metal
tree-climbing pegs, positioning himself on his camouflage-colored
cushion. He rests his camouflaged bow with its attached camouflaged
arrows across his lap. For the next three hours Bob Gasparini sits,
alert as a buck himself. He waits for something to happen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing does, unless you count the squirrel that scampered by,
three quick steps. But he's not discouraged. There's still tomorrow
morning.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m., Gasparini is in his truck, driving to the woods where
he quickly jumps out and dons his Scent-Lok suit. He is rushing, a
little anxious that he won't be in the tree for morning crunch time
_ 30 to 45 minutes after dawn. He hasn't eaten breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he climbs into a different tree stand he set up maybe
a quarter-mile from the last one. He's feeling lucky, pretty sure
that he'll see deer this morning, and that Friday was just bad
luck. ``If we don't see one today, it's not because we didn't
try,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And he tries. He sits in his stand for three hours, through a
light drizzle and a chill that necessitates camo gloves. Nothing
happens. (In fact, nothing will happen for the next few hunting
trips: It will be 10 outings in the woods before Gasparini finally
takes a deer.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But later that morning, at breakfast, Gasparini is reliving the
whole experience. He factors in the wind velocity, the noise level,
the location of coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason,'' he says, perplexed. ``We should have
seen one. Everything was right. The wind. Our scent. Where are the
deer? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He allows that he's a ``little disappointed'' he didn't
(itals)see(unitals) any deer. But not very, he emphasizes, adding
his often repeated maxim: ``If you get a deer it's the icing on the
cake. You really have to believe that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHARON, Conn. _ Bob Gasparini  &UR;  &LR; is ready to go bow-hunting for
deer. It's nearly dusk, ``crunch time,'' a kind of forest rush hour
when geese fly overhead and deer, who are most active at dawn and
at nightfall, make their way down from the ridges to their bedding
areas.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that a deer's nose is its primary defense against
predators, so he has taken every precaution to ensure he isn't one
of those careless hunters who, he says disparagingly, ``throw off
scent like a Roman candle.''
</P>
<P>
   He has washed his camouflage gear in scent-free detergent. He
has hung it outside to dry. He has packed it in an air-tight
container with a ``scent wafer'' that smells like earth. He has
showered with scent-free soap and shampoo. He has bought himself a
new set of Scent-Lok camo gear _ ``the ultimate in scent
technology, if you will.'' (It's got charcoal material woven into
the lining to absorb body odors.) He has sprayed his feet with
Scent Eliminator.
</P>
<P>
   Then he climbs into his tree, to wait.
</P>
<P>
   And he waits. And he waits some more. He listens for the
telltale crack of tree branches on the ground _ not the soft crack
made by a squirrel, but a loud crack made by hooves. He watches
golden leaves waft their way to the ground. Once every hour, he
stands up in his tree stand and stretches to keep his limbs loose.
And when it's too dark to see anymore, he lowers his bow to the
ground with a rope, then climbs down, to try again in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Bow hunting is the fastest growing form of hunting in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Gasparini, &UR;  &LR; who lives in Chelmsford, never gets a whole lot of
sleep the night before the hunting season's opening day. Make that
opening days; he does not restrict himself to only one.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, Massachusetts opening day for deer
hunting with a shotgun (Nov. &UR;  &LR; 30), for deer hunting with a bow
(Nov. 2.), and for turkey hunting with a gun and bow &UR;  &LR; (Oct. 26).
Then there are all the opening days in Connecticut. Ditto New
Hampshire and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   He tries to be in the woods for all of them or at least as many
as his family and work schedule will allow. That adds up to a lot
of nights counting sheep (actually deer or turkeys, or the
occasional pheasant) for Gasparini, because he's too pumped up to
sleep. His mind is racing. &UR;  &LR;  What will the weather be like? In what
direction will the wind blow? Where will the deer be? Where will he
be? Where will his hunting buddies be? Who'll be the first man to
move toward the other and push the deer in the opposite direction?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chess game,'' says Gasparini, 42. ``It's all based on
data.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasparini is, to understate the matter, deeply passionate about
hunting. A geneticist by vocation, he is a heavy-duty outdoorsman
by avocation. (``Just write that I'm Bob,'' he says. ``Forget the
doctor part.'') He's a 10th-generation New Englander who has hunted
since he was 7, a man for whom hunting _ preparing for it and
strategizing about it, as much as actually doing it _ is a
year-round preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   But after more than three decades, the challenge of tracking and
anticipating and psyching out wildlife can take a guy only so
far. &UR;  &LR; So Gasparini decided to raise the bar a bit higher for
himself. Two years ago he joined the approximately 27,000 hunters
across the state who are using bows to get the job done _ hunters
willing to accept the extreme discomfort of hiding 20 feet up in a
tree to stake out a deer; &UR;  &LR; of &UR;  &LR; sitting stone still for hours in the
cold; of accepting that the odds of killing a deer are definitely
in the deer's favor. (Getting a turkey with a bow, he says, ``is
almost an impossible challenge.'')
</P>
<P>
   You could say that bow hunting is to gun hunting what fly
fishing is to spin fishing, ``your purest form of hunting,'' says
Ken Brown, a member of the board of directors of the Massachusetts
Bowhunters Association. ``You're accepting a higher level of
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The main challenge is distance. You can't put very much of it
between you and a deer, since the maximum range of a bow and arrow
is 25 or 30 yards. So hunters like Gasparini must use any creative
advantage they can to hide from the animal. They have to rid
themselves of all traces of odor to ``fool the deer's nose,'' as he
puts it. They have to sit in uncomfortable tree stands to elude the
deer. They have to ``practice a lot, and get up at ungodly hours in
the morning to walk out and see nothing,'' Ken Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, deters the intrepid, upbeat,
ever-optimistic Gasparini.  &UR;  &LR; In fact one of the reasons he took up
bow hunting is that it gets him into the woods earlier: Instead of
waiting until mid-November, he can bow-hunt in Connecticut in
mid-September. Right now he is a very happy man and a busy one,
too. Now that bow-hunting season has started in Massachusetts, he
can do his hunting closer to home, cutting back on those three-hour
trips to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Now he only has to drive an hour to hunt, to places he favors in
Massachusetts like Ipswich or Ashby where he can sit in a tree for
up to six hours at a time in the sport of strategy, endurance,
skill, brains, luck, and, once in a rare while, soaring, surging
adrenalin.

JAMES WHALE: THE FATHER OF `FRANKENSTEIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before he died, Hollywood buried James Whale.
</P>
<P>
   Once it toasted him, regaled him as a genius and visionary. In
the 1930s, Whale was one of Hollywood's premier directors, the
mastermind behind three of the greatest horror films in history:
``Frankenstein,'' ``The Invisible Man,'' and ``The Bride of
Frankenstein.'' He made Boris Karloff a star, and the flat-headed,
heavy-browed Monster a cultural icon. But in that peculiar,
terrifying way Hollywood has of devouring its own, Whale fell out
of favor. Whether he was a victim of studio meddling, creative
differences, or homophobia, his career was effectively over by
1940.
</P>
<P>
   So when he committed suicide in 1957, two months shy of his 68th
birthday, little attention was paid. His death received scant
notice in the trade rags, few came to mourn, and his name faded
into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than four decades after his death, James Whale is in
the midst of a renaissance. He is the subject of a new biography,
and several of his films _ which have never wavered in style or
influence _ are part of next January's retrospective at the Brattle
Theatre. He was even the subject of a recent episode of the E!
channel's ``Mysteries and Scandals.''
</P>
<P>
   Likely to receive the most attention is ``Gods and Monsters,'' a
beguiling fantasia on the end of Whale's life. The film, which
opens Friday, stars Sir Ian McKellen as Whale, and Brendan Fraser
as Clayton Boone, a young ex-Marine fascinated by the director.
Combining fact and fiction, it also includes startling re-creations
of Whale's films, with actors who are dead ringers for Karloff and
for Elsa Lanchester, who portrayed the Bride. But it is less a
celebration of Hollywood's glory years than a subtle indictment of
its ability to consign to the shadows those it once revered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what happened to James Whale,'' said Bill Condon,
the film's director. ``He was really a major director, but it
seemed like his career was over almost before it began.''
</P>
<P>
   Condon based his film on ``Father of Frankenstein,'' a poignant
1995 novel by Christopher Bram. Though there were Whale biographies
available, Condon preferred the story that mingled fact with
fictional elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a great fan of biopics in general, and I think films
which go from one high point to another just never seem compelling
to me,'' he said. ``I thought (Bram's novel) figured out a great
way into telling the story of his life, by examining the end of his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Whale's life began July 22, 1889. Although he often passed
himself off as an aristocrat, he was the son of a poor laborer in
the mining town of Dudley, England. Like most boys of his time, he
was expected to work in a factory, but he sought a life beyond the
mean hiss of the furnaces. He loved art, and found work as a
newspaper cartoonist before joining up during World War I. While he
was a German prisoner of war, he staged productions for others in
the camp. Those experiences would eventually lead Whale to the
stage, and after a brief turn as an actor, he became a director.
</P>
<P>
   His first stage success was the war drama ``Journey's End'' in
1928, and it caught the attention of Hollywood that had just begun
to expand into ``talkies.'' As a stage director, Whale had valuable
experience with dialogue. He worked on Howard Hughes's ``Hell's
Angles,'' and in 1930, turned ``Journey's End'' into a
well-received film. Whale's work so impressed Carl Laemmle Jr., who
with his father Carl Sr. ran Universal Studios, that the filmmaker
was given his choice of any film project.
</P>
<P>
   He chose ``Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Laemmles, Whale was given creative freedom, and imbued
the 1931 film with such a singular vision that ``Frankenstein''
became as much his creation as that of Mary Shelley, who wrote the
classic novel on which the film was based. He handpicked his own
cast, including the unknown Karloff as the Monster and Colin Clive
as Dr. Henry Frankenstein. (The studio wanted Leslie Howard, best
remembered as Ashley Wilkes in ``Gone with the Wind,'' but Whale
believed Clive would better capture the doctor's frayed-nerve
persona.) He even helped design the Monster's look, an exaggeration
of Karloff's naturally harsh, angular features.
</P>
<P>
   His films are ``so fresh because he was so in control of them.
He put his entire personality into them,'' Condon said. ``He found
a niche for himself in the studio system in the early to mid 1930s,
and he was really allowed to have his way. He was almost like an
independent director before his time.''
</P>
<P>
   The film was a critical and commercial hit, not only
establishing Whale as a top-notch director, but horror films as a
bankable genre. It is still an arresting work. Whereas the shocks
that led some early audiences to walk out may have faded, what
remains is the pathos and touching, awkward humanity of Whale's
monster. Whale's was a cautionary tale about technology, and the
arrogance of men who aspired to be gods, to hold within their very
mortal hands the creation of life.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror,''
author David J. Skal described Frankenstein's monster as ``a
pathetic figure caught, as it were, on the barbed wire between
humanism and mechanism.'' People looked at the Monster and recoiled
because they saw themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, Whale was the golden boy of the Universal lot, enjoying
fame in the time of Garbo and Gable. The studio would trumpet his
work with the catch phrase, ``It's a Whale of a Film,'' and he
enjoyed his success. Perhaps it was his success that allowed Whale
to live openly as a gay man with David Lewis, a producer on such
films as ``Camille.''
</P>
<P>
   But Whale was also hamstrung by ``Frankenstein.'' Pegged as a
horror director, he yearned for the varied opportunities offered to
other directors such as George Cukor. For years Whale resisted a
sequel to ``Frankenstein,'' though there were other horror films,
most notably ``The Old Dark House'' in 1932 and ``The Invisible
Man'' in 1933. Finally, in 1935, Whale made ``The Bride of
Frankenstein,'' which many consider his best film. Though he would
also direct the musical ``Show Boat'' in 1936, most still thought
of him as a director of horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to get out of the horror genre. Even then, even
though he had huge success with it, there was still a slight stigma
attached to it,'' Condon said. ``He wanted to be on that A-list of
prestige directors. `Show Boat' was a first step, and the next step
was going to be `The Road Back.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road Back,'' a sequel to ``All Quiet on the Western
Front,'' was to be Whale's masterpiece, the story of German
soliders trying to adjust to civilian life after World War I. But
as Whale was beginning the film in 1937, the Laemmles lost their
stake in Universal, and with it went the director's creative
freedom. In came the cost-cutting men, their eyes ever on the
bottom line. Germany (and to be more precise, the Nazi Party), a
major market for American films, objected to some of the film's
messages, and against Whale's wishes, the film was severely edited.
Another director was even brought in to add bits of slapstick.
</P>
<P>
   The film bombed, and Whale's career never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   He made other films, among them a cracking good version of ``The
Man in the Iron Mask.'' But he would never be at peace with
executives always peering over his shoulder. By 1940, Whale was out
of the business. He retreated to his Pacific Palisades home, where
he spent his days painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ceased to be fun for him, so he walked away,'' Condon said.
``But when he left, it was so many decades before the cult of
directors and auteurs, he really was forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have theorized that homophobia was at the heart of Whale's
career decline. But Condon said the director should not be
characterized as a ``gay martyr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having talked to a lot of people, my sense is that when he did
stumble in his career, there weren't as many people there to help
him up,'' he said. ``It was the flamboyance, his disregard for what
people felt about it, that was probably read as a kind of arrogance
that made people enjoy his failure.''
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Whale suffered a series of strokes, and his
health deteriorated. A troublesome affair with a young Frenchman
led to the end of his 20-year relationship with Lewis, and although
the two remained friends, Whale spent much of his time alone. He
would have occasional pool parties for the beautiful young men so
plentiful in Hollywood, but at best he could only watch them as
life passed him by.
</P>
<P>
   So on May 29, 1957, dressed in his Sunday best, Whale, who never
learned to swim, dove headfirst into the shallow end of his pool.
For years there would be questions about Whale's death _ was he
murdered by some mad young man? _ and not until Lewis's death, in
1987 would the rumors to be put to rest. Lewis, trying to save what
remained of Whale's reputation, had concealed his former lover's
suicide note until then. In part, it said, ``The future is just old
age and pain. ... I must have peace and this is the only way.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, poor health played a hand in Whale's suicide. But
perhaps Whale's decline began years before on a studio lot when he
was robbed of his career, then his reputation. Like the Monster he
brought to stunning life in 1931, Whale is now having his own
resurrection, at last receiving the attention he so richly
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to pretend it didn't matter to him, but he was
disappointed that he'd been forgotten,'' Condon said. ``He deserved
better, and I imagine all the attention he's receiving now would
make him incredibly happy.''

JEWEL WRITES SONGS OF INNOCENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a big leap from living in your van as a teenager to being
the moral conscience of your generation. Yet that's the path being
carved by the quietly ambitious, unashamedly idealistic Jewel; the
Alaskan-born singer-songwriter whose debut album sold 8 million
copies and made her an icon to wandering youth.
</P>
<P>
   Jewel wrote that debut, ``Pieces of You,'' as a 19-year-old who
had moved from Alaska to an itinerant life in San Diego. The album
produced three huge hit singles: ``You Were Meant for Me,'' ``Who
Will Save Your Soul,'' and ``Foolish Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 24, Jewel returns Tuesday with ``Spirit,'' a softly
understated, beguilingly beautiful folk record that blends an
ecumenical spirituality with a timeless innocence that makes you
wonder how the marketplace will react to it. Jewel's
vulnerabilities are revealed, but so are her strengths and
commitments to the love, grace, and peace ethic.
</P>
<P>
   A focal track is ``Innocence Maintained,'' in which Jewel
intones: ``We've made houses for hatred/-It's time we made a place
where people's souls may be seen and made safe/-Be careful with
each other ... for innocence can't be lost, it just needs to be
maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   In many hands, Jewel's moralizing might seem corny, but she
invests this song and others with a stunning calm. As she told
Billboard, ``I wanted to write a record that was an antidote to all
the things that made me worry in the world, so that it's comforting
somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   She succeeded, for the new rec-ord goes right to the heart.
``We've compromised our pride and sacrificed our health/-We have to
demand more not of each other/-But more from ourselves,'' she sings
in the opening tune, ``Deep Water.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio singles may be few and far between this time, though
``Hands'' is working its way up the charts with the life-affirming
thought: ``In the end only kindness matters ... We are God's eyes,
God's hands, God's mind.'' This may not make the album go ka-ching
at the cash registers, but it earns respect.
</P>
<P>
   This album is meant to be listened to as a whole. Gently flowing
acoustic guitar, played by former Bostonian Jude Cole, (who also
has a fine new solo disc out), anchors these fragile, painterly
melodies. Other guests include Ednaswap bassist Paul Bushnell, Red
Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, Afro-Cuban percussionist Luis
Conte, pedal steel guitarist Marty Rifkin, and drummer Brian
Macleod.
</P>
<P>
   Jewel herself only plays guitar on two tracks, preferring to
concentrate on her voice. It has matured and deepened, yet is still
capable of a magnificent falsetto on ``Enter from the East,'' an
erotic, cello-limned tune where she sings, ``I must have you all to
myself/-Feel the full weight of your skin.'' A similarly light and
airy eroticism turns up on ``Jupiter.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jewel is searching for love, we soon learn it's a love
both on the earthy and the spiritual planes. In the elegiac
``Barcelona,'' with Flea adding a subtle bass line, she sings,
``I'm afraid I am alone/-Won't somebody please hold me, release me,
show me the meaning of mercy.'' Later, in the same song, she asks,
``God, won't you please hold me, release me?''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, these songs are unerringly pretty. Jewel even adds a
protest song in ``Life Uncommon,'' and that, too, is sung so
prettily that you won't want to rush the barricades after all.
Rather, this album makes you want to sit back, contemplate life,
and be glad that an artist as compelling as Jewel is willing to
bare her soul, in spite of a possible backlash against such
idealism.

DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE: FEWER SAILORS, GREATER PERILS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Fort Worth Star-Telegram reporter Chris Vaughn
and photographer Rodger Mallison were aboard the USS Enterprise
when it departed Norfolk, Va., on Nov. 6. They were flown off the
aircraft carrier the next afternoon, one day before an accident on
the flight deck killed four aviators.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE _ Hunkered down against the buffeting
winds of the Atlantic, Ronnie Pinkston prowls the rolling flight
deck.
</P>
<P>
   Morning, noon and night, Pinkston, a Dallas native, watches over
the 19- and 20-year-olds who crawl beneath 50,000 pounds of
screaming aircraft, glad he's not there anymore. He watches them
scramble to get out of the way, tries to guard their backs for the
propeller or the cable they don't see.
</P>
<P>
   A 22-year Navy veteran, it is Pinkston's job to oversee safety
on the flight deck and keep these men alive in an environment where
even a small error can mean death. It is an awesome responsibility,
but it weighs more heavily now because the Enterprise is several
hundred sailors light as it steams toward the Persian Gulf and the
possibility of a confrontation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find me some people,'' Pinkston said, the thunder of Navy
firepower drowning out the occasional word. ``Don't give me 80
percent of what I need. I need 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise, a four-decade veteran of fighting all around the
globe, is one of the best outfitted and most lethal warships in the
Navy. The 1,100-foot-long aircraft carrier is scheduled to arrive
in the Persian Gulf early next week, the largest vessel in an
armada sent by President Clinton in the latest buildup against
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   But this deployment _ the Enterprise's 16th _ began a week ago
with concern all the way to the captain's chair that the ship left
port with less than is needed for combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on the edge of having all the bodies we need,''
said Capt. Evan Chanik, the ship's commander and a Persian Gulf War
fighter pilot. ``We drop much lower, and it starts impacting my
ability to carry out our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military preparedness has emerged in the past year as one
of the most pressing issues in the budget discussions between the
Pentagon and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton,
recently visited the Senate to report that ``readiness is
descending'' and that the services need an additional $14 billion
to $17 billion a year to stay out of a ``nose dive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, for example, has 37 percent fewer sailors than it did
less than 10 years ago and recently has run into trouble with
recruitment and retention.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force and the Army are no better off.
</P>
<P>
   The private sector is booming, offering better pay and
retirement packages and less sacrifice to service members who leave
the military. And morale is sinking among those still in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bitter about my years in the service,'' Pinkston, 38,
said. ``I'm bitter that we're not moving forward. We're slipping
into the same situation we were in in the late '70s after the
Vietnam War. And I don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   From his carpeted chair high on the bridge, Chanik said the Navy
is nowhere near as depleted as it was in the late 1970s after the
post-Vietnam drawdown, a so-called ``hollow force.'' But he said it
will be if the military doesn't ``stop the decline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We still are out there as an instrument of national policy and
ultimately, if need be, to go to war and to win,'' he said. ``You
never want to do that without knowing darn well you're going to
win. This is not about losing market share or shareholder returns.
This is a matter of potential life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Nov. 8, two days after Chanik was interviewed,
two planes collided on the Enterprise's dimly lit flight deck
during practice landings and takeoffs, killing four aviators and
injuring two more.
</P>
<P>
   A number of those in Congress, including U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison of Texas and U.S. Rep. Kay Granger of Fort Worth, have
said they are increasingly alarmed at the state of the military and
believe that some of the defense cuts of the past six years should
be restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can take care of what we will possibly do to
Iraq,'' Granger said. ``When we talk about the long term, no, we're
not ready. It's not a crisis, but it is very serious. We have the
time to correct it before we're at a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   As the Enterprise towered 200 feet over the pier in Norfolk,
Va., on the morning of Nov. 6, sailors in black peacoats and white
hats rimmed its edges. A few wives and children braved the cold to
wave goodbye as the ship weighed anchor and drifted away from its
moorings.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise was ordered straight to the Persian Gulf, where
it will replace the USS Eisenhower and its battle group, which have
been in place for six months.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women on the Enterprise are likely to remain in the
area until May, long after many of the other military units have
gone home. The thought of six months away from home makes the first
day at sea difficult for many of the crew members. They are mostly
quiet, some of them downright sullen, as the reality sets in. The
brand-new sailors are nervous.
</P>
<P>
   It took almost two years of work for the sailors to reach this
point, months spent repairing and maintaining the ship, followed by
several months training
</P>
<P>
   at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise _ like most of the Navy's ships around the world
today _ is at C-2, the second-highest level of readiness, the
rating given to ships that can carry out most _ but not all _ of
their wartime missions.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old nuclear carrier left Norfolk with 4,550 men and
women, 100 short of what the Navy says it should have and 400 short
of what the Navy would like to have. Nor does the carrier have the
spare parts, particularly for its aircraft, that its senior
officers would like to have.

GARDENERS CURIOUS ABOUT LAUREL GROWTHS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could you identify this strange growth on my Texas mountain
laurel?
</P>
<P>
   A: &UR;  &LR; Three gardeners have asked about silvery-gray growths on
their plants. A curious growth that emerges from the stem _ a
round, pencil-size extension that flares like a skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Since Texas mountain laurels are more widely used in San
Antonio, I asked a Texas A&AMP;M extension horticulturist for that
region, Jerry Parsons, if he could identify this odd growth.
Parsons says this is a bloom spike that has a fasciated growing
point.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Taylor's Dictionary for Gardeners'' (Houghton Mifflin,
$25), the word fasciation is defined as ``an abnormal widening and
flattening of a stem, typically of a flower stalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Mountain laurel, Parsons continues, fails to bloom for three
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ The plant does not receive enough light in its present
location.
</P>
<P>
   _ The gray, stringlike bloom structures were pruned off in the
fall or early spring.
</P>
<P>
   _ The flowering structures were damaged by a late freeze or hard
freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of problems, Parsons says, are caused by the first
reason.
</P>
<P>
   The gray, stringlike bloom structures mentioned in reason No. 2
are the racemes of dormant flower buds. If the stringlike bloom
structures are removed in the summer or fall, bloom will not occur
the following year. (The flared growth shown in the photo above is
fasciated or mutated growth at the end of a raceme. It is not
genetically reproducible.)
</P>
<P>
   There is a narrow window of opportunity to prune mountain laurel
without decreasing or eliminating the following year's bloom _
pruning must occur shortly after spring bloom has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While visiting my daughter, we noticed huge bushes with
hundreds of deep pink flowers. We asked what they were and were
told ``Confederate rose.'' The woman gave me some cuttings, but I
would like some information on how to care for them and some
background on this beautiful bush.
</P>
<P>
   A: This great Southern shrub, or multitrunk small tree, is
botanically named ``Hibiscus mutabilis.'' Mutabilis refers to the
change in color of the bloom as it ages _ from a pink so pale it is
nearly white to a deep rose. The Confederate rose is sometimes
called cotton rose, as the leaves resemble oversize cotton foliage.
Others say the leaves remind them of a maple.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate rose is kin to perennial hibiscus with the
dish-plate-size blooms as well as to the tropical hibiscus used
here for great summer color and to the althea.
</P>
<P>
   If frozen back in winter, it re-emerges from ground level each
spring. The big pink blooms come in late summer/fall.
</P>
<P>
   It is said the Confederate rose originated in China and was
introduced to European gardens by 1690. How it came to the South is
not that clear, but apparently it was widely used in the 1800s.
It's believed the common name was derived from the plant's use in
the South and the resemblance of the big blooms to fluffy,
old-fashioned garden roses. Plant historians say Southerners with
little to spend on landscaping following the Civil War used the
Confederate rose in cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is easily propagated from cuttings. Plant the rooted
cuttings in the garden in spring after danger of frost.
</P>
<P>
   Give the Confederate rose plenty of sun and excellent drainage.
It does best in an acidic, fertile soil.
</P>
<P>
   This deciduous, old-fashioned, billowy shrub can reach 8-15 feet
in height and several feet in width.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have two large desert rose plants. How do I care for them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Desert rose, ``Adenium obesum,'' is a sun-loving succulent
with pink, crimson or white flowers and prominently veined glossy
foliage with downy undersides. The thick, bulbous stem contains a
poisonous milky sap. It is not cold-tolerant, so you will need to
provide winter protection.
</P>
<P>
   Give the plant a half day or more of sun. Water during the
growing season, but make sure the soil drains well. Keep the soil
on the dry side in late fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   Desert rose likes a loose soil. Any good potting soil is fine
for grafted types. Use a cactus and succulent potting soil for
ungrafted types. Apply a cactus fertilizer every three weeks or so
during the growing season.
</P>
<P>
   Prune the plant if it becomes leggy. Since the milky juice is
poisonous, wear gloves while pruning.

THE PERENNIALLY POPULAR PANSY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pansies are old-fashioned flowers for modern-day gardens,
whether the color scheme calls for muted peach and lavender,
calming blue and white, moody indigo, vivid orange and purple, or
downright cheerful red and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Pansies, relatives of the Johnny-jump-up and the sweet violet,
belong to the genus Viola, a large group containing some 500
species.
</P>
<P>
   Violas were cultivated in fourth-century Greece for
herbal-medicinal use, and the delicate-looking but hardy plants
were an inspiration to Shakespeare. As for the Victorians, the
pansy was second only to the rose, according to some who have
delved into 19th-century culture. Pansies, which are supposed to
convey loving thoughts in the language of flowers, were a popular
posy in Victorian tussie-mussies, nosegays that carried messages
via blooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of the 1800s, breeders began crossing Viola
species, and William Thompson, gardener for Lord Gambier of Iver,
Buckinghamshire, England, is credited with developing ``Viola x
Wittrockiana,'' the plant we know as a pansy. A pansy without a
``face,'' the block of color on the lower petals, was introduced
about the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent times, the United States, Germany and Japan have
been the forerunners in pansy breeding.
</P>
<P>
   Today, e-mail may be a preferred means of expression, but small
vases of pansy bouquets can lift the spirits. Pansies are
late-fall-to-spring-bloomers in Houston-area gardens and, given
some sun, a rich, well-draining soil and varied use, gardeners can
enjoy a wealth of blooms. Planted en masse, the cool-season annuals
are a colorful ground cover. Large groups of one cultivar are more
effective in a landscape than a couple of this and one of that.
Pansies' compact habit makes them ideal as edging material and
container subjects, complementing taller-growing bulbs such as
tulips and daffodils, `Rocket' snapdragons or a collection of
herbs. Organically grown pansy blooms are edible, too.
</P>
<P>
   The pansy flower is single, features five rounded petals and may
be one clear color, a single color with black lines (penciling)
radiating from the center, or may have a dark center, the block of
color on the lower petals we call the ``face.'' Some pansy blooms
wear two colors; some come with three.
</P>
<P>
   And that color range, one of the largest among annuals, includes
red, mahogany, bronze, gold, orange, salmon, apricot, yellow, pink,
purple, lavender and several shades of blue, white and cream.
</P>
<P>
   The pansy plant is generally no more than 8 inches in height and
width, but the size of the flowers vary and blooms generally are
categorized as large (3-4 inches), medium (2-3 inches) to
multiflora (1-2 inches).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PANSY SERIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to hybridization, there are numerous pansy series on the
market today. A series is a group of plants with similar qualities
and available in different colors.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Majestic Giant series, for example, features
large-flowered pansies available in six colors and a mix, all with
faces. This 1966 All-America Selections winner has a free-flowering
habit and tolerates warm and cold temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Pansies in the Crown series fall into the medium category and
are available in nine bright, clear colors. The Imperial series is
also in this size category and offers mostly faced flowers in blue,
pink and other colors. Imperial was a 1975 AAS winner.
</P>
<P>
   In the multiflora category, the Crystal Bowl series features
pansies in one clear color without a face. There are 11 colors,
however, in this series, touted as more tolerant of our heat.
</P>
<P>
   There are 14 Maxim colors, including the 1991 AAS winner, `Maxim
Marina,' a light blue pansy with a dark blue face outlined in
white. All Maxims are faced and fall into the multiflora category.
</P>
<P>
   Universal is another series of ``heat-tolerant'' multiflora
pansies, clear or faced. There are 13 colors as well as a mix.
</P>
<P>
   Two additional series touted as more heat-tolerant have joined
the pack, Bingo and Baby Bingo. Bingo cultivars produce 3 1/2-inch
blooms in 14 colors, including some great shades of blue and rose.
The Baby Bingos, like the Bingos, are 8 inches in height and 6-8
inches in width but produce 2- to 2 1/2-inch flowers available in
six colors, including `Sky Blue,' `Denim' and a mix.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AWAIT COOL TEMPERATURES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When summer devastates our gardens, it is tempting to pop
pansies into the ground before temperatures cool. Those planted in
early September can fizzle, so late October and November are better
times to add these annuals to the landscape. Expect blooms to poop
out sometime in May.
</P>
<P>
   Nurseries are filled with flats of pansies. Select colors that
suit your garden. Purchase healthy, stocky plants with dark green
leaves. Take home budded plants rather than those in full bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Pansies like sun. Morning sun and some afternoon shade is ideal.
A rich, well-draining, loose soil enriched with organic matter will
help ensure longer enjoyment. Work a little blood meal into the
soil when planting. Water and mulch. Boost blooms with monthly
applications of a balanced fertilizer. Remove spent blossoms and
any leggy stems to encourage more flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Pansies are cold-hardy and need a frost cover only when
temperatures dip to the low 20s.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PANSIES FROM SEED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most gardeners will pick up flats of pansies at their favorite
nursery, but some grow the cool-season annual from seed. Cool
darkness is needed for germination. Ideal soil temperature for
germination is 60-65 degrees. Sow seeds one-eighth-inch deep in a
clean seed flat or individual containers filled with a soilless
germinating mix. Sprinkle the mix over the seed. Carefully water.
</P>
<P>
   Since pansy seed must have darkness to germinate, it is a good
idea to cover the seed flat with black plastic. Or cover with clear
kitchen wrap, then place damp newspapers on top of the wrap. Check
the moisture of the germination mix daily or at least every other
day. Do not let the mix dry out; mist to moisten.
</P>
<P>
   Germination usually occurs in 10 to 20 days. Once tiny sprouts
are visible, permanently remove the plastic/newspaper. Move the
seedlings to a cool area where there is bright light. Transplant
when seedlings have two sets of leaves. Move to a cool, sunny spot.
Apply a diluted water soluble fertilizer.

WHAT A DIFFERENCE 10 YEARS MAKE IN CONDUCTOR'S CAREER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CHARLES WARD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When Kent Nagano made his Houston Symphony debut a
decade ago, he was a conductor on the rise. He returns this week
with a stellar reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, his career depended on things the best young conductors
do, such as being tapped to substitute for Boston Symphony
Orchestra conductor Seiji Ozawa in Mahler's Symphony No. 9 _ with
no rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Nagano gathers rave reviews, such as those for the
sensational Salzburg Festival performances of Olivier Messiaen's
only opera, ``St. Francois d'Assise,'' with his own ensemble, the
Halle Orchestra of Manchester, England.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Halle's performance of the Messiaen, a long, difficult and
complex score requiring exceptional stamina and concentration, was
of the highest order,'' commented Michael Kennedy in the online
version of the Telegraph of London.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see a virtually full Felsenreitschule (Salzburg's main
theater) audience on its feet at the end, shouting and stamping
approval, was thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagano anticipates projects such as next summer's production of
Ferruccio Busoni's opera ``Doktor Faust'' at Salzburg with the
Vienna Philharmonic and recording with the Berlin Philharmonic in
an ongoing relationship that began last season.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston he will join host Howard Pollock Friday for a Compaq
Casual Classics program and will conduct subscription series
concerts Saturday, Nov. 23. The program includes Franz Liszt's
``Mephisto Waltz'' from ``Faust,'' Felix Mendelssohn's Violin
Concerto (Tamaki Kawakubo, soloist) and Igor Stravinsky's
``Petrouchka.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nagano first conducted in Houston, he had just been
appointed music director of the Opera de Lyon in France, starting
with the 1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer he left that theater, which brought him attention
for excellent performances and imaginative projects, including the
EMI recording of Carlisle Floyd's opera ``Susannah'' with three top
American opera stars: soprano Cheryl Studer, tenor Jerry Hadley and
bass Samuel Ramey.
</P>
<P>
   Two reasons prompted the change, Nagano said by telephone from
Manchester. First, his work at Lyon was ``dream-driven,'' and he
felt he had realized almost all of the vision he had for the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   He also wanted to make more time for family: daughter Karin _ a
name both Japanese and European _ arrived Sept. 25. Heading both an
orchestra and an opera company ``didn't allow the environment in
which I wanted to raise a family.'' This year he will conduct no
operas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano was born Nov. 22, 1951, in Berkeley, Calif., where his
parents were graduate students at the University of California.
Before he turned 1, the family moved to Morro Bay, on the Pacific
coast north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There, he soaked up what today would be called a ``multicultural
upbringing,'' combining aspects of Japanese culture (learning to
play the koto, a string instrument), Western art music (from his
pianist mother and an ``exemplary'' elementary school music
program) and surfing, which he still does whenever he can (``a
wonderful way of entertaining yourself with nature'').
</P>
<P>
   While earning a master's degree in composition at San Francisco
State University, Nagano laid the foundations for a musical
relationship with the Berkeley Symphony. He became its music
director in 1978 and has headed it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   During his early years there he explored the music and forged
the contacts that have fueled his career.
</P>
<P>
   One focus was the music of Messiaen, the revered iconoclast of
French classical music from World War II on. In 1984, Messiaen
invited Nagano to assist Ozawa at the premiere of ``St. Francis of
Assisi'' at the Paris Opera. A year later, Nagano made his
explosive appearance with the Boston Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work we do (in Berkeley) is tied to the community,''
Nagano said.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano regularly premieres works by Bay Area composers. There
also is a strong emphasis on social and community concerns. ``The
ties between orchestra members and the community is very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagano notes that he grew up at the end of the political furor
that rocked the United States, particularly the San Francisco Bay
area, in the late 1960s and early '70s. He was engaged by them to
the point of earning undergraduate degrees in both music and
sociology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that an orchestra be part of a
community,'' he said. ``It's through that relationship that an
orchestra gets its own character.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, the emergence of the ``generic international''
orchestra, touted in many cities, is one of the ``saddest'' things
that has occurred recently. ``There's room for individual character
and expression. An orchestra should somehow reflect its
community.''
</P>
<P>
   In Manchester, for example, Nagano has been exploring English
music, one of the orchestra's traditions. That has led to a
recording of the original four-act version of Benjamin Britten's
``Peter Grimes,'' among other projects.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano's years in Europe have had an ironic result, though. More
and more he is aware that ``I will always feel like an American. I
must say that sensation is sort of surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagano has been principal conductor in Manchester, then music
director, since 1991. The orchestra plays in the 2-year-old
Bridgewater Hall _ which, acoustically, is considered one of the
best in England, he said. Touring ensembles arrange their
itineraries to include it.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the English orchestras, the Halle is closest structurally
to an American one.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, its name is the Halle Concerts Society, founded in
1858 by Sir Charles Halle, a political refugee from France who was
a close friend of composer Hector Berlioz.
</P>
<P>
   The society is ``more or less'' a private organization, Nagano
said. It receives less government money than most English ensembles
and thus has to raise more from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   As with many American orchestras, its existence has recently
been threatened by severe financial problems. They have been
stabilized but not solved, Nagano said.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a nice circle of association with Houston, the Halle
Orchestra is still closely identified with Sir John Barbirolli,
music director in Houston from 1961 to '67.
</P>
<P>
   Barbirolli took over the Halle in 1943 and remained its
conductor until his death in 1970. The orchestra still has 15
members who played for ``Sir John.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagano says he was not aware that the Houston Symphony was
searching for a music director when he accepted the concert here
this week. He liked his previous experience and is good friends
with Houston Symphony music director Christoph Eschenbach.
</P>
<P>
   Nagano is open to new challenges and expects one day to return
to the United States to head a major orchestra. For now, however,
he will only say, ``I am music director of the Halle Orchestra.'' &QL;

AFTER A DECADE, `A MAN IN FULL' WORTH THE LONG WAIT FOR WOLFE  
 
A MAN IN FULL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By Tom Wolfe 
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux 
$28.95. 
 
By FRITZ LANHAM 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much ballyhooed (author on cover of Time magazine), much
anticipated (10 years in the making), much printed (1.2 million
copies winging their way across the country), Tom Wolfe's ``A Man
in Full,'' the biggest novel of the season, has landed in stores
with the sort of decisive thud only a 742-page book can make.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see it jump to the top of the best-seller list. It
must also be considered the favorite to win the National Book Award
for fiction this week, an honor for which it was nominated even
before it was published.
</P>
<P>
   So is this really the novel you must read, if you read no other,
between now and Christmas? In short, yes. ``A Man in Full'' has its
flaws, but it more than lives up to the pre-pub hype. In a world of
novelistic miniatures, it's a big-wall tapestry.
</P>
<P>
   Real-estate tycoons, bankers, politicians, lawyers,
working-class stiffs, jailhouse thugs, cast-off matrons _ a long
laundry list of American social types marches through the multiple
narrative strands that make up ``A Man in Full.'' Racial conflict,
back-room politics, big-buck wheeling and dealing all figure in
this enormously entertaining book.
</P>
<P>
   What Wolfe does so brilliantly is portray people as defined by
their place in American society _ by how much money they have, how
big their houses are, what kind of clothes they wear, the color of
their skin, who does or doesn't defer to them _ and to delineate
the forces that hoist people up or pull them down the social
ladder. Internal forces like ambition, lust for power, class
anxieties. External forces like bosses, spouses, stupid business
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The main character in the ensemble cast is Charlie Croker, a
60-year-old Atlanta real-estate tycoon. Born, as he likes to say,
``below the gnat line'' in rural south Georgia, Croker first made a
name for himself as a football star at Georgia Tech. His gridiron
glories left him with a wrecked knee and an entre into the real
estate business.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing decades Croker built office towers, housing
developments, shopping centers. He became, in short, one of the
wheeler-dealer developers who helped transform Atlanta from a
sleepy Southern burg into a major American city.
</P>
<P>
   As a social type Croker is the familiar rich Southern good ol'
boy. His success has come less from brains than from raw ambition
and a will like a force of nature. Profane, arrogant, patronizing
at best toward blacks, homophobic, uncomprehending of all forms of
political correctness, he is happiest when tromping over his
29,000-acre quail-shooting plantation, entertaining city slickers
and playing the role of benevolent master to his retainers.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Charlie is on his second wife, having dumped his
spouse of 30 years in favor of a twentysomething muffin named
Serena. ``Boys with breasts'' is how his ex, the stoutish Martha,
describes the lithe, leggy, big-haired young women whom wealthy
older men like Charlie take as trophy wives.
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Man in Full'' is not about enjoying the view from the
top of the economic heap. It's about falling off the heap. It's
about the realization that ``life was anchored _ by nothing at
all'' as one character discovers in the midst of a literal
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Croker has gotten caught up in a speculative building
frenzy and now finds himself sitting in a mostly empty office
tower, ``a soaring monster he had megalomaniacally named Croker
Concourse.'' He also finds himself sitting on three-quarters of a
billion dollars of debt. To one Atlanta institution alone,
PlannersBanc, he owes $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   As the novel opens, PlannersBanc is putting the screws on
Charlie, and that involves reducing this prideful captain of
Southern commerce to an angry, frustrated, frightened old man. How
many other novelists could make a business meeting utterly
compelling for 20 pages? Wolfe does so in a long scene where
Charlie gets chewed up by the bank's aggressively unpleasant
``workout artiste,'' Harry Zale. (After finishing this chapter
you'll never think of ``saddlebags'' in the same way again.)
</P>
<P>
   Trying to perk up his financial picture, Charlie arbitrarily
orders a 15 percent personnel cut in his food distribution
business, which sets in motion another plot line.
</P>
<P>
   Among those laid off is Conrad Hensley, a 23-year-old husband
and father of two who has been humping heavy blocks of frozen food
in a Croker Global Foods warehouse in the working-class suburbs of
Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The son of shiftless Bay Area hippies, Conrad is a decent,
unexceptionable young man who wants nothing more than the bourgeois
comforts his parents so despise: a modest house in the suburbs, a
steady job, a ``Leave It to Beaver'' family.
</P>
<P>
   A job interview and a towed car precipitate an urbanite's
nightmare for the well-intentioned Conrad, the upshot of which is
that he ends up serving a sentence in the Santa Rita jail.
</P>
<P>
   Having depicted macho duels in the boardroom, Wolfe proves
equally persuasive in describing power plays inside a prison. The
long chapters in which Conrad fends off predators in Santa Rita are
as gritty and stomach-churning as any you're likely to read. The
jail is a Dante's ``Inferno'' of madmen and human animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``His world was now this lizard cage in a pod, which was gorged
with anger and testosterone,'' Conrad realizes. ``Everything boiled
down to the power of the brute, which was constantly expressed in
terms of sexual conquests.''
</P>
<P>
   Every 10 pages you'll feel like taking a shower.
</P>
<P>
   The third major plot strand deals with the explosive topic of
race. Georgia Tech's star running back, Fareek ``the Cannon''
Fanon, the product of Atlanta's harshest ghetto, is accused of
date-raping the daughter of a wealthy white businessman. The city's
black mayor recruits an upscale black lawyer, Roger White II
(nickname: ``Roger Too White''), to represent Fanon and put into
motion a back-channel scheme to help defuse this potentially
disastrous situation. Charlie Croker and his debt problem figure
largely in that scheme.
</P>
<P>
   With one foot in the white world, one in the black, and not at
home or entirely accepted in either, Roger White is the vehicle by
which Wolfe explores the pervasive anxieties about race in a city
where blacks have a majority of the population and hold political
power but where whites control the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth and lesser subplot involves Charlie Croker's ex-wife,
Martha, and a PlannersBanc loan officer with his own agenda. While
``A Man in Full'' is mainly a book about men, in Martha Wolfe draws
a sympathetic and persuasive portrait.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part Wolfe maintains a sort of Olympian
detachment from his characters, offering them up as specimens, with
all their foibles, their weaknesses, their occasional strengths.
The tone of the book is basically comic until the latter stages,
when it takes on a darker and more melodramatic hue.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the last quarter of the novel, in which Wolfe contrives
to bring together all four strands, is the least successful.
Suffice it to say that the philosophy of Epictetus (you know,
Epictetus, the first-century Stoic) serves as a major plot device.
Conrad's rebirth as a latter-day Roman simply doesn't seem
plausible.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``A Man in Full'' is always a hard book to put
down. Certainly part of the appeal is Wolfe's distinctive prose
style, with its finely observed details of appearance and behavior
embedded in language that tumbles down the page. Who can resist
this description of the rich Inman Armholster?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an odd-looking duck, Inman was. He was in his
mid-fifties but still had a head of thick black hair, which began
low on his forehead and was slicked back over his small round
skull. Everything about Inman was round. He seemed to be made of a
series of balls piled one atop the other. His buttery cheeks and
jowls seemed to rest, without benefit of a neck, upon the two balls
of fat that comprised his chest, which in turn rested upon a great
swollen paunch. Even his arms and legs, which looked much too
short, appeared to be made of spherical parts. The down-filled vest
he wore over his hunting khakis only made him look that much
rounder. Nevertheless, this ruddy pudge was chairman of Armaxco
Chemical and about as influential a businessman as existed in
Atlanta.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even more ambitious than Wolfe's first novel, ``The Bonfire of
the Vanities'' (1987), ``A Man in Full'' is acutely observed and
huge fun. &QL;

WHAT'S IN A NAME? PLENTY, IN SAN FRANCISCO'S NEIGHBORHOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Butchertown,'' an old area of slaughterhouses,
has been redeveloped. Gone too is Carville. And going fast is
Dogpatch as San Francisco remakes itself.
</P>
<P>
   As in any urban area undergoing change, redevelopment, real
estate's gilt-edged dreams, gentrification and whimsy are
conspiring to give new names to existing San Francisco
neighborhoods and to carve out new ones _ especially from the
downtrodden districts that people don't always want to be part of.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an amoeba. You can just watch the city create new
areas out of the old. Pretty soon we have a new city,'' said
historian Gladys Hansen, archivist at the San Francisco library for
47 years and now curator of the Museum of the City of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Mention Carville and many natives will draw a blank, although a
few enthusiasts are trying to keep the memory alive of the
oceanside colony built of used streetcars where 2,000 San
Franciscans lived at the turn of the century. Now the area south of
Golden Gate Park is known as the Outer Sunset.
</P>
<P>
   In Dogpatch, old-timers still love to describe the marauding dog
packs that supposedly gave the gritty eastern Potrero lowlands
their name _ not that they ever saw them. But now even the Hells
Angels clubhouse bears a pristine paint job and this is ``East
Potrero Hill'' to denizens of its new coffeehouse, ``New York-style
lofts'' and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Yet naming newly developing or redeveloping areas in booming San
Francisco is not always an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what to call the neighborhood _ part suburban-style
mall, part multimedia boomtown, part cafes and destination
restaurants _ emerging from the industrial wasteland of the
northeastern Mission District.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be just the Mission. Now, officially, it's the
Northeast Mission or NEMIZ, city-planning-speak for the Northeast
Mission Industrial Zone. But in the way of San Francisco
neighborhood names, something new is bound to stick. Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's good. Change keeps the city alive,'' Hansen said.
``But I'm not sure I like to see street names go or neighborhood
names go, because somewhere we have to leave a foundation for
people to understand what was. We are a transient city, but
newcomers don't realize it was ever anything other than what it is
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them to hang in for another 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The state of neighborhood confusion is far from new. In 1980,
Gerald Adams made a brave effort to impose order on the madness by
compiling ``A San Francisco Neighborhood Guide.'' In its
introduction, he wrote: ``San Francisco's neighborhood nomenclature
is a mess. It is confusing and inconsistent. Freeways have sliced
through districts. ... New subdivisions have grown up, bearing
names that befuddle old-timers. Neighborhood organizations have
invented new regional designations. ... City Hall, too, has
invented names and boundaries that never previously existed ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The resulting titles are so profuse that many people don't
know the name of their own neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate agents, who add to the problem by nudging property
into neighborhoods with more coveted addresses, admit to confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything with `heights,' of course, has status,'' said agent
Laura Taylor. The very unchic southeastern flank of the Bernal area
has become Bayshore Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Now when she tells clients she has a listing there, ``Everyone's
ears perk up,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants get in on the act, too, according to Max Kirkeberg, an
urban geographer at San Francisco State University.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses on Fillmore Street north of Geary use ``Upper
Fillmore'' to distinguish their stretch of posh shops from the
humbler blocks to the south, Kirkeberg said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a San Francisco tradition, going back to the 19th century,
when North Beach merchants wanted to disassociate themselves from
Chinatown. They dubbed their street ``Grant Avenue.''
Chinese-language signs along Grant still use the old name, Du Pont
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Where some neighborhood names come from is obvious: Japantown,
Chinatown, North Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for others have disappeared with time. Sometimes the
name stays anyway; other times a new one comes along.
</P>
<P>
   Long gone are the dairies that gave Cow Hollow its name. Just a
few blocks away, Washerwoman's Lagoon exists only in books like
Hansen's ``San Francisco Almanac.'' The large pond where women
washed their laundry in the 1850s has long been paved over and the
name evaporated into history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real estate is responsible for an awful lot of the names,''
Kirkeberg said. ``The Sunset in itself is a real estate name. It
really should be called `Fogbelt.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's fascinating and mysterious Little Hollywood. The
tidy enclave of turreted, white stucco homes with tiled roofs was
built in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound about the genesis of its name. Don Bertone,
president of the Little Hollywood Association, holds to a popular
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently the contractor built houses in Hollywood, and moved
north armed with the blueprints,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others think actress Mae West built Little Hollywood's largest
home when she was appearing at the 1939 world's fair on Treasure
Island. Still others think it was a secret haven for movie stars
when they were filming in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, in his neighborhood guide, said its developer may simply
have been copying ``pseudo-Spanish movietown architecture.''

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH _ DAY THREE
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529 was only a little
propeller-driven plane that fell in an obscure hayfield in west
Georgia: 10 people died, 19 survived. In terms of lives lost,
certainly it was not on scale with TWA Flight 800 and Swissair
Flight 111. More than 200 people died in each of those crashes. Yet
the ASA crash is writ large across many lives. Nearly two-thirds of
the people aboard survived _ a miracle gift _ and so this crash is
not only about death, but life.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reporter Gary M. Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from
Georgia to Maine to Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview
survivors of ASA Flight 529. He also canvassed investigative files
of the National Transportation Safety Board and testimony taken
during the ensuing litigation. Pomerantz vivdly describes the 9
minutes and 20 seconds of horror aboard that doomed aircraft as it
fell to earth, the fire that consumed the broken fuselage, as well
as how the tragedy has reshaped lives. This is the third day of the
seven-part series. WITH PHOTOS and ILLUSTRATIONS.
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-2NDCHANCE _ David McCorkell ran from the fuselage before
the flames set in. But images of suffering all across the hayfield
compelled the computer trainer from Minnesota to come back.
Circling closer, he heard first officer Matt Warmerdam's pleas for
help from inside the smoky cockpit. Warmerdam, trying to break
free, told McCorkell he didn't have enough room to swing his
hatchet. He passed the hatchet through a hole in the glass to
McCorkell and put his life in the hands of a man he did not know.
As McCorkell banged away, shards of glass flew into his hair and
face. Warmerdam pointed to show him where to hit. McCorkell's left
hand tired, so he switched the hatchet to his right. Black smoke
thickened as Warmerdam pressed his face to the hole, gasping for
air. Bit by bit, McCorkell widened the hole enough for Warmerdam to
stick out his head and one arm. McCorkell heard a loud pop
underneath the cockpit. A blast of heat shot at his legs, pushing
him back several steps. Scared, McCorkell wondered what to do.
``You aren't going to let me die, are you?'' Warmerdam cried out.

 &HT;    Online shopping this holiday season is projected to double from
1997, and the sky's the limit.
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let your fingers do the walking this holiday season. Why not
join the millions of shoppers doing their holiday shopping online?
Remember, in cyberspace there are no crowds, no lines, you can shop
at 4 in the morning or 11 at night, and you never have to worry
about finding a place to park.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce _ known to most consumers as online shopping
_ is rapidly becoming a booming business. Whether you're looking
for books, blue jeans, CDs or chocolates, there's a retailer online
to take your order, ring up the purchase and drop the goods at your
door.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll never have to pick up the telephone or see the inside
of a mall.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, online shopping has grown to meet the
needs of Web surfers who increasingly see the Internet as a
utility. The same users who turn to the Web for quick doses of
breaking news or financial information have come to see it as a
place to shop quickly. Purchasing a book on a site like Amazon.com
takes about 10 minutes or less for returning shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web sites offer ``one click ordering'' that lets you buy an
item, pay for it and log off in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Latour Kadison, a senior online research analyst with
Forrester Research who tracks online retailing trends, says a
handful of savvy retailers were responsible for moving Web shopping
into the mainstream. ``It took the minds of people like Jeff Bezos
at Amazon (http://
</P>
<P>
   www.amazon.com), Michael Dell at Dell Computer
(http://www.dell.com) and the two guys who started CDnow
(http://www.cdnow.com) (brothers Jason and Matthew Olim) to see the
Web is much more than just an information conduit.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest report from Jupiter Communications,
shoppers are expected to spend $2.3 billion online during the 1998
holiday shopping season, more than double the $1.1 billion spent in
1997. However, Jupiter also points out only 16 percent of online
purchases during this period are gift-related, leaving a largely
untapped revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online retailing got off to a very slow start because it was
these anonymous retailers (online-only stores unfamiliar to
consumers) trying to create a market. But when traditional
marketers like Tower Records (http://www.towerrecords.com), J. Crew
(http://www.jcrew.com) and Barnes &AMP; Noble (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .barnesandnoble.com) saw the value and the volume that could be
generated from online sales, it gave the industry a huge boost
forward,'' says Kadison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon was the leader,'' she says, ``and still is in terms of
online market share. But as access explodes in the next several
years and as all these newbies come online, they are going to look
for brands they know in their offline world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadison predicts Amazon, CDnow/N2K and other Web-only retailers
will have to work twice as hard to establish their brands offline
as traditional names set up shop on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Kadison says Web retailing has introduced a need for increased
speed and convenience. Surfers no longer want to wait for long
downloads or fumble through badly designed Web sites. They expect
slick, easy-to-use sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The utility that consumers are finding is convenience,'' she
says. ``That's the most important factor to online consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Vanderbilt, group director of Jupiter's digital commerce
group, says as the online shopping market matures, retailers will
shift their strategy from acquiring shoppers to building online
loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   She says the gift-giving season is an excellent time to foster
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online retailers have been successful in capturing dollars
consumers spend on themselves,'' she says. ``But they have been
unsuccessful in getting those same customers to spend gift dollars
online.'' She thinks services such as gift registries and other
holiday services such as gift wrapping might do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winners from the losers online will be separated by
excellent technology backing up your brand strategy,'' Kadison
says. ``The top three things shoppers want are convenience, ease of
research and competitive prices. As more and more familiar
retailers such as Land's End and Nordstrom come online, it becomes
more convenient for users, and the security fears go down because
of the reputations of these established brands.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Web is a way to do almost anything quickly
and efficiently, it's still a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Web is fun and utilitarian,'' says Kadison. ``You
can do your grocery shopping online and log off right away. But you
can also play games and do other things. It's absolutely both.
That's why the Internet is going to become such a huge part of our
lives in the next century, because it serves such a variety of
needs.''

TRAVELING PUTS FACES ON THE WORLD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As I surveyed the devastation and loss of human life caused by
Hurricane Mitch in Central America, my mind drifted away from the
pictures on the television screen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I saw the faces of children on a pier beside a cruise
ship at Roatan, Honduras, just last year. I saw them laughing,
crying, playing in youthful innocence.
</P>
<P>
   I saw the determination of a young woman as she swam with
dolphins and coaxed them into entertaining an audience.
</P>
<P>
   I saw the twinkle in the eyes of a guide as she convinced us to
abandon a structured tour _ one we surmised later she didn't know
exactly how to negotiate _ and instead offered an impromptu showing
of her favorite haunts.
</P>
<P>
   I saw despair in the shrug of an Honduran crew member who
stepped off our cruise ship knowing he had barely enough time for a
phone call, not a visit with his wife and kids on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Where were the children now? The dolphin trainer? The tour
guide? The crew member's family?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BAD NEWS AND MEMORIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many travelers have spent days and weeks vacationing on Roatan,
a renowned diving center in Honduras' hurricane-ravaged Bay
Islands. Others have lived and worked in more populated areas of
Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Some lost family members and
close friends in the recent disaster. Their images no doubt are
more profound than mine; I paused only for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   I don't even remember names. Still, I see their faces.
</P>
<P>
   I see the image, too, of a train conductor in Europe endeavoring
to communicate in limited English about U.S. politics and
entertainment. I've ridden the rails all over that continent, and
this past May I marveled at the efficiency of a new high-speed
express train in Germany. Three days later, an identical train _
maybe the same train _ on that route crashed, and 100 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   When we travel, the world ceases to exist as one vast, sterile
entity and we gain a closer perspective _ not always a complete or
even honest perspective, but a better understanding than for those
who stay home _ of individual cultures, histories, natural wonders,
public landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   And people. Especially people.
</P>
<P>
   And long after we return home, we are frequently moved. By
tragedy, yes. Also by happier events. Sometimes merely by our
memories.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SMILES AND TEARS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'll never erase _ never want to erase _ the image of a teen-age
soldier in South Korea who, assigned to the press barracks during
the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, broke down in tears while saying
goodbye to his American guests.
</P>
<P>
   He had no idea, the soldier confided, what perils lay ahead.
What risks his next assignment carried. He only knew that for a few
precious weeks, conflict had given way to forming new bonds of
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   I knew when I walked away to board a bus, to begin the long
journey home, that I would never see or hear from the young man
again. But whenever news reports are transmitted from Seoul, I
think of his kindnesses. His smile. His tears.
</P>
<P>
   I still hear, too, echoes of words sounded by Boris Morozov, a
guide who escorted me through the wondrous museums and parks of St.
Petersburg, Russia. His evolving homeland, Boris said wistfully,
appreciated democracy but didn't know how to handle it. But what
touched me most was when he said, ``As a nation, we have forgotten
how to smile.''
</P>
<P>
   When I read in the newspaper about the continuing economic and
political unrest in Russia, I can't help but wonder how long it
will be before Boris and others smile freely.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the faces I see in the rear-view mirror of my travels
remind me of pleasant experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, I still get a chuckle at reliving the time
the co-pilot and I, aware that the proprietor of a castle-hotel
along the Rhine River in Germany was a winemaker and avid
collector, decided to take him a bottle of Texas wine as a gift.
Today, our state produces fine wines; then, no. Or none that we
knew about. We purchased two bottles of the same vintage, opened
one the evening prior to departure and quickly spat out the foul
contents.
</P>
<P>
   Dare we take him the second bottle? He was, after all, a
collector. And it was unlikely he had ever seen Texas wine. I'll
never forget the glow when he accepted our gift and the pride
evidenced as he displayed this novelty to fellow vintners sitting
at the community table in the castle's dining room.
</P>
<P>
   And I still pray that he never opened that awful wine.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never forget, either, a woman in Lucerne, Switzerland _
Jessica Fletcher, we dubbed her, because she so closely resembled
Angela Lansbury of television's ``Murder She Wrote'' _ who served
as hostess at a small hotel restaurant frequented by locals, not
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to communicate verbally, we wrote down our request for a
reservation in German on a scrap of paper. Hours later, after
savoring a fabulous meal, we shook her hand in gratitude. And she
beamed.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, we returned, carrying the same piece of paper.
She arose from her seat, smiled and said, ``Houston, right?'' Do
you remember everyone, we asked? And in near-flawless English, she
responded, ``No, only the nice ones.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, when we paid yet another visit, Jessica was gone.
The restaurant now is part of a Best Western. The menu is printed
in English.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, relationships borne of our travels are more lasting.
Also in Lucerne, we met George, a restaurateur who introduced us to
fondue and raclette and Dole wine and warm Swiss hospitality. We
got to talking, and it turned out he has family ties in Galveston,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, George came to Houston. We introduced him to
Vietnamese crepes at Kim Son, Texas-raised quail and ostrich at the
Rotisserie for Beef and Bird and spicy fajitas at Casa Copilot.
</P>
<P>
   Then we sat together before the television and watched the
devastation in Honduras and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   And our great world seemed so small. &QL;

WHEN TOUR GOES WRONG, YOU LOSE MORE THAN TEMPER AND MONEY: YOU LOSE
TIME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: With sidebars TRAVEL-TOUR-SOURCES and TRAVEL-TOUR-OPTIONS) 
 
 
By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Workers pounded away on the bunkhouse as we stood, mouths agape,
inspecting our accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   We had been warned that the bunks weren't secured to the walls
(``Be careful when you climb in and out of bed''), but this
work-in-progress was to be our lodging for three nights. Hammering
heralded newly constructed stairs, and one man wrapped a cord
around the porch in lieu of railing. Walls were wide-gapped chicken
wire that came with assurances that there are no bugs on the Costa
Rican coast. Thin (but new) mattresses covered wide-slat bunks, and
sheets smelled of formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   Several yards away, another group of men banged away on the
``banos,'' which had everything one might need except towels and
soap.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Were we supposed to pack those?
</P>
<P>
   Rustic is not bad, but this was not the tour I had bought. So I
bailed.
</P>
<P>
   So did several others on the women-only tour, which had been
interesting if not fun for the first four days. By most reports,
the final three days were filled with rewarding activities, but
also repetitive meals, ogling workmen and chores not generally
associated with vacations. Nine women opted out of the itinerary by
the week's end.
</P>
<P>
   I was lucky. When my Costa Rican tour with Houston-based
Remarkable Journeys went in a direction not to my liking, I easily
secured lodging and finished out the rest of the tour days sitting
by a pool, sipping pina colodas and then retiring to an
air-conditioned beachfront room.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't lose a vacation day, and the newspaper picked up the
extra out-of-pocket expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Others were not so lucky (although Remarkable Journeys did offer
some reimbursement to participants who left the bunkhouse for a
motel).
</P>
<P>
   Group tours can be rewarding. I've tramped through Turkey,
island-hopped in Sweden and tracked penguins in Chile _ all in the
company of strangers. Each experience was unique, and my companions
were, with few exceptions, delightful.
</P>
<P>
   But when a tour goes wrong, you can lose more than your temper
and money. You lose valuable vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to avoid a bad group-tour experience is by doing
your homework before you book.
</P>
<P>
   First select your destination, then your tour. Knowing where you
want to go may point you to a tour operator.
</P>
<P>
   Melody Massey of Asian Pacific Journeys suggests finding tour
operators that specialize in the region in which you're interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specialists are more likely to have a more intimate knowledge
of the region as opposed to someone who goes all over the world,''
Massey says.
</P>
<P>
   Request brochures and catalogs from your travel agent or
directly from the tour operator. Many companies have Web sites that
either detail their trips and itineraries or allow you to request
written information.
</P>
<P>
   Then your real work begins.
</P>
<P>
   Study brochures and materials carefully. Ditto for Internet
information.
</P>
<P>
   As you read itineraries, keep in mind experiences that you
enjoyed on vacations past. Are activities appealing? Are they
cramming 14 attractions in three days? Is this something the entire
family would enjoy?
</P>
<P>
   Look for clues in the details. If a packing checklist includes
items such as toilet paper or towels, it may be a hint of things to
come _ good and bad. Does the word ``opportunity'' appear often? It
is a classic signal for ``you'll pay extra to ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Make a list of questions as you go and plan to ``interview''
several companies before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   A travel agent can answer many of your questions, but often
travelers book directly with tour operators.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, you will speak to a tour counselor or
coordinator. (That's tour-speak for salesperson.) Begin by asking
the tour coordinator whether he has personally taken the trip in
which you're interested. Don't hesitate to ask someone who has
taken the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Then let the questioning begin. Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   Who does this tour attract in terms of age, sex and marital
status?
</P>
<P>
   Are families welcome? Are there age restrictions?
</P>
<P>
   Which meals are included in the tour price? Are meals arranged,
or can you order off the menu?
</P>
<P>
   What are the accommodations?
</P>
<P>
   Is there time built into the itinerary for shopping or sleeping
late?
</P>
<P>
   How much time will be spent aboard a van, bus, boat or plane?
</P>
<P>
   Are optional activities offered, and at what price?
</P>
<P>
   Is air fare to the trip's starting point included? If not, can
the company book a competitive air fare?
</P>
<P>
   A focus of your scrutiny should be the guide or guides. These
are the folks who can make or break your vacation. Ask whether
local guides are used. How much experience does the guide have with
this company?
</P>
<P>
   And you should not be the only person asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   According to Asian Pacific Journeys' Massey, a good tour
operator will also question you.
</P>
<P>
   The operator's questions will pinpoint your travel history (Have
you ever been to a Third World country?), your vacation goals (Do
you want to see Paris and London in a week?) and your travel style
(camping or castle?).
</P>
<P>
   So be frank about your travel experience, fitness level and
comfort requirements, and be open to suggestions. Tour operators
know the guides as well as the idiosyncrasies and challenges of
each itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people have their heart set on a destination.
They've read about it. Heard about it. And they can't be
dissuaded,'' says guide Nancy Landau, who co-founded Remarkable
Journeys.
</P>
<P>
   That can be a problem for tour operators, says Landau, adding
that some would-be participants are reluctant to admit to physical
ailments. She cited a recent incident in which a client hid a heart
condition until midway through a strenuous trekking tour, when she
began having health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you should ask the tour company for references. Most
keep lists of past clients who are willing to share their
experiences. Don't be surprised if all the reports are glowing
since they compile these lists from post-trip surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company is hesitant to refer you to a past customer,''
Massey says, ``that's a sign that there may be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if you did your homework and your tour still
goes haywire?
</P>
<P>
   First, remain calm. Ranters and ravers rarely get satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated travel columnist and the American Society of Travel
Agents' consumer advocate Ed Perkins advises approaching the guide
or tour representative with the problem, an appropriate solution
and a deadline for correcting the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be polite but firm,'' Perkins says.
</P>
<P>
   Landau suggests that if you are unhappy with the way a tour is
progressing that you first speak privately to the guide.
</P>
<P>
   There are some problems that generally can be addressed during a
tour. A roommate swap may be a ``cause celebre.'' A diet request
can be fulfilled. Even the pacing of a tour often can be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Guides can be creative, Landau assures.
</P>
<P>
   If the problem or problems cannot be corrected, then you have a
decision to make, Perkins says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My strong advice is to decide, is the problem so bad that it's
going to make me miserable, or can I live with it?'' Perkins says.
``If it is something that is going to ruin your entire vacation,
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not stay, even if you don't have coverage. Make your own
arrangements and leave. Then demand full repayment or a refund when
you return.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems I see is that if you stay with the tour,
the company is able to say later that `it can't be so bad if you
stayed with it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Write down details about incidents, discussions with the guide
and results of these meetings. If others on the tour are
dissatisfied or witnessed problems, jot down their names, a
statement and contact numbers.
</P>
<P>
   When you return home, take your complaints to your travel agent
first.
</P>
<P>
   If you did not book through an agent, contact the tour operator
directly. Keep copies of all your correspondence and contact the
Better Business Bureau in the city where the tour company is based.
</P>
<P>
   Another agency that may help resolving disputes is ASTA. Its
consumer affairs department, unique to the travel industry,
mediates disputes between consumers and its 26,500 members. Contact
the organization by calling 703-739-2782, or accessing its Web site
at www.ASTAnet.com.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, Perkins says, take the tour company to small
claims court.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Perkins says, it's difficult to recoup a bad
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mistake that many people make is to be concerned about the
costs of a bad trip,'' Perkins says. ``Money is replaceable, but it
is their lost time that cannot be compensated.'' &QL;

GROUP-TOUR FIRMS CATER TO THE SPECIAL INTERESTS OF CLIENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Glossy brochures and Internet sites describe hundreds of
group-tour experiences. Some companies, such as Globus, Cosmos,
Trafalgar, Maupintour and Tauck, appeal to a wide range of
travelers. Others target specific interests.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tours that caught our eye:
</P>
<P>
   Few corners of the globe are not visited by Abercrombie &AMP; Kent.
Its escorted luxury holidays feature tantalizing names such as
``Wings Over Tanzania,'' ``The Great Switzerland Express'' and
``Splendors of Andalucia.'' Specialties include walking tours and
cruises.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;K began as a safari outfitter in 1962, so consider its ``East
African Hemingway'' tour. This 15-day itinerary touts the best game
viewing in Kenya and Tanzania. Days are spent on game drives in
Amboseli National Park, Serengeti National Park and Masai Mara
National Reserve. Evening accommodations are in luxury lodges or
splendidly appointed tent camps.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is $7,960 per person (double occupancy) and covers lodging,
all meals, game viewing and guides. International and internal air
fare is not included.

ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE: like to have. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We have to work a little harder and we have a little less
flexibility,'' said Chanik, a former Top Gun fighter instructor.
``If we lose people due to emergencies, it will stretch us. We do
not have depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every department on the ship absorbed some of those
losses. But senior officers and enlisted people say the shortage is
most acute among the people who launch and recover the aircraft and
those who operate the nuclear reactors in the bowels of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flight deck and the power plants are inherently demanding
environments that require 100 percent of a person's mental
attention every moment,'' said Randy Hardin, a Longview native who
is the ship's ranking enlisted officer. ``We have to watch our
people close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise's flight deck covers 4.5 acres, which seems more
than big enough until the 78 Navy and Marine Corps planes assigned
to the ship start landing, taking off and taxiing _ all at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   There are a hundred ways to die _ getting blown off the ship,
sucked into a jet's intake, tripped up by cables, cut by propellers
or just plain crashing into the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath those multimillion-dollar aircraft, in the wake of
their jet exhaust and in the numbing 30-knot winds of November, is
the flight deck crew, a color-coordinated cluster of shirtsin
shades of yellow, green, purple, brown, blue and red.
</P>
<P>
   For the dangers of the job, they are paid an extra $150 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Tim King, a native of Denton, Texas, wears a green shirt, the
uniform of the team that works the catapult system that launches
the aircraft and the arresting gear that brings them to a sudden
stop. He is 30, 10 years older than most of the other guys who work
the arresting gear with him, a workaholic who would like to make a
career of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   There are 25 sailors working with King, at least 10 fewer than
on the Enterprise's last Mediterranean deployment, in summer 1996.
Less than a year ago, there were only 17 sailors, the bare minimum
to staff the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighteen hours is a good day,'' King said one morning before
flight operations. ``If we just worked the 12 hours they fly, it
would be easy. But we've got maintenance to do, cleanup to do, and
we've got to get the equipment ready to go for the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinkston, who supervises the green shirts on board, would like
to have another 30 sailors, so his people could work shifts, so
they wouldn't have to eat cold sandwiches on the job, so they don't
get so fatigued that they make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You even have to make exceptions with discipline problems,''
he said. ``You find yourself more willing to overlook little stuff
because you can't spare the people.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Even with its shortages, the Enterprise is as fully staffed and
ready to go as any ship in the Navy, because ships sent to the
world's hot spots have the highest priorities for people, parts and
money.
</P>
<P>
   The ship and its air wing spent months this summer and fall
working up to the deployment and received more training than what
the last two carriers headed to the Persian Gulf received, Chanik
said.
</P>
<P>
   But commanders, both active and recently retired, said that
because of the shortfalls in people and funding, many sailors and
pilots aren't joining deploying carriers in time to reap the
benefits of that training.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 8 nighttime collision of an S-3 submarine hunter and an
EA-6B radar-jamming aircraft on the flight deck is under
investigation. A spokesman for the naval air forces with the
Atlantic fleet said there is no indication that the accident was a
result of manpower or training shortages.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of current and former Navy officers say rushed
training can lead to accidents. The Navy's accident rate reached an
all-time low in fiscal 1997, at 1.3 serious accidents per 100,000
hours flown. But by the end of the 1998 fiscal year, the rate had
climbed to 2.3 serious accidents, a 77 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just take an aviator out of the training command,
put him in the cockpit and then expect him to perform at peak
efficiency under a high-demand workload,'' said retired Vice Adm.
Richard C. Allen, the former commander of naval air forces in the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time. One could equate it to race-car driving. If you
take somebody off the street and put them in the Daytona 500, he
probably isn't going to do too well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise's relative readiness also means that the ships
and air wings not on deployment must make do with even less,
according to Navy officials, several of whom described the
situation as ``robbing Peter to pay Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   Two recently retired fighter pilots who now work at Lockheed
Martin in Fort Worth, Chuck Hunter and Don Beaufait, said squadrons
not deploying are ``cannibalized'' for units going to sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys in the squadrons at home are undermanned,
underplaned, short on flight hours and fuel and things to do,''
said Hunter, a former F-14 pilot and the current president of Fort
Worth's Navy League. ``The morale in those units falls out pretty
quick.''
</P>
<P>
   But throwing billions more dollars into the Pentagon's budget
won't necessarily help the troops' readiness, according to retired
Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, deputy director of the Center for Defense
Information, a nonprofit group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He says that part of the readiness problem is a result of a
military and a Congress still structured around fighting a
Sovietlike enemy, and he contends that Iraq, North Korea and Libya
hardly qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have well over 200,000 people overseas all the time, and
that's expensive,'' Carroll said. ``If the services were permitted
to restructure and shape themselves for the world we have today,
which is largely humanitarian and peacekeeping duties, we would be
more than ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has ordered the Pentagon to more closely track
readiness issues and determine the most pressing categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the American people want us to compromise our
national security,'' Granger said. ``We've balanced the budget and
said, `Look what we've done,' but a lot of those cuts were in
defense. I think we've got to re-prioritize.''

NAVY LOSING PERSONNEL AS SAILORS LURED BY GOOD CIVILIAN JOBS, HOME
LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: As U.S. forces remain poised for a military
strike against Iraq, the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise is
steaming toward the Persian Gulf region. A Fort Worth Star-Telegram
reporter and photographer were aboard the carrier as it left
Norfolk, Va., on Nov. 6. This is the second part of their report.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE _ Brian Hogan stood on the hangar deck
in his dungarees as the ship shuddered away from Virginia, finally
and fully aware that he was going to sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy had given Hogan, a lean and quiet 22-year-old from
Granbury, 11 days' notice that it wanted him on the carrier USS
Enterprise for the next six months. He had been back from another
six-month tour exactly one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just now hit me,'' he said later that morning from his
workshop beneath the flight deck. ``I wasn't really ready for this,
but it's my job so I'll make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan has been in the Navy just over three years and is highly
skilled in the maintenance of F-14 Tomcats. He is destined for
promotion. The problem for the Navy, and for the Army and the Air
Force, is that people like Hogan haven't been sticking around.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of better money and benefits in the civilian world,
coupled with far less time away from family and home, has led to
serious shortages in the military, from low-level sailors and
soldiers to top-level pilots and submariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask people for dedication, yet the payback that they want
in return _ pay, benefits, time off from deployments _ isn't
there,'' said retired Vice Adm. Richard C. Allen, president of the
Association of Naval Aviation. ``People ask themselves, `Why am I
doing this? I'm loyal to my country, I like what I do, but I'm
beating myself up, especially when there's a good economy on the
other side.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Navy missed its recruiting mark by 7,000 sailors
_ 13 percent of its goal. It also retained only 30 percent of its
first-term sailors and officers and 46 percent of its more
experienced people, well below the service's objectives.
</P>
<P>
   That shortfall has translated to the ships, where about 90
percent of the fleet jobs are filled, compared with about 98
percent just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy also finds itself dozens of pilots short, a problem
that will likely lead to less experience in leadership positions in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has perhaps the most difficult recruiting task among
the armed services because it requires extended sea duty. But the
number of Air Force pilots has been declining and is now short by
about 800. The Army, too, fell short of its goal in the infantry
and has had to accept more people without high school diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise, which steamed out of its home port in Norfolk,
Va., on Nov. 6 for six months in the Persian Gulf and the
Mediterranean Sea, left with 4,550 sailors, Marines and officers,
about 400 fewer than the Navy wanted.
</P>
<P>
   On board were a handful of North Texans, young men who joined to
get out of a small town, to learn a trade, to see the world. But
they highlight the Navy's troubles with retaining its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get out and get a job as an electrician,'' said Pat
Foley, a 24-year-old native of Arlington, Texas, who repairs
electrical systems aboard the ship. ``Maybe I'll finish up
school.''
</P>
<P>
   His former classmate at Arlington High, Corey Hooks, joined the
Navy on a six-year enlistment because he knew he wasn't ready for
college.
</P>
<P>
   He has been trained in medicine and works as a technician in the
Enterprise's tiny operating room, helping the doctors repair
hernias, remove appendixes, and stitch up heads and fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job as a surgical tech, but I would much rather do
it outside the Navy,'' Hooks said. ``There's a price to pay: long
work hours, sleepless nights, goofy uniforms, mushy food.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailors such as Hogan, Foley and 21-year-old Anthony Russell, a
native of Waxahachie, Texas, who works in aviation maintenance,
said they enjoy visiting ports in Spain and the south of France and
learning job skills.
</P>
<P>
   And none of them complained about the pay, which for a junior
sailor averages $20,000 to $24,000 a year. For a person in the
senior enlisted ranks, pay is in the range of mid- to upper $30,000
a year and for a midlevel officer it approaches $60,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the young sailors seemed to find few reasons to make the
Navy a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the guys say the Navy screws you, but I can't
complain about it,'' Russell said. ``We signed up to do it. It's
not forever. You can walk away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy commanders are aware that pay, retirement benefits, time
away from home _ even the frequency of port calls _ become
significant issues when sailors are deciding whether to re-enlist.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has tried to stem the tide by offering thousands of
dollars in bonuses to sailors and officers who re-enlist, adding
700 recruiters and increasing its advertising budget.
</P>
<P>
   Congress gave military personnel a 3.6 percent pay raise this
year but has thus far not funded one of the military's biggest
concerns: raising retirement to 50 percent of active-duty pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who work the hardest have their mind set on 20
years,'' said Tim King, a Denton native who works on the flight
deck and intends to make a career of the service. ``They need to do
something to make people want to retire from the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   For pilots, who have been offered bonuses of close to $100,000
for staying in another four to five years, money is not as much a
factor, said Capt. Evan Chanik, the ship's commander and an F-14
Tomcat pilot. Their frustrations stem more from a reduction in
challenging flying missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best things we can do is keep them flying,'' Chanik
said. ``That's why they're there. It's up to us to do that for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But little may change if Congress continues to push money into
weapons systems rather than people, according to retired Rear Adm.
Eugene Carroll, a former carrier commander and now a deputy
director with the Center for Defense Information, a nonprofit group
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is trip-wired at the procurement phase,'' Carroll
said. ``Buy airplanes, buy missiles, buy ships. ... That's where
the political rewards are. ... Readiness is people. You can have
all the wonderful hardware in the world, but you've got to have the
people to operate and maintain them.''

RAIL CRISIS FAILS TO APPEAR AS GRAIN EXPORTS SLUMP OFFSETS DOMESTIC
DEMANDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ At Thanksgiving, railroads can say a special
prayer of thanks that a widely predicted disaster in the grain belt
didn't happen this year.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the 1997 corn, wheat and soybean crops still in
storage and a bumper '98 crop looming, railroads began issuing dire
warnings last summer that big movements of grain as the harvest
moved north from Texas could swamp the already congested railroad
system west of the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the Titanic missed the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Export demand for U.S. agricultural production has fallen,
particularly in Asia where meat consumption has been reduced in
response to economic woes. This has kept prices low for wheat, corn
and soybeans. Domestic processors, in turn, have taken advantage of
the low prices to place full orders.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been, for the railroads at least, the best of all
worlds. Grain shipments are up slightly from the depressed levels
of a year ago. That is enough to keep their grain car fleets busy _
and making money _ without choking their track and yard networks.
</P>
<P>
   When Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway and Union Pacific
Railroad issued their warnings last summer, shippers didn't need
much bad news to become jumpy. Union Pacific Railroad has taken a
full year to overcome major congestion on its system in southern
Texas and at California ports, as it struggles to put together its
$5.4 billion merger with Southern Pacific Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fort Worth-based Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway,
which has avoided the excesses of congestion that beset rival UP,
has acknowledged that its on-time and other performance indicators
still aren't where they should be. In response, federal regulators
announced this year that they would be paying attention to harvest
flows more closely than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a normal harvest, but, for now, we're in good shape
on cars,'' said Steven Bobb, vice president for agricultural
commodities for Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Bobb says that although BNSF's fleet of 40,000 grain cars has
stayed busy this fall, he is still able to provide cars for
shippers who need them through next month.
</P>
<P>
   That's better than the normal boom-bust scenario that railroads
usually face at harvest time. Either they have huge grain movements
that leave them short of cars and anger shippers and politicians,
or they lack shipments and have grain cars sitting unprofitably
idle.
</P>
<P>
   Bobb's counterpart at Union Pacific, Diane Knutson, says,
``We're pretty much in sync. The export market is still thin but
we're having good demand from domestic processors. Meanwhile,
farmers aren't using rail cars for storage as much as feared, so
the capacity has been freed up. Our movements have been pretty
steady.''
</P>
<P>
   For UP and BNSF, grain ranks third behind intermodel freight and
coal among major commodity groups. Trouble is, although coal and
manufactured goods move on a fairly smooth, year-around basis,
grain moves in response to price. Over the last two decades,
railroads have tried all kinds of marketing and contractual
incentives to try to smooth out movements, with only middling
success.
</P>
<P>
   On the grain storage side, manager Brice McCree of Farmland
Industries' huge complex at Saginaw just north of Fort Worth says
that his elevators now have room for about 30 percent more
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were about 100 percent capacity last summer during the
wheat harvest, but we have room now,'' McCree said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland anticipated the current storage glut by reopening one
of its Saginaw elevators that had been closed since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   What had worried forecasters was the fact that due to low
prices, relatively little grain moved during the 1997 harvest.
Added to that carryover, as agriculture specialists call it, has
been a bumper crop this year.
</P>
<P>
   Texas wheat production was expected to come in at no more than
100 million bushels. Final totals are now expected to top 140
million bushels. Other big wheat producers _ Oklahoma, Colorado,
Kansas and Nebraska _ will check in with similar increases.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, wheat prices have persistently stayed below $3
per bushel this year. Elected officials campaigning in
grain-producing states this fall spent more time than they wished
discussing the latest farm belt ``crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   In good years, such as 1995 and 1996, exports provide a crucial
kick to the grain markets. But such exports haven't been there for
the last 18 months, because principal U.S. rivals in worldwide
grain markets _ Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Australia, Europe and
China _ have also had bumper crops and flooded the markets with
subsidized grain.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. markets got two small pieces of good news in the last week
with word first that the United States will send Russia 3.1 million
metric tons of wheat to alleviate food shortages there, plus an
announcement by Brazil that it will open its markets again to U.S.
wheat.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. shipments will get a boost, but nobody is anticipating a
deluge of exports similar to the legendary Russian grain shipments
of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, things can change quickly in international markets. A
weakening of the U.S. dollar and a desire to keep open old lines of
supply and perhaps some short crops in other countries next year
could quickly bring back the good old days of '95 and '96 for
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still could face a very tight situation if everybody wanted
to ship at the same time,'' UP's Knutson said.
</P>

   _ The female condom is catching on in Asia and Africa, but
American women find it unacceptable. (300 words)

endlessly. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NUTS-NUTRITION (Undated) _ People who ate more than five
ounces of nuts a week, slightly less than the rough equivalent of
one airline packet a day, had one-third fewer heart attacks than

GOING GAGA OVER `RUGRATS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ About halfway through their first feature film,
Tommy, Chuckie, Angelica and the rest of the Rugrats gang are
hurtling through the woods in a special souped-up toy car when they
burst through a clearing to find ... Bambi and Thumper. The
out-of-control car just keeps plowing ahead, scattering Disney's
cute little forest animals in its wake and delivering the not-so
subtle message that there's a new cartoon franchise on the block
and, even though it's still in its infancy, it isn't afraid to take
on the elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a respectful feeling for the great animation that
Disney has done,'' says Norton Virgien, who has won two Emmys for
his directing work on the ``Rugrats'' television series and
co-directs ``The Rugrats Movie'' with Igor Kovalyov.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we also think it's a shame that too many animators ape the
Disney look, whether it's the style of animation or the type of
storytelling or the inclusion of Broadway-style songs. We've never
done that, and I think it has a lot to do with the success we've
had. We've taken all the proven formulas and thrown them out the
window in order to create something unique and different.''
</P>
<P>
   And prosperous. ``Rugrats,'' which airs on Nickelodeon 19 times
a week, is the No. 1 children's show on cable television and one of
cable's most popular programs with adults, too. (One-third of the
``Rugrats'' audience is believed to be over 18, mostly parents who
voluntarily watch with their kids.) Last Tuesday night's
Thanksgiving episode earned the highest ratings in Nickelodeon's
history with 3.7 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Not content to rule just one medium, ``Rugrats'' began a daily
comic strip several months ago and has launched a stage show that
has been playing to sold-out arenas across the country. (It's due
in the Southland next March.) A broad merchandising campaign, begun
two years ago with Kids ``R'' Us stores, has put the ``Rugrats''
kids on clothes and toothbrushes, Band-Aids and backpacks. And with
the movie arriving in theaters Friday, those goofy (and, let's
admit it, somewhat grotesque) little ``Rugrat'' faces only figure
to become more ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   About the movie: It has been in the works for two years, but,
say ``Rugrats'' creators Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo, the film is
really the culmination of nearly two decades of animation work, not
to mention their own marriage and two children.
</P>
<P>
   The couple (now divorced) launched Klasky Csupo in a spare room
of their Hollywood apartment in 1982. The company, now on Highland
Avenue in Hollywood, currently employs 270 people and produces
``Duckman,'' ``Santa Bugito,'' ``Ahhh! Real Monsters'' and the
recently premiered ``The Wild Thornberries.'' They have ideas for
several live-action feature films, too, and with a lucrative,
near-exclusive deal with Viacom, figure on flooding movie theaters
with their work in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show the world that we can do movies as
successfully as TV shows,'' says the Hungarian-born Csupo. ``With
movies, you have more time and can make every frame just the way
you want it. You can't breathe in television because you've got to
get it on the air. It's push, push, push so you can make your
deadline. Hopefully, this movie will be successful and they'll give
us the freedom to make a few more.''
</P>
<P>
   He needn't worry. Paramount (owned by Viacom) has already
ordered a sequel, figuring the film has a built-in audience
guaranteed by the popularity of the show. It's a low-risk gamble
(the movie cost $25 million, inexpensive by current animation
standards) considering the fact that kids love the Nickelodeon
brand name nearly as much as they do Disney's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the Rugrats are more popular than Mickey Mouse or
Bugs Bunny,'' says Nickelodeon president Albie Hecht. ``They're
animated icons for the 21st century and reflect the kids-first
philosophy of our network. Kids know that Nickelodeon is their
channel and the Rugrats are a big part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way. When ``Rugrats'' premiered as part of
Nickelodeon's Sunday lineup in 1991 (``Ren &AMP; Stimpy'' _ remember
them? _ was another Nick program), kids liked the show, but that's
where it ended. There were no products, no stories, no awards. The
network stopped production of ``Rugrats'' after four years and then
started running the 65 episodes during the week, both in morning
and evening time slots. Ratings doubled and a cultural phenomenon
was born.
</P>
<P>
   Kids seem to love the ``Rugrats'' because the show's plots
revolve around topics that interest and concern them _ bad dreams,
going to the doctor for a shot, potty training among others.
Another appeal comes from the Rugrats themselves, talking babies
who can easily be appreciated by youngsters. There's the heroic
1-year-old Tommy, his scaredy-cat 2-year-old buddy Chuckie,
identical twins Phil and Lil, and the bratty 3-year-old Angelica,
who often makes life miserable (``You stupid babies!) for all
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has had an Angelica in their lives,'' says Cheryl
Chase, the actress who gives the tyrannical tot her voice. ``Kids
see her tormenting poor Tommy and Chuckie and they can empathize.
But she also tells it like it is, which makes her popular with
viewers. It's kind of a love-hate thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of yin-yang dynamic courses throughout the ``Rugrats''
world. The stories have happy endings without being syrupy sweet.
The parents are dim, but loving. The kids are kind of cute, but
they'd never win any beauty contests. (``Tommy is a spoof on all
little balding babies,'' Csupo says.) The music, composed by Devo
founder Mark Mothersbaugh (Crack that whip!), appeals to kids and
to those whose tastes run toward ambient and industrial sounds.
</P>
<P>
   And while the writers occasionally throw adult viewers a
sophisticated line or two, most of the jokes are still firmly
grounded in poopy references.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything too out there, we would give to `Duckman,''' Klasky
says, referring to her company's more adult-oriented animated
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie'' follows according to form. Tommy Pickles
gets a new baby brother and while the parents cope with wacky
hospitals (``Oh, Mrs. Pickles, you weren't due till next week.
Well, I guess we could try and squeeze you in somewhere'') and
birthing techniques, Tommy must deal with the mixed emotions that
come with a new sibling. Ultimately, Tommy and friends decide to
take Baby Dil (Dil Pickles, get it?) back to the ``hop-sickle,''
and on the way they get lost in a dark and scary forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone can see the Rugrats free on TV, so we thought we had
to give the audience something bigger and grander,'' says
co-director Virgien. ``And that's not easy when the characters
can't walk. But I think we do a pretty good job at delivering
adventure while exploring some pretty serious emotional issues like
sibling rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial cut of the film might have been a little too
serious. After too many children started crying during test
screenings, Virgien and the filmmakers went back and toned down
some of the scary scenes in the forest to keep the sniffles at a
minimum. But, Virgien says, the changes were altogether pretty
minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to keep some kind of edge so the movie would have an
across-the-board appeal,'' Virgien says. ``You look at a movie like
`The Lion King.' The father lion dies, but it's part of a lesson
which is mixed in with a lot of fun. We do the same thing, but with
a Rugrats sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means that more than one diaper gets dirty before the
whole thing is over.

 &HT;    E-shopping's easy, can be fun
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you've seen the packed parking lots at the mall, you're sick
of staring at the piles of catalogs cluttering your kitchen table
and you've decided that electronic shopping is the only way to go.
Trouble is, you've never shopped online before. Fear not first-time
shoppers: If e-shopping was hard or scary, nobody would do it and
you wouldn't be able to order Gap sweat shirts online.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need much to hop on the e-shopping bandwagon, besides
a computer, a modem and an Internet browser.
</P>
<P>
   It's always smart to do a little Web comparison shopping to make
sure you're getting the best value for your money. Sites such as
Junglee (http://www.junglee.com) and BottomDollar
(http://www.bottomdollar.com) will be able to tell you which Web
shops are selling the object of your desire at the lowest price.
Many portal sites such as Hot

RISK-PHOBIC STUDIOS HAVE BEEN RECYLING USED PLOTS FOR DECADES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent article by Peter Bart in Variety suggested that the
current crop of remakes comes from a generation that, backstroking
in its own lack of imagination, is merely enjoying the wealth of
art that previous generations turned out.
</P>
<P>
   This is a provocative concept, although it does sound a bit
crotchety. For, aside from such current films as the Brad
Pitt-fueled ``Meet Joe Black,'' a remake of ``Death Takes a
Holiday,'' or the upcoming ``Psycho,'' remakes have been the way
studios have done business for years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the finest movies ever to come from an American director,
``The Maltese Falcon,'' had been tested twice before John Huston
was given a chance to make it _ and make it his own.
</P>
<P>
   Churning out new versions of old movies was simply a way of
maximizing the money invested in something a studio had already
purchased. The studios were happy to bang out sequels _ long before
there was a ``Major League 3: Back to the Minors'' or ``Air Bud
2,'' there were the Andy Hardy movies, or, on a much higher level
of achievement, the quite enjoyable ``Thin Man'' series. (The James
Bond movies go so far back that there are kids who think they
started on radio.) No one can pretend such base motives are new to
the American cinematheque.
</P>
<P>
   Remakes of old movies serve as cultural comfort food, a steaming
plate of mashed potatoes and meatloaf. Even the imminent new
edition of Alfred Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' by director Gus Van Sant
(''Good Will Hunting,'' ``Drugstore Cowboy'') is meant to reduce
audiences into murmuring a satisfied ``ahhh.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how terrifying it looks _ and there's an eye-popping
poster with what looks like a victim trying to push her way out of
a shower curtain that's almost 3-D _ ``Psycho'' is out to elicit a
guaranteed response. Van Sant's film is a shot-by-shot remake,
using the original script.
</P>
<P>
   (Not that Hitchcock himself was above remakes. He took two
swings at ``The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' and if you've seen either,
you know it wasn't the kind of thing that needed to be done until
he finally got it right.)
</P>
<P>
   If the upcoming ``You've Got Mail'' looks familiar to you,
that's because it's a remake. Not just a remake of ``Sleepless in
Seattle,'' an excuse to keep Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan apart in
another gummy-sweet romantic comedy, but a remake of a beautifully
constructed little comedy called ``The Shop Around the Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   (''Sleepless in Seattle'' wound itself around ``An Affair to
Remember,'' itself remade as ``Love Affair,'' with Warren Beatty
and Annette Bening.) There's nothing new about taking a proven idea
and trying to run with it. Still, ``You've Got Mail'' is so
familiar that several people have asked me if it's a sequel to
``Sleepless.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what Variety's Bart was trying to get at is that such
cultural sampling has become a way of life. Major signposts such as
``Star Wars,'' with its plethora of quotes from other films, can be
like the history of the action picture reduced to a flip book.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason the ``Star Wars'' pictures, or the ``Indiana
Jones'' movies, work so well is that the creators have shown such
cunning in plundering bits from other movies and weaving them into
something for new audiences. (That's also why it's funny that a
young Steven Spielberg thought a ``Jaws'' sequel was beneath him,
but now he may be trying to figure out a way to get Harrison Ford
into a walker for another ``Indiana Jones'' film.)
</P>
<P>
   Even when movies aren't called remakes, they're taking material
that's so well-known it's like they're employing shared cultural
knowledge as a technique. And so, studio executives are now out to
turn what is basically an educated gamble _ moviemaking _ into a
science.
</P>
<P>
   The sequel is a de facto remake, a vain attempt to reboot the
``magic'' that brought a hit in the past, although it many cases _
the ``Batman'' series, for example _ it's like someone making a
living by cranking out third-generation Xeroxes of a product that
didn't make anyone that happy in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, every other Touchstone movie was a slightly
altered version of some sappy, bland French comedy, like ``Three
Men and a Baby.'' And when a second-rate ripoff of a lame French
genre picture merits _ to use the term loosely _ a sequel, you feel
like you're taking the escalator right down to the ninth circle.
(Not just Disney stooped to lifting from the French. ``True Lies''
was taken from ``La Totale.'' And ``Home Alone'' is so close to a
little-seen French picture, albeit a horror film, that the studio
may have had to pay off its creator.)
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   No one gets too upset over the umpteenth ``Island of Dr.
Moreau'' or ``Zorro,'' which date to the silents and have been
served up so often they're like a film version of fast food. One
more hamburger joint won't kill anybody, and a tastier brand of
cheeseburger may result. But when remakes start tampering with our
memories, smudging our feelings about originals, things start to
get uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Many movie-lovers have strong feelings about ``Psycho''; oddly
enough, even people who haven't seen it feel like it belongs to
them. ``Psycho'' actually leans toward torpor, which is why the
shower sequence is so shocking _ it leaps from the sluggishness to
catch you off guard. Maybe it's because we've come to consider
movies art, so that when a great movie like ``Shop Around the
Corner'' is made anew, it's like having a favorite painting tagged
by graffiti artists.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases _ ``Godzilla,'' for instance _ we may ask, What's
to deface? We may also wonder why somebody would bother to remake a
movie that worked because of a specific theme _ post-World War II
fear of nuclear power _ that has no modern correlative. So the
undercurrent, which resonated even with viewers who laughed at the
first ``Godzilla,'' and its guy in the lizard suit crushing
cardboard buildings in murky black and white, is thrown out. What's
left is merely annoying.
</P>
<P>
   There are cases in which the remakes work on their own. ``High
Society'' was a lively musical version of ``The Philadelphia
Story'' with the cooled-out chemistry of Frank Sinatra and Bing
Crosby giving it a life of its own. ``The Magnificent Seven'' was a
lean, All-American twist on Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece ``Seven
Samurai.''
</P>
<P>
   The western seems to be done best as a remake. Clint Eastwood
wouldn't have a career if Sergio Leone hadn't turned Kurosawa's
``Yojimbo'' into the Man with No Name and ``A Fistful of Dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything that gets a crowd into a theater is fair game. There is
some truth to the sense that the movie business takes its lead from
those old Holiday Inn commercials, in which the motto was ``The
best surprise is no surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brest, who started his career making fluky little movies
such as ``Going in Style'' and ``Hot Tomorrows,'' or even the
lively ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' seems to be ending it by inflating
minor old pictures. He first accomplished this with a remake of a
little-league Italian weeper, ``Scent of a Woman,'' and he's now
turning to American archives with his update of ``Death Takes a
Holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Fredric March looking sleek in a
deco-styled tuxedo, ``Death'' isn't much of a movie. Brest may have
the best idea. Take movies that are little-known, or not very good,
and try to bring something new to the mix. Although I wonder if
half the fun for the studios is the outrage they create when a
beloved old standard is brought up for possible remake, and the
first name you hear is that of Christian Slater ...
</P>
<P>

`MOESHA' SHINES AS A SITCOM WITH SUBTLETY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four seasons in, ``Moesha'' has gone through its share of
directional tinkering, the most recent being the switch in academic
settings for its heroine, portrayed by the current IT girl, Brandy
Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   This change was monitored with great interest because it was
around the end of the second season that UPN suits began dropping
hints to creator/producers Sara V. Finney and Vida Spears that
``Moesha'' was a fine show with decent ratings, but it wasn't
luring the broadest of constituents. In other words, not enough
white viewers to satisfy advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   So last season, Brandy's Mo was sent packing to a largely white
private high school, where the show's coming-of-age story lines
about class, family and peer acceptance was played out before a
more integrated cast. Mo clicked with a white character, Fort
Worth's Dru Mouser as a rather convincing hip rich chick. As for
the overall result, well, I've got the feeling that everyone, from
the writers to the actors, was doing something they didn't want to
do, which manifested in a series of clunky, uneven episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moesha'' (airing Tuesday nights) made it through without much
damage; the worst dis I heard from a disgruntled reader was when
she called it ``nothing but a black `Blossom.' The sister's gone
suburban.''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't go that far. But the comedy about a teen-age girl,
her overprotective father, wiseacre little brother and circle of
neck-wiggling cronies no longer moved along seamlessly and
confidently. To keep the core group intact, for instance, Mo had to
venture back and forth from school to the diner where she'd hang
tough with Hakeem (Lamont Bentley), Niecy (Shar Jackson) and Kim
(Countess Vaughn), funny loudmouths relegated to whiners moaning
about their friend's betrayal to the other side of the racial
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by last year's Nielsen Research numbers, ``Moesha's''
core audience didn't fade, and those new converts never showed up.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Mo was back at her old Crenshaw High with nary a
word about the private school failure, wasting little time in
helping ``Moesha'' regain its footing as TV's most underappreciated
_ and certainly unknown _ situation comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away in the netherworld of UPN and constantly creamed by
predators like The WB's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' Fox's ``King
of the Hill'' and CBS' ``JAG,'' ``Moesha'' will never experience
the kind of surge enjoyed by CBS' ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' what
with its network's promotion dollars, solid time slot, and TV
critics who'd bet their paychecks on its fall-off-your-chair humor.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Yuk for yuk, ``Moesha'' doesn't compete on ``Raymond's''
level. But those who watch can't deny that it's deeper. It is, in
fact, the rarest of comedies: a standard-issue coming-of-age sitcom
that executes its premise in the most subtle ways imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran writers Finney and Spears dreamed up ``Moesha'' to tap
into a long-ignored TV gold mine: the mind of a black teen-age
girl. But they needed an experienced ``name'' to be taken seriously
(much the way Chris Rock helped put ``The Hughleys'' on ABC). In
stepped Ralph Farquhar, a tall, bearded, mid-40ish Chicagoan with a
black activist mentality but a solid track record with shows as
white bread as ``Married ... With Children'' and ``Happy Days.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, he'd produced ``South Central,'' the dramatic
comedy about the daily struggles of a financially strapped black
family. Detractors labeled its honest portrayals of poverty too
depressing for network TV, and Fox agreed, yanking the series after
only 13 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   I'm convinced that ``Moesha'' is Farquhar's ``South Central''
compromise, discreetly disguised to fit TV's norms.
</P>
<P>
   Mo's family lives in a middle-class world; Dad (William Allen
Young) owns a car dealership and mom (Sheryl Lee Ralph) is an
educator. They own their own home and obviously have enough
disposable income to send Mo off to that pricey private school.
</P>
<P>
   Farquhar kept the family in a South Central neighborhood that is
demographically and culturally made up of blacks and Hispanics.
Leimert Park is a real middle-class black community that many of
the writers (''Moesha'' is one of the few black-oriented shows to
have a predominately black writing staff) frequent socially.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Moesha'' is perhaps the only black sitcom on TV to
consistently acknowledge a full range of African-American and
Hispanic lives _ all social and economic classes are represented,
and episodes haven't been afraid to show how and why they eye each
other with suspicion, sympathy and solidarity. The series is
unapologetically ethnic, dropping black slang and delivering the
kind of cultural references that should be spoon-fed to Middle
America but isn't.
</P>
<P>
   But the series' most innovative contribution is how the
struggles of the lead character remain universal, perhaps the most
effective testament to a medium that can't seem to understand that
people of color face similar fears and experience the same joys. Mo
routinely asks: What college should I attend? Does he love me? Is
my father whack?
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, I watched Mo fall for her handsome male
teacher (it was far more believable than that ``Dawson's Creek''
plot line), and in Tuesday's episode, a date-rape attempt sets up a
more engaging Nov. 24 edition about Mo's virginity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is where ``Moesha' is helped most by its voice-over
device used to open and close each episode. We're privy to Mo's
thoughts _ eloquent but well within the capability of the bright
teen-ager Brandy portrays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we were all once strangers, is there a point in the
journey where we stop being one and become the other?'' she asks,
talking about love. ``I know I desire him. If he feels the same, is
that real love? And when will I know it?''
</P>
<P>
   Now I'll admit that ``Moesha,'' like so much of television, can
often offer contrived situations. But its underlying vow to present
a realistic vision of young America is both admirable and sincere.

WHERE HIGH TECH MEETS OLD-FASHIONED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Look to the city of the future and you're likely
to see compact, pedestrian-friendly communities of digital artisans
working where they live _ in a place that looks a lot more like the
villages of the pre-industrial past than it does some mildly
modified version of postwar suburban-now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronics and architecture are coming together to make a new
type of hybrid setting,'' said William Mitchell, dean of MIT's
school of architecture and planning and author of ``City of Bits:
Space, Place and the Infobahn.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as surely as networks of canals shaped Venice, and networks
of trolleys and then highways shaped Los Angeles, Mitchell said,
the new virtual networks of high-speed communication will reshape
cities in the future.
</P>
<P>
   It's already happening in businesses such as bookstores, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A traditional bookstore is confined to the bricks and mortar
that enclose it, and by its operating hours. A person must
physically visit and then faces relatively limited choices of 5,000
to 50,000 titles.
</P>
<P>
   But online equivalents such as amazon.com aren't bound by those
strictures. Customers can shop 24 hours a day, from anywhere in the
world, and choose from more than 1 million titles at competitive
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Such virtual companies still need a physical place to process
orders and handle transactions, creating what Mitchell calls ``an
electronic front and an architectural back.''
</P>
<P>
   With high-speed communications networks headed to ubiquity,
Mitchell said many kinds of home-based businesses will flourish,
changing lifestyles and housing design, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see the reinvention of the pre-industrial home, where
the merchant lived above the shop,'' Mitchell said. ``Neighborhoods
will be densely intermingled urban space. The post-industrial city
will reinvent some of the focus of the pre-industrial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New urbanists'' say communities that are pedestrian-friendly,
with lunch places, dry cleaners, copying centers and other nearby
basic services, will flourish with the new digital artisans they
will accommodate and attract.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some developers are beginning to design communities
that make such lifestyles possible, said Tom Horan, director of the
Claremont Graduate School Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In western Riverside County, a planned 6,500-home project called
Liberty in Lake Elsinore aims to link all the residences with each
other, both in the virtual and real worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The homes _ each with the front porches and promenade-minded
sidewalks right out of small-town nostalgia _ are grouped in
``villages'' clustered around a small, pedestrian-oriented town
center, said Horan, who is co-producing a PBS documentary on such
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Each house would be linked by a high-speed fiber-optic phone
line that carries voice, data, video and other information, linking
the community's residents to each other, community organizations
and the Internet beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept level is to have innovative use of technology to
promote community,'' Horan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brea Cottages development in north Orange County uses the
same approach, clustering cozy housing around small yards in a
development close to nearby shops and theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't large lawns for everybody,'' Horan said. ``You
increase the density, put porches on the street, alleys in the back
for cars. You urban-design to create life on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Both communities repudiate the postwar suburban planning model,
which walled neighborhoods off from commercial areas, unwittingly
encouraged urban sprawl and physical isolation, while forcing
residents to drive everywhere for anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the traditional commuter cities, there's been a division of
function between the bedroom cities and downtown jobs,'' Mitchell
said. That gradually will change as more workers commute by
high-speed communications networks instead of highways and rail
lines.
</P>
<P>
   The massive, controversial Playa Vista development just south of
Marina del Rey in Los Angeles also would use technology to create a
very different living and working space, Horan said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for linking housing to the huge communications
network that will be installed in the area to support commercial
operations such as the DreamWorks SKG movie studio, Horan said.
</P>
<P>
   That will allow digital artisans _ such as film editors,
screenwriters and musicians _ to work from their homes, swapping
data back and forth with employers by high-speed modems, then walk
to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Such a lifestyle would be enormously attractive to a large swath
of Los Angeles professionals, many of whom already work largely out
of their homes in the entertainment business, Horan said.
</P>
<P>
   But what's unclear is whether communications networks and
networked communities will tie people together or isolate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the (heavy use of) electronic media could very well
result in more demand for face-to-face contact, not less,'' Horan
said. He admits that people could all become ``wandering electronic
nomads unable to deal with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But that demand for what futurist John Naisbitt called ``high
touch'' in a high-tech world probably means entertainment gathering
spots such as Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, Pasadena's Old
Town and Universal City's CityWalk should flourish in the coming
age, Horan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the initial concern was that we would all be at home
with laptops, the data suggest there will be new and interesting
combinations happening,'' said Horan.

IS THE WIRED WORLD READY FOR REAL LIFE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For those less than sanguine about the
implications a wired world holds for the concept of community, take
heart. Some experts say it'll be a long time before the online
world is anywhere near as compelling as real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distance between surfing the Web and experiencing real
life is chasmic,'' said Michael Benedikt, director of the Center
for American Architecture and Design at the University of Texas.
``I'm talking the Grand Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a three-dimensional online world, as is now being made
available in some sites, Benedikt said, ``You're seeing what people
want you to see. You can click to your heart's content, but the
poverty of that information is stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Burns, who heads the interactive telecommunications program
at New York University, is scornful of chat-oriented environments,
such as Active Worlds or the Palace, that attempt to create online
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like a party or going to a singles bar,'' Burns
said. ``I've found it very superficial and irritating. It's not
just a gender issue, but it may be an age issue. And why 3-D is
used (in those environments), I'll never understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Coco Fusco, a Temple University teacher, writer and performance
artist, said such frustrations are common among people who think
online communities are ``just rehearsing for real behavior that may
never be used in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burns' complaints almost miss the point. Sometimes, poor
technology doesn't mean a poor community.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Internet pioneer Tim Dorcey, who helped create the
video-conferencing software CU-SeeMe in 1992 at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   Dorcey recently created a much more powerful successor called
iVisit, but people have been unwilling to abandon their CU-SeeMe
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's surprised us is how hard it us to get people to leave
that behind,'' Dorcey said.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just CU-SeeMe that has proven vital and persistent.
Such text-based online communities as multi-user dungeons (MUDS),
mailing lists and the Well online service have thrived despite
using dinosaur technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love e-mail and listservs (automated mailing lists dedicated
to specific subjects); they're a great way to communicate,'' Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
   But she hastened to add, ``It's also important to experiment. I
may be disparaging about many of these efforts, but it's become
more and more apparent that (online communities are) very
personal.''

WHEN HARMLESS HERBS BECOME DEADLY DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C.)   (af)  
 By NANCY BETH JACKSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gardeners know valerian as a hardy perennial with fernlike
leaves and pinkish white flowers considered excellent for cutting.
Herbalists value its carrot-shaped root, which some call nature's
valium, believing it delivers relief for a variety of complaints
like shingles and menstrual cramps, even though it smells like
dirty socks.
</P>
<P>
   But for a 58-year-old North Carolina heart patient, one of a
growing number of consumers who combine such ``natural'' products
with prescription drugs, the self-administered treatment led to
unexpected cardiac complications and delirium after a surgical
biopsy of a lung nodule.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was not that he had taken valerian, but that he had
stopped. Unexpected withdrawal symptoms put him in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   The patient survived _ and no longer takes valerian for
sleeplessness.
</P>
<P>
   Like prescription drugs, herbal products act as chemicals in the
body and may cause the same kinds of side effects, withdrawal
symptoms and interactions, warn the doctors who linked the heart
patient's crisis to valerian.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't think of herbs as medicines,'' said Dr.
P. Murali Doraiswamy of the Duke University Medical Center.
``People have a tendency not to attribute complications to herbal
products. They are going to put the blame on prescriptions instead,
but you don't know what combinations might be dangerous in herbal
medicines. They haven't been tested.''
</P>
<P>
   Doraiswamy is one of three Duke physicians who wrote a letter,
appearing in the Nov. 11 issue of Journal of the American Medical
Association, documenting the case. They urge that patients tell
their doctors when they are taking herbal products, and that
physicians ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some doctors don't like the question, because it opens a
Pandora's box they don't know how to deal with,'' Doraiswamy said.
``No medical school in this country offered herbal medicine courses
until a few years ago, and there's no Physicians' Desk Reference
for herbal products.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbal remedies are increasingly popular. The current issue of
the Archives of Family Medicine offers a review of 12 commonly used
medicinal herbs and points out that more than one-third of
Americans use herbs for health reasons but often lack information
about their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Doraiswamy, the grandson of a doctor in India, grew up in a
culture where patients expected to combine conventional and herbal
treatments. But these days, he said, when he wants to know about
herbal products he goes to the Internet, where he does a broad
search and then ``evaluates the information skeptically.''
</P>
<P>
   A Web search for data on widely used valerian reveals everything
from botanical information to order forms. One site says valerian
is ``one of the best herbal tranquilizers and muscle relaxants the
plant kingdom has to offer,'' but warns that if taken regularly in
tea, capsule or extract form, it can cause mild depression in some
people.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the site, viewers can find everything from claims
that it is ``nature's answer to stress'' to warnings that it can
cause vomiting, stupor and dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Doraiswamy points out that valerian is not the only herb with
possible side effects _ chamomile, commonly taken as a calming tea,
causes hives in some people; licorice can cause hypertension. But
herbal remedies still have a place. After all, Doraiswamy said, he
grew up on ginger, an old sailors' remedy for vomiting and nausea.
Now, it is finding new applications among cancer and AIDS patients.

CHAIN STORES GET MIXED RECEPTION IN CITY CENTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ When Andrew Stoloff opened the Red Tractor
Cafe on College Avenue in Oakland's eclectic Rockridge area, the
neighborhood welcomed the addition but with a bit of apprehension.
It looked too clean. Too coordinated. A little too established.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would walk in and say, `Is this a chain?' And they
would say it sort of suspiciously,'' said Stoloff, who estimated he
heard the comment about 20 times a day following the opening in
February 1996 of his first restaurant. ``I didn't know whether to
be flattered or insulted.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoloff had designed the company to become a chain, and has
since opened his second restaurant in San Jose. To avoid the
negative ``chain'' perception, however, Stoloff scrapped some of
his plans for the Rockridge restaurant. He kept employees in jeans
and T-shirts rather than switching to overalls and chose not to
ring a bell signaling orders that were ready to serve.
</P>
<P>
   The reactions Stoloff received, even before opening his second
location, show just how unwelcome chain stores have become in parts
of the San Francisco Bay area, primarily in thriving commercial
neighborhoods in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Often faced with bitter local opposition, more companies are
trying to ``unchain'' themselves, doing whatever they can to seem
less like a corporate entity and more like a part of the
neighborhood. That may mean redesigning the look, customizing
merchandise, giving individual store managers more control or
getting involved in local philanthropic activities.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between neighborhoods and chain stores has heated up
recently. Earlier this month, San Francisco's planning commission
rejected a bid by Borders Inc. to build a 20,000-square-foot store
amid Union Street's smaller shops. Neighborhood residents and
merchants had protested the proposal, and the commissioners ruled
the plan was out of scale with the area.
</P>
<P>
   Retail consultants say trying to blend into a neighborhood is
one way chain stores can resolve some of the ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of chains are driving around and looking at the
independent mom-and-pops,'' said Robert Gibbs, a retail consultant
from Birmingham, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs said some companies are making stores look a little more
cluttered and nostalgic, scaling down corporate logos and building
free-standing, two-story stores that look less like a typical mall.
In some cities, zoning laws also have forced companies to scale
down their projects and signs.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 1,800 outlets worldwide, Seattle-based Starbucks
Coffee Co. has become synonymous with chain store, but it is still
held up by retail and design experts as an example of a company
that tries to adapt each store to its location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in terms of their signage and architecture, they
really like to fit in the neighborhood,'' said Peter Katz, an
Oakland-based author and consultant on urban issues who advocates
revitalization of city centers.
</P>
<P>
   To Katz, what's most onerous about chain operations is the type
of buildings the companies create. He said they often build stores
that do not fit into a neighborhood or that are designed for a
single use, such as a fast-food restaurant with a drive-through
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with chain stores is not the businesses themselves
but the box they come wrapped in,'' he said. ``Neighborhood
activists are trying to regulate the wrong thing. You can regulate
the form of the box, but to say a national chain store can't come
into a neighborhood is discriminatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood activists and many independent merchants say the
problem with the chains goes much deeper than just their
architecture. In addition to destroying local charm, opponents
complain the stores have economic advantages that smaller stores do
not.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants scoff at the proliferation of Gap stores and
Starbucks, accusing them of turning local distinctive charm and
character into bland homogenization. The chains are accused of
raising rents, pushing out competitors, being unconcerned about the
neighborhood and sending profits outside the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an economic war. Except they're the ones with the
bazookas, and we're the ones with the pea shooters,'' said Laurel
Norris, owner of a crafts store in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the debate agree that an entire
neighborhood or downtown made up of cookie-cutter stores is bad for
any community. Every area needs a healthy dose of local, home-grown
shops to distinguish itself from other neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Retail consultants point out that chains can have the positive
effect of jump-starting a sluggish shopping district and force
independents to increase their hours and update their image and
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of neighborhood opposition, customers are patronizing
the chain stores. These stores do well for the same reason that
McDonald's and Burger King prevail: Serving products designed for
the masses, they are efficient, affordable, convenient and visitors
from other areas know what they are getting.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, shoppers still have an inconsistent love-hate
relationship with the chain operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People very much dislike the idea of shopping at a chain,''
said Gibbs, yet his surveys show customers score chain stores high
on quality, service, price and selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love everything about the store except that it's a
chain,'' Gibbs said. ``They're worried that 200 million other
Americans are wearing the same chino khakis.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs has a formula he says is an ideal tenant mix for a
downtown: a third national chains, a third locally owned or
regional chains, and a third independent stores. He said that mix
can vary depending on the neighborhood, but that it generally
provides residents with a strong economic base.
</P>
<P>
   Katz disagrees with any formulaic approach, saying the free
market will establish the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't show me a single Main Street in America that is 100
percent chains. It is a self-correcting phenomenon,'' he said.

GORE ANNOUNCES NEW U.S. AID FOR ASIAN ECONOMIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Vice President Al Gore announced new
aid from Washington for stricken Asian economies Monday but warned
that the United States cannot be the dumping ground for the
struggling continent's flood of exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make one point crystal clear,'' Gore told business
leaders gathered for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum, ``the United States cannot be the importer of only resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not spell out what the Clinton administration might do
to stem increasingly high levels of goods from abroad or get other
rich nations to take a bigger share of products from Asia. Gore
indicated, however, that the White House was concerned there might
be a resurgence of anti-import fever in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, in this global economy, protectionism will only
protect us from prosperity itself,'' Gore said in a speech that was
to have been delivered by President Clinton, who remained in
Washington to deal with the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Gore announced $3 billion in trade financing from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank _ $1 million each for Indonesia, South Korea and
Thailand, three of the countries hardest hit by the 16-month-old
Asian economic crisis. And he said the U.S. Overseas Private
Investment Corp. will provide $2 billion in insurance and financing
for new private investment in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi also announced
in their capitals an additional program of aid from the two nations
as well as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank with an
initial price tag of up to $8 billion. The primary purpose is to
stabilize banks in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore participates Tuesday in APEC summit activities and holds
one-on-one meetings with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
and South Korean Prime Minister Kim Dae Jung. On Monday, shortly
after his 20-hour flight from Washington, the vice president met
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Thai Prime Minister Likphai
Chuan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech to the APEC Business Summit covered not only
economic issues but a challenge that he said ``surpasses all the
others'' _ the need for additional democracy in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president alluded to the most dramatic government shift
wrought by the Asian economic crisis, the resignation in June of
Indonesian President Suharto, and indicated such changes could not
be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, among nations suffering economic crises, we continue
to hear calls for democracy,'' Gore said. He cited the calls of
dissidents, including the cry of ``reformasi'' (or ``reforms``)
used by opponents of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who
was seated immediately in front of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear (the calls) today _ right here, right now _ among the
brave people of Malaysia,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The pointed reference to the host nation's internal turmoil
did not sit well with the Malaysian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most disgusting speech I have ever heard in my
life,'' Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz told reporters. ``That is a
direct interference in the domestic affairs of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir has urged visiting leaders not to get involved in what
he has said are Indonesia's affairs. Gore has earlier spoken out
against the apparent physical abuse by police of former Malaysian
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is on trial for corruption
and sodomy after a falling out with Mahathir over economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said Gore did not plan to visit with
Anwar's wife, who conferred Sunday night with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Gore was not attempting to be confrontational
with his remarks about Malaysia but added, ``The reason the theme
of democracy is there so forcefully is that it's one of the central
cores of a healthy social and economic system.''
</P>
<P>
   APEC leaders are focusing on the continuing fallout from the
Asian economic crisis, and Gore said that the United States has
great sympathy for the problem and admiration for stringent steps
some nations have take toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expanded trade is a cornerstone of economic recovery,'' Gore
said, but ``we must take great care to ensure that what began as a
global financial crisis does not become a global trade crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge you to consider what has happened to Asian exports to
America,'' Gore said. ``They have gone up dramatically. And other
major industrial economies have not absorbed nearly as much.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have pointed out repeatedly during briefings
surrounding APEC that while U.S. imports from Asia have risen
quickly during the economic crisis that the rate of imports from
the rest of Asia into Japan has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All developed countries _ whether in Asia, Europe or the
Americas _ must play a role and keep tearing down trade barriers,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore devoted a major section of his remarks to renewing the
Clinton administration's call for strong action from Japan to
invigorate its sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region cannot recover without Japan boldly and strongly
leading the way,'' Gore said. Japan's economy is the second-largest
in the world and accounts for more than two-thirds of Asia's total
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made no mention of the $196 billion economic stimulus
package announced Monday in Tokyo by Prime Minister Obuchi. The
proposal, including tax cuts, massive spending on public works and
government-issue shopping vouchers for the elderly and families
with children, was the largest ever for Japan and came only seven
months after a $139 billion package that was judged insufficient by
analysts and has had no significant effect on kick-starting the
Japanese economy.

 &HT;    Doctoring Ourselves: Time ($2.95) explores Americans' obsession
with herbal medicine
 &HT;    Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vanity Fair ($3.95) calls it the 1998 Hall of Fame, but perhaps
one of the inductees needs to be in the Hall of Shame. Among the 19
men and women featured in photographs by Annie Leibovitz and others
are Mark McGwire, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, Tom Wolfe, John
Glenn and Monica Lewinsky. Yes, Monica Lewinsky. Writer James
Wolcott justifies the former White House intern's inclusion this
way: ``Disown her as we may, disparage her as we might, she belongs
to all of us now (we're stuck with her).'' It also may have helped
that Vanity Fair already had pictures in hand from the Herb Ritts
photography shoot last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the magazine is as entertaining as usual. Zoe Heller
profiles Ewan McGregor, who soon will be seen as the young Obi-Wan
Kenobi in the ``Star Wars'' prequel; Dominick Dunne pays tribute to
the late Roddy McDowall; and Renata Adler presents the case against
Kenneth Starr while Christopher Hitchens does the same for Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MEET THE JEFFERSONS: The recent revelations about Thomas
Jefferson and his child, Eston, by his slave Sally Hemings has
thrown the spotlight on the issue of ``passing'' for white. Two of
Hemings' other children, Thomas and Madison, chose to live in black
communities, while Eston lived as a white man. ``Though we consider
it a gift of God, our one enduring question is why Madison chose to
stay black when it might have been easier to live as white,''
descendant Shay Bank-Young tells Time ($2.95) correspondent Tamala
Edwards. Robert Golden, Thomas' great-great-great grandson, says
some blacks would be black at home and white at work. ``You would
have neighbors,'' he says, ``but when you saw them downtown at the
job, you knew not to speak to them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  OPRAH'S DREAMS: Perhaps it's just a coincidence, but the
writer that Oprah Winfrey talks to about her life and times in
Essence ($2.75) is also the writer she selected for her book club.
Pearl Cleage, author of ``What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary
Day,'' interviews Winfrey about what she learned in her struggle to
make the film ``Beloved,'' and her TV show's new focus on changing
lives.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SUPERCARS: From Detroit to Munich to Tokyo, auto manufacturers
are speeding toward the goal of creating the car of the future. In
a Newsweek ($2.95) cover story, Daniel McGinn and Adam Rogers give
us a preview of what we may be driving in the next millennium.
Experts say we will see the hybrid-electric vehicles like Toyota's
Prius, which runs on a combination of engines and batteries.
Eventually, those cars will be replaced by vehicles that run on
pollution-free fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MONEY AND POLITICS: Where's J.P. Morgan when we need him? In
this week's New Yorker ($3), Jean Strouse describes how the
financier intervened to prevent an economic meltdown in 1907.
Summoning New York's major money men in the midst of a stock market
crash, Morgan managed to raise enough money to shore up shaky
institutions. This was not entirely a patriotic gesture, Strouse
writes. Morgan and his colleagues stood to lose millions of dollars
if the country slid into a long depression. Elsewhere in the
magazine, Joe (``Primary Colors'') Klein dissects the turbulent
political scene in Washington and decides that the constant
prosecutions and investigations ``may be more damaging to the
country's political future than any of the charges that have been
brought.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  BOOM CITIES: Looking for the best place to make your fortune?
P.O.V. ($2.95) lists Seattle, Wash., and Austin, Texas, as the two
best cities for young business types to strike it rich. Atlanta
ranks No. 9 primarily because of its low cost of living, says
Christopher Kraus, 25. The Georgia Tech dropout is the founder of a
multimillion-dollar company called Internet Security Systems.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SPIRITUAL MATTERS: According to recent polls, 96 percent of
Americans believe in God. But what do we see when we think of God?
Life ($3.99) tries to answer that question in an essay by Frank
McCourt, author of ``Angela's Ashes.'' McCourt, who was raised a
Catholic, explains that he does not confine himself to the faith of
his fathers anymore. ``All the religions are spread before me, a
great spiritual smorgasbord, and I'll help myself, thank you.''

<P>
   By the time the earth collides with a dense swarm of meteoroids
Tuesday night to unleash what may be the heaviest meteor
bombardment since 1966, many orbiting satellites will have
maneuvered into positions facing away from the storm to avoid
damage.
</P>
<P>
   But scores of instruments on the ground and aboard airplanes
will be aimed right at the blazing trails left by the meteors,
gathering information about these visitors from space and what they
do to the upper atmosphere as they burn up.
</P>
<P>
   Astrophysicists, atmospheric scientists and others have been
readying their experiments for a year or more in preparation for
Tuesday night's expected Leonid Meteor storm, so named because the
meteors appear to be coming from the direction of the constellation
Leo. The meteors are fragments, most of them microscopic in size,
of Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Although the earth encounters Leonid meteors every year on about
this date, only once in approximately every 33 years does the earth
intersect the swarm at a crowded point in the wake of the comet
after the comet has made its closest approach to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   This year scientists expect many Leonid meteors to be made of
fresh material knocked loose from the comet, making them better
indicators of the comet's composition than fragments that have
aged.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 the Leonids put on a spectacular show, with tens of
thousands of meteors blazing through the sky each hour. Many
astronomers believe there is a good chance that this year's display
will be just as spectacular, at least for viewers in East Asia,
which will be in nighttime darkness during the few hours when the
swarm is at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts, including Dr. Donald K. Yeomans of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., guess that the storm
will be much more modest, producing only 200 to 5,000 meteors per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, meteor experts from several countries have
converged on Asia to measure and study the Leonids as they hit the
atmosphere at speeds of about 45 miles per second.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are teams of specialists who will fly aboard two
airplanes _ a prop-jet Electra owned by the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and an Air Force KC-135
jet.
</P>
<P>
   Both are modified with upward-looking windows permitting
photography, spectroscopy, laser probes and other types of
observation.
</P>
<P>
   For about eight hours starting before midnight in East Asia, the
two airplanes, temporarily based in Okinawa, will fly in formation
with each other. The NCAR Electra, the slower of the two, will fly
back and forth along a straight track at about 25,000 feet, while
the Air Force KC-135, flying at about 40,000 feet, will fly an
elliptical course around the Electra's path.
</P>
<P>
   Instruments aboard both planes, a known distance apart, will
measure the angles between their respective views of a given meteor
trail, and triangulation will allow them to calculate the altitude
of the trail.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists are not worried about being hit by meteors, most
of which burn up in the mesosphere far above them, 50 to 65 miles
high. Most of the fragments are smaller than grains of sand, and
only very rarely is a meteor large enough and dense enough to
survive its white-hot trip through the air all the way to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The lead experiment on the Electra, conducted by Dr. Chester S.
Gardner and his team from the University of Illinois, will seek to
measure the amount of iron dumped into the atmosphere by meteors,
and to measure the temperatures of meteor trails.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The group has developed a new type of lidar (which stands for
``light detection and ranging'') for the experiment. A lidar
instrument, similar in principle to a radar except that it uses
light instead of radio waves, sends a powerful laser beam directly
upward, where it excites target atoms in the thin atmosphere
sensitive to the laser's wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   They emit light, and a telescope, aimed at exactly the spot
where atoms excited by the laser are glowing measures and analyzes
the light.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's group has built a pair of lidars based on crystals of
alexandrite, a mineral that can lase at any of a range of
wavelengths, depending on how it is ``seeded'' by a small diode
laser of the desired wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   Using a complex optical system, the University of Illinois group
has tuned its lidars to two of the wavelengths of ionized iron _
the form that iron assumes at very high temperatures. By sending up
beams of ultraviolet light at 372 and 374 nanometers, the group
expects to excite iron ions to fluoresce in visible light that can
be detected and measured by the two telescopes aboard the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of fluorescence triggered by the two laser beams will
reveal the temperature of the high-altitude iron atoms and
therefore the meteor trail. This laser thermometer is expected to
improve understanding of the chemistry of the upper atmosphere and
the effects of meteors on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't aim the lidars in the plane. They always point
straight up,'' Gardner said in an interview, ``so we have to wait
for a meteor trail to pass directly overhead through out beam. On
an ordinary night we have to wait five hours or more for a single
trail, but during this storm we hope the intervals between overhead
meteors will be much shorter and give us much more information.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is in charge
of the airborne study, which is also supported by the National
Science Foundation and the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   One of the objects of the program is to determine how a meteor's
mass is related to its brightness. In another part of the program,
spectrometers will analyze light from meteor trails (which often
persist for several seconds) in terms of their chemical
composition. Meteoroids are broadly classed either as silicates
(especially olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase) or metallic
meteorites made mostly of iron and nickel, but there are many
variations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the experiments aboard the Electra is a wide-angle camera
that can record images of the glow emitted by excited sodium atoms
in the atmosphere. The sodium content of the atmosphere is expected
to be significantly increased by the arrival of meteors, and sodium
at high altitude reacts with ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hope to learn whether meteor storms degrade the ozone
shield protecting life on earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the operators of scores of scientific, military and
commercial satellites have prepared the best they can for the
sand-blasting the meteor storm may produce. Solar panels have been
turned edgewise to present small targets to meteoroids, and some
electrical systems have been shut down to minimize the chances of
destructive short circuits triggered by impacts.
</P>
<P>
   A satellite regarded as particularly endangered by the Leonids
is the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) designed and built by
the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to study
charged particles coming from the sun and beyond the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Launched last year, ACE is now one million miles from the earth
in the direction of the sun _ a very vulnerable position close to
the center of the comet's wake. NASA is reorienting the spacecraft
to present a small target, but Dr. Mary Chiu, ACE's program
manager, said ``we're crossing our fingers in hopes of an
uneventful day on the 17th.''

JUSTICES TO HEAR CASE QUESTIONING POLICE SEARCHES IN DRUG WAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday delved into the
constitutionality of the war on drugs by agreeing to decide whether
police need a warrant before searching a car suspected of having
been used in a cocaine deal.
</P>
<P>
   The case, from Florida, questions the extent to which police may
examine the automobiles they impound while investigating illegal
drug activity. While courts have upheld the right of police to
seize the vehicles, a question remains whether officers may then
search them without first getting a judge's permission.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, the justices let stand a lower court decision
that struck down a Cincinnati ordinance limiting campaign
expenditures in City Council elections. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals said the ordinance ran afoul of the Supreme Court's 1976
ruling in Buckley vs. Valeo that generally held campaign funding
limits to be an unconstitutional restriction on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida case, the justices will review whether police
violated the Fourth Amendment when they conducted a warrantless
search of Tyvessel White's automobile and found cocaine in an
ashtray. White, who had been arrested on an unrelated charge, was
subsequently charged with drug possession.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, White asked that the cocaine evidence be thrown
out because the police lacked a warrant when they searched his
vehicle. Police, believing the car had been used several months
earlier to deliver illegal drugs, seized the automobile after
arresting White.
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge permitted the warrantless search, and White was
convicted. A Florida appeals court upheld the conviction, saying
the police did not need a warrant to search the car because they
had probable cause to believe the vehicle had been used to
facilitate a drug deal.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Florida Supreme Court reversed the ruling, saying
the police needed a warrant before searching a car seized under the
state Contraband Forfeiture Act, which allows law enforcement to
impound automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   In his successful request that the U.S. Supreme Court hear the
state's appeal, Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth noted
the local federal appeals court had ruled that police do not need a
warrant before searching an impounded vehicle. The 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals based its ruling on Supreme Court
decisions that police must be allowed to conduct quick, warrantless
searches of automobiles because cars can be driven away in the time
it would take to get a judge's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth said the Florida Supreme Court decision creates the
``inherently anomalous situation'' that state police need a warrant
before searching a car but that the same automobile seized for
identical reasons by federal officers may be searched without a
warrant. ``Such a result cannot be permitted to stand,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   David Gauldin, an assistant public defender representing White,
urged the justices not to disturb the Florida Supreme Court's
decision. He said the need for police to search automobiles quickly
only applies to situations on the open road. Officers, after
seizing a car, have plenty of time to get a warrant before
conducting a search, Gauldin argued.
</P>
<P>
   The justices have not yet scheduled when they will hear
arguments in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign funding case, council members urged the Supreme
Court to hear their appeal and overturn the 6th Circuit's decision.
They argued the $140,000 limit Cincinnati places on campaign
expenses removes the ``pervasive public perception'' that money has
corrupted local elections and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   However, John Kruse, an unsuccessful candidate for council,
urged the justices to let the 6th Circuit's decision stand.
Political candidates have a First Amendment right to spend as much
as they want on their campaigns, argued Kruse, who was joined in
the case by his campaign committee and two financial contributors
to Cincinnati city council campaigns. &QL;

 &HT;    FEARING IMMIGRATION CRISIS, U.S. TAKES STEPS TO AID CENTRAL
AMERICANS
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 600 words.
 &HT;    With IMMIGRATION-BOX-1117.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Fearing the northward migration of Central Americans
devastated by Hurricane Mitch, the Clinton administration has
stepped up aid to the region, and soon may offer temporary refuge
to hundreds of thousands of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton announced an
additional $15 million in food aid for Honduras during a visit to
that hard-hit country, which brings the total U.S. contribution to
the region to $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the administration is considering whether to
allow citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua
who are already here, both legally and illegally, to stay and work
for up to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States wants to do all it can to help these poor
economies in Central America so that desperate people don't flood
the U.S. border in coming years, which is a distinct possibility
because of how destructive Hurricane Mitch has been,'' said Larry
Birns, head of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the United States clearly doesn't want a repeat of
the 1980s, when thousands of Central Americans fled raging civil
wars to resettle in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced Monday that
it has temporarily suspended the deportation of aliens from El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua until January 7 ``as a
humanitarian response to the catastrophic damage'' caused by the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala and Honduras are two of the top destinations for
illegal immigrants who are forced to leave the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the INS
returned 2,171 people to Guatemala and 2,040 people to Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   But the granting of ``temporary protected status'' would go a
step further than the suspension of deportations by allowing
Central American citizens to remain in the United States for a
lengthy period of time, anywhere from six to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   These citizens would be permitted to work, as well as to apply
to visit Central America and return to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Such protection has been given in the past to citizens from
war-ravaged countries in Africa and elsewhere, generally for a year
but with the chance for renewal.
</P>
<P>
   It's not yet clear how long the temporary protection would last
or whether citizens of the various Central American countries would
be treated differently.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of move is not an easy one for the Clinton
administration to make as it seeks to aid Central Americans without
appearing to encourage all disaster victims to come to this
country.
</P>
<P>
   According to experts on Latin America, temporary protected
status could be applied to perhaps 450,000 people here.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials would not comment Monday on any plan to grant
such protection, except to say that details haven't been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``All options are being looked at, but nothing is definite at
this point,'' said an administration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan has prompted strong reactions from those who argue
that special protection could result in the permanent settlement of
illegal immigrants who should be returned to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When those who are here illegally get some kind of status it
becomes much harder to send them back to their own countries in the
future,'' said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for
Immigration Studies in Washington, which advocates a decrease in
immigration. ``This leads to the permanent settlement of a large
number of people, as well as to the future immigration of their
friends and relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the magnitude of the hurricane's damage has led many
people to predict a huge flow of migrants to the United States in
search of a better life.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse warned that a new wave
of migrants will go ``walking, swimming and running up north''
unless countries boost their assistance to the region in the wake
of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The 350-mile-wide hurricane ripped through the region earlier
this month, killing at least 11,000 people and leaving 13,000 more
missing.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization
said the cash crops that form the backbone of Central American
economies could take years to recover from the storm's damage.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras and Nicaragua, two of the hemisphere's poorest
countries, health authorities warned that major epidemics could
occur as hundreds of thousands of homeless jam-packed shelters with
poor sanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Central American officials are lobbying the U.S. government to
develop a massive aid program akin to the Marhall Plan that helped
Europe recover following World War II. They also are pushing the
United States to grant their countries equal status with Mexico as
partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have not said how much more assistance might be
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts argued that the crisis warrants all the aid the
United States can muster, including the granting of temporary
protected status to Central American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries can't take care of the people they've got so
we can't be sending even more people back there,'' said Max Castro,
a Central America expert at the University of Miami's North-South
Center. ``The place is in the midst of a tremendous crisis and the
United States must do the right thing by its people.''

<P>
   Good news for nut lovers _ and anyone who wants a simple way to
help lower the risk of heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Nurses Health study of 86,000 nurses found
that women who ate more than five ounces of nuts a week, slightly
less than the rough equivalent of one airline packet a day, had
one-third fewer heart attacks than those who rarely or never ate
nuts.
</P>
<P>
   And preliminary results from the companion Physician's Health
Study suggest that frequent nut consumption may provide similar
benefits to men.
</P>
<P>
   The Nurse's study, conducted by researchers at Brigham and
Women's Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston,
also brings good news about the nut.
</P>
<P>
   This plant product, which does not, contrary to wide
misconception, contain any cholesterol, has been maligned for years
and accused of being a menace because of its high fat content. With
conclusions to the contrary, the study is a reminder that not all
fat is bad fat, that the body, in fact, needs some fat.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard School of Public Health, who led the
research and reported on its results in the current issue of the
British Medical Journal, said that during the period of
observation, from 1980 to 1994, the women in the study suffered a
total of 1,255 fatal or nonfatal heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 86,000 women, 4,000 had a weekly diet that exceeded five
ounces a day of all kinds of nuts, from the elitist macadamia to
the commonest peanut: 44 of them heart attacks. This compared with
a group of 30,000 who rarely or never ate nuts and suffered 554
attacks, and 52,000 who were between the two extremes, eating nuts
on average from one to four times per week, and suffered 669
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuts are a fatty food,'' Hu said. ``They are high in fat, and
because of this people have thought for decades that they should
avoid them to help reduce the risk of heart disease. But we know
that some kinds of fats, unsaturated fats, are good, are necessary,
in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers warned against overdosing on nuts, however.
``There is a risk of too much of anything,'' Hu said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alice Lichtenstein, a biochemist at Tufts University's
nutrition research center, said the new study was valid and
important but added that ``people who tend to eat nuts may be those
whose life styles are healthier in general.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So one must not overreact to the data on nuts without
assessing one's whole diet,'' Dr. Lichtenstein said. ``There are
many factors that make up healthy eating habits and patterns of
life style and the others can't be ignored.'' &QL;

   A new study suggests that if you have to make a speech at the
stockholders' meeting, give your first piano recital or do the
tango in a dance contest, you may want to have Mom and Dad _ and
anyone else who wants you to excel _ stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Two psychologists, Dr. Jennifer L. Butler of Wittenberg
University in Springfield, Ohio, and Roy F. Baumeister of Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland, report research showing
that people did less well on tasks performed in front of audiences
that were rooting for them than they did in front of those who were
not. The research was published in the November issue of the
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   To study the effects of supportive audiences, the researchers
organized three laboratory experiments. In the first, 40 people
were seated before a one-way mirror and asked to count backward by
13 as quickly and accurately as possible starting with the number
1470.
</P>
<P>
   Half were told that a friend was seated on the other side of the
one-way mirror; half were told that a stranger was there. Those
believing they were performing in front of a friend made a median
number of 17.2 correct subtractions, 1.7 errors, and a total of
18.9 calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Those told they were before a stranger performed more
calculations with fewer errors with 23 correct subtractions, 2.8
errors and 25.8 calculations.
</P>
<P>
   In the second experiment 23 subjects were asked to perform a
difficult video game _ flying a simulated aircraft through an
obstacle course quickly _ and were told that all observers were
strangers. But half of the observers would receive a cash prize, as
the performers would, if the performance surpassed a certain score.
</P>
<P>
   The other half was told that only the performers would receive
cash. Before observers who would receive cash, the performers took
10 seconds longer and crashed four times as often as those
performing before an audience with no financial interest in the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The third experiment, with 93 participants, was the same as the
second except the subjects were told that a third group of
observers was added that would receive the cash prize if the
performers failed.
</P>
<P>
   In this test, steps were taken to account for possible
personality, emotional and skill-proficiency differences among the
performers. Here the differences were smaller, but, again, the
performers were faster and crashed less often before the
adversarial group than the supporting group.
</P>
<P>
   Why should this be?
</P>
<P>
   Concentration, most students of peak performance agree, is the
key to skilled performance. And, Baumeister said, ``people's
reactions to those who support them, including fear of
disappointing them, may be more distracting than their reactions to
those you don't care about them.''

IMMORTALITY, OF A SORT, BECKONS TO BIOLOGISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Greek myths, a terrible price is always paid by humans
who seek to live forever, as if to discourage people from even the
thought of sharing in the defining attribute of gods. Tithonus, a
youth with whom Aurora, the goddess of the Dawn, fell in love, was
granted immortality, but as he grew more bent and decrepit longed
only for one other gift, the relief of death.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by such cautionary tales, we meekly accept that death
is as inevitable as the dawn, knowing that our bodies will run down
like an aging automobile when they exceed their design limit. So it
was almost disquieting rather than uplifting to hear scientists at
Geron Corp. in Menlo Park, Calif., talk about ``immortalizing''
certain cells that they hoped to derive from the recently isolated
human embryonic stem cells. Surely the scientists were speaking
metaphorically.
</P>
<P>
   They were not.
</P>
<P>
   The study of aging is undergoing a possibly profound change, and
a handful of biologists, whose hubris has not yet been punished
with a thunderbolt from Mount Olympus, are beginning to think about
interfering with the mechanisms that make the body mortal.
</P>
<P>
   Immortalizing a cell is of course very different from making an
individual live forever. But because people are made of cells the
two concepts have a deep and maybe exploitable link.
</P>
<P>
   For decades biologists have known that the body's mortality is
mirrored on the cellular level by an immutable rule called the
Hayflick limit. Dr. Leonard Hayflick, now of the University of
California, San Francisco, discovered that when tissue cells are
taken from the body and cultured in a laboratory dish, they grow
and divide about 50 times _ the number varies with the kind of
tissue _ and then lapse into senescence.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Geron's biologists announced an electrifying
finding: They had learned how to make human cells break the
Hayflick limit. The physical basis of the Hayflick rule is a
section of DNA known as the telomere, which gets shorter each time
the cell divides. When the telomeres reach a certain minimum
length, the cell is thrown into a terminal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   All cells possess a gene, known as the telomerase gene, which
can restore the telomeres to their youthful length. But in most
cells the gene is permanently repressed and inactive. Geron's
discovery was that by inserting a copy of the telomerase gene in
active form into cells, it could make them grow and divide
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   For cells, the ability to divide indefinitely into two identical
daughter cells is immortality. (The cell's atoms and molecules are
continually being replaced, but its structure and informational
content are unchanged from day to day.) For an individual, making
clones of oneself in perpetuity would hardly count as living
forever. What stands between a person and immortality is that
almost all the body's cells are mortal and, though they turn over,
eventually cease to replace themselves efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Two categories of body cell, however, are immortal in the cell's
sense of being able to divide indefinitely. One is the essence of
life, the other of death. Cancer cells eventually learn how to
unlock the bolted down switches on the telomerase gene, and with
this last defense in their hands can defy all the body's careful
control mechanisms and run rampant.
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of immortal cell is the all-purpose, embryonic
stem cells from which the whole organism develops. In embryonic
stem cells, too, the telomerase gene is active, and the cells can
divide indefinitely as long as they remain embryonic. As the fetus
develops, however, the embryonic stem cells differentiate, meaning
that they progress down a variety of different pathways to become
the specialized cells that form each of the body's different
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In the biologist's view it is differentiation, not expulsion
from Eden, that makes us mortal. As cells differentiate, they
repress the telomerase gene. Some, like most brain and heart cells,
seem never to divide again once the organism has reached maturity.
Others, like skin and blood cells, can regenerate from stem cells
specific to their tissue, but these tissue stem cells, descendants
of the embryonic stem cells, also have a finite lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   How then are embryonic cells generated from parents whose cells
are irreversibly differentiated? In the embryo, a small number of
stem cells are set aside, before embryonic development begins, and
protected from differentiation. These special cells, known as
embryonic germ cells, migrate to the developing ovary or testis,
where they generate the egg or sperm for the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Thus there is a special lineage of cells that permanently resist
terminal differentiation, cycling indefinitely from embryonic stem
cell to embryonic germ cell, to oocyte or sperm, to fertilized egg
and embryonic stem cell again. At each cycle the cells spin off a
new body as the temporary vehicle to carry them forward on their
unending journey.
</P>
<P>
   Geron's second amazing advance of the year was the isolation of
human embryonic stem cells by two groups of researchers whom the
company financed. One reason for its success was that under its
visionary founder, Michael West, the company worked with leading
academic scientists in the telomere field. Because the embryonic
stem cells were known to maintain permanently youthful telomeres,
the company was drawn into the stem cell field and repeated the
coup of signing up many of the leading university scientists in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   With its human embryonic stem cells and its telomerase gene,
Geron has acquired two scientifically fascinating properties,
though of course commercial pay-off may be years away. What the
company hopes to do is to guide the embryonic stem cells down
specific paths of differentiation toward becoming the specialized
cells of heart, blood or any other desired tissue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before being injected into a patient, these specialized cells
could be immortalized by adding the telomerase gene in active form.
The tissues they formed in a patient would then be permanently
youthful. (There would of course be a problem of immune rejection,
which Geron has not yet addressed. West, now at another company,
said last week that he hoped to sidestep rejection by generating
embryonic stem cells from the patient's own body cells; their
differentiated state would be reversed by fusing the cell with a
cow's egg.)
</P>
<P>
   If biologists can immortalize some of the body's cells by the
Geron method, could they in time learn how to immortalize them all?
Dr. William Haseltine, chairman of Human Genome Sciences in
Rockville, Md., believes a solution lies with the tissue stem cells
that provide for the regeneration of tissue like blood and skin.
Tissue stem cells, descendants of the embryonic stem cells, may
exist for many or all tissues but only a few have so far been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   These tissue stem cells also get old in time and start to
generate tired or compromised cells. Haseltine's idea is to replace
them, before they start to do harm, with tissue stem cells
immortalized with telomerase. All the body's tissues would thus be
continuously and reliably regenerated from permanently youthful
tissue stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clearly articulated vision of human immortality that
will be introduced slowly over the next 50 years,'' Haseltine said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Okarma, Geron's vice president for research,
commented sternly that his own company had no such plans.
</P>
<P>
   Making the body immortal ``is indeed fanciful and certainly
something we don't even contemplate here,'' he said. ``We are much
more interested in dealing with the 20 or so degenerative diseases
that have no present treatment and could be addressed with
immortalized cells.''
</P>
<P>
   The embryonic stem cells, immortal seeds in our mortal bodies,
have a pedigree that stretches back more than 3 billion years to
the first cell. Their survival mechanisms are sophisticated. Even
the telomerase system is far from understood. Still, the cell is a
mechanism and, absent the gods' fury, it can one day be made to
operate closer to our desire than evolution's uncaring design.

THE FALL OF NETWORK TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been 22 years since a one-word movie title, ``Network,''
summed up all the majesty and danger of the world's most powerful
medium.
</P>
<P>
   In Paddy Chayevsky's brilliant fantasy, one mad news anchor
coaxed his countrymen out of their seats and to their windows, en
masse, to shout the ``mad as hell'' mantra of American malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Today, one window might fly open. Everyone else would look up,
startled, from MTV, wrestling matches, Nickelodeon cartoons,
historical documentaries and college basketball games to wonder
what the fuss was.
</P>
<P>
   The big broadcast networks have lost their grip. It's there in
the numbers, in black and white. But it's also in the (set
ital)feel(end ital) of TV these days.
</P>
<P>
   The system is disintegrating. It's no secret that the networks
have been losing audience share for years _ since 1979, in fact.
But this season, the meltdown seems to be in an advanced phase.
</P>
<P>
   A stench of decay now clings to the mighty alphabet networks _
ABC, CBS, NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The old variety of couch potato _ come home from work, snap on
the TV, watch whatever your favorite network throws on the screen
until bedtime _ is a vanishing species.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer sit comatose on the couch going from one sitcom
to another sitcom,'' says Tiburon, Calif.-based TV consultant Bruce
Lindgren. ``The real cause of unease out there in the industry is
that a lot of us, myself included, don't really know where this is
going.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to conclude that television itself has lost its
magnetism, that people have abandoned their TV sets for the
Internet, longer work hours, the kids' soccer practice, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics don't support that conclusion. TV sets are in use
more than ever, at least according to Nielsen Media Research
figures for average daily television viewing. Twenty years ago, a
TV set was turned on in the average American household for about 6
1/2 hours a day. In 1998, the figure is nearly 7 1/2 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   But the broadcast networks are no longer beneficiaries of that
addiction. The combined network ratings are in a long decline that
shows signs of turning into a genuine tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   While viewing has increased in the past decade, the combined
network ratings have shrunk 20 percent. This season, for the first
time, all the networks are averaging single-digit ratings in prime
time. And a 30-share series, once the benchmark for mere survival,
now exists in the form of only one show, ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the lost audience, of course, has migrated to the
multitude of cable channels, whose proliferation has provided a
nearly exact reverse image of the network decline.
</P>
<P>
   If the networks lose their unique allure as mass advertising
venues, they're toast. They would no longer attract the kind of
dollars needed to pay for the networks' relatively expensive
original programming.
</P>
<P>
   The networks pay stratospheric sums for proven audience-grabbers
to stanch the bleeding _ $2.2 billion annually for NFL games on
Fox, ABC and CBS; $13 million an episode from NBC for ``ER''; $1
million each, per episode, for Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser of NBC's
``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   And they cut corners everywhere else to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   They close news bureaus. They cut the workforce. They
green-light embarrassing, exploitative, inexpensive prime-time
specials that their forebears wouldn't have touched with asbestos
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   They further degrade their news divisions with plug-in
newsmagazines such as ``Dateline NBC.'' They try to extort tribute
from their program suppliers and jimmy nickels loose from their
affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, the highest-rated and presumably the most profitable of the
networks, has even cut back severely on charitable gifts.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the networks are devouring themselves in an
increasingly desperate effort to pay for programming that fewer
people are watching, and to buttress the sagging illusion of
network glitter.
</P>
<P>
   That glitter was based on being full-service networks that
brought the public the best of broadcasting _ news, sports and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But when NBC schedules ``Exposed! Pro Wrestling's Greatest
Secrets'' on the second Sunday of the November sweeps, something is
seriously wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sign of a network that no longer has the aspirations,
the acumen, the money or the taste to maintain high standards. And
the sign of a network that's willing to trade its prestige cheaply,
for easy rating points.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is less excitement than ever about the TV
season, as traditionally defined by the broadcast networks, and the
network schedules themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if network television has been reduced to a bare handful
of reliable drawing cards _ ``ER,'' ``The X-Files'' and ``Ally
McBeal'' are on the short list _ surrounded by mere electric
static.
</P>
<P>
   As the networks continue to shrink, their diminished future is
likely to be as one more label occupying shelf space alongside
other brand names marketed by a group owner.
</P>
<P>
   Shelf space in this case is a channel in the cable spectrum. And
however much it has been struggling in recent seasons, ABC is the
probable model for the future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the American Broadcasting Co. of old. ABC is now a
component of the Walt Disney Co., whose holdings also include the
</P>
<P>
   Disney Channel, the ESPN channels and pieces of the A&AMP;E and
Lifetime channels.
</P>
<P>
   Disney tries to make the various organs work in synergistic
harmony _ integrating the Sunday and Monday football packages on
ESPN and ABC, for example, or using ABC's ``The Wonderful World of
Disney'' to hype Disney movies, or the Disney Channel to promote
Disney theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   So, we have new skyscrapers in place of the old network towers
on the TV landscape. They're vertically integrated,
studio-connected entertainment conglomerates. Beginning in this
decade, they and not the networks are the giants that dominate the
world's most powerful communications force.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its film studio and magazines, Time Warner is the WB
network, HBO, Cinemax, CNN, TNT, the Cartoon Network, Turner
Classic Movies, TBS and half of Comedy Central. Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp. is the Fox studio and network, along with the FX cable
channel, Fox Family Channel, Fox News Channel and regional cable
sports networks. Viacom is Paramount, Showtime, a piece of the UPN
network, MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, half of Comedy Central and TV Land.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the lost network ratings go to the networks'
parent companies. A child who tunes out an ABC cartoon on Saturday
morning, for instance, might switch instead to a kiddie show on the
Disney Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The studio connections translate into what the industry so
blandly calls ``product'' _ the all-important cache of movies and
TV programs, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   That's why TV consultant Lindgren has noticed the greatest
unease these days within NBC and CBS. Neither is tethered to a
major studio.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and CBS happen to be slugging it out this season for first
place in the Nielsen household ratings. It's a battle that's
virtually meaningless, a remnant of an era when dinosaurs ruled the
airwaves.

SLOW-MOTION LIFTING FOR MAXIMUM MUSCLE FITNESS

<P>
   At Inform Fitness in Massapequa, N.Y., there is no piped-in
music, no blaring televisions and, above all, no clanging and
banging of weights. There are no treadmills, bicycles or rowing
machines. A sign on the wall warns exercisers not to drive for at
least 30 minutes after a workout.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by Adam Zickerman, a trainer, Inform is one of about 100
centers in the country that teach Super Slow, a weight-training
technique that involves lifting weights in ultraslow motion. The
workouts are done in total silence to promote focus and
concentration. No talking is allowed except for coaching by the
trainer. Because the regimen is so physically demanding (hence the
30-minute wait before driving), Zickerman recommends doing a
maximum of two Super Slow workouts a week.
</P>
<P>
   Zickerman and members of the Super Slow Guild, a loose group of
personal trainers who are certified by what they call a Super Slow
``master,'' believe that this high-intensity training method _ with
its long-lasting repetitions _ is more effective than traditional
weight training for building muscle strength. While a conventional
repetition takes about 2 to 6 seconds, a Super Slow repetition
lasts an excruciating 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lift quickly,'' Zickerman said, ``the exercise goes
by so fast, your muscles don't have time to latch on to the
movement. Moving very slowly fatigues the greatest number of muscle
fibers.'' He adds that the majority of weight-training injuries are
caused by extraneous movement of the body during weight lifting, a
problem that he says is completely eliminated by the Super Slow
technique.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the other ideas supported by the Super Slow Guild
are much more extreme. Members believe, for instance, that Super
Slow is the best _ and only _way to achieve fitness. They say that
all other forms of exercise, especially aerobic activities like
running and jogging, are not only worthless but dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Zickerman calls aerobic workouts ``empty exercise'' because, he
contends, muscles work in an uncontrolled, haphazard manner that
depletes the body's recovery systems and leads to injuries. He and
other guild members believe that the increases in muscular strength
brought about by Super Slow weight lifting will translate to
adequate improvements in cardiovascular function and stamina.
</P>
<P>
   Most mainstream exercise experts strongly disagree with these
conclusions, including Michael Motta, an exercise physiologist and
president of Plus One Fitness, a fitness management company. Though
Motta believes that lifting weights slowly is a good idea, ``to say
that the many thousands of studies correlating cardiovascular
activity with reduced incidence of heart disease and other health
risks are invalid is preposterous,'' he said. ``It flies in the
face of common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wayne Wescott, the strength training consultant to the
national YMCA, sees the merits of Super Slow training but does not
support the anti-aerobic stance. In an eight-week study he
conducted recently at the YMCA in Newton, Mass., he found that
subjects following a Super Slow program were able to lift an
average of 27 pounds more per exercise than they could at the
beginning of the study, compared with a 22-pound increase per
exercise with a standard 6-second repetition. ``The results are
really quite impressive,'' Wescott said. ``Though the system can be
tedious, it seems well worth the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Mingoia, 44, a software programmer in Oviedo, Fla., has
found that Super Slow training works for her. She has been doing it
as her only form of exercise for a number of years. ``When I first
walked into the facility I was a size 10,'' she said. ``Now I'm
buying 4's.'' Ms. Mingoia does one training session a week, which
consists of six, three-minute sets of weights with about a minute
rest between exercises. She describes her workouts as both intense
and meditative.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts concede that high-intensity weight training methods
like Super Slow have their place in advanced exercise routines, but
are probably too challenging and result in too much muscle soreness
for novice exercisers. They say the ideal fitness program should
include a combination of cardiovascular, flexibility and strength
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing magical about Super Slow,'' Wescott said.
``It's a good idea to move weight slowly to reduce momentum and
increase force on the muscle.''

RANDOM DRUG TESTING COMES HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga., Calif., Pa., Mich., N.Y., Mass.)   (af)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a weekday afternoon in 1992, Sunny Cloud, an insurance
saleswoman and single mother in Marietta, Ga., dropped by her home
unexpectedly and found her 16-year-old son, Ron, smoking marijuana.
Stunned, Ms. Cloud hustled the boy off to the nearest hospital
emergency room, where she asked doctors to screen his urine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' she said recently, ``and I didn't know what
else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure was expensive, and embarrassing. So Ms. Cloud,
still suspicious of her son, decided to do her own drug tests,
sending him into the family bathroom in boxer shorts with
instructions to come out with a cup full of urine that she could
ship to a local laboratory for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   That is how Ms. Cloud began a cottage industry: the home drug
testing business. As more teen-agers experiment with illicit drugs,
a small but growing roster of companies, including Parents Alert,
founded by Ms. Cloud in 1994, are marketing drug testing kits to
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Food and Drug Administration approved the latest
of these kits, the QuickScreen at Home Drug Test made by Phamatech,
a San Diego manufacturer of diagnostic tests. The company bills its
product as the first to give parents a result at home.
</P>
<P>
   Phamatech says that when the kit hits drug stores in December,
screening for marijuana, cocaine, LSD or heroin will be as simple
as taking a home pregnancy test.
</P>
<P>
   But while advocates of the kits describe them as lifelines for
parents struggling to keep their teen-agers away from illicit
drugs, critics warn that the tests will turn parents into
detectives, undermining the fragile trust essential in guiding
children through the tumultuous teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If parents want the illusion of control, then I think they
should scamper out and buy this kit and use it,'' said Dr. Daniel
H. Gottlieb, a family therapist in suburban Philadelphia and an
adviser to the Federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration. ``On the other hand, if they want a good
relationship with their child, they need to talk to their child to
find out what is going on in that child's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age use of illicit drugs has risen steadily over the past
six years, according to Monitoring the Future, a study by the
University of Michigan that has examined drug abuse among high
school seniors every year since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Among the graduating class of 1992, 27.1 percent had used an
illegal drug in the year before the survey; by last year, the
figure had jumped to 42.4 percent. In 1997, Nearly half of 12th
graders had tried marijuana by the time they graduated; 8.7 percent
had tried cocaine; 13.6 percent had tried LSD and 2.1 percent had
tried heroin.
</P>
<P>
   But those figures, while alarming, do not mean that drug
dependency is rampant among teen-agers. Dr. David T. Feinberg, a
child psychiatrist and expert in addiction at the University of
California at Los Angeles, estimates that 5 percent of American
teen-agers are addicted to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, he said, need to be able to tell dependency from the
``normal experimentation,'' that is part of the rite of passage to
adulthood, a distinction a drug test cannot make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should not be performing medical tests on their
kids,'' Feinberg said. Nor, he added, should pediatricians. ``The
way to determine if a kid has a drug problem is the way to
determine if a kid has any problem, first by taking a history, then
a physical,'' Feinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Feinberg says, the tests do not always tell the truth.
Eating a poppy seed bagel can render a urine test positive; so,
too, can taking certain over-the-counter cold remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The new test marketed by Phamatech cautions parents that while a
negative result is proof that a child is not using drugs, a
positive result is not conclusive and must be confirmed by a
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have said, `Don't you think this is like Big
Brother watching you?''' asked Carl Mongiovi, Phamatech's director
of operations and regulatory affairs. ``Neither myself nor my
company is interested in getting into the family unit, telling
people how to do things. But parents seem to need some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Mongiovi and other proponents of the tests, including officials
at the National Parents' Resource In Drug Education, a nonprofit
group based in Atlanta, say talking with young people about drugs
is hardly as easy as Feinberg and others suggest. They argue that
when parents have suspicions that a child is using drugs, testing
may be a good way _ in some cases, the only way _ to start a
truthful dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parents that I have talked to feel that it is hard for
them to discuss this with their adolescents,'' said Dr. Herbert
Kleber, medical director of the National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia University. ``These tests can help deal
with that issue, if they are used as part of the communication
between parent and child. If they are used as a club, they are
going to cause harm.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The kits come in various forms. Ms. Cloud's version, the Parents
Alert Home Drug Test Service, sells for $44.95 and includes a urine
collection bottle, a prepaid courier package to send to the lab and
the toll-free number of a drug counselor.
</P>
<P>
   She says the counseling is essential. ``A drug test is just a
tool,'' she said. ``It gives you information. What most people
don't know is what to do with the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Phamatech's test is designed to eliminate the laboratory, as
much as possible. The company says its kit, which will cost between
$25 and $35, will tell parents in about 10 minutes if their
children are free of drugs. It is already used by employers.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do not like the idea of urine tests, there is an
at-home hair analysis kit, marketed by the Psychemedics Corp., a
biotechnology company in Cambridge, Mass. Psychemedics bills the
product as ``designed for parents concerned about drug abuse.'' The
hair test costs $59.95, and has the advantage of surprise: A parent
can take a snip of hair while a child is sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to determine how many of these kits are sold
each year; most of the companies involved will not divulge sales
figures. But Ken Adams, the owner of Parents Home Drug Testing, a
company that is doing a brisk business selling unlicensed tests
over the Internet, says he sells 1,000 kits a month.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Burlington, director of the Center for Devices and
Radiological Health at the FDA, said several companies have
requested approval for tests similar to Phamatech's.
</P>
<P>
   Although Adams says his company operates in a ``gray area,''
Bruce Burlington of the FDA says the food and drug agency considers
the sale of unlicensed tests illegal. ``We are in the process right
now of weighing what actions we should take,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies marketing these tests advocate that parents set up
a ``family drug policy.'' ``Start when they are 11 or 12,'' Adams
suggested. ``Say that part of the family drug policy is that there
is going to be random drug testing. That doesn't mean I don't love
you and I don't trust you. It means that this thing is too serious
to take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams and Ms. Cloud both argue that the at-home tests can give
adolescents an easy out _ ``a good excuse to say no to peer
pressure,'' in Ms. Cloud's words. Her son, Ron, now a 22-year-old
junior at the University of Georgia, agrees. He said he smoked his
first marijuana cigarette in the eighth grade, and by 10th grade he
was smoking marijuana and taking LSD regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``His grades slipped,'' Ms. Cloud said. ``He started getting
belligerent.'' Cloud said that he stopped using drugs several years
ago, after some ``major spiritual revelations'' that began four
years ago, when he was a senior in high school. He said he had
attended a concert by the heavy metal group Nine Inch Nails, had
taken LSD and ``was pretty far out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was going into the depths of hell,'' he said.
After the concert, he went home and woke up his mother. ``I told
her I was sorry for the torture I was putting her through.''
Subsequently, he said, he turned to religion.
</P>
<P>
   Although he initially resented the drug tests his mother forced
him to take, Cloud said that they did ``play a role in putting me
down a good path.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that I couldn't go out and get crazy.''

 &HT;    BRITAIN TO SPEND ANOTHER $9.6 BILLION MAKING LONDON THE WORLD'S
'MILLENNIUM CITY'
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Seeking to make London the focus of the world at the
dawn of the next century, government and business leaders on
Tuesday plan to announce a $9.6 billion initiative to prepare the
capital city for its millennium celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, called ``London Millennium City,'' will invest
heavily in London's ``tourism and leisure infrastructure,'' a
government spokesman said. While details of the initiative were not
available Monday, it is expected to focus on new tourist
attractions, art galleries, mass transit improvements and special
millennium-related events. The funding will come from private and
public sources, including allocations from the $3.2 billion being
spent on millennium-related projects from the national lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the cost will be more than offset by the
income generated by additional tourism. Britain has been
campaigning and working for years working to become the focal point
for the world's celebration of the new millennium, not just for New
Year's Eve 1999 but throughout the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Britain's celebration is the $1.2 billion
Millennium Dome in Greenwich, about 7 miles down the Thames River
from the center of London. Greenwich is the home of the Old Royal
Observatory, which has been keeping the world's official time for
more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a once-in-a-lifetime experience, the 16-story Dome
will showcase the ``Best of Britain,'' with exhibits and displays
on contemporary life and the future as well as live entertainment.
There will be 14 exhibition zones covering the themes of work,
rest, play, education, health, religion, environment, community,
communications and finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exhibition on a spectacular scale about the choices
that lie ahead for all of us in the next millennium,'' said Jennie
Page, the chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Co.,
which is organizing the Greenwich events.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the Dome will be a ``Baby Dome'' -- a live performance
venue with a seating capacity of 5,000 -- staging concerts, films
and other live events.
</P>
<P>
   As it is with mega-events, the millennium celebration is
generating its share of handwringing over issues such as funding
and traffic. Even so, officials say everything is on time and under
budget -- so far. It is being billed as a ``no cars'' event, but
municipal officials seem sincere when they say that a combination
of the London Underground trains, buses and passenger barges will
handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are scheduled to go on sale early next year, and some
London hotels are already taking reservations.
</P>
<P>
   And when the year is over? The Dome is expected to be featured
in a proposed British bid for the Olympic Games -- perhaps the 2008
Games.
</P>
<P>
   And if the bid fails, the Dome probably would be put up for sale
for use as a conference or educational center.

   Marijuana Votes: Bane or Benefit? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By ALISHA BERGER
</P>
<P>
   Q. Voters in five states _ Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington _ approved initiatives to legalize marijuana for medical
use. Does this application encourage marijuana abuse?
</P>
<P>
   To answer that you have to assume that there is medical
marijuana. There is no scientific proof of that yet. It has not
been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and there have
not been any reputable studies that propose to demonstrate
medicinal qualities of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one domestic research protocol in the last
decade. It has not gone forward because Dr. Donald Abrams at the
University of California at San Francisco, who is conducting the
accepted study, has to recruit subjects for a double blind study.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the only thing participants can take while
battling AIDS or cancer is marijuana. One study that compared
marijuana to Marinol _ the active ingredient in the marijuana plant
_ patients preferred Marinol. It is premature to refer to medicinal
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The seduction of medical marijuana makes it seem that not only
is marijuana not harmful, but that it is beneficial. That sends a
bad message and encourages abuse. In the 1970s, Alaska allowed home
use of marijuana. There was a marked increase of use by young
people and a rise in child crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JIM McDONOUGH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Director of Strategy for the White House Drug Control Office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Voters recognized that there was a difference between the
medical use of marijuana and its abuse. Just as with other
medicine, there is a clear distinction between legitimate medical
use and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the legitimate medical use of marijuana has been
supported by the New England Journal of Medicine. Medical marijuana
controls nausea for cancer and AIDS patients, it reduces muscle
spasms for paraplegia and neurological diseases like multiple
sclerosis, and controls eye pressure for glaucoma patients.
</P>
<P>
   Among the test patients in the Federal Investigational New Drug
program, which dispenses medical marijuana, there have been no
cases of abuse, and some patients have been receiving marijuana for
two decades. In terms of the broader social ramifications,
California is our best case study.
</P>
<P>
   Recent numbers compiled by the Department of Health and Human
Services show that teen-agers in California are actually less
likely to abuse marijuana: 6.9 percent of California teen-agers 12
to 17 used marijuana frequently, whereas 9.9 percent of teen-agers
nationally frequently used marijuana. &QL;

   Marital spats do more than bruise feelings and break hearts.
They also narrow blood vessels, increase heartbeats, raise blood
pressures and encourage hypertension, atherosclerosis and acute
coronary heart disease, a University of Utah researcher says.

What sets off physiological bells and whistles is not the same for

   Husbands reacted when they believed their competence or
dominance was threatened. Wives reacted when challenges involved
interpersonal relations and level of compassion. The findings were
reported in the November issue of the journal Health Psychology.

 &HT;    BRITAIN TO SPEND ANOTHER $9.6 BILLION MAKING LONDON THE WORLD'S
'MILLENNIUM CITY'
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Seeking to make London the focus of the world at the
dawn of the next century, government and business leaders on
Tuesday plan to announce a $9.6 billion initiative to prepare the
capital city for its millennium celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, called ``London Millennium City,'' will invest
heavily in London's ``tourism and leisure infrastructure,'' a
government spokesman said. While details of the initiative were not
available Monday, it is expected to focus on new tourist
attractions, art galleries, mass transit improvements and special
millennium-related events. The funding will come from private and
public sources, including allocations from the $3.2 billion being
spent on millennium-related projects from the national lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the cost will be more than offset by the
income generated by additional tourism. Britain has been
campaigning and working for years working to become the focal point
for the world's celebration of the new millennium, not just for New
Year's Eve 1999 but throughout the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Britain's celebration is the $1.2 billion
Millennium Dome in Greenwich, about 7 miles down the Thames River
from the center of London. Greenwich is the home of the Old Royal
Observatory, which has been keeping the world's official time for
more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a once-in-a-lifetime experience, the 16-story Dome
will showcase the ``Best of Britain,'' with exhibits and displays
on contemporary life and the future as well as live entertainment.
There will be 14 exhibition zones covering the themes of work,
rest, play, education, health, religion, environment, community,
communications and finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exhibition on a spectacular scale about the choices
that lie ahead for all of us in the next millennium,'' said Jennie
Page, the chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Co.,
which is organizing the Greenwich events.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the Dome will be a ``Baby Dome'' -- a live performance
venue with a seating capacity of 5,000 -- staging concerts, films
and other live events.
</P>
<P>
   As it is with mega-events, the millennium celebration is
generating its share of handwringing over issues such as funding
and traffic. Even so, officials say everything is on time and under
budget -- so far. It is being billed as a ``no cars'' event, but
municipal officials seem sincere when they say that a combination
of the London Underground trains, buses and passenger barges will
handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are scheduled to go on sale early next year, and some
London hotels are already taking reservations.
</P>
<P>
   And when the year is over? The Dome is expected to be featured
in a proposed British bid for the Olympic Games -- perhaps the 2008
Games.
</P>
<P>
   And if the bid fails, the Dome probably would be put up for sale
for use as a conference or educational center.

   ``We're interested in understanding how marital distress may
make people more likely to have heart attacks,'' said Smith, a
clinical psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   He and his colleagues randomly assigned spouses to take the same
or opposite sides in two local issues, imposition of rent controls
and stricter university admissions requirements. The participants,
married three years on average, were given background notes and
four uninterrupted minutes each to state their positions. Each
issue was discussed twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men and women communicate differently and take different goals
and concerns into social interaction,'' Smith said. ``If this
happened only every now and then, it wouldn't influence people's
health at all, but the idea that it is frequent and occurs many
times is emotionally and physiologically taxing.'' &QL;

   Female Condom: a Market Wallflower &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you sell Reality?'' a customer asked uncomfortably this
month at a busy Manhattan drugstore. Then, a clerk stooped down and
pulled a box from deep behind the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Available in the United States since 1993, Reality is the first
and only ``female condom'' on the market. It is, in the words of
its manufacturer, ``a soft, loose-fitting plastic pouch that lines
the vagina.''
</P>
<P>
   But in America, it has never really caught on. ``They are not
popular,'' said Kris Kim, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood.
Many clients, she said, are put off by the condom's looks, by
squeamishness about inserting it and by its reputed tendency to
squeak.
</P>
<P>
   But Reality is finding a niche overseas. Like the male condom,
it protects against diseases, including AIDS. But the female condom
is one device that a woman can fully control. Because of that, the
United Nations AIDS programs and other international groups have
embraced it and helped provide millions of female condoms to
Zimbabwe, South Africa and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   Reality is made by the Female Health Co., a small Chicago firm.
Its chief executive officer, O.B. Parrish, said sales, mostly
overseas, had more than doubled in the past year, to 7.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of on the threshold of commercializing,'' he said.
``One of the things we feel good about is that this product
actually saves some lives.'' _Denise Grady &QL;

<P>
   Where to Turn When the Asp Bites
</P>
<P>
   An old problem with medical textbooks is that research moves
faster than printing presses, making texts out of date before they
reach the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Now a group of more than 400 emergency room physicians has
produced an online reference work that holds the promise of always
being immediate, because it can be updated endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Some other medical texts, like the Merck Manual, have made their
way onto the Internet. But Emedicine, a Boston-based creation of
two emergency room physicians, says that the Web site at
www.emedicine.com/emerg/ is the largest emergency medicine
reference source ever written _ the equivalent of 8,000 pages _
complete with audio and video clips, review questions and links to
related articles.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Scott Plantz, the research director in emergency medicine at
the Chicago Medical School, said the project grew out of a series
of review texts for board examinations he wrote and edited with Dr.
Jon Adler of Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Plantz was typing old material over for an updated
text that he thought there had to be a better way.
</P>
<P>
   Since the emergency medicine reference was hooked up to major
search engines a few weeks ago, the number of visits to the site
soared to a peak of 400,000 a day, said Plantz. The doctors are now
developing more online texts in other specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no space limit on the Web, the doctors were
able not only to cover virtually every common disease, ``but to do
more exotic diseases, or problems that aren't common in the United
States,'' said Plantz. Among those, he added, are sections dealing
with bites of tarantulas and snakes found in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Plantz said he hoped the work would be especially useful to
doctors who have access to the Internet but practice in countries
too poor to support textbooks that include maladies common to their
region. There is no charge for visiting the Web site.

MAN MOVING FINGERS OF TRANSPLANTED HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(rl) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Australian man who received a transplanted hand and forearm
in France seven weeks ago has begun moving each finger of the donor
hand and is gaining function with surprising swiftness, his doctors
said last week. They said that so far the man, Clint Hallam, had
not shown any signs of rejection and had escaped adverse effects of
potent immune-suppressing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A rejection reaction can occur at any time in someone who has
received another person's tissue. If such a reaction occurs in
Hallam, his doctors said, they are confident they can control it
with standard drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam, 48, is ``far ahead of schedule, doing superbly and
better than any of us ever would have hoped,'' said Dr. Earl Owen,
an Australian microsurgeon who headed the international team that
performed the transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, he is on top of the world,'' Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Hallam's early success is because of the prescribed
intense exercise program he performed on the muscles of his
handless right arm in the year preceding the operation. The muscles
of both forearms were equally strong when the transplant was
performed at Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyons on Sept. 23, and
remain strong with twice-a-day physical therapy, Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   It will take at least a year to determine whether nerve
regeneration will allow Hallam to feel hot, cold, touch and other
sensations in his new hand.
</P>
<P>
   Reimplanting hands and arms _ as opposed to what was done here _
has become standard surgery in many hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was a replant, then I would say well he is one of the
best replants we have ever had,'' said Owen, who is a leader in
such surgery. ``But he is a transplant, so that is even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallam can bend each finger about 25 degrees and then straighten
it, Owen and Dr. Xavier R. Martin, a member of the transplant team
in Lyons, said in separate telephone interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam ``can make the beginning of a grip and can move his whole
wrist around in a circle, which is very very good at this stage,''
Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Lyons, Martin said Hallam can turn his hand so the
palm faces down ``quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did the operation everybody was saying we would have
rejection of the donor skin within two weeks'' because
transplanting skin is considered the hardest immunological barrier
to overcome, Martin said. ``It did not happen and we are
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   A previous attempt at such a transplant failed in 1964 in
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam ``thinks he can feel his thumb, but he thought he could
feel his thumb before he had his new hand put on because of the
phantom limb phenomenon,'' Owen said by telephone in a brief visit
to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam has said he occasionally felt a pins and needles
sensation in his new hand. But standard medical tests such as
pricking the skin with a pin show Hallam has no feeling. ``We have
a hard time imagining he can feel with the tip of his fingers
because he cannot _ it is not possible the nerves can grow so
fast,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have taken a small amount of skin from the grafted
forearm above the wrist at least once a week since the operation. A
local anesthetic has not been needed, as would be essential in
performing such biopsies on a person with intact sensation, Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The biopsies are performed to monitor rejection. ``There has
never been the slightest hint of any rejection'' and the doctors
have lowered the number and amount of anti-rejection drugs Hallam
receives, Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have warned that Hallam may not regain sensation and may
be left with little more than a useless hand. But, Owen said,
feeling in the hand is not necessary to make a grip or move a hand
because the nerves controlling the muscles carrying out such motor
functions are in the upper third of the arm, which he already had.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam says the hand, from an anonymous donor, seems like his
own hand and not someone else's, Owen said. ``When he gives a
message from his brain, his muscles work because they are the same
muscles he has had all his life,'' Owen said. ``They pull tendons,
which are somebody else's tendons, but he thinks they are his
because his finger moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen described Hallam as calm, a trait ``honed in a jail for
years.'' Owen was referring to a jail in New Zealand where, in
1984, Hallam, who was serving time in a fraud case, severed his
forearm in an accident with a circular saw. It was replanted, but
had to be amputated in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam's wife and four children have joined him in Lyons. He
will stay there at least another month before returning to
Australia where newspapers have reported that he is due in court in
Perth to face fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Owen predicted that ``an insurance assessment at a year from now
will say that he has a 75 percent recovery of the full use of his
hand.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood is once again sending young Americans a pernicious
message: Smoking is OK. It relieves anxiety and tension, breaks the
social ice and, if Holly Hunter is an example, helps a woman
maintain a stick-thin figure. After seeing Ms. Hunter's new movie,
``Living Out Loud,'' in which she plays a chain-smoking divorcee, I
had to hold my breath as I plowed through a horde of
cigarette-smoking teen-agers gathered outside the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the 34-year decline in the proportion of adults who
smoke continues, youngsters are taking up this addictive habit at
an unprecedented rate. Every day in the United States, more than
3,000 teen-agers start smoking. Since 1991, after a decade of
little or no change, cigarette use by high school students has
risen by 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These are the young people who will be inflating the smoking
statistics _ and resulting illnesses, health care costs and
premature deaths _ in the years to come. As a nation with laws and
policies that promote clean air and clean lungs, we are now running
backward.
</P>
<P>
   Few young people appreciate how quickly a person can become
hooked on nicotine and how hard it can be to break the addiction.
Most youngsters who start smoking as a means of looking ``cool''
and fitting in with their peers expect they will be able to quit
long before it is too late to preserve their health and protect
their future children. Unfortunately, relatively few who become
daily smokers in high school succeed in quitting when they finally
decide to try.
</P>
<P>
   A new national survey of 250 current and 251 former adult
smokers commissioned by the Hazelden Foundation of Minneapolis
revealed that former smokers had tried to quit an average of 10.8
times before succeeding. The process of quitting for good took an
average of 18.6 years, by which time irreparable damage could have
been done to the smokers' bodies and lowered their chances of
living out a normal lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Current smokers in the survey averaged 3.4 attempts to quit.
``These numbers reflect the serious nature of nicotine addition,''
said Carol Falkowski, a senior research analyst for Hazelden, which
runs addiction control programs. ``Nicotine is a powerful drug,
just like alcohol or heroin, and those who want to quit often
relapse in spite of their good intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Most smokers in the survey said stress was their primary
obstacle to quitting. Others said they enjoyed smoking too much to
give it up or that the craving for cigarettes proved stronger than
their will to quit. Surprisingly, only 5.4 percent of current
smokers cited a fear of weight gain for their failure to quit,
although those who run smoking-cessation programs say that weight
gain is a major factor among women who fail to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But even if all adult smokers were able to free themselves of
nicotine addiction, progress in eliminating this health-robbing
habit would be stymied by the millions of youngsters now galloping
toward adulthood, cigarette in hand. A future smoke-free society
will depend on keeping youngsters from starting to smoke in the
first place and helping those already smoking to quit before
cigarettes become a permanent part of their persona.
</P>
<P>
   It may surprise parents to learn, as a recent study of 276
smokers in New Hampshire high schools indicated, that grades in
school and parental level of education have little or no bearing on
the likelihood that a youngster will become a smoker. Nearly
three-fourths of the youngsters had not tried to quit and 82
percent expected to still be smoking a year later. The primary
goal, then, is to keep kids from starting.
</P>
<P>
   In his helpful little book, ``How to Raise Nonsmoking Kids''
(Byron Preiss Multimedia and Pocket Books, 1997, $7.95), Dr. Neil
Izenberg, a pediatrician in Wilmington, Del., advises parents to
begin reinforcing the anti-smoking message very early. He suggests
explaining to preschoolers how tobacco advertising manipulates
people into thinking that smoking is cool, socially acceptable and
image-enhancing. I played a valuable game with my own sons when
they were young: Uncover the hidden message in advertisements and
tell me how the advertisement is trying to persuade you to buy or
use the product. Later we played a similar game with peer pressure:
What were other people trying to get you to do or believe? Because
peer pressure is widely considered the major factor that starts
kids smoking, learning how to identify and resist it is a most
valuable asset.
</P>
<P>
   Another helpful tactic is to appeal to youngsters' natural
desire for independence by emphasizing their ability to rise above
the influence of peers and advertising and think for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Essential to bringing up children who can think and act for
themselves is fostering in them a healthy self-image. Youngsters
with a strong sense of themselves are best able to resist noxious
outside influences and more likely to be leaders, not followers,
among their friends. A valuable lesson I learned from the late Dr.
Haim G. Ginott, author of ``Between Parent and Child'' (Avon, 1969)
is never to criticize the child, only the child's behavior. Instead
of saying ``You're a bad boy, good boys don't do things like
that,'' you should say ``What you did is wrong and hurtful.''
</P>
<P>
   Fostering involvement in sports, especially competitive sports,
is also helpful, because it is easy to convince youngsters that
smoking robs muscle cells of oxygen, interferes with lung function
and impairs performance.
</P>
<P>
   And because all smokers smoke for the immediate rewards bestowed
by cigarettes and few youngsters are willing to worry about their
health decades down the line, it helps to emphasize the immediate
negative aspects: a noxious odor that permeates the hair, clothes,
skin and breath; stained teeth; poor physical endurance, and lots
of money going up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Far less is known about effective stop-smoking techniques for
teen-agers than for adults. As you might predict, those who smoke
the least, which means they are less hooked on nicotine, have the
easiest time quitting. In other words, kids should be told that
they are most likely to succeed if they quit while they're behind _
in the number of cigarettes they smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Sargent and colleagues at Dartmouth Medical School
found in their study of the New Hampshire adolescent smokers that
effective quitting was unrelated to socioeconomic status, school
performance, alcohol consumption or any of several predicted
psychological characteristics. The most important factor was the
teen-agers' belief that smoking was not going to be part of their
future. However, the survey also found that most of the teen-agers
were not sure whether or not they would be smoking in a year's
time, while only a small percentage thought they definitely would
have quit.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study showed that even highly addicted youngsters
were sometimes able to quit, the researchers suggested that success
in quitting may be enhanced by nicotine replacement therapy.
Youngsters trying to quit should also be told that withdrawal
symptoms are at their worst in the first three days. And for most
people, quitting cold turkey works best.

   &UR; Yogurt, Threat or Not? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If I eat a lot of yogurt, will the bacteria in it make me
sick?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no evidence of human health problems from yogurt
with live bacteria, said Dr. Kathryn Boor, assistant professor of
food science at Cornell University, and there is some evidence the
bacteria may be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new field of study called probiotic bacteriology
that is investigating whether living organisms can help colonize
the gastrointestinal tract and keep out bad bacteria,'' Dr. Boor
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is controversial whether yogurt bacteria survive there, she
said, and conclusions must await completion of research, but there
is ``better than anecdotal evidence'' of such benefits. The theory
is supported by studies of young chicks sprayed with bacteria
present in adult chickens. The chicks take up these microbes and
are not colonized by harmful salmonella, an effect called
competitive exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Boor said she saw no reason to seek out yogurt without live
cultures for fear of danger from the bacteria that ferment milk
into yogurt. The most commonly used culture is Lactobacillus
delbrueckii bulgaricus in combination with Streptococcus
thermophilus. Both are harmless in the gut, if they survive, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Dr. Boor's research in the laboratory, so-called competition
studies found this combination ``very competent'' in killing a
disease-causing microbe like E. coli O157:H7 during yogurt
production.

A NEW LOOK AT HITLER: INSANE OR JUST EVIL? 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adolf Hitler is often referred to as a madman, in part because
most people are loath to accept such enormity of evil as anything
other than the byproduct of psychosis. Yet just how ``mad'' Hitler
was, and how much of the evil he perpetrated can be attributed to
illness, either physical or mental, has been a subject of
disagreement among historians.
</P>
<P>
   The publication this week of the first comprehensive medical and
psychological biography of the Nazi leader, ``Hitler: Diagnosis of
a Destructive Prophet'' (Oxford University Press, $35), is likely
to intensify the debate. In it, Dr. Fritz Redlich, a neurologist
and psychiatrist, concludes that though Hitler exhibited many
psychiatric symptoms, including extreme paranoia and defenses that
``could fill a psychiatry textbook,'' he most likely was not truly
mentally ill. Hitler's paranoid delusions, Redlich writes, ``could
be viewed as a symptom of mental disorder, but most of the
personality functioned more than adequately.'' Hitler, he added,
``knew what he was doing and he chose to do it with pride and
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the Nazi leader was afflicted with a variety of
physical ills, both real and psychogenic, he suffered from nothing
severe enough to take the blame for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Redlich, professor emeritus of psychiatry at both Yale
University and the University of California at Los Angeles, began
his research 10 years ago as an effort to refute assertions made by
some so-called Holocaust revisionists, including that Hitler was
manipulated by his personal physician, Theodor Morell. But when
Redlich discovered that there were few substantive works on
Hitler's medical condition, the psychiatrist says, he decided to go
further, constructing what he calls a ``pathography,'' or ``study
of the life and character of an individual, as influenced by
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is an exhaustive text that meticulously weighs and
considers virtually every aspect of the dictator's psyche and every
detail of his physical health. Redlich based his conclusions in
part on Hitler's own statements, but he also spent a decade
examining medical records, including diaries kept by Morell, and
conducting interviews with surviving sources.
</P>
<P>
   The litany of Hitler's physical ailments is long. He experienced
severe abdominal spasms, as well as belching, bloating and
constipation. Beginning in the 1930s, he complained of buzzing and
ringing in his ears. He was afflicted with hypertension, headaches
and heart trouble. And he had problems with his vision: After a
mustard gas injury in World War I, he experienced two episodes of
``blindness,'' at least one of which Redlich judges to have been
hysterical, and in later years Hitler described eye pain and hazy
vision, ``as if he was viewing objects through a thin veil.''
Toward the end of his life, the Nazi leader also suffered from
Parkinson's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Redlich adds several new medical diagnoses to the list. He
believes that Hitler probably had both spina bifida occulta _ a not
uncommon hereditary condition that is largely symptomless, but can
cause difficulties in urination and frequent bladder infections _
and hypospadia, an abnormally placed urethra. Redlich made these
diagnoses by piecing together information from Morell's diaries,
and from interviews with Henriette Hoffman von Schirach, daughter
of Hitler's photographer, and Ernst Gunther Schenck, a doctor and
former Nazi who was the author of a German medical biography of
Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Redlich learned, for example, that Hitler had mentioned both
conditions to Morell, leading the author to believe that they had
been diagnosed earlier by another doctor. If the Nazi leader did
have these abnormalities, Redlich argues, it might help explain his
sexual inhibition, and the frequent hand washing that other authors
attributed to psychological compulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Redlich also offers the opinion that Hitler probably suffered
from temporal or giant cell arteritis, an autoimmune disease
associated with inflammation of the arteries. A diagnosis of giant
cell arteritis, Redlich asserts, would explain many of Hitler's
complaints, including his headaches, cardiac symptoms and vision
problems.
</P>
<P>
   A commonly repeated notion is that Hitler had only one testicle,
an assertion made in the autopsy report filed by Soviet
pathologists who examined bodies removed from shallow graves in a
garden near Hitler's bunker, including one the Russians concluded
was Hitler's. Various historians have either accepted this finding
or rejected it as an attempt by the Bolsheviks to portray Hitler as
sexually defective. Redlich remains neutral on this question,
though he points out that monorchism, as the condition is called,
is sometimes associated with hypospadia. And there is no evidence,
the author writes, to show that Hitler had syphilis, despite
persistent rumors that he contracted the disease from a Jewish
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler's personal physician, Morell, to whom the Nazi leader was
devoted, has always been a controversial figure. Some biographers
have deemed him a charlatan and an exploiter. Others have said that
he deliberately tried to harm his patient. Redlich concludes, in
contrast, that while Morell was ignorant and made mistakes _ at one
point he gave Hitler both very potent laxatives and opiates, a
dangerous combination _ he ``was proud of his historical role,''
enjoyed the perquisites it provided and never caused deliberate
harm.
</P>
<P>
   Was Hitler a drug addict? Redlich thinks not. Morell did
prescribe amphetamines for Hitler, but this was a common practice
at the time, the author says. ``I think he took drugs, but he did
not become addicted,'' Redlich said in an interview. ``And when he
realized they were harmful, he stopped.'' He added that Hitler was
a teetotaler, and fiercely opposed to the use of nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Redlich concludes that ``Hitler's crimes and errors
were not caused by illness.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hitler scholars who have reviewed the new book said they were
impressed with the scope and detail of the author's research. Dr.
Ian Kershaw, a history professor at the University of Sheffield in
England, whose own biography, ``Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris''
(W.W.Norton, $35), will be published in January, has called the
book ``the most thorough investigation yet undertaken of Hitler's
medical condition.'' Dr. John Lukacs, a retired historian and
author of ``The Hitler of History'' (Knopf, $25.50), calls
Redlich's work ``a great contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the psychiatrist does not limit himself to a discussion of
Hitler's physical self. In the last section of the book, he goes
beyond that, delving into the Nazi leader's psyche and constructing
what amounts to a psychiatric profile.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalyzing Hitler has been a popular endeavor ever since
the U.S. government's Office of Strategic Services commissioned a
psychological profile of Hitler in hope of finding novel ways to
defeat him. After Hitler's death, efforts to explain his behavior
in psychological terms proliferated. Among them are Rudolph
Binion's 1976 biography, ``Hitler Among the Germans'' (Northern
Illinois University Press), which traces Hitler's aggression to his
rage at his mother's doctor, and Robert Waite's ``The Psychopathic
God: Adolf Hitler'' (Da Capo Press; $16.95), which concluded that
Hitler was sexually perverse.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dr. William McKinley Runyan, a professor in the school
of social welfare at the University of California at Berkeley, said
Nazi Germany became, in a sense, ``a test case'' for the budding
genre of psychohistory. ``Most people who write about psychohistory
end up writing about the Nazi era,'' Runyan said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Redlich does as much to temper what he considers
exaggerated interpretations by previous biographers as he does to
add his own psychiatric insights. Though his own training is
psychoanalytic, Redlich says he is dubious about how much
psychoanalysis can contribute to an understanding of Hitler: There
are simply not enough available data. ``I find these psychoanalytic
treatises are too simplistic,'' he said. ``To blame the Oedipus
complex or the castration complex for Hitler's problems _ these are
universal concepts and you need something much more specific.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet unlike some historians, who distrust any application of
psychological theory to historical figures, Redlich believes one
cannot adequately assess Hitler's actions without taking into
account not only the historical facts, but the Nazi leader's
``psychological reality.'' For example, Hitler believed that his
father was half-Jewish and had died of syphilis. These beliefs, the
author argues, may have affected the Nazi leader's behavior,
whether or not they were true. (There is no clear evidence, Redlich
writes, to support either claim.)
</P>
<P>
   Redlich theorizes that Hitler may have thought his physical
abnormalities _ his hypospadia and spina bifida occulta _ were
signs that he had inherited syphilis from his father. And his rage
at this may have fueled his anti-Semitism, and his obsession with
syphilis as a ``Jewish disease,'' a theme he dwelled upon for 10
pages in ``Mein Kampf.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most puzzling aspects of Hitler's childhood is that
investigators have been able to find little there to foreshadow the
adult he would become. He did not torture animals (though there is
a single, often repeated, story about a billy goat), and from the
little that is known, he seemed a fairly normal child, though
sexually shy in adolescence. ``Psychohistorians assume that the
child had troublesome, deep conflicts (including ambivalent
feelings about his mother and father),'' Redlich writes. ``I am
more impressed with the fact that useful data about eating habits,
sleep disorders and toilet training are lacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Indicators of Hitler's peculiarities in later adulthood, of
course, are abundant, from his sexual inhibition (he may never have
had sexual intercourse with Eva Braun, Redlich writes) to his
phobias of disease, his explosive rages, his delusions and his
conviction that he would die at an early age (he died at 56). In
his book, Redlich runs through a list of psychiatric symptoms _
paranoia, narcissism, anxiety, depression, hypochondria, to name a
few _ and finds some evidence for every one. Proof that Hitler was
overtly self-destructive or sexually perverse is sparser and less
compelling, the author says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Redlich concludes that attaching a formal psychiatric
diagnosis to the Nazi leader is not very useful. When applying such
diagnoses, he writes, he often feels ``as if I were in a cheap
clothing store: Nothing fits, and everything fits.'' Ultimately,
the psychiatrist portrays Hitler as a man who was more than the sum
of his pathology, entirely responsible for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Some have argued that any attempt to explain Hitler is wrong,
because understanding inevitably breeds excuse. Redlich disagrees:
``I tried to put myself as far as I could into Hitler's shoes, to
study him as a psychiatrist would study a forensic patient, to
understand what makes him tick,'' he said. ``Empathy is not the
same as sympathy.'' In fact, there is little possibility that in
trying to fathom Hitler's actions this particular author could also
forgive him. Redlich, 88, is himself an Austrian of Jewish descent,
who trained in Vienna before the war and fled the Nazis for the
United States in 1938. ``This book,'' he said, ``is in a way my
answer to Hitler.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Rolling Stones are the Energizer Bunnies of
the rock world: They just keep going and going. At a press
conference Monday, Bill Graham Presents announced that the Stones
would begin their 1999 ``No Security'' tour on January 25 at the
Arena in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Coming only a year after the band's blockbuster ``Bridges to
Babylon'' tour played the Bay Area, ``No Security'' _ named for the
recently released Stones live album _ will be the group's first
all-arena tour in more than 20 years, visiting venues in the
20,000-seat range.
</P>
<P>
   The tour will visit 24 U.S. cities, including several _ such as
San Jose, Calif., and Hartford, Conn. _ that haven't seen a Stones
concert in years. Additional dates haven't been ruled out, BGP
co-president Gregg Perloff said.

<P>
   Why did the Rolling Stones choose Oakland as their launching
point? ``They really like the Bay Area,'' Perloff said. Mick Jagger
and his band are also expected to hold rehearsals in the San
Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. tour will finish in Oklahoma City on April 10. Canadian
and European dates are expected after that.
</P>
<P>
   A warning note to Stones purists: The band's trademark tongue
emblem will be superimposed over a logo for designer Tommy
Hilfiger, whose company is backing the tour, for the duration of
the ``No Security'' road trip.

   US-IMMIGRATION _ MIAMI _ With Central American economies ravaged
by Hurricane Mitch, the Clinton administration is considering the
granting of ``temporary protected status'' to hundreds of thousands
of Central American citizens living in the United States. The move
would permit these citizens, who are here both legally and
illegally, to remain in the United States and work here without
fear of deportation. At the same time, the United States is
increasing its aid to the region, which will be visited by Hillary
Rodham Clinton beginning Monday(11/16), and taking other steps to
prevent Central Americans still in their home countries from
migrating north. Many government officials predict a major
immigration crisis as a result of the hurricane's devastation.

practices that are divisive and disruptive; and an amendment that
would exclude churches condoning homosexual behavior. We set the

   GA-TOBACCO _ATLANTA _ Georgia would receive $4.6 billion over 25
years under a proposed national settlement of liability claims
against the tobacco industry. Gov-elect Barnes said he is not
prejudiced against a settlement and would prefer the money be spent
on health care rather than general tax relief. The state has one
week to decide whether to accept the settlement or pursue its own
case in court, some public health agencies are questioning why the
window is so short. The settlement would also prohibit the industry
from mar keting to kids or using outdoor advertising and would
require it to set up a website with all documents produced in
smoking-related lawsuits. (Mantius, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH _ DAY THREE
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529 was only a little
propeller-driven plane that fell in an obscure hayfield in west
Georgia: 10 people died, 19 survived. In terms of lives lost,
certainly it was not on scale with TWA Flight 800 and Swissair
Flight 111. More than 200 people died in each of those crashes. Yet
the ASA crash is writ large across many lives. Nearly two-thirds of
the people aboard survived _ a miracle gift _ and so this crash is
not only about death, but life.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reporter Gary M. Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from
Georgia to Maine to Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview
survivors of ASA Flight 529. He also canvassed investigative files
of the National Transportation Safety Board and testimony taken
during the ensuing litigation. Pomerantz vivdly describes the 9
minutes and 20 seconds of horror aboard that doomed aircraft as it
fell to earth, the fire that consumed the broken fuselage, as well
as how the tragedy has reshaped lives. This is the third day of the
seven-part series. WITH PHOTOS and ILLUSTRATIONS.
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-2NDCHANCE _ David McCorkell ran from the fuselage before
the flames set in. But images of suffering all across the hayfield
compelled the computer trainer from Minnesota to come back.
Circling closer, he heard first officer Matt Warmerdam's pleas for
help from inside the smoky cockpit. Warmerdam, trying to break
free, told McCorkell he didn't have enough room to swing his
hatchet. He passed the hatchet through a hole in the glass to
McCorkell and put his life in the hands of a man he did not know.
As McCorkell banged away, shards of glass flew into his hair and
face. Warmerdam pointed to show him where to hit. McCorkell's left
hand tired, so he switched the hatchet to his right. Black smoke
thickened as Warmerdam pressed his face to the hole, gasping for
air. Bit by bit, McCorkell widened the hole enough for Warmerdam to
stick out his head and one arm. McCorkell heard a loud pop
underneath the cockpit. A blast of heat shot at his legs, pushing
him back several steps. Scared, McCorkell wondered what to do.
``You aren't going to let me die, are you?'' Warmerdam cried out.
(Pomerantz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   METEORS _ ATLANTA _ Millions of minuscule meteorites will pepper
the Earth's upper atmosphere today as the planet makes its annual
run through the gauntlet of cosmic buckshot responsible for the
Leonid meteor shower. With the intensity of the storm expected to
be the worst in 33 years, satellite operators, paging systems,
television networks, and even the Pentagon are on high alert.

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's good news, we have a new Speaker of the House, from
Louisiana, Bob Livingston. Here's what we know about Bob
Livingston: he's from Louisiana and he's a Karate
master...President Clinton has a black belt, but it's usually down
around his ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, the Speaker of the House is a black belt in karate. The
Governor of Minnesota is a wrestler. Pretty soon, these guys will
not need Secret Service protection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations to everybody there in snowbound Minnesota: you
have a brand new governor, professional wrestler, Jesse ``The
Body'' Ventura. Jesse is already shooting his mouth off. Earlier
today, he said that he felt that President Clinton should have his
affairs in a motel instead of in the Oval Office....I believe
that's true, I think the Oval Office should be reserved exclusively
for illegal fundraising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to believe that this whole impeachment thing was
Clinton's idea -- so he could get rid of the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't kid yourself, President Clinton is not out of the woods
yet on this impeachment deal. Now, here's how this goes: Henry Hyde
sends over to President Clinton a questionnaire and he has to
answer questions about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Tough
questions -- 42 of these questions contain the word jiggly.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Question number 12 on the questionnaire that Clinton has to
answer now -- like he's under oath, question 12 is: As you are
reading question 12, are you simultaneously having sex?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one of the questions on this questionnaire President
Clinton has to answer. It goes like this: If you and a 21 year-old
intern have been having sex for three years, how old will she be
when you're impeached?' Not easy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity birthday: happy birthday to Charles Manson. That's
right -- 64 years old. Charles Manson, by the way, is the Los
Angeles killer who's not presently out playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. went nuts again yesterday. He was calling into some
television show and...he said he wants America to leave him alone.
And I'm thinking, hey, O.J., there's a great place to get away from
it all: prison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. said he never stopped trying to solve the crime. He said
he's always trying to solve the crime. He said he would have had it
solved a while ago, but now he can't remember where he hid the
knife.''

<P>
   The baseball Babe Ruth hit in 1923 for Yankee Stadium's first

   _ (Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. Simpson, back in the news again. An appeals court has
ruled that O.J.'s children should be with the grandparents. O.J. is
very upset about this. His argument is, 'Hey, I should have the
kids. I haven't killed anybody in over four years.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, you can tell it's near sweeps. The local news: you ever
notice they discover dangers you never heard of before? Our own
channel four. In an exclusive last night: 'Big Breasts: Can They
Put Your Eye Out?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Star tabloid reporting Lisa Marie Presley is obsessed over
losing Michael Jackson. She blames herself for their failed
marriage. Well, it is her fault Michael lost interest in her. Not
only is she an adult, she's a female. That's two strikes right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And as hard as it is to believe, Monica Lewinsky is actually a
nominee for Time magazine's man or woman of the year. Because it's
whoever affects change. She's one of the nominees. And I'm sure if
she could just have a minute alone with each of the judges..''
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman's got the press following her every second of the
day. According to the papers today, Monica Lewinsky bought a can of
mace. So that explains why Clinton's eyes are always red and
puffy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks ago, I stepped into a pothole crossing Madison
Avenue at 23rd Street, sprained my ankle and had it taped at a
hospital. Just as I was about to write a letter, I read that the
mayor planned to fill all the city's potholes. The article included
a telephone number to call with any sightings.
</P>
<P>
   I dialed the number, was asked to hold by a recorded voice and
after a delay of several minutes, a woman came on the phone. I told
her I wanted to report a pothole, and gave the location.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: OK, wait one minute. (She seemed to be asking someone
else in the office a question.) What borough is that in?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Wait one minute (again an aside). Is that on the East
or West Side of Manhattan?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Madison Avenue, East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Operator (again a pause): Is that 23rd Street or Avenue?
</P>
<P>
   Me (starting to get slightly exasperated): Street.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Is the pothole on the sidewalk or street?
</P>
<P>
   Me: In the crosswalk.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Oh, do you mean those two white lines?
</P>
<P>
   Me (in disbelief): Yes, that's right, that's what a crosswalk
is.
</P>
<P>
   Operator (after a brief delay): OK, dear, your pothole number is
DM98274028. You should check regularly to see if it's been
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pleased to have my own pothole number _ but where do those
operators come from?
</P>
<P>
   _ CLAUDIA BLOOM
</P>
<P>
   Hotel, theater, museums and dinners _ a perfect weekend in
Manhattan for Louise Condak Liebold and her husband, who live in
Westbury. They had finished eating at a delicatessen on Seventh
Avenue when Mrs. Liebold, addressing her spouse, said, ``What a
waste! Too bad I can't take the chicken leftovers back to the
hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The tables were extremely close, and the remark was heard by an
expensively dressed woman next to them. The woman put her hand on
Mrs. Liebold's arm. ``My apartment's nearby, so I'll take your
leftovers, if you don't mind,'' she said. The waiter heard the
exchange, swept the Liebold leftovers off the table, wrapped them
and presented them to the woman, and out she marched.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the dining experience of Emmett Evans and his wife,
from Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands, who went to the Oyster
Bar at Grand Central Terminal for a late lunch. They smiled at the
two attractive young women at the next table, sat down and ordered.
While they were enjoying their cocktails, the women got up, smiled,
paid their bill and departed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the Evanses' waiter, and a cluster of other beaming
waiters, came over. ``Those lovely ladies paid your bill,'' their
waiter announced. The couple were stunned. Why would the young
women do that? ``They said you reminded them of their parents,''
the waiter explained.
</P>
<P>
   The notice posted at the cashier's counter at Liberty Display
and Supply on West 26th Street is so popular, they've had it
photocopied to accommodate customers who start copying it down or
comment on it. ``If you are GROUCHY, IRRITABLE or just plain MEAN,
there will be a $10 charge for putting up with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schifrin recently retired after 50 years in the
wedding-ring business. One of his favorite customers was a young
woman who earlier this year chose a ring for her fiance and asked
if she could get a refund if he didn't like it. Schifrin pointed to
the sign: ``No refunds. No returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Next day she came in, fiance in tow, and showed him the ring. He
approved. What he didn't know then was that she quietly ordered
that it be engraved ``3-2-98 No refunds. No returns.''
</P>
<P>
   As my parents were discussing preparations for their 56th
wedding anniversary next January, they again recalled their wedding
day in Brooklyn in 1943 and one of my favorite stories.
</P>
<P>
   My father, a boy from Brooklyn, was wearing his first tux. My
mother, a girl from the Bronx, was wearing more chiffon than she
had ever seen in her life. As children of Italian immigrants, their
wedding was as lavish as their shoe-factory paychecks allowed _ a
real singer at the nuptial Mass, sandwiches and confetti candy in
the church hall, a formal studio portrait and a rented limousine.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the photographer's studio after the Mass, hunger
overtook the wedding pair. My father's brother, the best man, took
charge and ordered the driver to detour to Coney Island. My uncle
jumped out at Nathan's, bought four hot dogs and four sodas and ran
back to the car with his culinary treasures. Sated and satisfied,
off they sped to have their pictures taken.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I look at my parents' wedding portrait, I see two
happy, elegantly posed young people. But I like to think that I
detect a trace of mustard on my father's chin and a sprig of
sauerkraut in my mother's bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   _ LINDA LOSCHIAVO
</P>
<P>
   The westbound crosstown bus was stopped for a light at Park
Avenue when the driver announced that the bus ahead was blocked and
unable to move between Park and Madison. A woman in the back
yelled, ``Can you make a detour?'' The driver paused and then
announced: ``I can, but let's take a vote. How many want me to make
a detour?'' A loud chorus of ``yes'' followed, and annoyed
passengers were soon smiling. Roberta Altman describes it as a nice
example of democracy at work.
</P>
<P>
   Adele Zipser and her husband stopped by their daughter's
preschool class of 3- and 4-year-olds. The children were seated,
having a snack when they arrived, and their daughter, Annie,
introduced each of them by name and then said, ``Children, these
are my parents.'' The tots looked and munched, and finally a small
voice addressed the room at large: ``Why is Annie calling them
parents? They look like grandparents to me.''

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's good news, we have a new Speaker of the House, from
Louisiana, Bob Livingston. Here's what we know about Bob
Livingston: he's from Louisiana and he's a Karate
master...President Clinton has a black belt, but it's usually down
around his ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, the Speaker of the House is a black belt in karate. The
Governor of Minnesota is a wrestler. Pretty soon, these guys will
not need Secret Service protection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations to everybody there in snowbound Minnesota: you
have a brand new governor, professional wrestler, Jesse ``The
Body'' Ventura. Jesse is already shooting his mouth off. Earlier
today, he said that he felt that President Clinton should have his
affairs in a motel instead of in the Oval Office....I believe
that's true, I think the Oval Office should be reserved exclusively
for illegal fundraising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to believe that this whole impeachment thing was
Clinton's idea -- so he could get rid of the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't kid yourself, President Clinton is not out of the woods
yet on this impeachment deal. Now, here's how this goes: Henry Hyde
sends over to President Clinton a questionnaire and he has to
answer questions about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Tough
questions -- 42 of these questions contain the word jiggly.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Question number 12 on the questionnaire that Clinton has to
answer now -- like he's under oath, question 12 is: As you are
reading question 12, are you simultaneously having sex?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one of the questions on this questionnaire President
Clinton has to answer. It goes like this: If you and a 21 year-old
intern have been having sex for three years, how old will she be
when you're impeached?' Not easy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity birthday: happy birthday to Charles Manson. That's
right -- 64 years old. Charles Manson, by the way, is the Los
Angeles killer who's not presently out playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. went nuts again yesterday. He was calling into some
television show and...he said he wants America to leave him alone.
And I'm thinking, hey, O.J., there's a great place to get away from
it all: prison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. said he never stopped trying to solve the crime. He said
he's always trying to solve the crime. He said he would have had it
solved a while ago, but now he can't remember where he hid the
knife.''

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The baseball Babe Ruth hit in 1923 for Yankee Stadium's first
homer has been sold for $126,500. Think of it as $50,000 on
adrostenedione.
</P>
<P>
   _ (Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. Simpson, back in the news again. An appeals court has
ruled that O.J.'s children should be with the grandparents. O.J. is
very upset about this. His argument is, 'Hey, I should have the
kids. I haven't killed anybody in over four years.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, you can tell it's near sweeps. The local news: you ever
notice they discover dangers you never heard of before? Our own
channel four. In an exclusive last night: 'Big Breasts: Can They
Put Your Eye Out?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Star tabloid reporting Lisa Marie Presley is obsessed over
losing Michael Jackson. She blames herself for their failed
marriage. Well, it is her fault Michael lost interest in her. Not
only is she an adult, she's a female. That's two strikes right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And as hard as it is to believe, Monica Lewinsky is actually a
nominee for Time magazine's man or woman of the year. Because it's
whoever affects change. She's one of the nominees. And I'm sure if
she could just have a minute alone with each of the judges..''
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman's got the press following her every second of the
day. According to the papers today, Monica Lewinsky bought a can of
mace. So that explains why Clinton's eyes are always red and
puffy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks ago, I stepped into a pothole crossing Madison
Avenue at 23rd Street, sprained my ankle and had it taped at a
hospital. Just as I was about to write a letter, I read that the
mayor planned to fill all the city's potholes. The article included
a telephone number to call with any sightings.
</P>
<P>
   I dialed the number, was asked to hold by a recorded voice and
after a delay of several minutes, a woman came on the phone. I told
her I wanted to report a pothole, and gave the location.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: OK, wait one minute. (She seemed to be asking someone
else in the office a question.) What borough is that in?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Wait one minute (again an aside). Is that on the East
or West Side of Manhattan?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Madison Avenue, East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Operator (again a pause): Is that 23rd Street or Avenue?
</P>
<P>
   Me (starting to get slightly exasperated): Street.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Is the pothole on the sidewalk or street?
</P>
<P>
   Me: In the crosswalk.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Oh, do you mean those two white lines?
</P>
<P>
   Me (in disbelief): Yes, that's right, that's what a crosswalk
is.
</P>
<P>
   Operator (after a brief delay): OK, dear, your pothole number is
DM98274028. You should check regularly to see if it's been
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pleased to have my own pothole number _ but where do those
operators come from?
</P>
<P>
   _ CLAUDIA BLOOM
</P>
<P>
   Hotel, theater, museums and dinners _ a perfect weekend in
Manhattan for Louise Condak Liebold and her husband, who live in
Westbury. They had finished eating at a delicatessen on Seventh
Avenue when Mrs. Liebold, addressing her spouse, said, ``What a
waste! Too bad I can't take the chicken leftovers back to the
hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The tables were extremely close, and the remark was heard by an
expensively dressed woman next to them. The woman put her hand on
Mrs. Liebold's arm. ``My apartment's nearby, so I'll take your
leftovers, if you don't mind,'' she said. The waiter heard the
exchange, swept the Liebold leftovers off the table, wrapped them
and presented them to the woman, and out she marched.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the dining experience of Emmett Evans and his wife,
from Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands, who went to the Oyster
Bar at Grand Central Terminal for a late lunch. They smiled at the
two attractive young women at the next table, sat down and ordered.
While they were enjoying their cocktails, the women got up, smiled,
paid their bill and departed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the Evanses' waiter, and a cluster of other beaming
waiters, came over. ``Those lovely ladies paid your bill,'' their
waiter announced. The couple were stunned. Why would the young
women do that? ``They said you reminded them of their parents,''
the waiter explained.
</P>
<P>
   The notice posted at the cashier's counter at Liberty Display
and Supply on West 26th Street is so popular, they've had it
photocopied to accommodate customers who start copying it down or
comment on it. ``If you are GROUCHY, IRRITABLE or just plain MEAN,
there will be a $10 charge for putting up with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schifrin recently retired after 50 years in the
wedding-ring business. One of his favorite customers was a young
woman who earlier this year chose a ring for her fiance and asked
if she could get a refund if he didn't like it. Schifrin pointed to
the sign: ``No refunds. No returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Next day she came in, fiance in tow, and showed him the ring. He
approved. What he didn't know then was that she quietly ordered
that it be engraved ``3-2-98 No refunds. No returns.''
</P>
<P>
   As my parents were discussing preparations for their 56th
wedding anniversary next January, they again recalled their wedding
day in Brooklyn in 1943 and one of my favorite stories.
</P>
<P>
   My father, a boy from Brooklyn, was wearing his first tux. My
mother, a girl from the Bronx, was wearing more chiffon than she
had ever seen in her life. As children of Italian immigrants, their
wedding was as lavish as their shoe-factory paychecks allowed _ a
real singer at the nuptial Mass, sandwiches and confetti candy in
the church hall, a formal studio portrait and a rented limousine.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the photographer's studio after the Mass, hunger
overtook the wedding pair. My father's brother, the best man, took
charge and ordered the driver to detour to Coney Island. My uncle
jumped out at Nathan's, bought four hot dogs and four sodas and ran
back to the car with his culinary treasures. Sated and satisfied,
off they sped to have their pictures taken.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I look at my parents' wedding portrait, I see two
happy, elegantly posed young people. But I like to think that I
detect a trace of mustard on my father's chin and a sprig of
sauerkraut in my mother's bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   _ LINDA LOSCHIAVO
</P>
<P>
   The westbound crosstown bus was stopped for a light at Park
Avenue when the driver announced that the bus ahead was blocked and
unable to move between Park and Madison. A woman in the back
yelled, ``Can you make a detour?'' The driver paused and then
announced: ``I can, but let's take a vote. How many want me to make
a detour?'' A loud chorus of ``yes'' followed, and annoyed
passengers were soon smiling. Roberta Altman describes it as a nice
example of democracy at work.
</P>
<P>
   Adele Zipser and her husband stopped by their daughter's
preschool class of 3- and 4-year-olds. The children were seated,
having a snack when they arrived, and their daughter, Annie,
introduced each of them by name and then said, ``Children, these
are my parents.'' The tots looked and munched, and finally a small
voice addressed the room at large: ``Why is Annie calling them
parents? They look like grandparents to me.''

waiter announced. The couple were stunned. Why would the young
women do that? ``They said you reminded them of their parents,''
the waiter explained.
</P>
<P>
   The notice posted at the cashier's counter at Liberty Display
and Supply on West 26th Street is so popular, they've had it
photocopied to accommodate customers who start copying it down or
comment on it. ``If you are GROUCHY, IRRITABLE or just plain MEAN,
there will be a $10 charge for putting up with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schifrin recently retired after 50 years in the
wedding-ring business. One of his favorite customers was a young
woman who earlier this year chose a ring for her fiance and asked
if she could get a refund if he didn't like it. Schifrin pointed to
the sign: ``No refunds. No returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Next day she came in, fiance in tow, and showed him the ring. He
approved. What he didn't know then was that she quietly ordered
that it be engraved ``3-2-98 No refunds. No returns.''
</P>
<P>
   As my parents were discussing preparations for their 56th
wedding anniversary next January, they again recalled their wedding
day in Brooklyn in 1943 and one of my favorite stories.
</P>
<P>
   My father, a boy from Brooklyn, was wearing his first tux. My
mother, a girl from the Bronx, was wearing more chiffon than she
had ever seen in her life. As children of Italian immigrants, their
wedding was as lavish as their shoe-factory paychecks allowed _ a
real singer at the nuptial Mass, sandwiches and confetti candy in
the church hall, a formal studio portrait and a rented limousine.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the photographer's studio after the Mass, hunger
overtook the wedding pair. My father's brother, the best man, took
charge and ordered the driver to detour to Coney Island. My uncle
jumped out at Nathan's, bought four hot dogs and four sodas and ran
back to the car with his culinary treasures. Sated and satisfied,
off they sped to have their pictures taken.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I look at my parents' wedding portrait, I see two
happy, elegantly posed young people. But I like to think that I
detect a trace of mustard on my father's chin and a sprig of
sauerkraut in my mother's bouquet.
</P>

   The westbound crosstown bus was stopped for a light at Park
Avenue when the driver announced that the bus ahead was blocked and
unable to move between Park and Madison. A woman in the back
yelled, ``Can you make a detour?'' The driver paused and then
announced: ``I can, but let's take a vote. How many want me to make
a detour?'' A loud chorus of ``yes'' followed, and annoyed
passengers were soon smiling. Roberta Altman describes it as a nice
example of democracy at work.
</P>
<P>
   Adele Zipser and her husband stopped by their daughter's
preschool class of 3- and 4-year-olds. The children were seated,
having a snack when they arrived, and their daughter, Annie,
introduced each of them by name and then said, ``Children, these
are my parents.'' The tots looked and munched, and finally a small
voice addressed the room at large: ``Why is Annie calling them
parents? They look like grandparents to me.''

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's good news, we have a new Speaker of the House, from
Louisiana, Bob Livingston. Here's what we know about Bob
Livingston: he's from Louisiana and he's a Karate
master...President Clinton has a black belt, but it's usually down
around his ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, the Speaker of the House is a black belt in karate. The
Governor of Minnesota is a wrestler. Pretty soon, these guys will
not need Secret Service protection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations to everybody there in snowbound Minnesota: you
have a brand new governor, professional wrestler, Jesse ``The
Body'' Ventura. Jesse is already shooting his mouth off. Earlier
today, he said that he felt that President Clinton should have his
affairs in a motel instead of in the Oval Office....I believe
that's true, I think the Oval Office should be reserved exclusively
for illegal fundraising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to believe that this whole impeachment thing was
Clinton's idea -- so he could get rid of the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't kid yourself, President Clinton is not out of the woods
yet on this impeachment deal. Now, here's how this goes: Henry Hyde
sends over to President Clinton a questionnaire and he has to
answer questions about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Tough
questions -- 42 of these questions contain the word jiggly.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Question number 12 on the questionnaire that Clinton has to
answer now -- like he's under oath, question 12 is: As you are
reading question 12, are you simultaneously having sex?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one of the questions on this questionnaire President
Clinton has to answer. It goes like this: If you and a 21 year-old
intern have been having sex for three years, how old will she be
when you're impeached?' Not easy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity birthday: happy birthday to Charles Manson. That's
right -- 64 years old. Charles Manson, by the way, is the Los
Angeles killer who's not presently out playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. went nuts again yesterday. He was calling into some
television show and...he said he wants America to leave him alone.
And I'm thinking, hey, O.J., there's a great place to get away from
it all: prison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. said he never stopped trying to solve the crime. He said
he's always trying to solve the crime. He said he would have had it
solved a while ago, but now he can't remember where he hid the
knife.''

</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. Simpson, back in the news again. An appeals court has
ruled that O.J.'s children should be with the grandparents. O.J. is
very upset about this. His argument is, 'Hey, I should have the
kids. I haven't killed anybody in over four years.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, you can tell it's near sweeps. The local news: you ever
notice they discover dangers you never heard of before? Our own
channel four. In an exclusive last night: 'Big Breasts: Can They
Put Your Eye Out?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Star tabloid reporting Lisa Marie Presley is obsessed over
losing Michael Jackson. She blames herself for their failed
marriage. Well, it is her fault Michael lost interest in her. Not
only is she an adult, she's a female. That's two strikes right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And as hard as it is to believe, Monica Lewinsky is actually a
nominee for Time magazine's man or woman of the year. Because it's
whoever affects change. She's one of the nominees. And I'm sure if
she could just have a minute alone with each of the judges..''
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman's got the press following her every second of the
day. According to the papers today, Monica Lewinsky bought a can of
mace. So that explains why Clinton's eyes are always red and
puffy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks ago, I stepped into a pothole crossing Madison
Avenue at 23rd Street, sprained my ankle and had it taped at a
hospital. Just as I was about to write a letter, I read that the
mayor planned to fill all the city's potholes. The article included
a telephone number to call with any sightings.
</P>
<P>
   I dialed the number, was asked to hold by a recorded voice and
after a delay of several minutes, a woman came on the phone. I told
her I wanted to report a pothole, and gave the location.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: OK, wait one minute. (She seemed to be asking someone
else in the office a question.) What borough is that in?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Wait one minute (again an aside). Is that on the East
or West Side of Manhattan?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Madison Avenue, East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Operator (again a pause): Is that 23rd Street or Avenue?
</P>
<P>
   Me (starting to get slightly exasperated): Street.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Is the pothole on the sidewalk or street?
</P>
<P>
   Me: In the crosswalk.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Oh, do you mean those two white lines?
</P>
<P>
   Me (in disbelief): Yes, that's right, that's what a crosswalk
is.
</P>
<P>
   Operator (after a brief delay): OK, dear, your pothole number is
DM98274028. You should check regularly to see if it's been
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pleased to have my own pothole number _ but where do those
operators come from?

   Hotel, theater, museums and dinners _ a perfect weekend in
Manhattan for Louise Condak Liebold and her husband, who live in
Westbury. They had finished eating at a delicatessen on Seventh
Avenue when Mrs. Liebold, addressing her spouse, said, ``What a
waste! Too bad I can't take the chicken leftovers back to the
hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The tables were extremely close, and the remark was heard by an
expensively dressed woman next to them. The woman put her hand on
Mrs. Liebold's arm. ``My apartment's nearby, so I'll take your
leftovers, if you don't mind,'' she said. The waiter heard the
exchange, swept the Liebold leftovers off the table, wrapped them
and presented them to the woman, and out she marched.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the dining experience of Emmett Evans and his wife,
from Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands, who went to the Oyster
Bar at Grand Central Terminal for a late lunch. They smiled at the
two attractive young women at the next table, sat down and ordered.
While they were enjoying their cocktails, the women got up, smiled,
paid their bill and departed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the Evanses' waiter, and a cluster of other beaming

 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McPhee, 67, a New Yorker writer best known for taking long
looks at small things, has recently published ``Annals of the
Former World,'' a 696-page look at the geologic history of a large
thing: North American.
</P>
<P>
   In that work, which took McPhee much of the last 20 years to
produce, he and other geologists travel from the Newark Basin to
the San Andreas Fault as they uncover the prehistory of the land.
The book is published by Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux ($35).
</P>
<P>
   McPhee spoke with Science Times recently from his offices at
Princeton University, where he is a professor of nonfiction
writing. He said he devoted himself to the Annals because he found
geologists and what they do a ``completely engrossing subject.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How did a 20-year book project on geology change
your perception of the world?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I came to look at rocks literally, specifically. For
instance, looking at an outcrop by a road: It's not what it appears
to be. It's not what it used to look like. Its history is embedded
in its rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that changes on a project like this is your sense
of time. We live in such a whisper of time. Developing a sense of
geologic time is frightening. Initially, you come up against
numbers that are so large that they don't really mean a lot to you
_ even if they differ by millions of years. But once you get a
sense of that, when you realize that one million years is really a
short unit in the history of the earth, that the earth is marching
along and constantly changing in its own time scale, you come to
feel absolutely insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of that is that you feel a little less disturbed
about the human condition. I think it helps in your contemplation
of death. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Science writers often have trouble making the
vastness of time comprehensible to readers. How did you do it?(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. You use analogies, a lot. Also, if you just live with this
problem long enough, you come to see it. You realize that the time
of the dinosaurs is very, very recent, comparatively. It's only 65
million years ago. The earth is 4.6 billion years old. Once you've
grasped that, you can close your eyes and really sense the motions
of collision and mountain-building and oceans appearing and
disappearing. You can see it going by, in your mind. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Give us a geologic description of the place we're
talking from this moment: East Pyne Hall, in Princeton, N.J.?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, Princeton is in something called the Newark Basin. Two
hundred million years ago, there was country here that was part of
a super continent and got active and started to pull apart. The
earth's crust pulled apart here and broke into blocks separated by
basins, and the largest separation is now 3,000 miles wide: the
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   All up and down Eastern America are places where the earth
pulled apart and basins formed and sediments poured into them from
all sides. The Newark Basin is one of them. The rock surrounding
the Newark Basin is 400 million years old, or older.
</P>
<P>
   This rock here in Princeton is only a 150 million years old
because it's the sediment that fell into the basin. Most of it fell
into a great big lake that formed here in the basin and lasted
eight million years.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau Hall, the building next door, is made of Stockton
sandstone, which came from down the hill by the lake a mile away
and was quarried in 1756 or something like that _ very local rock.
It was stuff that fell into that lake that I've been describing.
The library is Wissahickon schist and it doesn't come from here. It
was lugged in trucks from Pennsylvania. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)When you walk around town, or drive on a road, do
you now deconstruct the composition of every building you see?(end
italics) &QL; 
A. Do I do that? Yeah. Ask my wife. She says she'll allow me to do
that 10 minutes a day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Tell us about geologists _ you hung out for two
decades and traveled from coast to coast with them _ is there such
a thing as a geology-type?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, beyond the fact that they tend to carry hammers, wear
railroad engineers' hats and wool shirts and jeans and scuffed
boots and carry Brunton compasses, no.
</P>
<P>
   One generalization I will make is that geology often enough
attracts people who originally were trained in another science.
They seem to get drawn to it because geology is eclectic. Geology
involves physics, biology, chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Morgan, one of the signal people in this or any other
science, got his PhD in physics. He's one of the cornerstones of
plate tectonics. Ken Deffeyes, who I did much traveling with, was a
chemist and then became a geochemist. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)One gets the sense that within the academy, geology
is looked at as a slightly inferior science because it is not so
theoretical _ it is, in fact, quite earthbound.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, that could be, although that aspect is arresting. On
the other hand, geologists developed plate theory in the 1960s. In
a period of eight years, a series of papers were published that
absolutely revolutionized our understanding of the earth _
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, nobody knew that mountains were built by
intercontinental collisions, that oceans were formed by extensional
disassembling of a piece of the earth, which eventually opens up
like the Red Sea. Anyway, this stuff was unknown before these
people performed the scientific revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But, supporting your theory, the number of geology majors in
many a university's undergraduate population probably will be
influenced by the price of oil. The fact that this subject is so
interesting per se does not cause universities to roll over and
increase their budgets for geology departments. Academic geology is
very much related to the world of mining and oil and so forth. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You seem to enjoy geology-humor. Do geologists have
a witty side?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Geologists are fond of puns. And it doesn't seem to be very
conscious. I've pointed this out to some of them, and they scratch
their heads. For example, one of their primary journals is called
GSA Today. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why do they refer to the Pocono Mountains as ``the
so-called Pocono Mountains?''(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They don't. I do. In my book. Because they aren't mountains.
The Poconos are a flat-lying plateau that's dissected by streams.
The Catskill story is the same. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is it difficult to develop narratives about
rocks?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I find it very difficult. Well, I find it very difficult to
write about anything. It's particularly hard when you are trying to
grasp something that is virtually in another language and then try
to describe it in a way that will make sense to someone else not
trained in the field. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is it true that in your past you'd tie yourself to a
chair in order to write?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Once. In the 1950s. I had a captain's chair with spindles and
I sat in there by a typewriter and tried to write. One day, I took
the sash from a bathrobe and tied it between the spindles and then
around my waist. I did it three or four times. I abandoned that. It
didn't work. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Back to geology, do you think most modern
city-dwellers underestimate nature?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh yeah. The seashore is full of people trying to stop nature
in her tracks, and she doesn't want to stop. Coney Island wants to
go South. Hatteras Light is sitting on ground that wants to move.
But we feel it's a National Historic Site _ so we're spending
millions of dollars to fight a battle that probably is not
winnable. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)When you think about all this, does it make you
religious?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm really impressed. This subject that I have worked on for
20 years is nothing more or less than describing the earth and the
people who study it. And why am I doing that? Well, this is the
only earth I'm ever going to live on, and I find it an interesting
place.

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's good news, we have a new Speaker of the House, from
Louisiana, Bob Livingston. Here's what we know about Bob
Livingston: he's from Louisiana and he's a Karate
master...President Clinton has a black belt, but it's usually down
around his ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, the Speaker of the House is a black belt in karate. The
Governor of Minnesota is a wrestler. Pretty soon, these guys will
not need Secret Service protection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations to everybody there in snowbound Minnesota: you
have a brand new governor, professional wrestler, Jesse ``The
Body'' Ventura. Jesse is already shooting his mouth off. Earlier
today, he said that he felt that President Clinton should have his
affairs in a motel instead of in the Oval Office....I believe
that's true, I think the Oval Office should be reserved exclusively
for illegal fundraising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to believe that this whole impeachment thing was
Clinton's idea -- so he could get rid of the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't kid yourself, President Clinton is not out of the woods
yet on this impeachment deal. Now, here's how this goes: Henry Hyde
sends over to President Clinton a questionnaire and he has to
answer questions about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Tough
questions -- 42 of these questions contain the word jiggly.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Question number 12 on the questionnaire that Clinton has to
answer now -- like he's under oath, question 12 is: As you are
reading question 12, are you simultaneously having sex?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one of the questions on this questionnaire President
Clinton has to answer. It goes like this: If you and a 21 year-old
intern have been having sex for three years, how old will she be
when you're impeached?' Not easy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity birthday: happy birthday to Charles Manson. That's
right -- 64 years old. Charles Manson, by the way, is the Los
Angeles killer who's not presently out playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. went nuts again yesterday. He was calling into some
television show and...he said he wants America to leave him alone.
And I'm thinking, hey, O.J., there's a great place to get away from
it all: prison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. said he never stopped trying to solve the crime. He said
he's always trying to solve the crime. He said he would have had it
solved a while ago, but now he can't remember where he hid the
knife.''

   ``O.J. Simpson, back in the news again. An appeals court has

very upset about this. His argument is, 'Hey, I should have the

</P>
<P>
   ``The Star tabloid reporting Lisa Marie Presley is obsessed over
losing Michael Jackson. She blames herself for their failed
marriage. Well, it is her fault Michael lost interest in her. Not
only is she an adult, she's a female. That's two strikes right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And as hard as it is to believe, Monica Lewinsky is actually a
nominee for Time magazine's man or woman of the year. Because it's
whoever affects change. She's one of the nominees. And I'm sure if
she could just have a minute alone with each of the judges..''
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman's got the press following her every second of the
day. According to the papers today, Monica Lewinsky bought a can of
mace. So that explains why Clinton's eyes are always red and
puffy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks ago, I stepped into a pothole crossing Madison
Avenue at 23rd Street, sprained my ankle and had it taped at a
hospital. Just as I was about to write a letter, I read that the
mayor planned to fill all the city's potholes. The article included
a telephone number to call with any sightings.
</P>
<P>
   I dialed the number, was asked to hold by a recorded voice and
after a delay of several minutes, a woman came on the phone. I told
her I wanted to report a pothole, and gave the location.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: OK, wait one minute. (She seemed to be asking someone
else in the office a question.) What borough is that in?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Wait one minute (again an aside). Is that on the East
or West Side of Manhattan?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Madison Avenue, East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Operator (again a pause): Is that 23rd Street or Avenue?
</P>
<P>
   Me (starting to get slightly exasperated): Street.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Is the pothole on the sidewalk or street?
</P>
<P>
   Me: In the crosswalk.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Oh, do you mean those two white lines?
</P>
<P>
   Me (in disbelief): Yes, that's right, that's what a crosswalk
is.
</P>
<P>
   Operator (after a brief delay): OK, dear, your pothole number is
DM98274028. You should check regularly to see if it's been
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pleased to have my own pothole number _ but where do those
operators come from?
</P>
<P>
   _ CLAUDIA BLOOM
</P>
<P>
   Hotel, theater, museums and dinners _ a perfect weekend in
Manhattan for Louise Condak Liebold and her husband, who live in
Westbury. They had finished eating at a delicatessen on Seventh
Avenue when Mrs. Liebold, addressing her spouse, said, ``What a
waste! Too bad I can't take the chicken leftovers back to the
hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The tables were extremely close, and the remark was heard by an
expensively dressed woman next to them. The woman put her hand on
Mrs. Liebold's arm. ``My apartment's nearby, so I'll take your
leftovers, if you don't mind,'' she said. The waiter heard the
exchange, swept the Liebold leftovers off the table, wrapped them
and presented them to the woman, and out she marched.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the dining experience of Emmett Evans and his wife,
from Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands, who went to the Oyster
Bar at Grand Central Terminal for a late lunch. They smiled at the
two attractive young women at the next table, sat down and ordered.
While they were enjoying their cocktails, the women got up, smiled,
paid their bill and departed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the Evanses' waiter, and a cluster of other beaming
waiters, came over. ``Those lovely ladies paid your bill,'' their
waiter announced. The couple were stunned. Why would the young
women do that? ``They said you reminded them of their parents,''
the waiter explained.
</P>
<P>
   The notice posted at the cashier's counter at Liberty Display
and Supply on West 26th Street is so popular, they've had it
photocopied to accommodate customers who start copying it down or
comment on it. ``If you are GROUCHY, IRRITABLE or just plain MEAN,
there will be a $10 charge for putting up with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schifrin recently retired after 50 years in the
wedding-ring business. One of his favorite customers was a young
woman who earlier this year chose a ring for her fiance and asked
if she could get a refund if he didn't like it. Schifrin pointed to
the sign: ``No refunds. No returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Next day she came in, fiance in tow, and showed him the ring. He
approved. What he didn't know then was that she quietly ordered
that it be engraved ``3-2-98 No refunds. No returns.''
</P>
<P>
   As my parents were discussing preparations for their 56th
wedding anniversary next January, they again recalled their wedding
day in Brooklyn in 1943 and one of my favorite stories.
</P>
<P>
   My father, a boy from Brooklyn, was wearing his first tux. My
mother, a girl from the Bronx, was wearing more chiffon than she
had ever seen in her life. As children of Italian immigrants, their
wedding was as lavish as their shoe-factory paychecks allowed _ a
real singer at the nuptial Mass, sandwiches and confetti candy in
the church hall, a formal studio portrait and a rented limousine.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the photographer's studio after the Mass, hunger
overtook the wedding pair. My father's brother, the best man, took
charge and ordered the driver to detour to Coney Island. My uncle
jumped out at Nathan's, bought four hot dogs and four sodas and ran
back to the car with his culinary treasures. Sated and satisfied,
off they sped to have their pictures taken.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I look at my parents' wedding portrait, I see two
happy, elegantly posed young people. But I like to think that I
detect a trace of mustard on my father's chin and a sprig of
sauerkraut in my mother's bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   _ LINDA LOSCHIAVO
</P>
<P>
   The westbound crosstown bus was stopped for a light at Park
Avenue when the driver announced that the bus ahead was blocked and
unable to move between Park and Madison. A woman in the back
yelled, ``Can you make a detour?'' The driver paused and then
announced: ``I can, but let's take a vote. How many want me to make
a detour?'' A loud chorus of ``yes'' followed, and annoyed
passengers were soon smiling. Roberta Altman describes it as a nice
example of democracy at work.
</P>
<P>
   Adele Zipser and her husband stopped by their daughter's
preschool class of 3- and 4-year-olds. The children were seated,
having a snack when they arrived, and their daughter, Annie,
introduced each of them by name and then said, ``Children, these
are my parents.'' The tots looked and munched, and finally a small
voice addressed the room at large: ``Why is Annie calling them
parents? They look like grandparents to me.''

 &HT;    TED TURNER FOR PRESIDENT?
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So what does the political class think about CNN
founder Ted Turner pondering a presidential campaign?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding? It'd sure make it more interesting,''
exclaimed Larry Sabato, author of ``Feeding Frenzy,'' a book about
the 1996 presidential campaign, and a political science professor
at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have to be as a Democrat. The Republicans aren't
going to make Jane Fonda the First Lady. I'm not sure Democrats
would either,'' said Sabato. ``He probably wouldn't get a
mainstream party nomination, so he's got to be thinking about the
Reform Party. It's got to be the Jesse Ventura model.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the notion of a sarcastic, Southern-fried media mogul
with no political experience running for president might seem more
outlandish if a former professional wrestler hadn't just been
elected governor of Minnesota in his first try at elective office.
</P>
<P>
   And Gov.-elect Ventura isn't the only role model in the
Turner-for-president scenario. Ross Perot has certainly shown that
a controversial billionaire who speaks his mind and spends his
money can mount a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotline _ an electronic tip sheet for political junkies _
took note Monday of the New Yorker magazine quoting Turner as
saying ``I am very serious about running for president, but Jane
doesn't want me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Fonda, Turner's wife, has been a villain for three decades
to conservatives who remember the actress as ``Hanoi Jane'' for her
anti-war activism during the Vietnam era. The likelihood of her
campaigning her husband in a GOP primary does seem unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the Democrats?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing to say at this point,'' said Tony
Wyche, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. ``We're
heard that he's said that he's interested, but we don't know if,
how or what.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post reported that ``the specter of the 60-year-old
billionaire throwing his hat in the ring is sure to be a hot potato
for the nation's top politicos, who are well aware of his
jaw-dropping ramblings over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Turner Broadcasting's office of corporate affairs
long to officially respond to the New Yorker piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did say it, but it was just in talking,'' Turner
spokesperson Phillip Evans told the Atlanta Journal and
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The official Turner response? ``At the present time, Mr. Turner
has no plans to announce his candidacy for president.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the nation's capital wasn't exactly abuzz Monday with
rumors of a Ted Turner presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work for CNN and this is the first I've heard about it,''
said William Schneider, a political analyst with the cable news
network and the American Enterprise Institute.

GORE REBUKES MALAYSIA FOR REPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
 (htv) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Vice President Al Gore rebuked the
Malaysian government for suppressing freedom and championed the
growing protest movement here Monday as tensions between the United
States and Malaysia boiled over at a meeting of Pacific Rim
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, standing in for President Clinton at the annual meeting of
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, praised Malaysians who
have rallied against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as ``brave
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracies have done better in coping with economic crises
than nations where freedom is suppressed,'' Gore said in a speech.
``Democracy confers a stamp of legitimacy that reforms must have in
order to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, among nations suffering economic crises, we continue
to hear calls for democracy, calls for reform in many languages _
people's power, doi moi, reformasi,'' he said, referring to the
slogans of reform movements in the Philippines, Vietnam and
Malaysia. ``We hear them today, right here, right now, among the
brave people of Malaysia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reformasi,'' or reform, is the rallying cry of protesters who
are demanding the resignation of Mahathir. The Prime Minister has
been the object of searing criticism for ousting and imprisoning
his reform-minded deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is being tried on
sex-related and corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Though few protesters have taken to the heavily guarded streets
of Kuala Lumpur this week, the Anwar case has poisoned the
atmosphere at a meeting of leaders who were trying to focus on the
crushing economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's broadside against his Malaysian hosts eclipsed his
announcement that the United States and Japan would jointly pledge
$10 billion in financing to help rebuild Asia's shattered banks and
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is the first major collaboration of the United States
and Japan in confronting the Asian crisis. And it comes after the
two countries sparred over lowering trade barriers in the region.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, though, the rancor was entirely between the United
States and Malaysia. Prime Minister Mahathir and other top
officials were in the audience during Gore's speech, and his words
drew a sulfurous reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most disgusting speech I've heard in my life,''
Rafidah Aziz, the Malaysian trade minister, said to a group of
reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The ill will between the United States and Malaysia has been
building since this meeting began. When Clinton, who started these
gatherings six years ago, canceled his visit because of the Iraq
crisis, some people here interpreted it as a convenient excuse to
avoid coming to a country in disfavor.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Rafidah clashed publicly with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who met with the wife of Anwar, Wan Azizah Wan
Ismail, during her 24-hour visit here. At a news conference,
Albright expressed ``great concern'' over Anwar's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   After insisting that Anwar would receive a fair trial, Rafidah
said she would like to meet Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel
who is investigating Clinton, on her next visit to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not in jail,'' replied a stone-faced Albright.
</P>
<P>
   American officials are not the only visitors who have sought to
make an issue of Anwar's plight. The President of the Philippines,
Joseph Estrada, met with Anwar's wife Monday, and on Saturday, the
Canadian Foreign Minister, Lloyd Axworthy, also met Wan Azizah.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir has bitterly criticized visitors for meddling in
Malaysia's internal affairs, and people who watched him Monday
night during Gore's speech said he appeared deeply offended by the
Vice President's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Although several hundred people milled outside the convention
center while Gore spoke _ a typical prelude to a demonstration in
this country _ the crowd did not coalesce and eventually dispersed.
Red water-cannon trucks were parked prominently around the
building.
</P>
<P>
   After Gore's speech, American and Japanese officials struggled
to switch the focus to their new financing package. Under the terms
of the plan, the United States has pledged to contribute $5 billion
worth of trade financing and insurance to help bolster the efforts
of governments in Thailand, South Korea, and Indonesia to
recapitalize their debt-stricken banks and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Another $5 billion is to be provided by a separate Asian
recovery fund, officials said. Japan has agreed to commit $3
billion to that fund, which is also to include money from the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has rebuffed previous Japanese proposals for
an Asian recovery fund. But officials of both countries noted that
the nature of the financial crisis has changed from a
panic-inducing meltdown of currencies and government reserves to a
more chronic, grinding recession.
</P>
<P>
   To revive commercial activity, Gore said the United States
needed to work with Japan and other countries. ``Just as today's
economic crises are global in scope, the solutions must be global
as well,'' Gore said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A senior American official conceded, however, that it would be
several more weeks before the United States and Japan even agreed
on the mechanics of the plan. And given the scope of the economic
devastation, he said the plan should not be regarded a silver
bullet to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be a `Big Bang' solution for the region's
problems,'' said the official, who spoke on condition that he not
be identified. ``It is a modest, quite sensible set of proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   With its emphasis on recovery rather than rescue, the proposal
is in keeping with the tone of this meeting, which, aside from the
political pyrotechnics, has been marked by subdued reflection on
the costs of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea said his country had to
bear much of the responsibility for its currency collapse in July
1997, which devastated Korea's economy and left it within a whisker
of defaulting on its loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know why and how the crisis came,'' Kim said candidly.
``It was because of the collusive ties between politics and
businesses, government-controlled financing, and widespread
corruption.''
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An area of light snow accompanying weak low pressure will slide
eastward into parts of southern Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire
on Tuesday. Accumulations will generally be light, though some
areas will receive several inches by dusk. Meanwhile, clouds and
periods of cold rain will overspread southeast New England, while
patchy drizzle and flurries linger in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the dull, chilly weather over New England, high
pressure will grace the southern Middle Atlantic States and the
interior Southeast with sunshine and mild temperatures. The
exception to the tranquil weather will occur from Florida to
eastern Texas, where residual clouds and fog from a waning
disturbance will dim the sunshine at times.
</P>
<P>
   Ample clouds and seasonably cold weather will lie to the north
of a front from Michigan to North Dakota. Farther south, clouds and
breezes from the south will increase in the central Plains as a
vigorous storm forges through the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will accompany the storm in the mountains and across the
plains of Montana, while rain showers fall in the valleys of Utah,
Idaho and Nevada. Preceding the storm, very windy conditions will
occur in some areas to the east of the Front Range in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The deserts of the Southwest will continue to be dry and
seasonable, while an onshore flow of cool, moist air supports
showers near the coast from central California to Washington. Snow
will fall in the Cascades and northern Sierras, with some areas
receiving over a foot of accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Coastal Storms
</P>
<P>
   An intense low-pressure system near the mouth of the St.
Lawrence River produced pockets of heavy snow and strong winds over
parts of the Canadian Maritimes on Monday. The storm system, like
all middle-latitude lows, derived its energy from contrasts in
temperature, which in November can become quite large between the
land mass of eastern Canada and offshore Atlantic waters. In time,
as winter's chill winds reach southward, natural contrasts between
ocean and land will serve as fertile breeding ground for storms
along the U.S. East Coast, setting the stage for infamous
northeasters.

LABOR-INDUCING DRUG WAS DEVELOPED AS AN ANTACID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 42 weeks gestation, Mary Margaret Myers of Dallas says she
was more than ready to have her baby _ but her cervix was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby just didn't seem to want to come out,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   When her doctor suggested it would be in the baby's best
interest to induce labor, the mother readily agreed. She and her
husband, Chris, checked into Presbyterian Hospital shortly after
midnight on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nurse gave me a tiny little pill, inserted vaginally, at
about 1 a.m., and then gave me another at 4 a.m. By 5 a.m., all
hell had broken loose,'' Myers recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Myers was awakened by severe cramps in her lower abdomen, and
she quickly dilated to 4 centimeters. By 7 a.m. she was having
strong, rhythmic contractions, and a few minutes after noon, she
gave birth to her first baby _ a healthy boy named Matthew, who
weighed in at 8 pounds, 1 ounce.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny little pill that prompted Myers' labor was Cytotec.
Originally developed to reduce stomach acid and prevent ulcers, the
drug (pronounced ``SITE-oh-tek'') is now being used by doctors to
soften the cervix, trigger contractions and induce labor in women
who are ready to deliver their babies.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cytotec's contraction-causing effects have been known
for years _ indeed, the packaging contains warning labels that the
drug should not be used by pregnant women because it can cause
contractions that lead to miscarriage _ the idea of using the drug
as a labor inducer is being met with increasing enthusiasm by both
patients and some doctors across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was great,'' said Myers. ``When you're two weeks
past your due date and ready to have your baby, you're just
grateful for any help.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers' obstetrician agrees. ``This is great stuff,'' said Dr.
Jeffrey Thurston. ``We have about 45 doctors who deliver babies
here at Presbyterian, and we've been using it for about six months.
We all love it. It seems to work great, and there's no comparison
in cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of Cytotec as an agent for inducing labor note that
it is quicker and much less expensive than other drugs used to
prepare for birth. It also has milder side effects and often
launches contractions that make it unnecessary to administer a more
traditional Pitocin IV drip to induce labor, said Dr. Tracy Papa, a
maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the University of North Texas
Health Science Center in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who come in for cervical ripening the night before they
are scheduled for induction often deliver in the middle of the
night on their own, after we give them Cytotec,'' Papa said. ``It
definitely shortens labor, and often nothing else is required. You
either use no Pitocin or less of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cytotec is a prostaglandin, or hormonelike drug, developed to
reduce the production of stomach acid and protect the stomach
lining, especially in people who are taking nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen
(Motrin, Nuprin, Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) for long periods.
Doctors usually require a pregnancy test before they will prescribe
Cytotec (misoprostol) for women of child-bearing age, and women who
are taking it are asked to quit and contact their doctors
immediately if they suspect they may have become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The drug received Food and Drug Administration approval in 1989
as an antacid. It has not been approved for the purpose of inducing
labor, though for about five years in this country, it has been
used for exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   For some doctors, this is a cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one problem cited with using Cytotec in women who
are ready to deliver is that it can actually work too well, causing
contractions that are so long and strong, or so close together,
that the baby is put at risk, said Dr. Michael Lucas, assistant
professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical School in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blood supply is cut off while the uterus is in spasm. The
baby can be squeezed to death,'' Lucas said. ``Or a very long,
prolonged contraction potentially can rupture the uterus.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   The smallest marketed dose of Cytotec is a tiny, 100 microgram
pill, which Lucas said must be broken up for use in the labor room
because it can cause contractions that are too strong. A whole pill
could also cause hypertonic (spastic) dysfunctional labor, Lucas
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some problems with chopping up pills meant to be taken
orally and using them vaginally,'' said Lucas, ``but a lot of
people are using it because it is cheap and basically doesn't take
much attention. You just put it in and wait,'' he said. ``It's not
a magic bullet, but it does have an effect on uterine
contractions.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind the use of Cytotec and other cervix-ripening
agents is that they can decrease the need for Caesarean sections by
dilating and effacing, or thinning, the cervix so that it merges
with the rest of the uterus and opens to deliver the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agents used to ripen the cervix are meant to reduce the number
of C-sections, but they haven't had much impact on the C-section
rate,'' Lucas said. ``What they have done is cut back on the use of
Pitocin by triggering spontaneous labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting back on Pitocin, the drug most widely used to induce
labor, may be, some experts say, a good thing. The drug is more
difficult to administer than Cytotec because it is infused through
an IV line with a nurse closely monitoring the mother and baby.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cytotec is absorbed better vaginally than orally, a
recent study reported in the October issue of Obstetrics &AMP;
Gynecology shows that the drug is effective in inducing labor when
taken in either manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a good cervical ripening agent,'' Papa said. ``The
others we have are much less predictable and much more expensive _
probably 100 times as much.''
</P>
<P>
   At one Fort Worth pharmacy, for example, 60 100-microgram
Cytotec tablets cost $42.29, or about 70 cents each. In obstetrics,
doctors are using 25 to 50 micrograms. By contrast, two other drugs
approved to ripen the cervix cost $70 to $100 each.
</P>
<P>
   The low cost, combined with Cytotec's track record in quickly
bringing on labor, seems to explain the rising popularity of the
drug in labor and delivery rooms across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results have been very encouraging,'' Papa said. ``Now no
one wants to use anything else.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a biographer wanted to write about a spectacular comeback
from notoriety to respectability, and the tenuous nature of
comebacks, a good subject might be nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   After denouncing nicotine for its highly addictive properties,
which hook people on tobacco, scientists have begun to rehabilitate
it, not only as a means of helping smokers to break their habit,
but also as a potential treatment for a variety of other disorders,
including stress, the intestinal condition ulcerative colitis,
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, attention deficit
disorder and Tourette's syndrome, the disorder in which people make
involuntary movements and unwanted sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nicotine-replacement products, developed to help people quit
smoking, used to consist only of chewing gum and skin patches, but
now a nasal spray is available by prescription, as well as a
product called an inhaler, which is really a fake cigarette made of
plastic that a person sucks to get a dose of menthol-flavored
nicotine into the mouth and throat, but not the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, doctors are awaiting the approval of a nicotine
tablet that patients will dissolve under their tongues to help
fight their craving. In all the products, the nicotine is extracted
from tobacco leaves.
</P>
<P>
   But just as nicotine approaches the edges of respectability, a
few researchers have begun to raise caution flags. Although all
agree that replacement nicotine is safer than smoking, and worth
some risk if it helps a person quit, a few are beginning to worry
that some smokers are using nicotine products not just for the
short periods the products were designed for, but for years.
</P>
<P>
   They fear this use will only increase if nicotine products
proliferate and if more become available over the counter, as the
patches and gum already are. And if nicotine or drugs chemically
related to it do come into use to treat chronic diseases, the
researchers say, there may be important side effects to take into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies directed by Dr. Bianca Conti-Fine, a professor of
biochemistry and pharmacology at the University of Minnesota in
Minneapolis-St. Paul, suggest that nicotine can damage cells that
line blood vessels and the airways in the lungs. Papers by Dr.
Conti-Fine and her colleagues were published last month in the
Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, and this
month in Molecular Pharmacology.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which have raised concerns about the products
among some other researchers in the field, have led Dr. Conti-Fine
to warn that nicotine patches, gum and other similar products may
not be safe if they are used beyond the three to six months
recommended for smoking cessation. The nicotine-replacement
products are clearly safer than smoking, she said, and are worth
using if they help a person quit. But the use should not go on
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a smoker, I would certainly take the replacement for
a while, but not forever,'' Dr. Conti-Fine said. ``Long-term usage
might have the potential to cause problems, and I think it should
be looked at with great caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Her warning extended to proposals to use nicotine over a long
term to treat disorders like Alzheimer's disease and attention
deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   In studies of cells grown in the laboratory, she and her
colleagues have found that cells lining the blood vessels and lungs
carry nicotine receptors, molecules on the cell surface that link
up with nicotine, which can then disrupt the cells.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the receptors bind to a signaling molecule,
acetylcholine, which plays an essential role in stimulating the
cells to maintain their shape and connection to each other. As Dr.
Conti-Fine described it, the cells that line the lungs, blood
vessels and other surfaces in the body exist in a stretched and
flattened shape and butt up against one another like floor tiles.
By activating its receptor, acetylcholine directs the cells to
stretch and flatten.
</P>
<P>
   When nicotine parks at the receptor in acetylcholine's place, it
initially activates the receptor, but then causes it to stop
working, a process called desensitization. When that occurs, the
signal to stretch is broken, and the cell balls up. ``It rips off
its connection with neighboring cells, and you make a hole,'' said
Dr. Conti-Fine.
</P>
<P>
   In the blood vessels, she said, those holes may result in
lesions that develop into artery disease. In the lungs, the holes
may lead to bronchitis, and in smokers the holes may help other,
cancer-causing chemicals in cigarette smoke to penetrate the cells.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Conti-Fine said she was particularly concerned about
``smokeless cigarettes,'' RJR Nabisco's Eclipse and Philip Morris
Cos.' Accord, which are being marketed in some parts of the United
States. The products release nicotine by heating tobacco rather
than burning it, and are marketed as safer than cigarettes because
they expose the lungs to far lower low levels of tars and other
dangerous combustion products.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Conti-Fine said that if, as her studies suggest,
nicotine itself is harmful, then people who use the smokeless
products still risk lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   Nicotine gum and patches do not expose the lungs to much
nicotine, even from the bloodstream, Dr. Conti-Fine said, so its
damaging effects on the lungs are unlikely to show up in people who
use those products and do not smoke. But the replacement products
would expose the blood vessels to nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very strong circumstantial evidence that nicotine
would have a direct, facilitating action on atherosclerosis,'' Dr.
Conti-Fine said.
</P>
<P>
   To some researchers, the circumstantial nature of the evidence
is a problem, particularly because there is no evidence from
studies in people that nicotine gum or patches do any damage. And
scientists have been on the lookout for harmful effects, especially
on the heart and arteries.
</P>
<P>
   A large study published in 1996 found no ill effects from
nicotine gum, even among men who had used it regularly for five
years. Another study showed no health problems in men who wore
three nicotine patches a day for several months, three times the
usual dose.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Conti-Fine said that damage to the arteries was still
possible but might take years to occur and be proved only by large
studies that lasted for years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Benowitz, chief of the division of clinical
pharmacology and experimental therapeutics at the University of
California in San Francisco, is among the researchers who have been
unable to find any harm from replacement nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   But Benowitz, who is described by other researchers as the
foremost nicotine expert in the United States, said he was
impressed by Dr. Conti-Fine's work on the lung cells, particularly
in people who use either regular cigarettes or the smokeless ones,
the lungs are exposed to extremely high levels of nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, if someone had asked me if it was likely that these
nicotine-delivery devices could cause problems, I would have said
probably not,'' Benowitz said. ``Now this makes me wonder. This
work says we need studies of inhaled nicotine. It may not be
innocuous.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said, ``Nicotine is always less hazardous than
using tobacco.'' Benowitz also said that Dr. Conti-Fine's results
on blood-vessel cells were more speculative, and their relevance
not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Olin, chairman of the department of vascular
medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, said there was strong
evidence that nicotine alone could play an important role in a
certain type of vascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   The condition is Buerger's disease, a disorder that occurs only
in smokers. Even among them, it is rare. People with the disease
develop such severe artery damage that the circulation to their
hands and feet can fail, necessitating amputations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have lost both legs and both arms,'' Olin said. ``But 100
percent of the time the disease becomes quiet if people stop
smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicotine clearly plays a role, he said, because Buerger's
disease will remain active and continue to attack the circulatory
system even if a patient gives up tobacco but continues to chew
nicotine gum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to see anything come out that gave the public the
impression that nicotine is safe,'' Olin said.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers suggest that nicotine may have other harmful
effects, like contributing to the bone-thinning disease
osteoporosis, which is more common among smokers and is a major
cause of fractures in older people.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Nebraska dental school in Lincoln, Dr. Eric
Fung, a professor of pharmacology, has found bone-thinning in rats
that were fed nicotine in amounts that produce the same blood
levels that a person would get from smoking two to three packs of
cigarettes a day. Fung said that the bone loss occurred because
nicotine interferes with Vitamin D metabolism, which is essential
for keeping calcium in the bones.
</P>
<P>
   Although nicotine-replacement products result in far lower blood
levels of nicotine than those he studied, Fung said it was
conceivable that long-term use of nicotine even at the lower levels
might contribute to osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who study smoking cessation view bad news about nicotine
with great caution, particularly because the findings come at a
time when specialists in the field have begun using higher doses of
nicotine for longer periods, in a whatever-it-takes approach to
help heavily addicted smokers to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Hughes, a psychiatrist at the University of Vermont,
said that nicotine-replacement products were generally regarded as
safe, even for people with heart conditions, and certainly a far
lesser evil than smoking. The products release much less nicotine
into the bloodstream than smoking does, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors are extending the duration of treatment beyond the
three- to six-month period approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, Hughes said. And he added that although products
like the patches and gum were meant to be used separately, doctors
were finding that they worked better combined than either one
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a benign medication that if I'm at three months and
I have a patient and there's a 1-in-10 chance that if I ask them to
stop the gum they'll go back to smoking, I have no problem using
the gum for an extra six months,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, he said, 95 percent of patients in the United
States were ready to give it up. ``But if you go over to Europe,
you'll see people who have been chewing it for five or 10 years,''
he said. ``This brings up the notion that some people need nicotine
replacement for life. That's a debatable issue in our field. Some
believe it's true and some don't. There's no good evidence for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Mayo Clinic, Dr. Richard Hurt, an expert on smoking
cessation, said he has had patients who have used
nicotine-replacement products for many months and in some cases for
years. He has seen no evidence of harm.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hurt said that he understood Dr. Conti-Fine's
concern. ``She's at the micro level,'' he said. ``Those of us at
the treatment end are more concerned about the potential return to
smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would hate to see the potential side effects of
nicotine blown out of proportion, because it might give smokers an
excuse to light up again. ``When you're dealing with an addictive
disorder, people will leap at any shred of evidence or any reason
to go back to using the substance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hurt said that he and his colleagues are themselves studying
the safety of nicotine. ``It's a question that's not going to go
away,'' he said. ``The concern will be there until there's proof
beyond any reasonable doubt. It would be nice to know we're doing
no harm.''

   &UR; Endless Love &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Civilizations may come and go, but love of chocolate endures.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists from Cornell University and the University of
California at Berkeley, digging in the Ulua Valley in northwestern
Honduras, have found evidence of a village that was continuously
occupied for 3,000 years, until about 1000 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulua Valley was renowned in pre-Columbian America for the
quality of its cocoa beans. And cocoa was no child's treat, but
rather the stuff of royalty (Montezuma, at the time of the
conquistadors, was said to have drunk cups and cups of chocolate
beverage every day).
</P>
<P>
   The anthropologists cite early pottery found in the Ulua Valley
village as evidence that, in one period at least, this reputation
for chocolate might have been why the village thrived.
</P>
<P>
   The pottery, dating between 1100 B.C. and 900 B.C., resembles
items found to the west, in areas inhabited by the Olmec, who
flourished until about 500 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The anthropologists suggest that the Olmec influence was
probably due to trade and social interactions, notably marriages
between distant families.
</P>
<P>
   And one thing that would have motivated a far-off family to
marry into a family from the Ulua Valley, they say, would have been
access to the area's cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quake Shakes Volcano &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The idea that an earthquake could trigger a volcanic eruption
makes intuitive sense.
</P>
<P>
   Both events are related to goings-on within the Earth's crust.
And a few studies have appeared to show volcanic activity caused by
a specific earthquake _ notably a 1992 quake in Southern California
that affected a huge reservoir of molten rock, or magma, several
hundred miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But is it possible that historically, many earthquakes have
triggered eruptions? Two researchers at the Carnegie Institution of
Washington say yes.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, who reported on their work in a recent issue of
Nature, examined records of large quakes going back several hundred
years and compared the data with records of eruptions. They found
that within a day or two of large quakes, many more eruptions
occurred within about 500 miles of the quake zone than would have
been expected.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that seismic waves from a far-off
earthquake could increase the pressure within the chamber enough to
make the volcano blow its top prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Way to Date Quakes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Those Carnegie researchers may soon be able to delve much
further into the historical record of earthquakes thanks to a
quake-dating method developed by scientists at the University of
Arizona and Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, reported in the journal Science, uses the fact
that cosmic rays reacting with surface elements on exposed rock
produce a chlorine isotope, chlorine-36. The longer the rock has
been exposed, the more chlorine-36 will be found.
</P>
<P>
   And because the rate of cosmic ray bombardment is predictable
for any spot on earth, the date that the rock was first exposed can
be calculated.

DIGGING UP A DINOSAUR WITH THE SNOUT OF A CROCODILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(rl) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dinosaur-hunting expedition into a remote part of the Sahara a
year ago came upon a foot-long, sickle-shaped claw lying in the
sand. Digging deep and wide, the international team of
paleontologists collected and pieced together fossils of what turns
out to be one of the more peculiar reptiles ever found, an enormous
predatory dinosaur with a skull and menacing snout like a
crocodile's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dinosaur trying hard to be a crocodile,'' said Paul
C. Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist who led the
expedition. ``It's a great thrill to work on an animal that doesn't
look like anything you've seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of a new genus and species of fish-eating
dinosaurs, which lived 100 million years ago and grew to the size
of Tyrannosaurus rex, was described by Sereno in an interview last
week and in a report in the current issue of the journal Science.
The species has been named Suchomimus tenerensis, for ``crocodile
mimic from the Tenere'' region of Niger in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Suchomimus was related to a larger but poorly understood group
of dinosaurs known as spinosaurs. Fossil fragments of other
spinosaurs have been dug up in Egypt, England and Brazil, but the
new specimen is the most complete spinosaur skeleton ever found,
Sereno said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark A. Norell, a paleontologist and dinosaur specialist at the
American Museum of Natural History in New York, said the new
fossils could be a significant discovery because spinosaurs are
``really a weirdo group of dinosaurs and not a whole lot is known
about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the skeleton, Sereno's group estimated that Suchomimus
measured 36 feet long and 12 feet high at the hips and weighed 5
tons. Like most other spinosaurs, the spine along the Suchomimus
back protruded to a height of 2 feet to form a kind of fin-like
sail running the length of the body. The most distinctive
characteristic was its 4-foot-long skull. The snout was
particularly long and narrow, much like a crocodile's.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying article in Science, Thomas R. Holtz Jr., a
paleontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park,
suggested that the crocodilian aspects of the skull may have arisen
as adaptations toward a diet that included fish as well as other
types of animals. A narrow snout might allow a smoother passage
through water, and pointy, cone-shaped teeth function better to
pierce and grasp fish rather than to slice meat.
</P>
<P>
   Sereno said that this spinosaur had a long, flexible neck and an
especially strong tail. The neck could have been well adapted to
fishing from a river bank or in shallow water. The tail could have
been used in swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists emphasized that the appearance of the Suchomimus
snout should not be interpreted as evidence of a close evolutionary
relationship between crocodiles and these dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   One evolutionary pattern that does seem to emerge from an
analysis of the fossils concerns the relationship of spinosaurs
spanning three continents. It had been assumed that the spinosaurs
in Europe, Africa and South America evolved separately from
ancestors that had lived across the supercontinent Pangaea. As
Pangaea rifted apart, one genus evolved on the northern continent
that included present-day Europe, and two more closely related
spinosaurs evolved on the southern continent. At the time of
Suchomimus, the narrow beginnings of the Atlantic Ocean appeared
between Africa and South America.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise, Sereno said, is that the specimen from Niger more
closely resembles the one from England than any other southern
specimens. He suggested the two spinosaur cousins must have shared
a common ancestor that managed to cross the Tethys Sea that
separated the diverging northern and southern land masses. Perhaps
traffic by land bridge or island hopping between rifting continents
continued longer and had evolutionary consequences that scientists
had not suspected.

TRIUMPH OF THE WILL

entertainment package.)

prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative

 Includes a color slide of Will Smith with Gene Hackman in a scene
from ``Enemy of the State.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Will Smith was gettin' jittery with it.
 &HT;    He's opened $100 million blockbuster films, released No. 1 rap
albums and headlined his own television show. But this was more
than he could handle.
 &HT;    ``The flop sweat started pouring off of me,'' Smith recalls.
 &HT;    The scene was the streets of Los Angeles, the time a night this
past summer. The cast: Big Willie, complete with a case of the
willies, and his wife, a very-much-in-labor Jada Pinkett Smith.
 &HT;    ``We live an hour outside of the city, which is a little tough.
I'm going, like, 120 miles down the freeway,'' Smith says. ``I'm
scouring the dashboard, trying to do that `Men in Black' move where
I hit that little red button that makes the car drive sideways
between traffic.''
 &HT;    But don't worry _ as movie, television and music executives can
attest, Mr. Smith always delivers. And in this case so did Ms.
Smith _ a son, Jaden, now 4 months old.
 &HT;    Sipping a soda in his suite at the Ritz Carlton in Marina Del
Ray, Calif., Smith _ who looks casual in a gray T-shirt, black
pants and Gucci belt _ seems still in awe of the whole experience.
 &HT;    ``It's so weird,'' he says. ``You know, I have a Sony
Picture-in-Picture television, and the direction book is about four
inches thick. The doctor hands me this little baby, and I'm like,
`Wait! Can I get some instructions? I want the pamphlet _ I don't
know what I'm doing.'
 &HT;    ``The doctor just told me, `Hey, you guys have fun.'''
 &HT;    Actually, Smith is having fun. His latest round of fatherhood _
he and his ex-wife have a son, 5-year-old Trey, whose custody they
share _ seems to suit him as well as those snappy suits and shades
he and Tommy Lee Jones wore in ``Men in Black.''
 &HT;    In fact, young Jaden stands as his fourth Hollywood hit in a
row, after ``Bad Boys'' (1995), which cracked $100 million,
``Independence Day'' (1996), the year's biggest movie at the box
office, and of course ``Men in Black,'' which earned a staggering
$572 million.
 &HT;    Most filmland observers are predicting that ``Enemy of the
State,'' opening Nov. 20, will keep that streak alive. The action
thriller, which co-stars Gene Hackman, earned Smith his first $20
million payday, which should buy Jaden a fair number of toys and,
incidentally, cement Smith's status near the top of Hollywood's A
list.
 &HT;    Not that he's all that impressed.
 &HT;    ``I love how people ask, `How does it feel to be on the A
list?''' Smith says. ``In my mind, I've always been an A-list
Hollywood superstar. Y'all just didn't know yet.''
 &HT;    One thing for sure: There may be a few movie stars who make
bigger paychecks than Smith, but none of them has a hit rap album
like Smith's ``Big Willie Style,'' his first album in six years
and, almost predictably, another smash.
 &HT;    All that, and it was only this past Sept. 25 that he turned 30.
 &HT;    But Smith is no typical 30-year-old. He's got his career figured
out with all the strategic consideration of a field marshal's
battle plan.
 &HT;    ``Enemy of the State'' is a conscious expansion of his movie
repertoire. It spins a serious, down-to-earth story which usually
passes on the comedy in favor of real suspense.
 &HT;    ``This film is the first time I'm really saying to my audience,
`Just come see me.''' Smith says. ``This movie is more about the
acting than it is about the bells, the whistles and punching
aliens.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot of running and chasing, but for me this role was
meatier than saying, `Welcome to Earth,''' Smith says. ``This is a
regular guy in a mess.''
 &HT;    As for the Oscar-winning Hackman, Smith says, working with him
was unlike any other experience he's had.
 &HT;    ``Every single line, every single scene he's dead on,'' he says,
mock-grievedly. ``It was like playing with Michael Jordan.''
 &HT;    The emphasis on acting chops is a new spin for Smith, at least
since his critically admired but audience-overlooked performance in
``Six Degrees of Separation,'' his 1993 film debut. For most of his
life, he has been first and foremost an entertainer, aiming to
amuse people, not impress them.
 &HT;    It goes back to high school in Philadelphia, he says, when a
brainy kid bent on becoming a computer engineer discovered that,
big ears or no, he could get girls to like him if he was funny.
 &HT;    His joking demeanor evolved into a rap act, which in turn earned
him a record deal at 17. He was hooked.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing like being in high school with a hit record.
You can really chill at that prom,'' he says.
 &HT;    His next few years as a rapper are a blur of Grammys, big cars
and money to burn, he says. The good times ended, however, when he
simultaneously found that he'd run through everything he'd earned
... and that he had a whopping debt to the Internal Revenue
Service.
 &HT;    ``Suddenly, I had six cars, but I didn't have enough money for
gas,'' he says.
 &HT;    Sobered, Smith called off the party and regrouped. When he was
offered the series ``The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' he saw it as
not only a chance to square his IRS bill but also a chance to start
over _ and this time be smart about it.
 &HT;    He learned about money, and learned to look twice at the people
around him.
 &HT;    ``I learned to see people's true colors,'' he says. Now, he
adds, his staff is made up of his brother, his sister and a few
longtime friends _ people he trusts.
 &HT;    At the top of that list is Pinkett, an old friend whom he didn't
begin to think of romantically until she helped him through his
divorce. Now, he says, he can't imagine himself without her.
 &HT;    ``Basically we have similar inner-city upbringings,'' Smith
says. ``We describe our relationship as `From the White House to
the Ghetto.'
 &HT;    ``Basically, I want to be with a person who you can go to a
hardcore Ice Cube rap concert with and have a ball,'' he explains.
``And then the next day you can go meet with Bill and Hillary at
the White House _ and you're equally comfortable in both places.
That's what we found in one another.''
 &HT;    Since then, in fact, Smith hasn't made a wrong step. He's
currently finishing his next film, a feature version of the
old-time television series, ``The Wild Wild West.'' It will be
released on his lucky July 4 weekend, the same weekend that
``Independence Day'' and ``Men in Black'' premiered.
 &HT;    A couple of sequels _ to ``Bad Boys'' and ``Men in Black'' _ are
in the talking-about-it stages, as is a screen biography of
Muhammad Ali.
 &HT;    They sound promising, but Smith isn't counting his chickens this
soon.
 &HT;    ``I'm waiting for my one flop movie,'' he jokes. ``The brick
will land.''
 &HT;    Even if it does, Smith says, he won't worry. His biggest project
_ parenting _ isn't measured in box-office dollars.
 &HT;    He'll usher in 1999 ``by changing some diapers,'' he says. ``I
can't help with the breast-feeding, so I just rub Jada's back and
say, `You're doing so good.'''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, he adds, he tries to be a strict dad to Trey, who
showed up on Smith's ``Just the Two of Us'' single.
 &HT;    ``I try to be tough,'' the proud father says, beaming, ``but he
cracks me up. He's like a little me.''

 Includes a color slide of Drew Barrymore in a scene from ``Home
Fries.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Sometimes, method acting has its rewards.
 &HT;    Director Dean Parisot has complained that, during the making of
his new film ``Home Fries,'' he couldn't get Drew Barrymore and
Luke Wilson to break off their kissing scenes, even by hollering
``Cut!''
 &HT;    Told of his comment, Barrymore rolls her eyes.
 &HT;    ``I guess I might have been the temptress who kept our lips
together for a few extra seconds,'' she says, laughing. ``I have no
shame. I think Luke is so cute that any time I get a kiss from him
is a great opportunity.''
 &HT;    In case you didn't guess, Barrymore and Wilson are a pair on and
off the screen, though ``Home Fries'' _ opening nationwide Nov. 25
_ is their first film together.
 &HT;    ``But I want the world to know that we were total pros on the
set,'' she insists. ``We didn't want to be one of those lovey
couples that people are always smirking about because they can't
keep their hands off each other. Between takes I wouldn't even sit
on Luke's lap, much less hold his hand.''
 &HT;    Not unlike their first meeting, she says, when she could hardly
even talk.
 &HT;    ``I was standing next to a refrigerator in somebody's kitchen
when I saw him,'' she recalls. ``All I could think about was, how
do I pull it together and not act like a complete nerd? I was
mortifiedly _ is that a word? _ embarrassed.''
 &HT;    ``Home Fries'' also involves both romance and embarrassment,
with Barrymore cast as a fast-food waitress who falls in love with
a helicopter pilot (Wilson). There's one catch, though: At the
time, she's nine months pregnant with another man's baby.
 &HT;    It was a tough challenge for Barrymore, who's never been
pregnant.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to make it as realistic as possible,'' she says. ``I
know that it must be the most uncomfortable feeling in the world.
So I had this prosthetic suit with a corset that seemed like it was
punching my lower back every time I moved. And it was full of lead
weights, so it was really heavy.
 &HT;    ``But I saw Sally as the kind of optimistic free spirit who
wouldn't let her pregnancy weigh her down,'' she continues. ``So
even though I was walking with my butt out and my legs spread, I
tried to put a little spring in her step.
 &HT;    ``I'm sure I wouldn't be that way in real life,'' she adds.
``I'd be like a beached whale.''
 &HT;    The actress doesn't expect to find out anytime soon, however.
 &HT;    ``I don't think I'm ready for an extreme change right now,'' she
says. ``Everything is going smoothly. I'm just as excited when I
see Luke now as I was on our first date. So why screw that up? I'd
like to stretch it out for as long as possible.''
 &HT;    Currently basking in the success of her past two films, ``The
Wedding Singer'' (1997) and ``Ever After'' (1998), not to mention
her bravura cameo in ``Scream'' (1996), Barrymore has just
completed ``Never Been Kissed.'' It's the first release from her
own production company, Flower Films, and co-stars David Arquette.
 &HT;    At 23, Barrymore finds herself an increasingly acclaimed
actress, a box-office draw and even a fledgling producer. Not bad
for an optimistic young woman _ she laughingly refers to herself as
``Ms. Bubbly'' _ who has had a long, sometimes tortured climb to
her current success since making her debut at 5 as the cherubic
Gertie in ``E.T.'' (1980).
 &HT;    By now, the aftermath of that starmaking role is well known,
including her struggles with drugs and alcohol. In her
autobiography, ``Little Girl Lost'' (Pocket Books, 1991), the young
actress wrote frankly about getting drunk at 9 and entering rehab
at 14 after an attempted suicide.
 &HT;    At 16 she won legal control of her own finances and left her
mother's house _ her father, actor John Drew Barrymore, had left
the family years before. She had numerous, highly publicized
relationships, including a three-week marriage. She posed nude for
Playboy in 1992, and bared her breasts on ``The David Letterman
Show'' a few years later.
 &HT;    That wasn't so long ago, but to Barrymore it seems a lifetime.
 &HT;    ``I've lived on this planet for 23 years,'' says the
granddaughter of acting legend John Barrymore. ``It's been a
strange life. I'm young in numbers, but I don't feel young in my
soul. My age doesn't reflect all the experiences I've had. It's
been quite a ride, and I've learned a lot about what I want out of
life.''
 &HT;    What she wants definitely includes Wilson, whose background is
the antithesis of Barrymore's chaotic history. Born and raised in
Texas as one of three sons in a conventional, two-parent family, he
made his first foray into show business in ``Bottle Rocket''
(1996), with his brother Owen.
 &HT;    ``Luke's family is very close-knit,'' Barrymore says. ``In fact,
most of my friends have families like that. I'm the only one who
doesn't even really talk to her parents. I get so excited when I'm
part of a big family event _ it's like, `Hi, I'm the weird orphan
and I love being at your party!' If I ever do have a family I want
it to be a big one.''
 &HT;    Otherwise, however, Barrymore professes reluctance to talk about
Wilson's background.
 &HT;    ``Luke is more private than I am,'' she says. ``I've learned
something from that. I don't want to give too much of what we have
together away.''
 &HT;    But Barrymore is willing to talk about how she first met
Wilson's parents.
 &HT;    ``It was nerve-wracking,'' she recalls. ``The funny thing is
that they called me `Drew.' `Drew' is the more public me _ people
who are close to me call me `Daisy.' I'm more comfortable with
`Daisy.'''
 &HT;    So what is Daisy really like? Barrymore smiles.
 &HT;    ``She's just a mellow, nose-picking jerk,'' she says, laughing.
``I am such a geek. Anyone who thinks I'm not is fooling
themselves.
 &HT;    ``But actually I love being a geek,'' she adds. ``It's so much
freer and funnier in life not to have to worry about being cool. It
takes a lot more energy to not be yourself and to hide who you are.
 &HT;    ``The more you are yourself, the better you feel at the end of
the day,'' the actress says. ``I don't mind if you don't like me
... at least you know who you are dealing with. I'm always myself,
and I feel comfortable with that.''
 &HT;    Speaking of comfort, Barrymore _ whose own curvaceous body has
received lots of public exposure _ is disturbed by what seems to be
a new trend in Hollywood among actresses to flaunt their thinness.
 &HT;    ``I think the attention that's been given to that is too bad,''
she says. ``I used to think about weight a lot. From the time I was
8 until about 14 I was totally overweight, and I felt really
strange and awkward.
 &HT;    ``A lot of dieticians may want to kick my butt for saying
this,'' Barrymore says, ``but the truth of the matter is things
changed for me when I stopped obsessing about my appearance.
 &HT;    ``I guess I look at where I am and think of the ugly
duckling/beautiful swan metaphor,'' she adds with a smile. ``Maybe
it applies to me. You question who you want to be in life. If you
find the answer, you blossom and flower. That's what makes you
beautiful.
 &HT;    ``Nothing on the outside can match what you have inside
yourself.''

 Includes a color slide of Cate Blanchett with Joseph Fiennes in a
scene from ``Elizabeth.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Power struggles. Deaths. Backstabbing. Political intrigue. Dirty
dancing. And plenty of sex.
 &HT;    No, it's not the Clinton White House. We're in 16th-century
England, where the arduous, historic reign of Queen Elizabeth I is
the subject of the lush new film ``Elizabeth,'' opening nationwide
on Nov. 25.
 &HT;    Call it a biography. Call it a political thriller. Call it a
historical romance. But whatever you do, don't call ``Elizabeth'' a
period piece. At least, not in the presence of its star, Cate
Blanchett, the translucent-skinned Australian star of ``Paradise
Road'' (1996) and ``Oscar and Lucinda'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``I fear the term `period piece,''' Blanchett says, sipping a
cup of tea during a conversation at Manhattan's Essex House hotel.
``What that usually says is `dull, boring and irrelevant' _ and why
would we want to do something dull, boring and irrelevant?
 &HT;    ```Elizabeth' very much reflects our world today,'' the actress
adds. ``I was in England a couple of weeks ago and, yes, people
were making comparisons between Elizabeth and Princess Diana. They
were both private people with public lives, but also public people
with private lives.
 &HT;    ``Then just think about the influence of the Elizabethan Age on
England today, in terms of architecture, music and the language, in
terms of the way we view the world now.''
 &HT;    Directed by Indian filmmaker Shekar Kapur, ``Elizabeth'' depicts
a blood-soaked era of betrayal and turmoil, as the Catholic church
seeks to keep the Protestant Elizabeth from assuming the throne
following the death of her Catholic half-sister, Queen Mary.
 &HT;    The star-studded cast includes Richard Attenborough as
Elizabeth's senior adviser, Joseph Fiennes as Lord Dudley, her
longtime friend and lover, and Geoffrey Rush as her mysterious
master of spies. Among her antagonists are Christopher Eccleston as
the Duke of Norfolk, a Catholic who wishes Elizabeth a short reign,
and Kathy Burke as Queen Mary.
 &HT;    ``I'm interested in history,'' Blanchett says. ``I was
interested in Elizabeth's legacy, her achievements in England, and
I knew about those aspects of her.
 &HT;    ``I supposed it was far more interesting to me to delve into the
insecure, unstable surroundings she dealt with as she assumed the
throne,'' the actress says. ``It's not addressed in the film, but
it was helpful for me to read the letters she wrote to her brother,
Edward, and for me to try to understand her relationship with her
father.
 &HT;    ``To say she came from a broken home would be an
understatement.''
 &HT;    Blanchett breaks into a short peal of laughter. After all,
Elizabeth's father was Henry VIII, the famous beheader of wives
who's been the subject of a movie or two himself.
 &HT;    But don't expect a meticulous docudrama, Blanchett warns. The
focus of the film is Elizabeth's inner life, not historical
minutiae.
 &HT;    ``Shekar wasn't that interested in historical accuracy,'' says
the 29-year-old actress, whose own prior knowledge of Elizabeth was
limited to a BBC history. ``He saw history as a jumping-off point,
and just wanted to unlock the private, domestic recesses of this
woman's self on screen.
 &HT;    ``That was a great challenge to me, especially as Elizabeth
becomes increasingly more public,'' she says. ``So we tried to show
the interface between the internal life, which is pure invention on
our part, and what she actually achieved.
 &HT;    ``I had to release myself from the idea of being reverent to
someone who's become so emblematically involved in England's
history,'' Blanchett adds. ``I had to let my research inform my
performance, but not dictate it.''
 &HT;    Blanchett's performance is energized by her onscreen chemistry
with Fiennes, the younger brother of her ``Oscar and Lucinda''
co-star, Ralph Fiennes. Asked to compare and contrast the brothers,
Blanchett recoils.
 &HT;    ``Comparisons are odious,'' she says impatiently. ``Ralph and
Joseph share the same last name, and they're both actors.''
 &HT;    She softens a bit.
 &HT;    ``I think it's really difficult for Joe, being the younger
brother of someone who is brilliant,'' she says. ``Joe is
brilliant, too, but in a very different way.
 &HT;    ``Joe is actually hilarious and a real trickster,'' she adds,
smiling. ``He's got a very dry sense of humor and, because I'm very
gullible, he sucked me into several elaborate ruses.
 &HT;    ``I quite welcomed that, though, because Dudley often made
Elizabeth laugh when things got too serious for her.''
 &HT;    Her previous career had offered nothing like the sheer scope of
this production, the actress reports.
 &HT;    ``It was the most intense professional experience I've ever
had,'' she says, ``with the possible exception of performing
`Oleanna' with Geoffrey (Rush) on stage.
 &HT;    ``I realized at the end of `Elizabeth' that I probably knew a
lot more about acting than I thought I did going into the film,''
she says. ``That was a great feeling, to overcome my
uncertainties.''
 &HT;    The daughter of an Australian teacher and a Texan naval officer,
Blanchett was born and reared in Melbourne, Australia. At school,
she studied fine arts and economics, and anticipated a career in
international relations _ one that didn't quite work out.
 &HT;    ``You had to get to the fourth year of university to get into
international relations,'' Blanchett says, smiling sheepishly,
``and I guess my impatience led to acting, because I couldn't hang
in there long enough.
 &HT;    ``I did a lot of theater at drama school in Melbourne, then went
to Sydney,'' she recalls. ``One show I did was `Elektra,' and it
was a wonderfully chaotic experience, not unlike `Elizabeth.' I
realized theater wasn't a dead form, that it didn't have to be
operatic or irrelevant. It doesn't have to be high art or above
people.''
 &HT;    As a stage veteran, she admits to finding it unsettling to work
on a film set, miles and months away from her audience.
 &HT;    ``You're totally removed from the people you're trying to
reach,'' she says. ``It's not until someone stops you in the
supermarket _ not that this happens to me often, mind you _ and
says `Wow' or `Yuck' that you get a reaction.''
 &HT;    Not that it's keeping her from making movies. Since completing
``Elizabeth,'' Blanchett has starred in a big-screen version of
Oscar Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband,'' taken a small supporting role
in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' which stars Matt Damon, and joined
John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton for director Mike Newell's
upcoming black comedy, ``Pushing Tin.''
 &HT;    Of her impending releases, Blanchett seems most thrilled with
``Pushing Tin.''
 &HT;    ``It's about air-traffic controllers,'' she says. ``In very
broad strokes, I play a Long Island housewife who's married to John
Cusack. It's really about stress, and it's a dark piece.
 &HT;    ``Mike saw me in `Oscar and Lucinda' and wanted to cast me as
Connie Falzone,'' she adds. ``It's liberating when a director takes
a chance like that and asks you to go to the opposite end of the
spectrum.''
 &HT;    As soon as she finishes promoting ``Elizabeth,'' Blanchett plans
to return home to Australia and relax with her husband, Andrew
Upton. She'll then fly to London to prepare to star in David Hare's
play, ``Plenty.''
 &HT;    As her growing slate of films hits screens around the world,
Blanchett may find it harder to retreat to the sanctuary of the
stage. Bigger films, bigger paychecks and a brighter spotlight
beckon, but she insists that she's going to keep a level head.
 &HT;    ``The film industry works at a frenetic pace, but I like to take
my time,'' she says. ``So I am taking my time. I'm doing a play,
doing films I care about. As a person I can be pressured very
easily, and I'd like to walk a bit slowly if possible.
 &HT;    ``Everything that's happened so far has been fantastic,''
Blanchett adds, ``and always the greatest reward is more work being
generated by something you've done.
 &HT;    ``The work is the thing for me.''

FRENCH STEWART: STRANGEST IN A STRANGE LAND

 Includes a color slide of French Stewart in a scene from ``3rd Rock
From the Sun.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something's wrong with this picture, and French Stewart can't
figure out what.
</P>
<P>
   The actor is rehearsing a scene for ``3rd Rock From the Sun,''
and he senses something is wrong. It's not the premise _ nothing
wrong there. It's not the dialogue _ smack on for his goofy
character, Harry.
</P>
<P>
   Finally it occurs to Stewart _ it's the prop. He'd been handed a
bag of groceries to tote into the scene, purely as a random bit of
business, but Stewart fears it may send the wrong message to idiots
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, it's a little, er, productive of Harry, don't
you think?'' he says to the production brain trust. ``I can't
imagine Harry ever accomplishing something, like going to the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a small but incisive insight into his character, proving
that Stewart knows as an actor how to explore the inner life of
even an imbecile.
</P>
<P>
   Later, back in his office/dressing room, he relaxes amid
controlled chaos, a formidable clutter that includes cast photos,
show props and a Jay Leno autograph. Most intriguing, on his wall
is a chunk of piano under glass, a memento from the show's famous
3-D episode. It's from Harry's dream sequence, in which he met
songwriter Randy Newman, got a piano smashed on his head and then
resumed singing with a lovely lady on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two different pianos, the actual piano and the
breakaway piano,'' Stewart recalls. ``And, as luck would have it,
somebody evidently missed a memo and we smashed up the real piano.
Which ended up costing a little cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Stewart spent a little cash himself _ he hit
the road for Las Vegas and married his longtime girlfriend,
Kathrine Lanasa, who played the woman Harry lost his virginity to
in the first season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' Stewart says with a laugh. ``So it must've
been a character thing etched deep into my brain. She's sort of
been able to watch the whole thing blow up a little bit, see the
good and the bad. It's nice to have somebody who was there before
and can relate to all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The wedding wouldn't have been that out of character for Harry,
actually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely hilarious,'' Stewart recalls. ``We took this
road trip out to Vegas, where we found this little chapel and got
married at night by an Elvis impersonator and headed straight to
the Liberace Museum. Your basic traditional wedding!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually Elvis himself didn't perform the ceremony, he
hastens to add.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a minister who does the service,'' the actor explains.
``Elvis stands in the background with a guitar, looking very
solemn, and every now and then he'll step up and do a little solo
and then step back again and resume looking solemn. He was great,
though _ he was a good singer and could actually play.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Liberace Museum, Stewart reports, ``It's crazy. It's
in a strip mall. You go into the first area and it's all Liberace's
cars, which are pretty much exactly what you would think Liberace's
cars would look like _ basic cars with sequins and furs and
candelabra hood ornaments. Some of them look like pianos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second room is all memorabilia, his letters,'' he
continues. ``He's from Milwaukee _ who knew? So it's just a lot of
pictures of him, you know, in Milwaukee. And the last room is all
his clothes. And it's by far the most insane, because these things
are literally worth half a million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   As Harry, Stewart finds himself in costumes only a notch less
outrageous than Liberace's wardrobe. Case in point: the 1998/99
season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took place in a carnival,'' he recalls, ``so I'm wearing
this `Hargo The Alien' costume, and it's got a headpiece with a
metal ball on the end of an antenna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've been in it for a day, you forget you're wearing
it,'' Stewart adds. ``You find yourself talking about serious
things _ and then you'll start to nod thoughtfully, and that ball
is waving back and forth over your head, and you realize you can't
be taken seriously at all.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Harry is actually going to get a job in a bar,
which promises to test what little mettle Harry has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever he gets tough, he's just sort of mimicking somebody
else's tough behavior _ every now and then he'll whack out, but
it's usually something he probably saw on `Cops,''' Stewart says.
``It's not really something in his nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bar scene is rich,'' he adds, ``because people will
talk to him like he actually knows something. It has all the
elements to bring out the edgier side of him, because there's a
part of him that's a little perverted, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing you can count on, though, is that Harry won't be
learning anything worth knowing from his experiences there.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what planet he was on, he had to be the biggest
idiot there,'' Stewart says. ``It doesn't matter if you put him in
a furry little body or if he lives like some sort of android, he's
still going to be spilling coffee and messing up. That's the thing
I liked _ he was this prototypical wacky neighbor next door, this
Squiggy kind of character, but he had to be Ultra Squiggy, Squiggy
cubed, the Mr. Universe of morons. So hopefully we're accomplishing
that.''

 `TALE OF THE 1002d NIGHT': AN EROTIC FABLE THAT LEADS TO OMINOUS(Publication notes at end) 
(JT) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Tale of the 1002d Night'' (1939), the last novel of Joseph
Roth's to be published in Europe and the latest of his works to be
translated into English, is a disturbing little fable that begins
as an erotic roundelay reminiscent of Schnitzler's ``La Ronde,''
mutates into a Chekhovian fairy tale of missed connections and
failed epiphanies, and ends as a pessimistic parable about
deception and cultural decline, reminiscent of the work of Horvath.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``The 1002d Night'' possesses neither the emotional depth
nor the historical resonance of Roth's masterpiece, ``The Radetzky
March'' (1932), it embodies all the themes of his mature fiction,
and serves, for readers unfamiliar with his work, as a fitting
introduction to his haunting oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1894 to Jewish parents in Galicia, on the eastern
frontier of the Hapsburg empire, Roth served in the
Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I before becoming a
journalist, based in Vienna and later Berlin. In 1933, with the
rise of the Nazis, Roth fled to Paris, where he started drinking
heavily and died in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Though critics have frequently focused on the apparent schism in
Roth's work _ between the early, liberal-minded novels, which
tended to focus on topical social issues, and his later, more
conservative fiction, animated by a nostalgia for the vanished
world of the Hapsburgs _ such arguments underplay the enduring
current of loss in the author's writing, his lifelong preoccupation
with social change and its fallout on individuals. Indeed, Roth's
own sense of exile and rootlessness reverberates throughout his
fiction, endowing his feckless, displaced heroes with a vertiginous
sense of their own lives' passing them by.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this is the case of Baron Taittinger, the aristocratic
army officer whose downfall is recounted in ``The Tale of the 1002d
Night.'' Quite clearly a symbol of the declining fortunes (and
values) of the Austrian empire, Taittinger is a superfluous man,
clueless about his role in a changing world and carefully
indifferent to the plight of others. He is ``an enigma of nature,''
a colleague thinks, a man without qualities, neither exceptionally
wicked nor exceptionally stupid _ just fatuously in love with
himself.
</P>
<P>
   When the baron tires of the rigors of courting the beauteous
Helene, he cavalierly moves on to Helene's look-alike, a silly
shopgirl named Mizzi, who promptly falls in love with him and bears
his son, named Xandl. In the ensuing years, Mizzi will end up going
to work in a brothel, while Taittinger continues with his
self-absorbed existence, refusing to acknowledge the child, who
grows up to become a thoughtless bully.
</P>
<P>
   Taittinger's troubles escalate unexpectedly one spring day when
the Shah of Persia arrives in Vienna for a visit. The Shah, in
search of romantic solace for his restless heart, spots the
beautiful Helene, now married to a count, and demands that she be
brought to him for the night. The baron suggests that the nervous
courtiers, torn between ``the laws of decency'' and ``the laws of
hospitality,'' find a double for Helene, a double who turns out, of
course, to be Mizzi.
</P>
<P>
   As a token of his affection, the Shah sends Mizzi a lavish set
of pearls, and those pearls swiftly set into motion a series of
events that will change the lives of nearly everyone involved.
Mizzi, uncomfortable with her newfound wealth, will go into
business with an unscrupulous con man and wind up in prison. Her
former madame at the brothel, Frau Matzner, will find herself
forced out of business. And a tabloid reporter who has covered the
story of the Shah's visit will try to spin his story into a
lucrative blackmail scheme _ with unsettling results.
</P>
<P>
   As for the baron, he will realize, too late, that he has led an
unexamined life and that the ``blithe insouciance of his younger
days'' has caught up with him, leading to the loss of his career,
his estate and his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experiences, when one encountered them, looked bright,
colorful, floating,'' Roth writes of the baron's first, carefree
encounters with Mizzi. ``You held on to them as to a balloon on a
string, for as long as they were fun. Then, when you got bored, you
let go. They floated off prettily into the air, you watched them go
with gratitude and affection, and then they went pop quietly
somewhere in the clouds. But a few hadn't gone pop at all. Instead,
treacherous and invisible, they hung around somewhere for years, in
defiance of all the laws of nature. And then, full of ballast, they
fell back like lead weights on the head of poor Taittinger.''
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, the story of the baron's fall reads like a
fairy tale: the narrative is framed by two appearances by the
mysterious Shah of Persia and set in motion by the Shah's gift of
the cursed pearls, and its simple, almost bouncy language, so
deftly translated by Michael Hofmann, lends it an uncanny air of
the far away and long ago. Like most of Roth's novels, however,
``The Tale of the 1002d Night'' is also a potent allegory about his
native land, seamlessly moving back and forth between the sweeping
vistas of history and his characters' small, personal dilemmas,
fluently delineating the shattering consequences that public events
can have on private lives.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, ``The 1002d Night'' leaves the reader with some
indelible glimpses of Vienna on the eve of Hitler's Anschluss: its
shopworn streets and cafes and parks, its mood of weary decadence,
its atmosphere of cultivated ennui. Nearly every one of this
novel's main characters suffers from disenchantment or disillusion.
</P>
<P>
   Mizzi comes to understand ``the sorrow and futility of
everything,'' from her love for the baron to the gift of the
pearls. Frau Matzner, feeling she has outlived her time, realizes
``she was in love with her own youth, and even with the way she had
misspent it.'' The Shah leaves Vienna feeling ``like a boy who,
after just an hour, has broken his new toy.'' And the baron, booted
out of the army for his sexual indiscretions, looks back,
longingly, at his life in the military, when his days were ordered
and orderly and everything made sense.
</P>
<P>
   As Hofmann points out in his introduction, there is a ``horror
at social change'' in ``The Tale of the 1002d Night,'' a nostalgia
for the receding past. At the same time, there are ominous portents
in this novel, written in 1936-37, of the horror yet to come. In
fact, the mocking refrain heard through out the book (``the world
was plumply, contentedly, frivolously at peace,'' ``the world was
deeply, horribly deeply at peace'') assumes an awful irony, as it
becomes clear that ``a new and still more terrible era was
beginning'' _ the era of Hitler, the era that Roth, in exile, would
not live to see run its course.

ROLLER DERBY GETS ITS LEGS FOR RETURN TO TV

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly 30 skaters of all shapes and ages raced
among cones, skated laps and tried to impress onlookers at the Ice
Chalet on Friday with hopes of playing Roller Derby.
</P>
<P>
   You heard right. Roller Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The sport, updated and improved, is making a comeback in a new
television show called ``RollerJam,'' which will debut on the
Nashville Network in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would come back,'' said World Skating
League commissioner Jerry Seltzer, who was a honcho with the
original Roller Derby. ``But I guess everything comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Skating League had representatives in town running
these men and women through drills, looking for speed, agility,
ability and, of course, good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the league has four 14-member teams _ each consisting
of seven men and seven women _ and is looking for as many
additional players as are worthy.
</P>
<P>
   One player who certainly caught the eye of Seltzer, producer
Brian Gadinsky and the gaggle of former Roller Derby players in
attendance was Chris Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for people who combine both the superior
skating skills required,'' Gadinsky said, ``with a great sense of
charisma while being telegenic.''
</P>
<P>
   He could very well have been describing Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   A former professional hockey player, Nelson, 26, graduated from
the University of Wisconsin, where he won two ice-hockey national
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is the prototypical player for the latest incarnation of
Roller Derby.
</P>
<P>
   He is solidly built at 6-foot-2, 205 pounds, and a fast skater
by any standard. Nelson also oozes with style. He finished one
slalom course with a wink and a point to the people watching on the
sidelines, prompting Seltzer to refer to him as an ideal candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a natural skater,'' said Nelson who lives in
Westwood. ``It's something I never had to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the game faster and flashier, ``RollerJam'' will shed
itself of quad skates in favor of in-lines, and the Polymax play
surface will speed up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark D'Amato, 43, of West Hollywood will be staying firmly
on all fours _ on quads, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The player/coach of the New York Enforcers started 25 years ago
as an original Roller Derby player, and this will be his third
go-round in the sport that has waxed and waned in popularity twice
already.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a phone call out of the clear blue sky,'' he said.
``I'll be the only skater on quads in the whole league, so I'll
have to work harder.''

INDIA: THE PAINTED MANSIONS OF SHEKHAWATI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)  
(mk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The promise of an oasis in the Thar desert of Rajasthan lured us
off the beaten path. A travel agent assured us that a four-hour
drive would take us from New Delhi to the small town of Mandawa.
Once there, we would stay in an enchanting castle from the time of
the maharajahs and wander through crumbling mansions richly painted
with images of kings and Hindu gods, gramophones and Victorian
touring cars.
</P>
<P>
   But four hours into the bone-rattling journey, Mandawa was still
nowhere in sight, and it began to seem more mirage than oasis. Max,
my 8-year-old son, had already broken his record for counting the
license plates of Indian states (18). My husband, Barry, who had
gamely agreed to the adventure, was looking more and more
aggravated. With each jounce and jar, I felt guiltier _ and we had
only just passed through the state of Haryana.
</P>
<P>
   Once into Rajasthan, the roads became even more rutted and
pitted. Loping caravans of camels and herds of woolly sheep made
picturesque roadblocks that regularly challenged the braking skills
of our driver, Pan Singh. The sage and dun landscape was only
occasionally brightened by yellow wildflowers and the crimson
turbans of men trudging along the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, six and a half hours after we set out, we arrived in
Mandawa, in the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan, several hours'
drive from the state's usual tourist draws, or an airport, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   As we pulled into the grand square of Castle Mandawa, once the
home of Rajput royalty and since 1980 a hotel for the intrepid, we
felt that we should have been riding in on elephants instead of
clambering out of an Isuzu Trooper. To our great relief, the place
immediately began to cast a spell on us all.
</P>
<P>
   We went first to our suite, reached by a series of narrow
stairways, courtyards and passages. It was romance incarnate. A
four-poster bed was surrounded by scalloped, alabaster arches and
enclosed by lacy curtains that fluttered in a breeze cast by a
ceiling fan. A big window seat, which looked out over the square,
made the perfect spot to read a book _ or, as in our case, to bed
down two boys.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to the colonial veranda. There, courtly young
men dressed in white kurta pajamas served us scrambled eggs, toast,
french fries and fresh lime sodas. Fortified and with dusk nearing,
we set out for a walk, led by Tejpal Singh, a guide on the Castle's
staff. The sun, a glowing orange orb, cast a golden light on the
tranquil village. At the end of October, the air was balmy and
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   We threaded our way along winding, sandy alleyways, careful to
avoid the cow pats dropped by the fat brown beasts who wandered
freely, and past the once magnificent havelis, stately houses built
by Marwaris, the famed traders of Rajasthan, who have spread out
across India and the world to become some of the subcontinent's
most successful entrepreneurs. Originally, they profited from the
camel caravans that passed through Shekhawati along the great
trading routes bearing spices and sandalwood, silks and saffron.
</P>
<P>
   In a dusty square just steps from the Castle, a group of boys
played cricket using a tin can as a wicket, their spirited game
encircled by walls where armies of marching elephants, prancing
camels and leaping horses cavorted.
</P>
<P>
   The local merchants _ upper-caste Hindus and Jains _ who built
the havelis in the 19th century hired artists to paint them with
images whimsical, fantastical, erotic and sacred. The mansions have
an abandoned, decayed look now, Venetian in the grandeur of their
faded glory. The fierce, sandy desert winds, the monsoons and time
itself have effaced some of the paintings and softened the indigos,
greens and reds.
</P>
<P>
   The descendants of these rich men now live in Calcutta and
Bombay. The havelis are mainly inhabited by aging chowkidars, or
caretakers, and their extended families, who have often resided in
them for 50 years or more. They welcome tourists and are grateful
to those who offer a modest tip for the privilege of a peek inside.
``The owners live in the big city,'' Tejpal explained. ``They do
not like the small village life.''
</P>
<P>
   To walk through Mandawa is to step back in time. There are very
few cars or trucks. More common are tiny donkeys barely as tall as
my 3-year-old, Sam, pulling wooden carts. Women on foot balance
wiry stacks of kindling on their heads. The stucco village houses
are washed in pastels of sky blue, mint and rose.
</P>
<P>
   We walked up a stone staircase encrusted in sand and into the
Ladia haveli, on the square. We passed through an intricately
carved, larger-than-life wooden doorway into a small courtyard
painted with beautiful designs. At the front of the haveli is a
dark, dusty antique store that was selling a round lunch holder,
known as a tiffin box, for $11.80 and a metal water pitcher for
$35.50.
</P>
<P>
   On the exterior wall of another Ladia haveli across the square,
a steam train puffed along under a large painting of an elephant,
which had a small barred window cut away in its belly for the
haveli's residents to peer through. Tejpal pointed to what he said
was an erotic painting on the underside of one of the small
overhangs. With a squint, it was possible to make out a woman
sitting on a man's lap, kissing his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   At the Saraf haveli, where two barefoot girls in grimy party
dresses scampered after each other, the grubby walls of the
interior courtyards had fanciful paintings of a motor car and a
flying machine.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Jhunjhunuwala haveli, the courtyard was strung with
clotheslines draped with ancient sheets, emerald and pink saris and
men's trousers. The owner, Rajhuwar Dayal, a clothing retailer,
welcomed us into a spacious, sensuously paint-encrusted room.
``There are three kilos of gold in the paintings,'' he said. He
proudly waved to an image of a blue-faced Krishna dancing with his
wife. The room was cast in a warm glow from small stained-glass
windows of lime green, royal blue and deep red, their jewel tones
echoing the fabulous royal ornaments once made for the princely
courts of an earlier era.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Castle, we put our boys in the bathtub and washed
off the sand, then headed down to a lovely interior courtyard that
had been turned into a magical stage set for dinner. Tables laid
with red tablecloths and flickering candles were scattered across
the moonlit lawn. Lights in fretted stone containers edged the
balconies and walkways.
</P>
<P>
   For $8.25, plus tax of 12 1/2 percent, a person (children under
12 free), guests ate from a plentiful Indian buffet and watched a
campy, entertaining sideshow that thrilled the Italian, French and
German tourists, their cameras snapping and video cameras whirring.
(There was not another American in the place while we were there.)
A beautiful dancer in flowing orange chiffon picked up a 100 rupee
note on the ground with her teeth and never upset the tower of
seven pots that teetered on her head. A hammy young man blew great
puffs of fire from his mouth, like the Wizard of Oz. And a boy
danced with a python around his neck. ``That's Kaa,'' shrieked Sam,
familiar with a scene from ``The Jungle Book,'' when he saw one.
</P>
<P>
   Kesri Singh, the imposing, genial proprietor, who is himself a
descendant of the Raja of Mandawa, opened the castle to visitors in
1980 with just six rooms, and has since renovated 65 more, some of
which used to be stables for the horses. No one, he told us, is
trying to preserve the havelis that are the area's biggest tourist
draw. ``This area is quite neglected,'' he said. `'It has no
powerful spokesman.''
</P>
<P>
   His guests are almost entirely from Europe. ``American people
are fussy,'' he said. ``They don't like to waste their time on
bumpy roads. They like to fly.'' We tried not to take his
description personally, especially since it fit us so perfectly.
Kesri encouragingly noted that Jaipur is only three hours away on
better roads, but he also told us that the 155-mile trip to Delhi
could be accomplished in four and a half or five hours _ an
estimate that did not match our own grueling experience.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, we decided to take a look at Fatehpur, another
town known for its havelis. ``This boy will take you,'' Kesri said,
gesturing to a middle-aged man who wore his Dick Dastardly mustache
with a flourish. We all climbed into the Trooper for the 12.4-mile,
40-minute ride to Fatehpur along a single-lane road. Many a jeep
and tourist bus, heavy with Indian passengers on their rooftops,
hurtled past us.
</P>
<P>
   Fatehpur itself is bigger than Mandawa and not as charming, but
it does have some wonderful haveli paintings, with the ancient and
the modern brushing shoulders, and the mark of the British Raj in
the faces on the walls. Finding a guide is no problem. Young men
who speak passable English quickly offer their services to any
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bhaisamal Kedia Haveli, the chowkidar, Bhanwar Singh, an
old man with great tufts of gray hair, showed us portraits of Queen
Victoria and King George in the entry foyer. In the second interior
courtyard, likenesses of Krishna and Ram shared a wall with a
curious airplane that had both bird's wings and whirring
propellers. A British touring car with spoked wheels was next to a
painting of Krishna's wife carried aloft on cushions by four
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Back out on the streets, cluttered with trash, piglets, jingling
horse buggies and putt-putting scooters, we found that almost every
block boasted a haveli. In the Nan Lal Deera haveli, there are
paintings on glass of mustachioed maharajahs. In the Bhagat Ram
Jalan haveli, long-necked camels galloped across the walls.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the havelis are in a terrible state of decline. As
we waited on the main street for our driver to pick us up, we stood
opposite an abandoned haveli, its doors blocked by piles of garbage
and earth, its fine stone screens almost invisible beneath a thick
coating of grime. ``There are 100 havelis in Fatehpur,'' said
Ridmal Rajput, the young guide who had attached himself to us,
``and 75 are locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   As we got back on the road to begin our arduous journey to
Delhi, we whizzed out of Fatehpur, past the modern-day versions of
the wall paintings of Rajasthan _ garish advertisements for
Valvoline, Pepsi and Macroman underwear briefs splashed across the
sides of buildings. It was all a world away from the subtle,
riotously imaginative art of the region's heyday.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Around
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best way to see the havelis in Mandawa and Fatehpur
is to hire a guide through your hotel. In Fatehpur, we also found a
number of young men offering to be guides.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Castle Mandawa, (91-1592) 23124 or 23245, a 71-room hotel
in the town of Mandawa, offers charmingly restored rooms and a good
base for exploring the havelis of the area. The hotel is 155 miles
from Delhi, 104 miles from Jaipur and 118 miles from Bikaner.
</P>
<P>
   All the rooms have a sitting area. The towels are a little
skimpy and the mattresses and pillows not the most comfortable, but
the accommodations are spacious and the atmosphere beguiling.
</P>
<P>
   A standard double room is $38, a deluxe room $50 and a suite
$94.50, plus a 6 percent tax. A dormitory for drivers is provided
free _ and I would not advise driving yourself or being on the
roads after dark. The truck drivers in India are daredevils who
regularly play chicken on the narrow roads.
</P>
<P>
   Room reservations: (91-141) 371194; fax (91-141) 372084.
</P>
<P>
   Guests can use a gorgeous pool with a vista of the desert at the
Desert Resort, under the same management, about a mile away. A
camel ride costs $9.50 for an hour. The $8.25 buffet (plus 7
percent tax) is available to nonguests. Telephone: (91-1592) 23151.

`THE SAM SHEPPARD STORY': FATHER IS DEAD, AND THE TORMENT LIVES ON
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(nk) 
 By WILLIAM McDONALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever known conflicted grief will recognize the
emotional struggle going on in ``My Father's Shadow: The Sam
Sheppard Story,'' a fact-based movie on CBS Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The son lurking in the title is Sam Reese Sheppard, and at
watershed moments in this impassioned if flawed drama, he argues
and anguishes with the specter of the man who was at the center of
one of the most sensational murder trials of this century.
</P>
<P>
   The encounters occur in a hotel room, on the gravelly shore of
Lake Erie and elsewhere. In each, Dr. Sam Sheppard, played by Peter
Strauss, materializes out of thin air to coax, lecture, needle and
otherwise have it out with his grown son (Henry Czerny).
</P>
<P>
   The point in staging these seemingly otherworldly visitations is
not a mystery. They're plainly meant to dramatize a blood bond that
even death can't sever, a kinship that propels the son on a crusade
to clear his father's name in the killing of his pregnant mother in
their lakeside home near Cleveland in July 1954, when the boy was
7.
</P>
<P>
   Even more, these father-son face-offs give vent to a painful
ambivalence that death can't easily erase: Though the son becomes
the father's champion, he can't quite forgive the arrogant man who
cheated on his wife, often treated his son harshly and drank
himself to an early grave, in 1970. The ghost, then, is actually
one side of an interior dialogue made visible.
</P>
<P>
   That the movie's makers chose to render young Sam's turmoil in
so literal a way is one of the few false notes struck here. The
encounters _ usually occasions for speechifying or sentimentality _
only distract from a story that would be absorbing enough without
them, one that inspired both the television series and the movie
``The Fugitive.'' By deftly alternating between the past, through
flashbacks, and the present, ``My Father's Shadow'' makes a
convincing case for Sam Sheppard's innocence and for the guilt of a
window washer who died in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the movie centers on the father-son
relationship, much of the case's courtroom drama and legal history
is left out or addressed only glancingly. A viewer may thus not
come away completely clear on the chain of judicial events: that
the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Sheppard's conviction in 1964,
ruling that the trial had been prejudiced by news-media pressure;
that Sheppard was acquitted in a second trial, in 1966, and that
the son's campaign for damages has been stymied to this day.
</P>
<P>
   But what's never left in doubt is the movie's outrage over not
just the destruction of Sam Sheppard's life but of his family as
well: a son orphaned and Sheppard's mother, father and
father-in-law all dead, two by suicide, soon after the first trial.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is well rendered by a strong cast that overcomes
patches of overheated dialogue. The movie does invent a scene or
two _ in one, young Sam finds his girlfriend and his womanizing
father in a compromising position _ but it resists the obvious
opportunity for gore. Rather than depict the fatal bludgeoning, it
does something even more effective: It registers the shock of the
crime in the bewildered face of a 7-year-old confronting his
mother's blood, smeared on a door, as he is hustled out the house.
</P>

 &HT;    There's Method to CD madness
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're calling today Super Tuesday in the recording industry.
That's what happens when superstars such as Garth Brooks, Mariah
Carey, Whitney Houston, Jewel and Seal all release albums on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman at one Atlanta retailer predicts Method Man's
``Tical,'' his second release without the full Wu-Tang Clan, will
be bigger than the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say Method Man will be bigger here than Garth, bigger
than Whitney, bigger than Mariah,'' says Jimmy Richter, a manager
at Buckhead's HMV. Keith Medin, a manager at Tower, acknowledges
that Method Man will have strong sales, but adds, ``There's so much
(coming out). We've been getting big calls about Whitney's new
album and Jewel should be hot after her `Saturday Night Live'
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Although record labels and acts will begin getting some sales
figures this week, it'll be next week before the official numbers
are announced by SoundScan, which uses computers to track sales,
and Billboard.
</P>
<P>
   A list of major new releases in stores today:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Burt Bacharach: ``One Amazing Night'' tribute. Sheryl Crow,
Barenaked Ladies, Mike Myers, other contemporary performers do
master's tunes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Garth Brooks, ``Garth Brooks Double Live'' (Capiotol). Live
hits, along with three new tunes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mariah Carey, ``1's'' (Columbia). Features 13 chart-topping
tunes, plus four new songs.

 &HT;    Tom Wolfe skewers Atlanta
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wolfe Watch '98
</P>
<P>
   Still aching for news of Tom Wolfe, despite the volumes of
verbiage we've hurled your way? Got you covered:
</P>
<P>
   In his upcoming profile of Wolfe, AP national writer Larry
McShane describes ``A Man in Full'' thus: ``The novel does for
1990s Atlanta what `Bonfire of the Vanities' did for New York City
of the 1980s: skewer its people and pretensions from every angle _
from the mayor's office to the mansions of Atlanta to the annual
Freaknik festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw in satiric shots at the art world and the fitness craze,
trophy wives described as `boys with breasts,' his rap and metal
parodies, a jewel-encrusted football hero named Fareek `The Cannon'
Fanon, and you've got a book in full _ another Wolfe winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, during a recent chat with PBS talk show host Charlie
Rose, Wolfe responded to Fortune magazine managing editor John
Huey's somewhat negative review in the Journal-Constitution. Wolfe
noted that although Huey had been born in Atlanta, he now lived in
New York. Said Wolfe: ``I think John may be out of touch with
what's happening in Atlanta now.''

   Keri Russell is `Felicity', a soapy mix of dewy-eyed adolescent
sensitivity and cable-knit sweaters
</P>
<P>
   By Phil Kloer
</P>
<P>
   Teenaged girl scraps all her plans and follows a boy she barely
knows across the country to college. Once there, she illegally
sneaks into his admission application file, writes him letters,
fights off a perceived rival, re-writes his English essay and
nearly gets him expelled. Throughout, the boy ranges from oblivious
to downright hostile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This infatuation thing is now looking a little scary,'' admits
Keri Russell, who plays Felicity Porter on the new WB drama
``Felicity,'' a soapy mix of dewy-eyed adolescent sensitivity, hip
music, soulful eyes and cable-knit sweaters that is this season's
``It'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Critics were starting to complain that Felicity's obsession with
Ben (Scott Speedman), the boy whose life she has nearly wrecked,
started out cute but was beginning to look like stalking. From cute
crush to borderline creepy in just a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   Russell says she was never bothered by Felicity's intensity. ``I
know people who are married with kids who still hold on to their
college crush, even if it's not realistic. I like that slightly
crazy infatuation thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she says, calling from the ``Felicity'' set in Los
Angeles, ``we're going down a different road now.'' In the future,
the show will play up Felicity's relationship with Noel (Scott
Foley), the puppy-doggy resident assistant in her dorm who wants
Felicity for himself, but has had to play the good friend so far,
listening to her earnest babble about Ben ad infinitum.
</P>
<P>
   But first, tonight's episode will explore the aftermath of the
date rape of Julie by Zack, two supporting characters. The episode,
which was written in consultation with the Advocates for Youth
Media Project, also features Riley Weston, the 32-year-old woman
who caused a minor scandal in the TV industry when she was caught
shaving 13 years off her age and pretending to be a 19-year-old in
order to land a writing job on ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot going on for one little show, but ``Felicity'' has
had more attention that most series since months before it debuted,
when the pilot episode generated mega-buzz. Despite an intense fan
base, ratings have been lukewarm so far, which Russell says is no
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty happy with the way things are going. We don't want
to be like 'Friends.' I don't mean that in a negative sense. It's
like a song on the radio that you hear a thousand times a day. You
get sick of it, it's so in your face. I'd rather be a slow builder
like 'Party of Five.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who's 22, says she's been so busy filming ``Felicity''
every day that she hasn't yet faced the so-in-your-face onslaught
of celebrity. But she has found her friends have gotten hooked on
the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my friends, like, care about what's going on. They call
and say, 'I can't believe that happened!' I go, 'Guys, it's a
show.' ''

RESTIVE REPUBLICANS BRACE FOR ELECTION OF HOUSE LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three of the seven House Republican leadership
slots up for selection Wednesday are expected to be fiercely
contested down to the last minute as candidates scramble to line up
votes before the secret balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The party is in the throes of an intense self-examination after
losing five congressional seats in the Nov. 3 election, trimming
their majority to a tiny 223-212 margin and triggering a mutiny
that led House Speaker Newt Gingrich to announce his resignation
from the speakership and from the House.
</P>
<P>
   While Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., quickly rounded up the
votes to succeed Gingrich, the outcome for three other leadership
slots was less certain. They are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, is being challenged
by Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., and Steve Largent, R-Okla. Although
Armey reportedly has an edge, the contest appears too close to
call. Rep. Dennis J. Hastert, R-Ill., is described by colleagues as
a compromise candidate who could jump in at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   If no candidate gets more than half the vote on the first
ballot, the weakest candidate is dropped from the next ballot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Republican Conference chairman John Boehner, R-Ohio, is being
challenged by J.C. Watts, R-Okla., a gifted orator, former
professional football player and the only black Republican in
Congress. Boehner is reported to have a slight advantage but the
contest is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   _ The post of conference vice chairman is also a toss-up, with
four candidates, Anne M. Northup, R-Ky., Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., Sue
Myrick, R-N.C., and Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., vying for the spot.
The seat is being vacated by Dunn, who is seeking the majority
leader's post.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Livingston, three other candidates appear to have
locked up enough votes to win election Wednesday. They are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Delay, R-Texas, incumbent majority whip;
</P>
<P>
   _ Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, incumbent Republican conference
secretary;
</P>
<P>
   _ Christopher Cox, R-Calif., incumbent Republican policy
committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most in-depth and detailed discussion about the
direction of the House that Republicans have had since they first
took the majority'' in 1994, said Terry Holt, spokesman for the
House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now heading into waters unchartered by Speaker Newt
Gingrich and about to be charted by a new speaker. Everyone sees
that a new day is dawning and they are having a conversation about
how we manage ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   When the closed-door session begins at 9 a.m. Wednesday in room
345 of the Cannon House Office Building, Rep. David Dreier,
R-Calif., soon to be chairman of the House Rules Committee, will
preside because the regular conference chairman, Boehner, is
seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   After appointing three members to be tally clerks to count
votes, Dreier will direct that blank sheets of paper be distributed
so members can write their choices when the vote for each position
is called, in descending order of importance, starting with
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates themselves won't address the caucus. Only the member
nominating each candidate may make a pitch, speaking for as long as
three minutes; a member making a seconding speech can speak for as
long as one minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the second ballot comes, all bets are off,'' said one
Republican staffer, because members are considered free to abandon
their pledges if the voting goes beyond the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members will be looking at who can effectively communicate our
message and how do we get that message to groups like minorities
and women,'' said another Republican aide. ``The question is, who
is the better face to put on the party, what direction are we going
to go in, and how do we best relay what we're doing to the
public.''

 &HT;    TED TURNER FOR PRESIDENT?
 &HT;    Eds: Clarifies Ventura's political background in graf 4.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So what does the political class think about CNN
founder Ted Turner pondering a presidential campaign?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding? It'd sure make it more interesting,''
exclaimed Larry Sabato, author of ``Feeding Frenzy,'' a book about
the 1996 presidential campaign, and a political science professor
at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have to be as a Democrat. The Republicans aren't
going to make Jane Fonda the First Lady. I'm not sure Democrats
would either,'' said Sabato. ``He probably wouldn't get a
mainstream party nomination, so he's got to be thinking about the
Reform Party. It's got to be the Jesse Ventura model.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the notion of a sarcastic, Southern-fried media mogul
with no political experience running for president might seem more
outlandish if a former professional wrestler hadn't just been
elected governor of Minnesota in his first try for a major elective
office.
</P>
<P>
   And Gov.-elect Ventura isn't the only role model in the
Turner-for-president scenario. Ross Perot has certainly shown that
a controversial billionaire who speaks his mind and spends his
money can mount a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotline _ an electronic tip sheet for political junkies _
took note Monday of the New Yorker magazine quoting Turner as
saying ``I am very serious about running for president, but Jane
doesn't want me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Fonda, Turner's wife, has been a villain for three decades
to conservatives who remember the actress as ``Hanoi Jane'' for her
anti-war activism during the Vietnam era. The likelihood of her
campaigning her husband in a GOP primary does seem unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the Democrats?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing to say at this point,'' said Tony
Wyche, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. ``We're
heard that he's said that he's interested, but we don't know if,
how or what.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post reported that ``the specter of the 60-year-old
billionaire throwing his hat in the ring is sure to be a hot potato
for the nation's top politicos, who are well aware of his
jaw-dropping ramblings over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Turner Broadcasting's office of corporate affairs
long to officially respond to the New Yorker piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did say it, but it was just in talking,'' Turner
spokesperson Phillip Evans told the Atlanta Journal and
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The official Turner response? ``At the present time, Mr. Turner
has no plans to announce his candidacy for president.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the nation's capital wasn't exactly abuzz Monday with
rumors of a Ted Turner presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work for CNN and this is the first I've heard about it,''
said William Schneider, a political analyst with the cable news
network and the American Enterprise Institute.

   IRAQ-U.N. (United Nations) _ As weapons inspectors prepare to

that Saddam Hussein may have bought himself time with his

   ``You can have the Civil Rights Division and its lawyers charge
in like the United States cavalry and make it right, but that's not
reality,'' said Bill Lann Lee, who is the acting assistant attorney
general in charge of the Justice Department's Civil Rights
Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our civil rights laws. They state broad propositions
and contain broad promises. But it's really up to you in these
communities to make it work, to give life to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, one of the final speakers at a three-day conference on
racism, poverty and inequality in the South, said civil rights in
the United States have not progressed much beyond 1968, the year
Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling King's final sermon, Lee said, ``We're in the
wilderness'' in the 1990s, and getting to the Promised Land ``is
not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions from conference delegates, Lee
sympathized with those who expressed outrage that minorities are
disproportionately represented in prisons. But the ``political
reality,'' he added, is ``that is something you can change faster
than I can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has supported many of the policies
critics blame for minorities' being overrepresented in the criminal
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the administration has heard enough about the
issue,'' Lee said. ``It needs to.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who earlier in his career spent 10 years in the South as a
lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People in school desegregation cases, said the conference _
``Unfinished Business: Overcoming Racism, Poverty and Inequality in
the South'' _ is ``misnamed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really about the future of the South _ it's about the
future of the nation, because the issues that arise are the same,''
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent murders of James Byrd Jr. in Texas and Matthew
Shepard in Wyoming are ``reminders that there is something dark and
ugly lurking everywhere in this country,'' he added. The deaths of
Byrd, a black man, and Shepard, a homosexual, are widely thought to
have been hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which drew about 500 people from communities
throughout the South, ended Monday with approval of a ``New
Southern Manifesto'' committing the delegates to improving
education, health, housing, job opportunities and the criminal
justice system throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   The manifesto also petitioned political and business leaders
``to redress these grievances in the spirit of our founding
documents.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates, in their manifesto, vowed to ``raise up a
generation of new Southerners, new Americans, who assume equality
as a birthright.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I was working on a group project when one of my
associates disagreed with me. When I showed him that he was wrong,
he became very upset and stormed out of the meeting. On his way
out, he threw his calculator across the room and it shattered on
the wall. He came back later and apologized, and most of the group
shrugged off his behavior, saying he's just that kind of guy.
Should I discuss what happened with management? J.T. &QL; 
A. When ``just that kind of guy'' turns a calculator into a
missile, you should definitely discuss what happened with
management. It may be normal for some employees to fervently,
adamantly and even emotionally express their views and opinions,
but there is nothing normal about rage.
</P>
<P>
   Your associate was out of control, and frankly, he and the rest
of you were very lucky that the calculator hit a wall and not a
forehead. In fact, the company was lucky too.
</P>
<P>
   When employees act this way, they need to be targets themselves
_ targeted for counseling, guidance and discipline. In many cases,
this type of aggressive behavior is considered grounds for
immediate dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have a right to a safe work environment, and if they
are aware of any factors, including human factors, that are
creating dangers, they should present the facts to management. When
employees throw things in an organization, many employers throw
them out of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you as a manager say when all of your employees keep
criticizing each other? They complain about each other's work,
personal habits, hours and anything else that comes to mind. B.G. &QL; 
A. When employees seem to be spending more time digging into each
other instead of digging into their work, there are a number of
approaches that can help. There is not one specific approach,
because this type of childish behavior can be a symptom of any
number of larger problems.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the employees' hypercritical mode can be due to
such factors as confusion over objectives, lack of resources,
inadequate team-building or perhaps just plain cranky people. If
you are unable to isolate the cause or causes of this behavior, you
should try a direct approach by bringing the employees together and
indicating the time has come for the excessive criticism to stop.
Within such a meeting, you can work with the employees to develop
some alternative behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   You should cite examples of inappropriate actions without naming
names, and then ask the group to come up with better ways to deal
with each other. Having the employees do some role-plays, such as
by assuming each other's roles and re-enacting some of the less
pleasant exchanges, can also give them compelling insights into the
way their behaviors are perceived, as well as into the way they
should be acting.
</P>
<P>
   If you see a reduction in criticizing, give the employees some
positive feedback. And for those employees who still feel that
digging into others is a way of life, it is time for them to
understand that they are digging themselves into a hole. &QL; 
Q. I work at the local office of a national trucking company. The
office has never had a specific dress code, and dress has always
been casual. The company just instituted a policy that requires all
females in the office to dress up in skirts, dresses or dressy
pants. This will require the office clerks to spend a good deal
more on clothes than we spend now. Company management is virtually
all men, and I question their motives for this change. What can
they require us to wear? H.B. &QL; 
A. Sometimes employees have to wonder if managers sit around at a
meeting and say something like, ``The employees seem to be pretty
happy. I wonder if there is anything we can do to annoy them.''
And, soon enough, the topic turns to the dress code.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that if the employers have a reasonable purpose,
they can implement standards for dress and grooming as conditions
of employment. At the same time, they can run into trouble if the
dress code somehow discriminates against various employees, such as
the females.
</P>
<P>
   However, rather than going down the path, it makes more sense
for you and your associates to meet with management to express your
thoughts about the new dress code. In addition, let management know
about the additional costs, hampered mobility, possible safety
concerns and general dissatisfaction that the new code can cause.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the bigger picture, many progressive companies are
moving toward more casual attire. Is this new dress code actually a
road sign indicating that the trucking company may be heading in
the wrong direction?

 &HT;    GATES TESTIMONY MAKES JUDGE CHUCKLE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In videotaped testimony at the Microsoft antitrust
trial, an evasive Bill Gates refused Monday to say the software
giant had declared a ``jihad'' against arch-rival Netscape
Communications Corp. to seize control of Internet gateways.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial entered its fifth week, Gates repeatedly declined
to admit that Microsoft viewed Netscape as a competitor in the
super-heated browser market _ until confronted by an e-mail to that
effect from one of his top lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look carefully at any significant opportunity to
gain share vs. Netscape,'' Microsoft vice president of development
Paul Maritz wrote Gates, Microsoft's chairman and co-founder, in
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the Gates tape rolled in the courtroom on a 10-foot screen,
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson chuckled and shook his
head his head in wonder at the often farcical 50-minute verbal duel
between David Boies, the government's lead counsel, and his hostile
witness.
</P>
<P>
   In deposing Gates, Boies also handed him a March 13, 1997,
document from Brad Chase, a Microsoft vice president, that said,
``We need to continue our jihad next year. ...Browser share needs
to remain a key priority for our field and marketing efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates sparred at length with Boise over the meaning of such
terms as ``competition,'' ``concerned'' and ``market share,'' and
offered his own interpretation of his colleague's use of ``jihad,''
the Arab word for ``holy war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is referring to our vigorous efforts to make a
superior product and to market that product,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   When Boise asked Gates whether he saw the sentence in the
document that said, ``we need to continue our jihad next year,''
Gates replied: ``Now I see _ it doesn't say Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Boise: ``Well, when it says 'we' there, do you understand that
means something other than Microsoft, sir?
</P>
<P>
   Gates: ``It could mean Brad Chase's group,'' Gates replied after
pausing for 32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When Boise asked Gates again whether he understood Chase as
``referring to Microsoft when he uses the word 'we,''' Gates waited
for another 52 seconds before answering, ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think he means when he uses the word 'we'?'' Boise
persisted, speaking slowly and clearly as one might to a
slow-witted child rather than a chief executive officer with a net
worth of $58 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates tape was meant to underscore testimony from Glenn
Weadock, the fifth witness in the landmark trail. Weadock, the
author of a dozen computer books, serves as a $100-an-hour
government consultant in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Weadock agreed during an exacting cross-examination by Microsoft
lawyer Richard Pepperman that Microsoft's Windows 98 operating
system and its Internet Explorer browser could not be pulled apart
without risking a fatal software crash.
</P>
<P>
   As his central theme, Weadock testified that some users,
including a sampling of Fortune 500 companies, would have preferred
to have been left the choice of removing the integrated Microsoft
browser and working only with Netscape Navigator on their personal
computer desktops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are aware, are you not, Mr. Weadock, that the Department
of Justice compliant filed last May that initiated this trial
demanded that Microsoft separate the browser from the operating
system in Windows 98?'' asked Pepperman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read the complaint,'' Weadock replied.

<P>
   IRAQ-U.N. (United Nations) _ As weapons inspectors prepare to
resume work in Iraq on Tuesday, there is a strong consensus here
that Saddam Hussein may have bought himself time with his
last-minute pledge to cooperate, but that any effort on his part to
interfere with inspections again will trigger almost automatic
military action. There is also a sense that the chances are not
good that Iraq will live up to its pledges. By Barbara Crossette.

 &HT;    GATES TESTIMONY MAKES JUDGE CHUCKLE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In videotaped testimony at the Microsoft antitrust
trial, an evasive Bill Gates refused Monday to say the software
giant had declared a ``jihad'' against arch-rival Netscape
Communications Corp. to seize control of Internet gateways.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial entered its fifth week, Gates repeatedly declined
to admit that Microsoft viewed Netscape as a competitor in the
super-heated browser market _ until confronted by an e-mail to that
effect from one of his top lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look carefully at any significant opportunity to
gain share vs. Netscape,'' Microsoft vice president of development
Paul Maritz wrote Gates, Microsoft's chairman and co-founder, in
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the Gates tape rolled in the courtroom on a 10-foot screen,
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson chuckled and shook his
head his head in wonder at the often farcical 50-minute verbal duel
between David Boies, the government's lead counsel, and his hostile
witness.
</P>
<P>
   In deposing Gates, Boies also handed him a March 13, 1997,
document from Brad Chase, a Microsoft vice president, that said,
``We need to continue our jihad next year. ...Browser share needs
to remain a key priority for our field and marketing efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates sparred at length with Boise over the meaning of such
terms as ``competition,'' ``concerned'' and ``market share,'' and
offered his own interpretation of his colleague's use of ``jihad,''
the Arab word for ``holy war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is referring to our vigorous efforts to make a
superior product and to market that product,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   When Boise asked Gates whether he saw the sentence in the
document that said, ``we need to continue our jihad next year,''
Gates replied: ``Now I see _ it doesn't say Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Boise: ``Well, when it says 'we' there, do you understand that
means something other than Microsoft, sir?
</P>
<P>
   Gates: ``It could mean Brad Chase's group,'' Gates replied after
pausing for 32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When Boise asked Gates again whether he understood Chase as
``referring to Microsoft when he uses the word 'we,''' Gates waited
for another 52 seconds before answering, ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think he means when he uses the word 'we'?'' Boise
persisted, speaking slowly and clearly as one might to a
slow-witted child rather than a chief executive officer with a net
worth of $58 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates tape was meant to underscore testimony from Glenn
Weadock, the fifth witness in the landmark trail. Weadock, the
author of a dozen computer books, serves as a $100-an-hour
government consultant in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Weadock agreed during an exacting cross-examination by Microsoft
lawyer Richard Pepperman that Microsoft's Windows 98 operating
system and its Internet Explorer browser could not be pulled apart
without risking a fatal software crash.
</P>
<P>
   As his central theme, Weadock testified that some users,
including a sampling of Fortune 500 companies, would have preferred
to have been left the choice of removing the integrated Microsoft
browser and working only with Netscape Navigator on their personal
computer desktops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are aware, are you not, Mr. Weadock, that the Department
of Justice compliant filed last May that initiated this trial
demanded that Microsoft separate the browser from the operating
system in Windows 98?'' asked Pepperman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read the complaint,'' Weadock replied.

 &HT;    Davenport sitting pretty for top spot
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport can clinch the final No. 1 ranking in women's
tennis this week by winning her first-round match Wednesday against
Sandrine Testud at the season-ending Chase Championships at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Davenport falls, No. 2 Martina Hingis would have to win
the tournament to block Davenport's attempt to become the first
American-born player to finish atop the WTA Tour's rankings since
Chris Evert in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The plot with the most intrigue, however, involves the
resurgence of Steffi Graf, the Chase champion two years ago when
she was still the game's No. 1 player.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, now ranked 12th, won her second title in a row, last week
in Philadelphia, where she became the first unseeded player to beat
the top two players in the world _ Davenport and Hingis _ in the
same tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recurring injuries, early-round defeats and
speculation of retirement, Graf has won three titles this year _
one fewer than Hingis _ and her winning percentage (.794, 31-8) is
fourth behind Hingis (.829, 63-13), Davenport (.825, 66-14) and
Venus Williams (.803, 53-13).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm right where I want to be,'' Graf said. ``I didn't think
I'd be here two weeks ago. Winning these last two tournaments shows
I'm much further along than I thought I'd be.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that she drew defending champion Jana Novotna in
the first round tonight and could face Monica Seles, Davenport and
Hingis in the quarters, semis and final.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of Lindsay....
</P>
<P>
   Davenport was selected the WTA Tour's Player of the Year in
media voting announced Monday. She also won the Diamond Aces Award,
chosen by tournament directors in recognition of the player who has
done the most to promote the game. Other award winners were
Davenport and Natasha Zvereva (Doubles Team of the Year), Patty
Schnyder (Most Improved Player), Serena Williams (Newcomer of the
Year), Seles (Comeback Player), Graf (Most Exciting Playr), Yayuk
Basuki (Sportsmanship) and Joanette Kruger (Player Service).
</P>
<P>
   Eltingh's grand exit
</P>
<P>
   Jacco Eltingh could become the ATP Tour's first player to retire
at No. 1. The Dutchman is the top-ranked doubles player in the
world, and he and Paul Haarhuis are the No. 1 seeds this week for
the ATP Tour Doubles Championships in Hartford, Conn. Atlanta's
Ellis Ferreira and partner Rick Leach are the fifth-seeded team,
and former University of Georgia player Francisco Montana will make
his tournament debut with Don Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' job is simple
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras knows exactly what he has to do in his quest for a
record sixth-straight year finishing at No. 1. He leads Marcelo
Rios by 33 points entering next week's ATP Tour Championship in
Hannover, Germany, and whoever does better there in the eight-man
field will finish atop the rankings. If Rios and Sampras win the
same number of matches in their round-robin groups without
advancing to the semifinals, Sampras would hold the top spot.
Others who have qualified, in order, are Andre Agassi, Carlos Moya,
Alex Corretja, Karol Kucera, Tim Henman and Yevgeny Kafelnikov. No.
3 Pat Rafter and No. 8 Richard Krajicek are out with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly . . . .
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's rise to No. 4 in the world after falling out of the top
100 ranks as the year's best comeback, but perhaps just as
impressive is Todd Martin's move to No. 16 this week after winning
the Stockholm Open. He finished No. 81 last year and missed seven
months with elbow trouble. . . . For the second in a row, Agassi
played last week in the USTA Men's Challenger of Las Vegas, the
``minor-league'' tournament that helped launch his comeback. This
time, he just played doubles with coach Brad Gilbert, and they lost
in the quarterfinals.

 &HT;    Vols remain on top despite weekend squeaker
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tennessee's 28-24 come-from-behind win over Arkansas
last Saturday did nothing to hurt its position in the Bowl
Championship Series rankings. The Volunteers remained No. 1 when
the new numbers were released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings combine four elements: average ranking in the two
major polls, average ranking in three computer polls, strength of
schedule and won-loss record. The two teams with the lowest ratings
at the end of the season will play in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4 for
the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (9-0) dropped from a tie for No. 1 to No. 2 in the USA
Today/ESPN coaches poll on Sunday, but the Vols still improved
their margin in the Bowl Championship Series standings over No. 2
UCLA. A week ago, the Volunteers had a 3.92 rating to UCLA's 5.73,
for a margin of 1.61. On Monday the Vols had improved their rating
to 3.77 to UCLA's 5.81, a margin of 2.01.
</P>
<P>
   By playing and beating an 8-0 Arkansas team Saturday, Tennessee
improved its strength of schdule from 23 to 13, for a net reduction
of .40 on the total ranking. It also moved up from No. 2 to No. 1
in the Seattle Times computer poll, which allowed the Vols to pick
up about .25 points.
</P>
<P>
   With games remaining against Kentucky (7-3), Vanderbilt (2-8),
and probably Arkansas (8-1) in the SEC Championship Game, the Vols
appear to be in good shape for the Fiesta Bowl, if they win out.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest remaining question is whether No. 3 Kansas State can
catch No. 2 UCLA if both teams win the rest of their games.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State (10-0) is still .74 points out of second place
because of a schedule that is rated No. 68 out of 112. UCLA's
schedule, by comparison, is No. 12. But the Kansas State schedule
only gets better, as the Wildcats play Missouri this week and play
in the Big 12 championship game on Dec. 5. If Kansas State wins
both and finishes 12-0 it probably would move ahead of UCLA in the
standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins play at home this week against Southern California
and finish the regular season on Dec. 5 at Miami.

 &HT;    Florida still not out of National Championship hunt
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ For a few delicious moments Saturday night,
Florida coach Steve Spurrier thought his team might get back in the
race for the SEC championship.
</P>
<P>
   After the Gators' 33-14 win over South Carolina, the Florida
coaches gathered in their offices to watch the Arkansas-Tennessee
game on television from Knoxville. Arkansas led 24-22 when
Tennessee was stopped on downs with 1:54 left. A few nervous smiles
broke out in a room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we were pulling for Arkansas,'' Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Arkansas quarterback Clint Stoerner fumbled with 1:43
left, Tennessee got the ball and went on to score, winning the game
28-24. Tennessee's victory effectively ended Florida's hopes in the
SEC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thinking that if Arkansas could beat them, then maybe
Kentucky could, too,'' Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols, who beat the Gators 20-17 in overtime on Sept. 19,
have to lose their final two games with Kentucky and Vanderbilt for
Florida to win the division. Spurrier conceded Monday that those
odds were long.
</P>
<P>
   So the Gators apparently will miss out on the SEC championship
game for the second year in a row. But here's a nice twist for
Florida: If the No. 4 Gators can find a way to win at No. 5 Florida
State on Saturday (3:30 p.m. ABC), they might yet get a shot at the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message Spurrier is conveying to his team this week
as they prepare to travel to Tallahassee, where the Gators have not
won since 1986. Spurrier, for all his success at Florida, is 0-3-1
at Doak Campbell Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three undefeated teams (Tennessee, Kansas State, UCLA)
just seem to be barely getting by every week,'' Spurrier said.
``They have to win them all. We have to win this one and wait and
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the leader in the clubhouse at a golf tournament, Spurrier
said, the winner of Saturday's Florida-Florida State game will be
in a great position to get into the Fiesta Bowl, which will match
the nation's top two teams on Jan. 4. It will be the season-ender
for the two Florida teams, while the three undefeated teams all
have tough games on Dec. 5. Tennessee will be in the SEC
Championship game, probably in a rematch with Arkansas. Kansas
State has to play No. 6 Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 championship game.
UCLA must travel to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're thinking about is trying to beat FSU so that we're
in position if some of those teams lose down the stretch,''
Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has a couple of things in its favor as it gets ready for
the Seminoles. First, it has a hot quarterback in Doug Johnson, who
finally appears to be fulfilling his potential. Johnson has thrown
for 1,118 yards and 10 touchdowns in his past three games.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State, on the other hand, will have to rely on sophomore
quarterback Marcus Outzen, who took over last week for the injured
Chris Weinke. Outzen is solid but not nearly as effective at
getting the ball to Peter Warrick, Florida State's All-American
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   But Spurrier is more concerned about a Florida State defense
that has been manhandling its opponents in the second half of the
season. Even though the Seminoles are without Weinke, Florida has
no reason to get over-confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won there in the 1990s, and (Florida State has)
what may be the No. 1 defense around,'' Spurrier said. ``No reason
to think it's not going to be a tough game.''
</P>
<P>
   FSU also has the revenge factor on its side. Florida upset
then-No. 1 Florida State 32-29 in Gainesville last season, knocking
the Seminoles out of a shot at the national championship.

 &HT;    Ole Miss gets ready for 'toughest team' Georgia
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It's November, so it's time for the annual rite of
Mississippi coach Tommy Tuberville being mentioned for various job
openings across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago,Tuberville was a candidate at Alabama. He nearly
left for Arkansas last year, and the Rebels' fourth-year coach
already has removed his name from Auburn's list this season.
</P>
<P>
   While the attention is certainly flattering , it also could be a
distraction for Mississippi, which is trying to rebound from a 34-0
drubbing at Arkansas on Nov. 7. The Rebels, who are 6-3 overall,
hope to improve their bowl chances with two games remaining,
including Saturday's road date at No. 14 Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A victory over the Bulldogs or archrival Mississippi State in a
nationally televised game on Nov. 26 could deliver Ole Miss some
credibility, considering that its six victories have come against
opponents that are a combined 17-44 and all with losing records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting ready to play the toughest team we've played all
year,'' Tuberville said.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the off-week addressing his secondary, which has been
hit hard by personnel losses in recent weeks. Free safety Syniker
Taylor, a promising freshman who was seventh on the team with 39
tackles, dislocated his ankle in practice before the Arkansas game
and is out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, cornerback Korey Graham, a sophomore who played in nickel
coverage, left the team for academic reasons, Tuberville said.
</P>
<P>
   Pass defense and turnovers were the Rebels' problems against the
Razorbacks. On Arkansas' second play, quarterback Clint Stoerner
threw deep to wideout Anthony Lucas, who got behind left cornerback
Gary Thigpen. Safety Anthony Magee was too late getting over to
help, and Lucas grabbed a 50-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas pair connected again late in the first half when
Lucas ran a slant pattern, getting inside position on cornerback
Timothy Strickland for a 36-yard touchdown. Lucas had four catches
for 177 yards in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to find some stability and get some
consistency in the secondary,'' Tuberville said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville has moved sophomore flanker Ken Lucas to cornerback,
although he still will see some action on offense. That move could
allow Strickland to work some at strong safety, which has been
Tuberville's biggest concern.
</P>
<P>
   Magee, who started the last three games at strong safety, will
replace Taylor at free safety. Junior-college transfer Kenny Woods,
who started the first six games, will return to the starting lineup
at strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to find the right combination to get more
speed and experience on the field,'' Tuberville said. ``We've got
to get ready to play all the underneath stuff, as well as the deep
connection of (Dogs quarterback Quincy) Carter and (wideout Champ)
Bailey. We caught Hines Ward from behind two years ago. If Champ
Bailey gets behind us, we won't catch him. I don't care who we've
got out there.''

 &HT;    Wake a possible victim of Sports Illustrated poll
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The date was Aug. 25, and every member of the Wake
Forest football team had a photocopy of a page from that week's
Sports Illustrated magazine. The national magazine had picked the
Demon Deacons as the 22nd-best team in the nation, and spirits and
expectations were high in Winston-Salem, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The school with the lowest winning percentage in Division I
football finally was getting some recognition.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a long haul for coach Jim Caldwell, who came to Wake
Forest after stints as an assistant at Iowa, Northwestern, Colorado
and, for six seasons before his arrival in Winston-Salem.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale redshirting for two seasons looked as if it had
finally paid off for the Deacons. But things went wrong. Air Force
pummeled Wake 42-0 in the opener. Wake opened at Air Force and got
pummeled 42-0. Then after defeating Navy and Clemson in Death
Valley, the Deacons lost at home to Division I-AA Appalachian State
and Duke, which had lost an ACC-record 21 games in a row. Saturday,
the dispirited Deacons come to Grant Field at 3-7 to end the
season. With a loss, Wake will finish 3-8 _ the seventh time this
decade it will have won three games or fewer. Caldwell's record is
17-48, yet Wake athletics director Ron Wellman has said, ``Jim
Caldwell will be the coaching here into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the worst thing that ever happened to us was being
picked No. 22 by Sports Illustrated,''said Dustin Lyman, one of
Wake's starting inside linebackers. ``As much as coach tells you
not to let stuff like that go to your head, I think maybe some
people did.''
</P>
<P>
   When Adrian Duncan was asked if he thought Duke had come to
Winston-Salem hungry for a win, he said, ``Hell, yeah. I think
everybody that comes to play Wake Forest is hungry for a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have watched the program since Caldwell's arrival in
1993 say the coach is competent, but they think that some of his
assistant coaches are overmatched. The staff does a good job Sunday
through Friday, they say, but things move too quickly for them on
Saturday, resulting in stupid penalties, questionable calls and too
many timeouts. Against Appalachian State, Duke and North Carolina,
Wake needed a timeout and didn't have one left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, if I could explain it to you, I'd love to,'' says
free safety Jeffrey Muyres, Wake's leading tackler, a native of
Atlanta and brother of Tech receiver Jon. ''It's been very
confusing. The only way I can explain it is I don't think we've
played a complete four-quarter game.''
</P>
<P>
   Muyres says Wake isn't coming to Atlanta to roll over. ``This is
the game we're looking at as building for the future,'' he said.
``This game is just as big for us as it is for them. This is the
first game of a new season. . . . It would be great to go out with
an ACC win against Georgia Tech.''

TEXAS TEEN ACCUSED OF SETTING BOY ON FIRE RECEIVES FURLOUGHS FROM
JUVENILE CENTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By PAUL McKAY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONROE, Texas _ The Houston-area teen-ager accused of dousing an
8-year-old neighbor with gasoline and setting him on fire has spent
two Sundays with relatives while on furlough from Montgomery
County's juvenile detention center.
</P>
<P>
   Don W. Collins, 13, of Splendora spent at least one of the
furloughs at the home of the aunt and uncle with whom he was living
when the younger boy was attacked on his 8th birthday. Collins has
been detained in the juvenile lockup since July 3 on allegations
that he torched Robert Middleton.
</P>
<P>
   Robert, who was burned over 99 percent of his body in the
assault on the wooded trail across the street from where he and
Collins both lived at the time, is recovering at the Shriners Burns
Hospital-Galveston, where authorities say he may have to remain
confined through February.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County prosecutor Mike Valdez said the County
Attorney's office agreed to the six-hour furloughs, which were
requested by defense lawyer Bill Hall and approved by Juvenile
Judge Mason Martin, because bail is not allowed for juvenile
defendants under Texas law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in custody for a long time and may be in custody a
long time before his case goes to trial,'' prosecutor Mike Valdez
said. ``Overall, his conduct since he's been in detention has been
good. So we did not disagree to the idea of furloughs. It was the
fair thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert's father, Bobby Ray Middleton, said Monday he was not
aware of the weekend releases for Collins, but he declined comment.
He and his wife, Colleen, have given no interviews since the June
28 attack, referring all questions to other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have plenty to say about everything when the time is
right, but now is not the right time,'' said Middleton, who works
at a family-owned glass business.
</P>
<P>
   Robert's uncle, Mark Wise, noted that Robert's condition has
improved immensely since the boy entered the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to comment on furloughs or anything else
because all that stuff is for the police and the courts,'' Wise
said. ``We've always taken the attitude that we'll let the police
and the courts do their business. We have enough to worry about
with an 8-year-old boy who's going to be in the hospital for a
long, long time. Even when he gets out, he'll still be an
outpatient.``
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Middleton, who has moved out of the Splendora neighborhood
where he and his family lived next door to Collins and the teen's
aunt and uncle _ John Horn Sr. and Fairy Horn _ now lives with his
two other children in east Montgomery County.
</P>
<P>
   Splendora, a community of 850 people, is about 35 miles north of
downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Middleton's wife, who also used to work at the glass company, is
residing in Galveston close to Robert.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though he had no legal guardian after his mother died
several years ago, Collins had lived with the Horns and was
well-known in the neighborhood where he and Robert were often seen
playing together.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Thompson, who lives two doors from the Horns, said he saw
Collins in the family's yard two Sundays ago and briefly talked to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him how the process is going, and he told me that
they're just waiting for Robert to talk about what happened,''
Thompson said. ``I asked him if he had anything to do with this,
and he said, `No, sir, I did not have anything to do with this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart of hearts, I think Don is innocent. He may not be
completely innocent _ he may know something _ but I just don't buy
it. I don't know who else might have done it, but I just can't
accept that he did this.``
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is shared by some other neighbors who say that
while Collins once got kicked off a school bus for fighting, his
general conduct was never so bad that he appeared capable of the
kind of heinous crimes for which he is being detained.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't any real threatening kid, not really a bully,'' said
James Bruce, a Houston police officer who lives around the corner
from the Horns. ``I didn't know he'd been here (on furlough) until
he was already gone again. Speaking as one who has an 11-year-old
daughter, I wasn't upset when I found out he'd been here. If he had
already been convicted, I wouldn't want him around. He is innocent
until he's proven guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to come around and pick up sticks for me to make
himself three or four bucks,'' Bruce said. ``He was a hard little
worker. He was sly like a fox, always trying to get some snuff out
of the adults around here, and he'd usually manage to get some from
somebody. The only trouble I ever knew him to cause, before this
happened, was kid stuff _ the kind of trouble we all got into when
we were 13. I'm not saying he did it or didn't do it, but some of
the people around here are having a hard time believing he could do
it.``

STARR'S LAST CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When he testifies Thursday before the House
Judiciary Committee, will Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr try to
put the kindest face possible on his relentless crusade to bring
down President Clinton for lying about illicit sex?
</P>
<P>
   Of course.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be an absolutely honest face, expressing the kind of
unflinching, painful truth he demands of Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   That's another question.
</P>
<P>
   Starr knows that most Americans disagree with his assessment of
the enormity of the president's wrongdoing and the overwrought
conclusions that the impeachment recommendations were based on.
With the House poised to vote on the issue, his two-hour
performance is the climax that he has been building toward for four
years. He badly needs to justify himself and soften his image.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr faces questions under oath about his own integrity and
judgment as tough in their way as those hurled at the president
when he prevaricated and indulged in semantic silliness during his
grand jury testimony and his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case. Initially, Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde demanded
that committee members ask only about Clinton's conduct and ignore
Starr's, but that looked too much like a partisan coverup and was
sure to backfire politically.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, Starr gets two uninterrupted hours to lay out his
case, and the White House gets only 30 minutes to cross-examine
him.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the proceeding will seem unfair no matter how it is
handled. A hearing dominated by Starr as sole witness would strike
fair-minded Americans as one more reason to view the impeachment
controversy as politically motivated. Yet calling more witnesses,
which is still an alternative, would delay the process and further
muddy the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And only Starr can reverse what looks like a pending bipartisan
stampede away from impeachment. A new CNN/USA Today Gallup Poll
reports that 59 percent of those surveyed disapprove of holding
hearings at all and 62 percent disapprove of the GOP's handling of
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   To be more persuasive in person than he was in his report, Starr
must come across as more candid and forthright than Clinton, not
simply as a man of more rigid moral standards. Maybe the prosecutor
can do that without confessing to personal and political hostility
toward the president, but it is doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   A pretense of judicious neutrality would not be credible.
Starr's track record argues against that.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how he conveniently forgot to include in his
impeachment report Lewinsky's fervent denial under oath that anyone
ever asked her to lie or promised her a job for her silence?
Instead, Starr's report sets out as an impeachable charge the
unconfirmed claim that the president and his supporters tried to
buy her off.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also pulled a suspicious last-minute publicity stunt last
week by reviving charges against Clinton by Kathleen Willey, a
onetime White House volunteer, and indicting former Associate
Attorney General Webster Hubbell once again. It is a stretch to
interpret the timing as accidental.
</P>
<P>
   The Willey matter _ she claims Clinton groped her, and he denies
it _ is too amorphous to have much impact on an impeachment vote.
Starr did not even pretend to have conclusive evidence, new or old.
But reviving her charges does give pious conservatives another
excuse to go into another round of condemnation of Clinton's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Hubbell looks vindictive, driven by Starr's
failure to nail anyone else in the Whitewater land deals, the issue
he was originally mandated to probe.
</P>
<P>
   But it will ultimately not matter how skilled Starr turns out to
be in his own defense. He can mislead folks with oratorical
flourishes and still not overcome the consequences of the midterm
election, which alerted moderate Republicans as well as Democrats
that it would be unwise to carry this political vendetta any
further.
</P>
<P>
   But so far as we can tell, Starr did his darndest in his written
report to Congress, claiming 11 grounds for impeachment essentially
based on the concept that trying to conceal a consensual adulterous
affair is an unforgivable abuse of power. If he has any
blockbusters left, the world will wonder why he withheld them.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Judiciary Committee members have been all over
television prejudging the president and calling their own political
integrity into question. And the committee as a whole did not cover
itself in glory when it sent to Clinton 81 questions demanding that
he ``admit or deny'' the allegations and queries they raised. The
questions included such gratuitously insulting nonsense as whether
he knows he is the chief law enforcement officer of the United
States. Kindergarten stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it will not be easy for Hyde to get his badly
polarized committee to polish off the hearings quickly. But he is
supported in that effort by Bob Livingston, R-La., who wants the
whole matter finished before he officially takes over as House
speaker next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Paula Jones case is history and so should the House
impeachment inquiry be. Congress should forget impeachment and
censure the president instead. And Starr should leave Washington
and get a life.

KILLING DRAWS NEBRASKA TOWN INTO PAINFULLY PERSONAL DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   HEBRON, Neb. _ A few weeks ago, Vernal
Ohlrich was just a retired plumber with stomach problems and one
very sick wife.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, charged with first-degree murder, he is a cause.
</P>
<P>
   The 76-year-old's case reverberates across Nebraska with echoes
of a national debate about mercy killing.
</P>
<P>
   Early Oct. 27, Ohlrich fired a slug from a .22-caliber handgun
into his wife's brain, ending her painful battle with cancer and
starting his own struggle with the legal system. On that much the
local prosecutor, investigators and Ohlrich's defense attorney
agree. And no one has yet suggested Ohlrich was motivated by
anything other than mercy born of watching 74-year-old Phyllis
Ohlrich in prolonged misery.
</P>
<P>
   But what to do with a man who ended a medical dilemma with a
handgun?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel real angry with him, but I know he shouldn't have
done it,'' said Clara Muehling, who lives across the street from
Ohlrich in Deshler, Neb. ``I don't think he belongs in prison, but
it seems like they should do something to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Thayer County Attorney Dan Werner will not seek the death
penalty, but he has charged Ohlrich with first-degree murder.
Conviction would require a life prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than self-defense, the use of deadly force is illegal in
Nebraska,'' he said. ``If this is, in fact, characterized as a
mercy killing, that does not mean it is legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlrich's attorney, Joe Murray, argues that the killing was
prompted by compassion and consequently should be treated
differently from other murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who acted out of desperation to end the
suffering of someone he loved very much,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Ohlrichs were devoted to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very close,'' said Harold Struve, publisher of /{The
Deshler Rustler/} who grew up with the couple. ``They got along
very well and had an extremely close-knit family.''
</P>
<P>
   They were married 57 years and had spent their retirement years
traveling, playing cards and attending St. Peter Lutheran Church.
In late 1997, after Phyllis Ohlrich had complained of stomach pains
for years, they learned that she had colon cancer. In May 1998 she
underwent abdominal surgery. Doctors told them she had just months
to live.
</P>
<P>
   She lingered longer than expected, often in severe pain. In
early October she was admitted to the small hospital in Hebron
seven miles from her home in Deshler. Her husband, known as Bob,
spent most of the day, every day, at her side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember visiting her, and she was very depressed,'' said
Muehling, the Ohlrich's neighbor. ``She just couldn't hardly stand
the pain anymore. He was always there sitting with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Ohlrich was ready, she told Muehling, to die. But her
body was not yet spent. She survived without respirators or other
machines controlling its vital functions.
</P>
<P>
   About 7:15 a.m. on a Tuesday morning two weeks into her final
hospital stay, as the two night nurses were winding up their shift
and three day nurses were starting theirs, Bob Ohlrich placed a
handgun on the counter at the nurses station. The nurses hadn't
heard a gunshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said something to the effect that, `I can't take it any
more, and you'd better check on my wife,' '' said Larry Leaming,
the administrator of the 22-bed Thayer County Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was,'' Leaming said, ``very distraught.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Ohlrich would tell investigators that after shooting his
wife he turned the gun on himself but that it jammed.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few days after the killing, Ohlrich's attorney
chose not to press for his client's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least there in jail we knew he's safe and wouldn't hurt
himself,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   He won Ohlrich temporary release Oct. 30, over objections from
the prosecutor, to attend his wife's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Soon this very personal crisis became fuel for a broader
discussion about assisted suicide. The Nebraska chapter of the
Hemlock Society said the violence of Phyllis Ohlrich's death could
have been avoided if state law had allowed physician-assisted
suicide. The Nebraska Coalition for Compassionate Care, which was
being organized when the case broke, hastened the announcement of
its formation. The group is opposed to assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who is human must sympathize with the level of despair
that you presume drove him to this,'' said Greg Schleppenbach, a
leader of the group. ``But tragedies like this should prompt us to
find and improve end-of-life care. It should not prompt us to
legalize euthanasia.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, said medical ethicist Dennis Brodeur, is ``an
indictment on many of us in health care...for not coming up with a
way for people to die with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   When Oregon voters approved an assisted-suicide measure two
years ago, Brodeur said, exit polls showed they believed they were
going to suffer painful deaths prolonged by medical technology that
would bankrupt their families. That's typical, he said, of why
increasing numbers of Americans favor assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a blue jail jumpsuit and a jacket, Ohlrich was
arraigned Thursday in Hebron. He pleaded not guilty and was
released on $35,000 bond to live with one of his sons in Lincoln
until his trial in early February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just taking things minute by minute,'' said eldest son,
Mike Ohlrich.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Roger said the family viewed the killing as Bob
Ohlrich's attempt to be humane to a suffering spouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad she's no longer in such excruciating pain,'' Roger
Ohlrich said.

   Publicity about Ohlrich's case has generated letters and
donations of money from across the country, his lawyer said. In
Deshler, newspaper publisher Struve said that even though people
disagreed with Ohlrich's actions, ``they sympathize with him for
the most part....

<P>
   ``If he walked down the street,'' Struve said, ``people would
greet him like they always have.''

 &HT;    Handheld PCs are the rage at Comdex
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Michael Lyon bought a Palm III three months ago, but
already he's tempted by the latest handheld device from Nokia.
</P>
<P>
   The Nokia 9000il Communicator combines the e-mail, calendar and
address features of his Palm III in a wireless phone that can also
access the Internet. But like many consumers who are trying to find
their way through the claims for dozens of devices, Lyons isn't
sure he needs all those features in one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of finding out what consumers want and making that,
these companies take the technology that's available and try to
sell it to people,'' said Lyons, president of an Internet-access
company in Falls Church, Va.
</P>
<P>
   He was among more than 200,000 business people,
purchasing-department officials, vendors and consumers who have
come to this gambling mecca for Comdex Fall '98, the latest word on
personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   Handheld devices, or personal-digital assistants, are hot this
year. More than 100 people at Comdex crowded around 3Com's booth
Monday, partially blocking the aisle, to see a demonstration of the
Palm III.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is getting to be a very device-oriented world,'' said
Cheryl Currid, president of Currid &AMP; Associates in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Like past Comdex shows, this week's is billed as a look into the
future of the rapidly changing industry. And even recent history
has shown that prices for PCs and other electronics equipment, such
as cell phones, come down dramatically after a few years after they
are released.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm III is about $350, Nokia's 9000il is about $700. That's
only the beginning for some of the devices, if their owners wants
to add features.
</P>
<P>
   The catalogue of software and additions for the Palm Pilot
family includes a $299 scanner to put business cards to the
devices' memory, a $99 modem to exchange data with a PC. While on
the road, a global-positioning receiver for the Palm device or
IBM's workpad can produce a street map on the small screen anywhere
in the United States. That costs $199.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons is typical of those who are willing to pay several hundred
dollars for these devices. He wants to read his e-mail when he's
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your'e a road warrior and you need to get fast information
back and forth, you can probably justify it,'' said Currid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the handheld digital devices, there are new
portable computers that are not much bigger than a thin paperback
book.
</P>
<P>
   Casio Manufacturing Corp. is demonstrating a 1.8-pound PC made
of magnesium-alloy. Available in Japan, the Casisopeia FIVA runs
Windows 98 with a 200-megahertz Cyrix processor and a 6.7-inch
display. It comes with 32 megabytes of RAM and a 3.2-gigabyte hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Connections include universal serial bus and infrared
communication ports. A Casio salesman said its costs the equivalent
of $2,400 in Japan but is expected to sell for about $2,000 when
the company introduces it in the United States next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts foresee a networked world in which various mobile
devices are connected to home PCs, telephones and even security
systems, which would provide seamless sharing of data from
anywhere. That's still sometime in the future, though because
competitors are fighting to become the standards in the emerging
fields.

TOBACCO INDUSTRY AGREES TO $206 BILLION SETTLEMENT, BAN ON
ADVERTISING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's tobacco industry, seeking an end to
its legal fights with states, agreed Monday to a historic $206
billion settlement and a broad ban on advertising and promotional
give-aways that appealed to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Eight states announced the agreement in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called the settlement a good first step and
pledged he would make federal anti-tobacco legislation a priority
when the new Congress convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   A massive $368 billion settlement reached in June 1997 between
41 states and the tobacco industry collapsed when Congress balked
at raising cigarette prices by $1.10 per pack, curbing advertising
and giving the Federal Food and Drug Administration the power to
regulate nicotine as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is one of four states that previously reached individual
settlements with the industry in their efforts to recover states'
share of Medicaid costs for treating victims of tobacco-related
ailments. Another 39 states, including the eight in negotiations,
have lawsuits pending and will be eligible to participate in the
agreement announced here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to stop the legal bickering and move the tobacco
fight out of the courthouse and into the streets,'' said Christine
Gregoire, the Washington state attorney general. ``Since June 20,
1997, more than half a million people have died of tobacco-related
illnesses and 1 1/2 million children have become addicted to
tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the record-setting settlement a ``milestone in
the long struggle to protect our children from tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry, citing an important contingency in the
case, wants a ``sufficient number'' of the 39 states to join the
settlement before they will sign the final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we remain confident in our legal defenses, we are
prepared to accept this proposed agreement as a way to end this
unique litigation and join in a common sense approach to addressing
important tobacco issues,'' said a statement released by the big
four cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies involved in the settlement are Philip Morris,
Inc.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.; Brown and Williamson Tobacco Co.
and the Lorillard Tobacco Co.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal does not include any proposed increases in
federal taxes or FDA control over nicotine. It calls for a pay-out
of $206 billion through the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
   It would ban advertising on billboards, taxi and transit ads as
well as promotional gear such as hats, shirts and backpacks and
characters such as Joe Camel. Payments to get tobacco products
placed in television and movies would be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   It requires the industry to place a minimum of $2 billion into a
foundation dedicated to advertising anti-tobacco messages and $250
million over 10 years would go specifically to a foundation to
study how to reduce teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will change the way we see tobacco,'' Gregoire said. She
was joined by attorneys general from Colorado, New York, North
Dakota, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. Two officials from California
and North Carolina were unable to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement drew tentative support from anti-tobacco groups,
such as the American Cancer Society and others, that, while
supporting agreements that curb advertising, still want stronger
federal legislation, especially for FDA authority to regulate
tobacco products
</P>
<P>
   The president ordered the Solicitor General to ask the Supreme
Court to take the case of FDA authority, which is being challenged
in the lower courts by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   He also renewed his call for Congress to pass comprehensive
anti-tobacco legislation. The White House declined to say how much,
if any, the administration will seek in cigarette tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said any comprehensive tobacco bill should clarify FDA's
authority as well as provide financial protections for tobacco
farmers.

 &HT;    FROST NEW CHAIRMAN OF HOUSE DEM CAUCUS
 &HT;    370 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The message from House Democrats in the new
Congress will be delivered with a Texas twang as U.S. Rep. Martin
Frost, D-Dallas, becomes chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, a
job that includes coordinating policy planning among the 211
members of the minority party.
</P>
<P>
   With his election Monday, Frost, 56, is the highest-ranking
Texan among House Democrats, taking the No. 3 spot behind Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Minority Whip David Bonior,
D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Frost won the caucus chairman's job in a 108-97 vote over Rep.
Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. Despite the close vote, the Democrats'
selection of their leaders lacked the drama that will attend
Republicans' leadership contest Wednesday. In the wake of
Republican losses in the Nov. 3 congressional elections, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said he will resign, and two
challengers are hoping to unseat House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, is unopposed for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Frost's victory was credited to the $75 million he raised for
House candidates during his four-year stint as chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a record for any four-year period at the DCCC,'' said
the committee's executive director, Matt Angle. ``To raise that
much money in the aftermath of having lost the majority is
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   As they completed most of their leadership selections Monday,
Democrats' eyes were clearly on the elections in 2000, both for the
House and White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran on the basis that we have to include everyone _
liberals, moderates, conservatives _ in developing policy,'' Frost
said. ``It is critical that we occupy the political middle as we
head into this campaign'' in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the name of Texas Gov. George W. Bush wasn't far
behind the mention of 2000. Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., fresh from
his election as vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus,
invoked the names of Bush and his brother, Gov.-elect Jeb Bush of
Florida, and their strong showings among Hispanic voters in the
Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be in a fight for the hearts, minds and votes
of Hispanic Americans,'' Menendez said of his fellow Democrats.

NETANYAHU SUSPENDS TRANSFER OF LAND TO PALESTINIANS _ FOR NOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday
suspended an impending transfer of West Bank land to the
Palestinians until President Yasser Arafat retracts statements
calling for violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under these
circumstances,'' Netanyahu told Parliament on the first day of a
scheduled two-day debate on the agreement signed last month at the
Wye River conference center in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year and a half, we haven't moved an inch,'' he
said. ``The Palestinians will test us every day, and we will stand
firm.''
</P>
<P>
   His unexpected statements came a day after Arafat told members
of his Fatah party that Palestinian ``rifles were ready'' to defend
Jerusalem if Israel tries to stop them from praying in the holy
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sort of thing is this, this threat of violence with
rifles?'' Netanyahu said on Israel's Channel 2 television. ``If we
do not accept the Palestinian demand of a division of Jerusalem,
they will use those rifles against us? There cannot be such
dictates.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to delay troop withdrawal was the latest in a
series of minicrises that have held up implementation of the Wye
agreement since the accord was signed Oct 23 at the Maryland
plantation.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 7, Netanyahu held up a Cabinet vote after Palestinian
suicide bombers blew themselves up in a crowded Jerusalem market,
injuring 25 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, he held up Cabinet discussion of the accord because
Palestinians had not shared their blueprint for fighting terrorism
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Netanyahu's tough talk may cause the first handover
of two percent of West Bank land to be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Israel and the Palestinians agreed that the first
land transfer would take place this Friday, only five days behind
the schedule laid out in the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
   That withdrawal would set in motion a three-month timetable in
which Israel is supposed to transfer 13 percent of West Bank land
to the Palestinians in three phases, release 750 Palestinian
prisoners, open an airport in Gaza and allow Palestinians to travel
between Gaza and the West Bank. In return, Palestinians will carry
out specific security measures.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Tibi, Arafat's political adviser in Jerusalem, responded
to Netanyahu's statements by accusing Israel of ``trying to avoid
and escape implementation'' of the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Jericho, Arafat said that Palestinians
were committed to fulfilling their part of the Wye deal and would
not ``shift course'' away from peace, but stopped short of
retracting his earlier statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace to us is a strategic choice, and we will not shift
course,'' Arafat said. ``As we ask the Israeli government to count
on us on the full implementation of the Wye River memorandum, we
hope that the Israeli government will do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli analysts said it was unlikely that Netanyahu's threat
would scuttle the hard-won Wye agreement. At most, it might delay
the troop withdrawal by a few days.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the heated war of words is a sign that the Wye
agreement did little to dispel months of mistrust, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, delays and conditions set by the Israeli side and calls
for statehood by the Palestinians have kept suspicions high. Since
the agreement was signed, Israel's Cabinet has attached conditions
to it and has taken the first steps toward construction of Har
Homa, a controversial Jewish housing project in Jerusalem, moves
that angered Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sunday, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon went a step
further, telling West Bank settlers to ``run, grab hills'' to stake
claim to land before the Wye accord is put into action.
</P>
<P>
   Unpublished clauses of the Wye agreement reportedly will make
settlement expansion more difficult once the accord is set in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Israel) went off track slightly,'' said Reuven Hazan, an
Israeli politic analyst at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. ``We
added conditions to the agreement. Then we started building at Har
Homa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Arafat went a little off on his end by going back to the
old Arafat-speak of `we're going to use weapons' and 'we're going
to fight for Jerusalem,''' Hazan said. ``We've ended up with a
battle of rhetoric between Arafat and Netanyahu.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials upbraided Arafat and Sharon for making statements
that they said were ``unhelpful'' to putting the Wye agreement into
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place . . . for statements which call for or
suggest violent actions,'' U.S. State Department spokesman James
Rubin said. ``Statements such as the one made by Foreign Minister
Sharon undermine the trust and confidence necessary (for peace).''
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin downplayed Netanyahu's decision to halt troop
withdrawal unless Arafat recants his words and said he expected the
Wye agreement to be carried out on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wye memorandum was signed without conditions and it is our
expectation that both sides will implement the agreement as
signed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Netanyahu's statements, Israel's parliament, the Knesset,
had been poised to vote overwhelmingly in favor of the Wye
agreement. Analysts estimate that as many as 90 of 120 Knesset
members will back the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's threat to suspend troop withdrawal was not expected
to influence that support. The Knesset is expected to meet Tuesday
and ratify the accord as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two, three days late, there will be a troop redeployment,''
said Hazan. ``Barring a catastrophe, a slight delay, it will take
place.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A Texas judge was convicted of perjury for declaring that he had
used political contributions to buy flowers for his staff when, in
fact, the flowers went to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida postal supervisor is in prison for denying in a civil
deposition that she had a sexual relationship with a subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   An Ohio youth who was arrested for underage drinking testified
that he had never been read his rights by the police. He was then
convicted of perjury for lying and sent to jail for 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of President Clinton have argued that his accusers are
overzealous in saying he should be impeached or subject to criminal
charges on the grounds that he committed perjury when he denied in
a civil deposition that he had a sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But a review of more than 100 perjury cases in state and federal
courts, and statistics on the number of perjury prosecutions
brought around the country, show that people are prosecuted in
America for what might be called small lies more regularly than the
Clinton defenders have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Judiciary Committee's hearings into the possible
impeachment of the president set to begin this week. The
president's defenders are expected to return to their theme. The
president's lawyer, David Kendall, has said that ``no prosecutor in
the United States would bring a perjury prosecution on the basis''
of the kinds of questions Clinton was asked about his sex life in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with lawyers, legal experts and with a woman who
is serving a sentence for lying about sex in a civil case show
that, far from being shrugged off, the threat of prosecution for
perjury, even in civil cases, is a crucial deterrent in the legal
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbolically, the sword of Damocles hangs over every
perjurer's head, and no one can know whether they're the perjurer
that's going to be prosecuted,'' said Jeffrey Abramson, a former
prosecutor and an expert on jury trials who is a professor of legal
studies and politics at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   One statistic on perjury prosecutions has been widely circulated
since the president's supporters began arguing that perjury was
little more than a technicality seized upon by the president's
enemies: Of 49,655 cases filed by federal prosecutors last year,
only 87 were for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   State courts, where statistics are harder to come by, are
another matter. Data supplied by court officials in two states,
California and New York, suggest that perjury prosecutions are not
as rare as some have suggested. In California alone last year,
there were 4,318 felony perjury cases. In New York there were 395
perjury cases last year. And even in the federal system, prison
officials said in October that 115 people were serving sentences
for perjury in federal prisons alone.
</P>
<P>
   The review of the cases offers some support for Clinton's
defenders. Perjury charges are brought in civil cases far less
frequently than in criminal cases. In addition, the law of perjury
is highly technical, with courts sometimes ruling that some
obviously misleading statements like those Clinton acknowledges
making may not constitute perjury under the law.
</P>
<P>
   But the cases also show that, even in civil cases, judges are
sometimes provoked by perjury more than by many of the evils they
see every day. In the Florida case of the postal supervisor in
July, the judge, Lacey A. Collier, sentenced the supervisor, Diane
Parker, to 13 months for falsely denying in a civil deposition that
she had a sexual relationship with a male subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most troubling things in our society today,''
Collier said, ``is people who raise their hands, take an oath to
tell the truth and then fail to do that. An analogy might be made
to termites that get inside your house. Nobody sees it, nobody
knows about it until the house collapses around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some courts have gone out of their way to say that perjury in
civil cases is as important as perjury in any other testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1988 civil suit in Georgia, for example, a founder of the
Southern White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, David Wayne Holland,
was found liable for violating the rights of civil-rights marchers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Holland was convicted of perjury for lying about his
assets so the plaintiffs could not recover any of the $450,000 in
damages they had won. A federal judge in Georgia said the sentence
in the civil proceeding would be less severe than if Holland had
lied in a criminal case. The judge sentenced Holland to home
detention and community service.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, a federal appeals court criticized that ruling and
sent the case back for a sterner sentence. ``We categorically
reject any suggestion, implicit or otherwise,'' the appeals court
judges said, ``that perjury is somehow less serious when made in a
civil proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The review of perjury cases also shows that, while lies about
sex are rarely the subject of perjury prosecutions, there are
precedents that come quite close to the allegations against
Clinton.

 UNDATED: against Clinton.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1984, Pam Parsons, the former women's basketball coach at the
University of South Carolina went to prison for four months after a
perjury conviction for her testimony in a civil libel suit she had
filed against Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine had reported that she had a lesbian relationship
with at least one team member and recruited players ``with sex in
mind.'' Ms. Parsons and the player testified, denying, among other
things, that they had frequented a lesbian bar. The jury in the
libel case decided for the magazine. Then the women were indicted
for perjury. Both pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In a current case, Barbara Battalino, a former Veterans Affairs
psychiatrist at a medical center in Idaho, has become, perhaps, the
best known admitted perjurer in America. She now acknowledges she
performed oral sex in her government office on a Vietnam veteran
who was seeking psychiatric help in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   She says the man, Ed Arthur, was never formally her patient. But
she also admits that when he brought a civil suit for medical
malpractice and sexual harassment, she lied when his lawyer asked
her at a deposition whether ``anything of a sexual nature''
occurred in her office when she was alone with Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur provided the prosecutors with tapes he had secretly made
of her telling him to deny their affair. She was convicted of
perjury. She is now serving six-months home confinement, and says
she has had to give up her medical license because she was
convicted of felony perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after one network television interview and
before another, Dr. Battalino, 53, said she was sorry she had told
a lie, even though it was to try to keep an embarrassing sexual
relationship private. But if Clinton escapes punishment, she said,
she felt she deserved a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's getting special treatment because he's the
president. He has used his office to get his message across that
what he did was no big deal. That wasn't good enough for me. I
apologized to the judge that I lied to.''
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters of Clinton have suggested that the independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, was using the possibility of a perjury
charge as a way to damage Clinton because he opposes his politics.
They have said that was an abuse of Starr's powers as a prosecutor,
suggesting that if Clinton were a private person he would never be
charged with perjury for lying about private sexual matters.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it is an abuse of power or not, other prosecutors in
other high-profile cases have sometimes pushed for perjury charges
_ to send a signal to the public that lying will be punished. In
fact, there is some evidence that the higher the profile of the
case, the likelier the perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   In a Kansas murder case that attracted wide local publicity, the
Geary County attorney, Chris E. Biggs, won a perjury conviction of
a local minister who prosecutors said had played a role in the
killing. The prosecutors charged the minister had lied in a related
civil case about whether he had had a sexual relationship with one
of the other people charged along with him in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important,'' Biggs said in an interview, ``to send a
message because the whole system depends on people telling the
truth under oath.'' Similarly, in Kentucky, a federal appeals court
last month affirmed the perjury conviction of Robert DeZarn, who
was the adjutant general of the Kentucky National Guard. He had
been charged with perjury for denying during an investigation that
he had engaged in improper political fund-raising from
subordinates. At the time of the perjury charge, the fund-raising
investigation was the subject of extensive news reports in
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, some scholars and many practicing lawyers have
suggested that lying under oath is epidemic in the courts. But some
legal experts say they are even more troubled by what they say is a
highly technical approach the courts often take in defining what
perjury is. In a 1973 case, Bronston vs. United States, the U.S.
Supreme Court laid down a rule for perjury cases that is still the
governing law for courts across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's critics have said the fine distinctions set
forth in the Bronston case are at the heart of Clinton's assertion
that he did not commit perjury when he denied that he had ``sexual
relations'' as that term was defined in Ms. Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the center of the 1973 case, Samuel Bronston, a movie
producer, filed for bankruptcy and was asked in testimony in his
bankruptcy case whether he had ever had Swiss bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bronston's answer was: ``The company had an account there for
about six months, in Zurich.'' In fact, he once had $180,000 in an
account in Geneva that he did not mention.
</P>
<P>
   Bronston was later found guilty of perjury. The Supreme Court
reversed the conviction. The high court said that even if
Bronston's answers ``were shrewdly calculated to evade'' it was the
lawyer's responsibility to bring the witness ``back to the mark, to
flush out the whole truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of that ruling say it added momentum to the rampant
telling of half-truths in the courts. Robert Blecker, a professor
at New York Law School who has written about perjury law, said that
judges nationally have concluded that the Supreme Court justices
were permitting what most people would consider lying under oath.
``They sent a signal,'' Blecker said, ``that you can calculatingly
mislead by a statement that is carefully crafted to say one thing
when you are really saying something else.''

THE FILMS OF OUR LIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(For release Monday, Nov. 16, 1998 after 8 p.m. Pacific Time.) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a year when any fool who can count on both
hands seems to be releasing a Great Movies List, the 10-year-old
National Film Registry's roster of 25 new inductees serves a few
instructive purposes.
</P>
<P>
   First, unlike the American Film Institute's hype-heavy ``100
Years, 100 Movies,'' the list released Monday is hardly the result
of a popularity contest. With entries such as the 1956 Puerto Rican
feminist manifesto ``Modesta,'' the '64 ``Dead Birds'' documentary
about a New Guinea tribe and the self-explanatory, newsreel-based
``Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse'' (1940), this batch _ chosen by
Librarian of Congress James H. Billington, with consultation from a
board of film scholars, critics and professionals for inclusion in
the library's permanently preserved collection _ is no one's idea
of a greatest hits package.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most of the all-time favorites have already been
included in the registry. But even though the full, now 250-title
list is top heavy with films at absolutely no risk of being lost _
they're too valuable for their copyright owners to neglect _ it's
always had room for the obscure, the unpopular and the otherwise
overlooked significant work.
</P>
<P>
   As for the more recognizable movies on this year's list, a
handful are long overdue masterpieces like James Whale's witty 1935
``The Bride of Frankenstein,'' Joseph H. Lewis' sleazy, energetic
'49 noir ``Gun Crazy'' and Peter Bogdanovich's 1971 retro elegy for
elusive innocence, ``The Last Picture Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the Hollywood titles included this year _ ``Easy
Rider,'' ``Little Miss Marker,'' ``The Ox-Bow Incident,''
``Tootsie,'' ``Twelve O'Clock High'' _ are decidedly second tier,
artistically speaking.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of formally influential stuff like the first
Mickey Mouse sound cartoon, ``Steamboat Willie'' (1928), and the
1925 ``Lost World,'' which was the first big, special effects-laden
dinosaur movie. But the overriding notion the '98 list projects is
the sense that the candidate pool is getting pretty shallow.
</P>
<P>
   While this means that a wider spectrum of worthy movies are
being considered, it also indicates that the practice of reducing
great cinema to items on a list can only go so far. Let's hope the
AFI, and all the other organizations that think art can be ranked,
appreciate that lesson.

DOUBTS REMAIN ABOUT AUTHENTICITY OF ACCOUNT OF BATTLE OF THE ALAMO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the eve of an auction that could fetch $250,000 to $300,000
for a rare account of the Battle of the Alamo, doubts about the
manuscript's authenticity remain.
</P>
<P>
   The auction has attracted widespread attention because the
diary, purportedly by a Mexican officer, contains a myth-shattering
revelation that Davy Crockett was captured, then summarily
executed.
</P>
<P>
   Attributed to Lt. Col. Jose Enrique de la Pena, who served in
Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's army, the 684-page manuscript
goes under the hammer Wednesday with bidders from around the
country linked by satellite. Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield auctioneers
in San Francisco said they have received inquiries from Texas
institutions that want to keep the papers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The papers are owned by San Antonio resident Ruby Peace, 74.
</P>
<P>
   California illustrator Joseph Musso, who has spent decades
studying another Alamo hero, Jim Bowie, Bowie knives and Alamo
history, said the document is a forgery, citing an analysis by
handwriting expert Charles Hamilton. The auctioneers had used
Hamilton to authenticate another offered item, an 1832 Jim Bowie
letter.
</P>
<P>
   But Greg Shaw, who stressed that his firm stands behind the
manuscript's authenticity, disputed Musso's assertion and suggested
that someone might have forged the statement by Hamilton, who died
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's most ridiculous,'' Shaw said from Los Angeles. ``... I
just can't understand what these people are up to. It's a forgery
of Charles Hamilton's signature, possibly. This is all conspiracy
nonsense by amateurs who don't have any training or ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Musso, who earns a living by illustrating movie story boards for
Hollywood studios, writes frequently on Bowie and the Alamo. He
found several errors about the battle in the latest edition of the
Handbook of Texas, which its editors later acknowledged. Various
organizations including Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield have consulted
with him on Jim Bowie-related matters, Musso said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's statement attributed the Alamo diary forgery to John
Laflin, alias John Lafitte, who the expert profiled in his book
``Great Forgers and Famous Fakes,'' which was reprinted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Charles Hamilton never mentioned it to anybody and
didn't refer to it in a new edition of his book about Lafitte,''
Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton did not examine the actual document but a photocopy of
a reproduction contained in the 1975 English translation, published
by Texas A&AMP;M University Press, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was inappropriate,'' Shaw said. ``No handwriting expert
can authenticate anything from a photocopy. You have to examine the
document.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's statement said: ``I certify that I have carefully
examined the document allegedly written by Jose Enrique de la Pena,
entitled `Personal Narrative with Santa Anna in Texas,' and find
that it is a forgery by John Laflin, alias John Laffite.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Shaw earlier insisted there was no need for a forensic
examination, he had the diary's paper tested before he appeared on
NBC's ``Today'' show last month. Tests showed the paper had been
manufactured in Portugal a decade before the 1836 battle. If ink
had been applied this century, he said, there would have been
tell-tale ``feathering'' _ ink spreading out as if on blotting
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Musso said Hamilton gave him an oral report for $250, then sent
him a written one calling the manuscript a forgery for another
$250. Musso faxed the signed certification and canceled checks that
purportedly carry Hamilton's signature to the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   The diary triggered an uproar when the English translation
appeared two decades ago. Diehard Crockett advocates denounced it
as a 20th century forgery, an elaborate hoax that disputes their
belief that the coonskin-capped frontiersman went down fighting at
the Alamo in March 1836.
</P>
<P>
   But many academics accept it as a narrative penned or dictated
by de la Pena while he was jailed for backing the wrong
general-politician after the Texas War of Independence. Only one
page is devoted to Crockett's demise; the rest outline de la Pena's
complaints about his superiors' incompetence and cruelty during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was known of the diary until a Mexico City rare coin
dealer published a book based on it in 1955. The Mexican military
archives authenticated de la Pena's signature, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Peace's late husband, former state Democratic Party Chairman
James Peace, bought the papers in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the weight of evidence is on the side of
authenticity,'' said Stephen Hardin, a Victoria College historian
and author of the ``Texas Iliad,'' which quotes the diary.
</P>
<P>
   Hardin then cautioned: ``I hope whoever gets it puts the
document through not just one test, but through a whole battery of
tests to prove its authenticity.''

`ALONE' SAILOR GETS LIFE-SAVING MEDICAL HELP VIA INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Viktor Yazykov is cq; a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dr. Daniel Carlin was on call to offer health care by
computer to sailors racing around the world, but he wasn't prepared
for the e-mail from the Russian competitor that flashed across his
computer last Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have been sitting on the bloody cabin floor almost completely
naked ... watching as my life drop by drop leaving me,'' Viktor
Yazykov, one of 15 solo sailors competing in the ``Around Alone''
race wrote last week. The Russian had performed surgery on his
infected arm, following the doctor's written instructions, but
something had gone horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yazykov, the doctor would later learn, had not provided all the
pertinent medical information prior to cutting into himself. Such
things happen when there are language, communication and weather
barriers. It also happens when the patient is a former Soviet
commando disinclined to reveal just how much pain he was in.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin ultimately would save the arm, and perhaps the life, of
Yazykov while the sailor was alone, far at sea, and bouncing in
storm-swept seas like he was in an amusement park ride.
</P>
<P>
   Yazykov sailed into Capetown, South Africa, at 10 a.m. Monday a
happy man _ and a lucky man. His story is told in a paper trail of
e-mails and illustrates just how bad a lousy day of sailing can
get.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of administering medicine by remote control, this one
has got to be right up there as one to remember,'' said Carlin, 39,
an infections disease specialist at the New England Medical Center.
He is also founder of World Clinic Inc., which uses computer
technology to make house calls from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   The first e-mail from Yazykov arrived shortly after Carlin's
breakfast one week ago today &UR;  &LR; (Nov. 17). The Russian's spelling has
been corrected for this report:
</P>
<P>
   ``My right elbow does not look good. Some yellow spot in the
middle of red and it feels like dead,'' Yazykov wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian was 400 miles from Cape Town and at the end of the
first leg in the Around Alone Race, considered the most challenging
solo yachting competition in the world. Carlin is the ``on call''
physician, a job faciliated by the sophisticated satellite
communication systems many sailors took to at sea.
</P>
<P>
   But not Yazykov. Finances being tight, he set sail from
Charleston, S.C., with the race-issued ``INMARSAT C,'' a minimal
system, relatively speaking, that uses solar power for emergency
e-mail transmissions. At night, the system is useless _ and, for
Yazykov, always a challenge because the keyboard uses the English
alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   Yazykov had been four days late for the Sept. 19 start.
Nevertheless, he had plowed his way ahead of four competitors at
the time of his initial e-mail: An injury to his elbow sustained at
the beginning of the race was bothering him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting for your help,'' he messaged Carlin. The doctor
responded that it appeared to be an infection, but he needed more
information.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, Yazykov messaged back:
</P>
<P>
   ``All skin is glossy and shiny white. It is like a pillow with
some liquid inside.'' He said he was not in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin realized Yazykov was in trouble _ and that the former
member of the Russian Special Forces had probably downplayed the
amount of pain he was actually in. In fact, Yazykov had probably
sailed much of the race with his left arm only, the other infected
with a severe abcess. If it burst inside the skin, the infection
could fatally flood the body.
</P>
<P>
   It was four hours before sunset in the South Atlantic _ and four
hours before Yazykov's daily communication blackout. Carlin quickly
scripted a 13-step operating procedure to drain the abcess using
medical instruments provided all the sailors by World Clinic.
Carlin got his directions off _ including precise instructions
about where to make incisions with a scalpel _ before the sailor's
INMARSAT system went dead.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning the doctor learned the surgery gone well
given the circumstances. The abscess had been punctured, but the
bleeding would not stop, Yazykov e-mailed. And, he couldn't move
his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   What Yazykov had neglected to tell his doctor was that he had
taken about eight aspirin in the previous day or two to try to numb
the pain. Aspirin thins the blood and hampers clotting. The
bandaging as ordered by the doctor had been useless.
</P>
<P>
   So, using his teeth and his good arm, the Russian wrapped
elastic cord around his bad arm several times to stop the bleeding
_ and paralyzed himself from the elbow down.
</P>
<P>
   In the flurry of e-mails that followed, Carlin had Yazykov
remove his tourniquet, apply direct pressure to the wound, and
eventually the bleeding stopped. By the weekend, Yazykov had gotten
some minor movement back in the hand. Full recovery is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the surgery and one-handed sailing, he would finish that
leg of the race still ahead of four competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin got the Russian's last e-mail Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   ``The arm getting better. Very grateful to the doctor.''

EIGHT WESTERN STATES MOVE TOWARD EARLIER PRIMARY DATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Further crowding New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation
presidential primary, eight Western states are on the verge of
creating an early regional primary in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from the states met in Salt Lake City Monday and are
expected to formally vote Tuesday on a primary date of Saturday,
March 11. Each state's legislature must approve the change.
</P>
<P>
   On the East Coast, secretaries of state in Massachusetts and New
Hampshire warned Monday against the political front-loading, saying
it would be bad for democracy and bad for the voters. They said
candidates for president will have to raise more money for
television commercials, bypassing the traditional face-to-face
politicking that historically has tested aspirants over the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would diminish voter interest and increase voter
frustration,'' said Massachusetts Secretary of State William F.
Galvin. ``I don't think most people want the presidential election
to begin next year in 1999, especially since the final decision
won't be made until November of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   William M. Gardner, the secretary of state in New Hampshire,
said he is worried the process of nominating a presidential
candidate will turn into a one-day national event. Besides the
Western states, New Jersey is moving toward an earlier date and may
join forces with Maryland and Pennsylvania to create a mid-Atlantic
primary. California has already changed its primary to March 7, and
Washington and Oregon may do so as well, creating a new Pacific
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the nomination will be wrapped up quicker
than it was last time and everyone thought that went too fast,''
Gardner said. ``It's not a process in my opinion that's good for
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Westerners, led by Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, say they resent
the attention and the influence that East Coast states like New
Hampshire receive. New Hampshire law requires that the state set
its primary date a week before any other state. Leavitt has said he
hopes that by banding together, Western states will be able to
focus attention on issues affecting them, such as water rights,
rural health care and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice of the West has not been heard,'' said Karen Deike,
communications director for the Western Governors' Association.
``We want to make sure the candidates come early, often and listen
to the issues of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   States represented at the Salt Lake City conference are:
Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime observers of presidential politics say the new move
toward early primaries will preclude lesser-known candidates from
emerging in the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary and
going on to victory. Previous candidates, such as Bill Clinton,
Jimmy Carter and even George Bush, might never have been elected
without the time to raise more money after the early primaries in
order to compete in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main advantage of early primaries in small states is that
it allows relatively underfinanced campaigns a chance to get
started, a chance to win, a chance to receive some coverage, some
votes and some attention,'' said Clark Hubbard, a political science

   Even with New Hampshire retaining its first primary status,
Hubbard said, the state's importance may eventually be diminished
by all the other states competing for attention just a few days
later.

   Alfred Balitzer, a professor of American politics at Claremont
McKenna College in California, said he likes the nominating system
just the way it is _ despite the longstanding complaints from other
states.

<P>
   ``When you have to go from state to state to state it puts an
enormous amount of pressure on a person but that may be good. You
can find out if that person has what it takes to be president of
the United States,'' Balitzer said.

FILENE'S BASEMENT RECORDS LOSS IN THIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Its turnaround apparently in trouble, Filene's Basement Corp.
said Monday it lost $272,000 for its third quarter, compared with a
$3.2 million profit for the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   While sales for this year's third quarter rose 2 percent to
$154.8 million for the entire chain, sales at stores open for at
least one year fell 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Filene's Basement appeared to be showing some
signs of a recovery after struggling along with many other
retailers in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a strong retail economy for much of 1998, and a
preference by many consumers to shop at discount chains rather than
at department stores these days, the Basement has failed to show
much progress this year in its bid for a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few weeks, repeated phone calls to chief financial
officer Steven R. Siegel have not been returned, including several
calls made Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In its press release, the Basement offered no explanation for
its quarterly loss.
</P>
<P>
   Two Wall Street analysts who had followed the Basement indicated
Monday they recently dropped coverage of the company.
</P>
<P>
   While the flagship store at Downtown Crossing in Boston
continues to be popular with tourists, the company seems unable to
consistently duplicate this success at many of its other 50
locations.
</P>
<P>
   What may be contributing to the Basement's decline is that its
rivals appear to be getting stronger.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, TJX Cos. of Framingham, Mass. bought Marshalls
to add to its T.J. Maxx chain, creating a $7 billion behemoth in
the offprice retail segment that includes Filene's Basement.
</P>
<P>
   Size not only gives TJX more buying power with apparel makers
but with stores from coast to coast, TJX is insulated from the
unpredictable New England weather that can buffet a much smaller
regional clothing retailer such as Filene's Basement.
</P>
<P>
   More than once the Basement has blamed unseasonable weather for
hurting the sales of winter or summer clothing.
</P>
<P>
   On Nasdaq, shares of Filene's Basement fell 3/16 to close at 1
31/32, near its 52-week low.

FIDELITY LAYS OFF 100 ON TECHNICAL STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a belt tightening aimed less at short-term cost
cutting and more at streamlining operations, Fidelity Investments
layed off nearly 100 technology specialists last week from its
retail fund sales and institutional brokerage group.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions, involving 25 full-time staffers and 68 outside
contractors, are the latest trimming in J. Gary Burkhead's unit,
which sells Fidelity mutual funds directly to individual investors
and operates the nation's second-largest discount brokerage. The
brokerage sells both Fidelity and non-Fidelity funds in addition to
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The trimming, in the group's operations and technology section,
seemed unusual for Fidelity, the nation's largest fund firm and
traditionally a big spender on technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (technology) projects are running their course or
continuing at different paces,'' Fidelity spokeswoman Anne W.
Crowley said Monday. The Boston-based firm hoped to offer
full-timers other jobs within the company and had several hundred
technology positions to fill, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on
technology projects, had not scrapped any programs, Crowley said.
Last week's cuts included two vice presidents and two directors.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhead's 1,200-member group, called the Personal Investments &AMP;
Brokerage Group, had already trimmed about 100 staffers in recent
months. Around 60 junior to mid-level employees were let go early
last month, barely one week after 30 people in the group's retail
marketing unit were told to find new jobs. Last week's cuts
affected individuals, mostly software developers, in Fidelity
offices across the East Coast and Texas. Burkhead, one of
Fidelity's most senior executives, took over the group a year ago
and has proceeded to consolidate and restructure two of the
toughest areas of the mutual fund business.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, with $645.4 billion in assets under management as of
the end of September, has moved in recent years to sell more funds
from other companies and more funds of various provenances through
a wider array of channels. The firm faces mounting competition from
discount brokerage leader Charles Schwab Corp. and on-line trading
outfits such as E_Trade.

VERMONT HIGH COURT TO HEAR SAME-SEX MARRIAGE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Two weeks after Hawaii rejected a referendum
on gay marriage, the hopes of the nation's gay couples are turning
north to Vermont, where a landmark lawsuit will be heard tomorrow
by the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Holly &UR;  &LR; Puterbaugh and Lois Farnham say their lives have been
as intertwined as those of any married couple.
</P>
<P>
   They share a mortgage, eat breakfast together, nurse one another
through the flu. Together, they run a Christmas tree farm. They
share vacations, health-care benefits, job victories, and car
trouble. They finish one another's sentences.
</P>
<P>
   They are raising a daughter adopted four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Puterbaugh and Farnham consider themselves one another's next of
kin. The law, however, does not. Because they are both women,
Puterbaugh and Farnham are legally barred from getting married.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Puterbaugh and Farnham went to the Milton Town Hall
and applied for a marriage license. When the town clerk refused
them, they sued.
</P>
<P>
   Now, their case, which contends the state should afford them the
same rights as straight couples, will be heard by the Vermont
Supreme Court Wednesday (Nov., 18). Given the recent defeats of gay
marriage referendums in Hawaii and Alaska, gay rights activists are
putting their faith in the Green Mountain state. ``Right now
Vermont, in many ways, is our biggest hope,'' said Tracey Conaty of
the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Vermont couples who want to legally share their lives
_ Stan Baker and Peter Harrigan, and Nina Beck and Stacy Jolles _
are also named in the lawsuit, known as Baker v. the State of
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met and fell in love,'' said Baker. ``And marriage seems to
be a logical extension of that love.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont is among the most liberal in the nation in affording
civil rights to gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The state offers domestic partner benefits to its workers, as do
some cities and towns. Vermont bans discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation in housing, jobs, public accommodation, and
credit. It has a hate crimes law and allows gays and lesbians to
adopt children.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Vermont permits second-parent adoption by gays
and lesbians, allowing a lesbian couple, for example, to be legal
parents of the same child. But those parents cannot marry.
</P>
<P>
   The six plaintiffs say that by being denied the right to marry
they are denied the protections, benefits and obligations that go
along with marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're in a car accident on the way home, there's no
guarantee that I'd be able to go see her, sit with her,'' said
Puterbaugh. ``Because I'm not `family.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A man and a woman who meet in a bar and decide to marry the
next morning have more legal protections and rights than a lesbian
or gay couple that have been together 25 years,'' said Beck. ``That
doesn't make any sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The couples' lawyers argue that Vermont's marriage statues exist
``to protect, encourage, and support unions of committed couples,
and thereby also provide a stable environment for those couples to
raise children, if they have them.'' Therefore, they say, the law
should already allow same-sex couples to marry.
</P>
<P>
   Further, they contend, the ``common benefits clause'' of the
Vermont constitution renders the state's limitations on marriage
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Johnson, who teaches at Vermont Law School and is
co-counsel on the Alaska case said the plaintiffs' constitutional
analysis is strong. But there is legal jousting on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own view, as far as the ultimate question goes, is that I
don't think the Vermont constitution compels legal recognition of
same-sex marriages,'' said Peter Teachout, a Vermont Law School
professor and constitutional scholar.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the state will have to convince the court that
there are ``legitimate purposes'' served by limiting marriage to
heterosexual couples. If they cannot, he said, the court has room
to rule in the plaintiffs' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Teachout said the strongest argument the challengers have is one
comparing the ban on same-sex marriage to the now-unconstitutional
bans on interracial marriage nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The state argues that because Vermont's marriage statutes are
imbued with gender-specific language (like bride, groom, man, and
woman) that marriage is, by legal definition, a union between a man
and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The state argues that Vermont has an interest in maintaining
marriage as a union between the sexes. Among their arguments is
that the purpose of Vermont's marriage laws is to further the link
between procreation and child-rearing. Therefore, marriage is
limited to couples most likely to procreate _ heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe said there is a
``good chance'' that the court will find the plaintiff's
constitional arguments convincing. Tribe called the procreation
argument ``insane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no polite way of characterizing that,'' said Tribe.
``That means that sterile people shouldn't be able to marry, that
two octogenarians should not be able to marry. It's just
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom McCormick, a Burlington attorney who filed a
friend-of-the-court brief on the state's behalf, said the state has
``traditionally had an interest in marriage because of the interest
of the child,'' and that procreation and child-rearing have
traditionally taken place within the context of a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The case was thrown out by a lower court, which upheld the
state's defense on the basis of the procreation argument.
</P>
<P>
   The couples involved in the suit say they have been pleasantly
surprised by public reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Harrigan had just moved into their condo when the suit
became public, and they did not know what to expect from their
neighbors. The day the story ran in the local paper, some of their
neighbors came to the door with a bottle of champagne and a card
that said ``Happy Engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many Vermonters are against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Pounds of friend-of-the-court briefs have been filed on both
sides. A group called Take it to the People, or ``TiP,'' has vowed
to bring the issue either before the state Legislature or to a full
referendum vote for a constitutional amendment if the Supreme Court
rules in the plaintiffs' favor.
</P>
<P>
   The group is confident that the Legislature or the citizenry
would reject the idea of same-sex marriage, and say polling data
backs up that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   While TiP president Mary Schroyer is careful to say that the
group ``is not opposed to homosexual rights.'' She says they simply
want to ``preserve traditional marriage,'' which she calls the
``foundation'' of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you shift that foundation block, the effects sort of
ripple out. And you can't be sure, if you change that basic
building block, what the effect will be down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights activists believe that the bans on same-sex marriage,
like the bans on interracial marriage, will inevitably be struck
down.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe said he is ``not at all convinced that the federal
judiciary will invalidate these bans anytime soon.'' But, he said,
``I do think in the long run they will be struck down. They're
likely to be struck down sooner if a state like Vermont does make
the change and their electorate doesn't take it back.''

good that Iraq will live up to its pledges. By Barbara Crossette.

FINAL STARR REPORT MAY NOT COME UNTIL CLINTON'S TERM ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new indictment of Webster Hubbell, the longtime
friend of the Clintons, means that Kenneth Starr will almost
certainly remain in business as independent counsel through the
last months of President Clinton's term, and that a final report
may not be made public until after Clinton leaves the White House,
lawyers involved in the inquiry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before last week, the widespread impression was that Starr was
winding down his four-year inquiry. But the prosecution Friday of
Hubbell for Whitewater-related matters raises new issues that could
result in months of legal pretrial wrangling, a long trial and
possible appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Charles G. Bakaly III, Starr's spokesman, said Monday that it
would be impossible to say when a final report would be completed
and that it cannot be filed with the special court that oversees
independent counsels until the conclusion of the Hubbell cases and
other court action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot predict when it will end,'' Bakaly said. ``Once
matters are filed and go into the judicial arena, the timing is
outside of the control of the prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing raises the prospect of an independent counsel who has
spent years investigating conduct that has its origins in events
that occurred long before the President arrived in Washington, and
whose conclusions will not be known until after the president
leaves office _ and after the expiration of the independent counsel
law itself.
</P>
<P>
   It would also permit Starr, if he so chose, to follow the path
that is being pushed by some Republicans, like Sen. Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania, who have suggested that even if Clinton is not
impeached, he could still be prosecuted after leaving office. Starr
and his staff have never said whether it would be appropriate to
bring charges against the president after his term ends.
</P>
<P>
   Although some details of the Whitewater findings by Starr have
been made public over the years in trials and other court
appearances and papers, his conclusions about the role of the
Clintons and top officials in many aspects of the investigation
remain unknown. Starr is expected to provide some further details
about his inquiry when he appears before the House Judiciary
Committee on Thursday, but federal rules will sharply limit what he
can tell the lawmakers about much of the evidence provided to grand
juries. (There are no such limitations about what he writes in a
final report.)
</P>
<P>
   The sense that Starr was approaching the end of his work came in
part from the independent prosecutor himself. In his impeachment
report involving Monica Lewinsky, Starr told Congress that ``all
phases of the investigation are now nearing completion.'' His
office, Starr said, ``will soon make final decisions about what
steps to take, if any, with respect to the other information it has
gathered.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr had completed his use of grand juries in Arkansas. And he
had shown no signs of bringing any prosecutions arising from his
investigations of the dismissal of the White House travel office or
the improper compilation of hundreds of FBI files by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In court proceedings, Starr's moves did not appear likely to
open vast new areas of inquiry. He had filed a routine appeal of
his defeat in the criminal tax case he had brought against Hubbell.
And he had obtained a new indictment against Susan McDougal, one of
the Clniton's Whitewater partners, on criminal contempt charges
although there was no expectation that she would reverse her years
of refusing to answer grand jurors' questions. That case is
expected to be tried soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the newest criminal indictment against Hubbell brings the
sprawling inquiry back to its Whitewater roots and refers in
considerable detail to the role of Hillary Rodham Clinton, one of
Hubbell's partners in the Rose Law Firm, in a fraudulent land deal.
It may require Hillary Clinton's appearance in the witness box. And
it will take until at least the end of next year before the case
can be concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt from all of our experiences that it takes a
year or more to bring a criminal case,'' said John Bates, a former
deputy to Starr who is now in private practice. And, he and others
said, it could take at least six months for the federal court that
oversees the independent counsel to sort out the legal issues that
surround the public release of a final report.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starr's allies see the protracted nature of the inquiry as a
by-product of two things: the continual expansion of the
independent counsel's charter by the attorney general and the
repeated obfuscation and stonewalling by senior officials in the
Clinton administration. But his detractors say he has moved too
slowly, and that there was no reason why he could not have brought
the new Hubbell case many months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Hubbell stemmed from criminal referrals that
had been made by regulators at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
and the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency that supervised the
bailout of the savings and loan industry.
</P>
<P>
   It describes a longstanding scheme of defrauding the two
agencies by concealing the nature of the involvement by Hubbell,
his father-in-law and Hillary Clinton on a land deal that was found
by regulators to be fraught with corruption. Hillary Clinton was
not accused of any crimes in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been assigned to James Robertson, the same federal
district judge who earlier this year chastised Starr and dismissed
the tax case that he had tried to make against Hubbell.

 &HT;    RITALIN SALES DOUBLE, WHILE ATTENTION DISORDER IS DEBATED
 &HT;    610 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a little green pill turns a miserable, rowdy,
troublemaking kid into an attentive, quiet and apparently happy
youngster, it is either correcting an imbalance of brain chemistry
or suppressing the child's natural spontaneity and innovative
impulses.
</P>
<P>
   It depends on who's describing it.
</P>
<P>
   But sales of the pill, the stimulant methylphenidate, which is
marketed under the trade name Ritalin, have more than doubled in
the past decade as more and more parents, teachers and therapists
turn to the drug to treat a condition known as attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   While the drug, which acts on the brain in much the same way as
cocaine, is increasingly used to make better students out of
elementary school children deemed to have ``developmental
disorders,'' a growing number of specialists has begun to question
the wisdom of using the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to methylphenidate, stimulates such as amphetamines
are sometimes used to treat ADHD, but to a lesser extent.
</P>
<P>
   A committee of psychiatrists, neurologists, pediatricians,
pharmacologists and educators will listen to experts on different
sides of the controversy before attempting Wednesday to issue a
``consensus statement'' on ADHD and its treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, assembled by the National Institutes of Health, heard
its first presentations Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking away their vitality with psychostimulants that
can cause irreversible brain damage,'' Dr. Peter Breggin, a
Maryland psychiatrist, told the panel Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But referring to findings from sophisticated brain-imaging
equipment, other experts insisted people with ADHD suffer from
identifiable brain disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Certain areas appear to be smaller than normal and are less
active during mental tests. Theories about the cause range from
genetics to injuries suffered during fetal development.
</P>
<P>
   For such conditions and the chemical imbalances that develop
because of them, some experts said, methylphenidate is the best
treatment currently available.
</P>
<P>
   People with behavioral patterns that cause them to be diagnosed
as having ADHD _ impulsiveness, inability to concentrate,
difficulty learning _ appear to have a deficiency in certain brain
receptors involved in processing the neurotransmitter dopamine,
according to this view.
</P>
<P>
   Like cocaine, methylphenidate inhibits a brain chemical that
removes dopamine from certain areas of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, it increases the time the reduced number of receptors
is exposed to dopamine.
</P>
<P>
   But that may not be as simple as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, while ADHD has been thought of as a temporary
condition that children ``grow out of,'' recent findings suggest it
may be a chronic condition that can last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Food and Drug Administration has approved the sale
of methylphenidate on the basis of short-term studies of its safety
and effectiveness, no one knows the impact of long-range use of the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1990 and 1995, there was a 2 1/2-fold increase in
sales of methylphenidate,'' said Andrew Rowland, a researcher at
the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. ``We need
to generate long-term data on the safety and effectiveness of this
drug.''
</P>
<P>
   After listening to other researchers Tuesday morning, the panel
is to discuss the ADHD-drug issue privately in the afternoon and
issue a consensus panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Specific questions the consensus committee is charged with
answering include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether ADHD is, in fact, a disorder.
</P>
<P>
   _ What impact it has on individuals, families and society.
</P>
<P>
   _ What are the effective treatments?
</P>
<P>
   _ What are their risks?
</P>
<P>
   _ What directions should future research take?

LORDS VOTE TO LET CHANCELLOR CHANGE HIS BREECHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ All Lord Irvine wanted was the right to change his
pants.
</P>
<P>
   He found the slim black breeches that went with his job as lord
chancellor outdated and a little bit embarrassing, he said. Nor did
he like the black stockings and buckled dancing-type slippers that
completed his official outfit in the House of Lords, making him
look like a dark version of the frog footman in ``Alice in
Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that for male adults of sound mind like myself _ I hope
I am _ the days of breeches, tights and buckled shoes should go,''
he told a parliamentary committee recently.
</P>
<P>
   But change comes slowly to the House of Lords, and Irvine's
modest plea for the right to dress down generated an unusually
impassioned debate there Monday, as peers from across the political
spectrum discussed the semiotics of fancy costumes, the unbearable
heaviness of full-length wigs and the potential erosion of
standards in a place traditionally defined by extravagant symbolism
and high ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   If the issue seemed utterly frivolous, the philosophical
differences underlying it were not. On the one side was Irvine, a
Cabinet member, the nation's top judge and the speaker of the House
of Lords, dressed in a 17th-century costume and sitting on the
Woolsack, a big, square bench filled with British wool that is
meant to represent the country's trading prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   As comical as he might have looked, he was arguing on behalf of
the Labor government's desire to modernize, to put an end to many
of the archaic customs that sometimes seem to make Britain more of
a quaint old theme park than a country on the brink of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side were the men and women of the Conservative
opposition, sitting on red leather benches in business suits and
dresses, arguing strenuously on behalf of tradition and formality,
of maintaining the mysterious trappings of the institution they
hold so dear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The office of lord chancellor is one of the highest in the
land,'' said Earl Ferrers, a Conservative lord who led the
offensive against Irvine's sartorial proposal. Speaking of the lord
chancellor's outfit, he added, ``It is a reminder to all of us, and
members of the general public, of the stature, dignity and indeed
the awe in which the office of lord chancellor is held.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the vote was 145 to 115 in favor of
letting Irvine dress, if not completely normally, then at least
seminormally. He will be allowed to jettison the half-pants, the
stockings and the patent-leather slippers in favor of regular black
trousers, socks and well-polished black shoes, the peers decreed,
but when he is presiding over the lords, he will still have to wear
his long, heavy wig and his long, heavy robe.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has complained bitterly about the wig _ it ``weighs
an absolute ton and is very uncomfortable,'' he said last week _
Irvine graciously agreed to continue wearing it whenever he sits on
the Woolsack.
</P>
<P>
   But, when he is sitting with the rest of his party during
discussions of bills in which he is taking the lead, he will now be
allowed to dispense with the costume altogether, and appear in a
simple business suit along with everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   It was the prospect of change from past custom and a belief in
the trappings of office, rather than an overwhelming love of silky
stockings on men, that seemed to so exercise the peers who spoke
against the proposal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With many of them facing enforced retirement soon _ it will only
be a matter of time before the government enacts its plan to remove
the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the lords _ the
House of Lords is extremely sensitive to anything that might chip
away at its dignity and power.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the ditching of the lord chancellor's breeches is but
one in a series of similar changes proposed, or already enacted, by
the Labor government. Recently, it decided to shorten the induction
ceremony whereby new peers enter the House of Lords, an elaborate
ritual that involves bowing on numerous occasions while dressed in
a voluminous robe and floppy cap.
</P>
<P>
   It has also pared down the trappings of the annual state opening
of Parliament, another tradition-clogged ceremony, by, for
instance, eliminating the role of someone known as the silver stick
in waiting (Andrew Parker Bowles, former husband of Prince Charles'
companion, Camilla, once held that job).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the lord chancellor will no longer be required to
walk backward down the steps away from the queen; instead, he will
be allowed to turn around and walk away in the regular manner.
</P>
<P>
   It is such changes that particularly upset people like Baroness
Young, who spoke against the proposal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good example of salami-slicing,'' she said of
Irvine's proposal, meaning that as each new slice is removed, the
salami of tradition gets smaller and smaller until nothing is left.
``We've had this today _ what will come tomorrow?'' she added,
speaking ominously of ``dress-down Friday'' and peers in jeans and
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Waddington agreed, saying, ``I can see no advantage to the
queen or the public if the lord chancellor removes his tights.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think this is neither the beginning nor the end.
If we accede to his request, we just add fuel to the flames and
encourage more and more modernization. Personally, I think this
modernization has gone far enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baroness Thornton, speaking in support of Irvine, noted that
many traditions were ``accidents of history'' plucked
indiscriminately from one era or another in a nation with a
millennium's worth to choose from. As much as he hated his outfit,
she said, the lord chancellor should be relieved that he never had
to wear a little tunic and a chain-mail shirt.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: A PAIR OF WARHORSES COME TROTTING DOWN FROM
CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The curtain rose at 7:40, but the Stratford Festival
did not unveil its capabilities until an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of revelation came when William Hutt, the celebrated
Canadian company's Old Reliable, an actor in his late 70s with the
savoir-faire that comes with age, made the force of his presence
felt in Shakespeare's ``Much Ado About Nothing.'' The troupe has
brought the play to City Center for a two-week run in repertory
with its production of Moliere's ``Miser.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutt, portraying Leonato, father to Hero, the ingenue, and uncle
to Beatrice, the sharp-tongued cynic, steals an inherently funny
drinking scene with his descent into good-natured inebriation.
</P>
<P>
   Dangling a martini glass, Hutt turns the leonine patriarch into
a figure out of Noel Coward, supplying dry-as-vermouth commentary
as the other men spin lies about the love Beatrice (played by
Martha Henry) has for Benedick (Brian Bedford), all of which
Benedick overhears while hiding behind a plant.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is so effortlessly charming, and Hutt so delightfully
lightheaded, that you wouldn't mind if someone turned off the play
and allowed the banter to go on and on. The trouble is that once
the scene ends, the party is essentially over. Its conclusion marks
the passing of the only truly sparkling encounter all evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Stratford Festival, which draws tourists and rabid
theatergoers to a small town in Ontario for an immersion in the
work of Shakespeare and other old hands, has come to City Center
with a sampling on the first of what it hopes will be an annual
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The company, quite sensibly, arrived in New York, where the
classics only sporadically enthrall the hometown crowds, with a
pair of audience-pleasing comedies by dead playwrights with whom
the ensemble is nonetheless on intimate terms.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the shows are short on laughs and long on _ well,
they're just kind of long. Based on the dubious rewards, potential
ticket buyers might be better served by waiting to see what
Stratford plans for next year.
</P>
<P>
   These are technically proficient productions, directed by
Stratford's artistic director, Richard Monette, but without
virtually any remarkable aspects, from the sterile sets by Guido
Tondino and Meredith Caron to unappealing costumes by Ms. Caron and
Ann Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are nimble performances by a few of the older
actors, like Hutt (in both plays, but more memorable in ``Much
Ado'') and the always resourceful Bedford (also in ``Much Ado''),
the level of performance is for the most part standard issue,
especially among the younger players. The overall impression is of
a ``Much Ado'' ultimately thwarted by odd casting decisions and a
``Miser'' undermined by a precious and debilitating concept.
</P>
<P>
   Monette's modern, cosmopolitan ``Much Ado'' is the livelier of
the evenings. The setting is the Italian seacoast just as World War
I is ending, in Leonato's luxurious palace, where the fellow at the
baby grand plays music inspired by Gershwin.
</P>
<P>
   The play takes place at what would have to be twilight. As
portrayed by the mature Ms. Henry and Bedford, the old antagonists
are a lot older here than audiences are used to. This is a cooler,
sexually mellower sparring match, between an unregenerate spinster
and a confirmed bachelor. But age is not really the confounding
characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the line readings have a nice twist in this ``On Golden
Pond'' pairing. ``My dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living?''
Bedford, in ascot and whiskers, sneers at Ms. Henry, whose casual
retort, ``I know you of old,'' sounds more like an insult than an
observation.
</P>
<P>
   The severe-looking Ms. Henry, playing Beatrice as a kind of
bookish smarty-pants, is best in the early scenes, when Beatrice is
at her most smug. But the badinage goes nowhere. Dressed in what
look like outfits from the Queen Elizabeth II Reject Shop _ check
out the ghastly kimono and cap she wears in the wedding scene _ Ms.
Henry reveals little affinity for Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   That they end up together seems a random result. In another
break with tradition, the audience is not actively engaged in the
rooting for their union. Whatever happens to them, you're
reasonably certain that these two survivors will, indeed, survive.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding the two leads are an assortment of supporting
players, only a few of whom, like James Blendick as Don Pedro, are
more than satisfactory. Tom McCamus' villainous Don John is a blank
in black, and the overdone Dogberry of Stephen Ouimette should be
wearing a sign that says, ``Look at me, I'm funny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miser'' is a more troubled import. The adaptation by Miles
Malleson plays as virtually a sendup of Moliere. The actors are
encouraged by Monette to indulge in patently silly and wholly
unnecessary antics, as when a pair of identical, gnomish servants,
starved by their niggardly master, Harpagon, kill and eat a
housefly in unison, or when members of the household carry a
screaming piglet to slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Making the joke on Moliere seems the height of hubris. The
employment of such embellishments is not justified by this affected
version, whose chief attraction remains Hutt's Harpagon. It's not
nearly as sly or subtle as his suave Leonato. You never quite
believe this cranky miser would sacrifice anything for money. But
he is nonetheless a fitting foil for the pranks of his staff and
family.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his best efforts, though, Hutt's sourpuss is powerless
to dilute the production's bitter aftertaste.

SCIENTISTS SAY METEOR SHOWER UNEXPECTEDLY HEAVY 
</HEADLINE>

   Skies were starting to light up over Asia Monday, and elsewhere
in the world, more than a day before the expected peak of this
year's Leonid meteor shower, which astronomers say could turn into
a rare, dramatic meteor storm sometime Tuesday. The early signs of
activity suggest that the shower could be even more intense than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonid shower, which can produce spectacular storms of
activity every 33 years, occurs every year in mid-November, and
either this year or next is expected to produce major activity. The
last big Leonid storm was in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites in orbit could be affected, or even completely
disabled, in the event of a direct hit. Scientists estimate a
chance of somewhere from one-tenth to one percent that any given
satellite will be hit, which means that with more than 600 in orbit
there is a good chance that at least one will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the predawn hours Monday, about a day and a half before
the expected peak of ``shooting star'' activity, one experienced
meteor observer in California called it ``the best meteor shower
I've ever witnessed,'' with an unusually high proportion of the
extremely bright meteors known as fireballs _ those that blaze
brighter than the planet Venus at its brightest.
</P>
<P>
   George Zay, the observer in rural southern California who works
as a fireman by day and has been recording meteor activity by night
for eight years for the International Meteor Organization, said one
of the early-Monday fireballs for a second or two blazed several
times brighter than the full moon. (It reached a brightness
astronomers refer to as magnitude -15, in a scale where the larger
the negative number, the brighter. The full moon is magnitude -13,
and the sun is -26). ``The stars totally disappeared and the sky
looked like daylight blue for a second or two,'' Zay said. ``It was
pure excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate of meteors, so long before the expected peak, was not
extraordinary _ only about ten Leonids per hour, Zay reported _ but
the number of bright ones was far greater than average, making for
a dramatic show. ``I've never seen 25 fireballs in one night
before,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports from Mongolia, where some scientists had traveled
to be in the best position for the expected peak of the storm, also
indicated that the activity was picking up early, with rates of
more than one per minute and with many bright fireballs.
</P>
<P>
   Two US research planes will be observing the peak activity over
Asia, using ultraviolet cameras, radar and other instruments to try
to determine the size and numbers of particles entering the
atmosphere. All estimates of the amount of material burning up
during a meteor shower have been calculated based on the bright
trails seen from the ground, but some researchers have suggested
that there may be far more material entering the atmosphere
invisibly at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Another experiment, being carried out by National Aeronautics
and Space Administration scientists, will attempt to catch a piece
of the falling debris before it burns up in the atmosphere, using a
high-altitude weather balloon. The scientists estimate the chances
of successfully catching a ``falling star'' are only about 10
percent, but the potential scientific payoff _ getting the first
laboratory sample ever of material from a comet _ is worth the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   This meteor storm ``is like room service for science,'' said
David Noever, a member of NASA's Astrobiology Institute. ``Instead
of us going to the comet, it's coming to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding out just how much material is hurtling into the upper
atmosphere, and what it is made of _ all of it is believed to be
sand-sized debris shed by a comet called Tempel-Tuttle _ could be
crucial to those planning for how to protect satellites during
future meteor storms.
</P>
<P>
   The early reports of activity Monday are an encouraging sign for
viewers in New England and the rest of the United States, who
according to the early forecasts were expected to be left out of
the spectacular show altogether. While nobody thinks we will
experience the rates of thousands of meteors in one hour that are
expected in Asia, the high proportion of fireballs suggests that
this could be a show well worth watching, even here.
</P>
<P>
   While last night was overcast in the Northeast, the forecast
calls for partly to mostly cloudy conditions tonight, which may
provide enough openings for observers in locations with dark skies
_ the farther from city lights the better _ to catch some of those
brighter meteors. The best times to watch are between midnight and
dawn. The meteors can show up anywhere in the sky, but all appear
to be radiating outward from the constellation Leo in the
southeast.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Valerie Harper, it's the voice. Even if she's
not doing her Rhoda Morgenstern nice-Jewish-girl-from-New-York
accent, the tone and the knowing, contemporary rhythm of her voice
send signals: This is a savvy, neurotic late-20th-century woman and
she's probably about to say something funny _ ideally to Mary, Lou,
Brenda or Joe. (For readers without television sets, those are
characters from ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ``Rhoda,'' the
two 1970s sitcoms in which Ms. Harper starred.)
</P>
<P>
   That's why playing Pearl Buck with an old-lady voice, in
addition to the baggy clothes and the gray hair in a bun, was
actually a good idea. In ``All Under Heaven,'' an intelligent and
often witty one-woman show that opened at the Century Theater on
Monday night, Ms. Harper does well.
</P>
<P>
   The production is no tour de force, but she proves herself a
competent stage actress and not a bad mimic. In addition to Buck,
she plays, among others, a Chinese woman who named her son Little
Meatball, Buck's unhappy West Virginia mother and Will Rogers
reading a newspaper review of ``The Good Earth'' (``So you go get
this and read it''). She even does a very quick Nixon
impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   Buck, who is 79 as Ms. Harper plays her, was born in 1892 and
grew up in China, the daughter of Presbyterian missionaries. She
came home long enough to get a degree at Randolph-Macon Woman's
College in Virginia but returned to China, became a university
teacher there, married a missionary and wrote magazine articles and
essays.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually she wrote the novel ``The Good Earth'' (1931), the
story of a Chinese peasant who became a wealthy landowner, which
won a Pulitzer Prize. Within four years, she divorced her husband,
married her New York publisher and moved back to the United States.
She continued to write, and she died in Vermont in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But those are only the outlines of a life. Ms. Harper's play
concentrates on the highs and lows, particularly the difficulties.
Buck's father, for instance, never reads ``The Good Earth,''
because, he says, he doesn't have time.
</P>
<P>
   After giving birth to two daughters, Buck is unable to have more
children. (``There is no rapid recovery from the loss of your
womb.'') So she adopts seven. One daughter is very sick. (``There
are two kinds of people in this world: those who have known
inescapable sorrow and those who have not.'') She becomes a target
of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's communist witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in China, she is so certain of her imminent death,
because she is not Asian, that she resolves to kill the children
first rather than leave them to suffer whatever horrors the
soldiers might inflict. During the same military attack, a Chinese
friend, says Buck, ``managed to save many of our things by
pretending to loot.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Buck could find humor in the worst of situations and
subjects, and Dyke Garrison, who wrote ``All Under Heaven'' with
Ms. Harper, conveys that. Discussing the plight of mixed-race
children fathered by American soldiers in Asia, a cause Buck was
fervent about, she speaks to her Bucks County, Pa., neighbors,
including Oscar Hammerstein II: ``No one is born prejudiced. You've
got to be carefully taught.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All Under Heaven,'' nicely directed by Rob Ruggiero, is too
long and falters once or twice, but overall this is a well-drawn
portrait of an author who truly had something to say.

`ALONE' SAILOR GETS LIFE-SAVING MEDICAL HELP VIA INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Viktor Yazykov is cq; a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dr. Daniel Carlin was on call to offer health care by
computer to sailors racing around the world, but he wasn't prepared
for the e-mail from the Russian competitor that flashed across his
computer last Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have been sitting on the bloody cabin floor almost completely
naked ... watching as my life drop by drop leaving me,'' Viktor
Yazykov, one of 15 solo sailors competing in the ``Around Alone''
race wrote last week. The Russian had performed surgery on his
infected arm, following the doctor's written instructions, but
something had gone horribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yazykov, the doctor would later learn, had not provided all the
pertinent medical information prior to cutting into himself. Such
things happen when there are language, communication and weather
barriers. It also happens when the patient is a former Soviet
commando disinclined to reveal just how much pain he was in.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin ultimately would save the arm, and perhaps the life, of
Yazykov while the sailor was alone, far at sea, and bouncing in
storm-swept seas like he was in an amusement park ride.
</P>
<P>
   Yazykov sailed into Capetown, South Africa, at 10 a.m. Monday a
happy man _ and a lucky man. His story is told in a paper trail of
e-mails and illustrates just how bad a lousy day of sailing can
get.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of administering medicine by remote control, this one
has got to be right up there as one to remember,'' said Carlin, 39,
an infections disease specialist at the New England Medical Center.
He is also founder of World Clinic Inc., which uses computer
technology to make house calls from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   The first e-mail from Yazykov arrived shortly after Carlin's
breakfast one week ago today &UR;  &LR; (Nov. 17). The Russian's spelling has
been corrected for this report:
</P>
<P>
   ``My right elbow does not look good. Some yellow spot in the
middle of red and it feels like dead,'' Yazykov wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian was 400 miles from Cape Town and at the end of the
first leg in the Around Alone Race, considered the most challenging
solo yachting competition in the world. Carlin is the ``on call''
physician, a job faciliated by the sophisticated satellite
communication systems many sailors took to at sea.
</P>
<P>
   But not Yazykov. Finances being tight, he set sail from
Charleston, S.C., with the race-issued ``INMARSAT C,'' a minimal
system, relatively speaking, that uses solar power for emergency
e-mail transmissions. At night, the system is useless _ and, for
Yazykov, always a challenge because the keyboard uses the English
alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   Yazykov had been four days late for the Sept. 19 start.
Nevertheless, he had plowed his way ahead of four competitors at
the time of his initial e-mail: An injury to his elbow sustained at
the beginning of the race was bothering him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting for your help,'' he messaged Carlin. The doctor
responded that it appeared to be an infection, but he needed more
information.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, Yazykov messaged back:
</P>
<P>
   ``All skin is glossy and shiny white. It is like a pillow with
some liquid inside.'' He said he was not in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin realized Yazykov was in trouble _ and that the former
member of the Russian Special Forces had probably downplayed the
amount of pain he was actually in. In fact, Yazykov had probably
sailed much of the race with his left arm only, the other infected
with a severe abcess. If it burst inside the skin, the infection
could fatally flood the body.
</P>
<P>
   It was four hours before sunset in the South Atlantic _ and four
hours before Yazykov's daily communication blackout. Carlin quickly
scripted a 13-step operating procedure to drain the abcess using
medical instruments provided all the sailors by World Clinic.
Carlin got his directions off _ including precise instructions
about where to make incisions with a scalpel _ before the sailor's
INMARSAT system went dead.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning the doctor learned the surgery gone well
given the circumstances. The abscess had been punctured, but the
bleeding would not stop, Yazykov e-mailed. And, he couldn't move
his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   What Yazykov had neglected to tell his doctor was that he had
taken about eight aspirin in the previous day or two to try to numb
the pain. Aspirin thins the blood and hampers clotting. The
bandaging as ordered by the doctor had been useless.
</P>
<P>
   So, using his teeth and his good arm, the Russian wrapped
elastic cord around his bad arm several times to stop the bleeding
_ and paralyzed himself from the elbow down.
</P>
<P>
   In the flurry of e-mails that followed, Carlin had Yazykov
remove his tourniquet, apply direct pressure to the wound, and
eventually the bleeding stopped. By the weekend, Yazykov had gotten
some minor movement back in the hand. Full recovery is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the surgery and one-handed sailing, he would finish that
leg of the race still ahead of four competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin got the Russian's last e-mail Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   ``The arm getting better. Very grateful to the doctor.''

FINALLY, GERMAN COMPANIES BEGIN STREAMLINING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The streamlining of corporate Germany,
which has been under way in fits and starts for several years, has
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, three of the biggest conglomerates have
announced plans to spin off huge chunks of their empires, which
employ tens of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   First came Siemens AG, the giant electronics and engineering
company, which announced on Nov. 4 that it would spin off
businesses accounting for more than $10 billion of its $70 billion
in annual sales and with that, 60,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Then Viag AG, which owns everything from electric utilities to
chemical plants, announced plans on Nov. 9 to sell companies with
about $9 billion in revenue and 13,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   And last Friday, the nation's biggest retailing company said it
too would slim down. Metro AG, which is second to Wal-Mart as an
owner of stores, said it would sell a collection of chains that
generate $9.6 billion in sales and employ 34,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Three companies do not necessarily add up to a trend, and each
company was motivated by different reasons. But analysts said the
flurry of revamping reflected growing pressure on European
conglomerates to shed businesses that drag down overall profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each case is specific, of course,'' said Mark Davies-Jones of
Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``But I think there is a general
trend, as well. What we are seeing are the effects of
globalization, both of their markets and of their investor base.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most of the restructuring in German industry has
been achieved through cost-cutting. Textile companies like Hugo
Boss shifted production to low-wage countries in Eastern Europe and
Asia. Machine-tool and engineering companies made their assembly
lines more efficient and flexible. Steel companies merged and shut
down factories. Banks have begun merging and closing branches.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of companies have rethought their central
strategies. Daimler, which just completed the takeover of Chrysler,
abandoned unsuccessful acquisitions in aircraft, insurance and
other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Veba AG, a conglomerate involved in chemicals, packaging,
telecommunications and electric-power generating, has sold scores
of small businesses since 1993. This year alone, it is spinning off
businesses with sales of more than $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst AG has been trying to put itself through a more radical
transformation, though its success has been mixed at best so far.
The company, based in Frankfurt, is systematically selling or
spinning off its chemicals businesses while pushing further into
pharmaceuticals and buying its way into agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   More companies are listing shares in the United States or
borrowing money in international bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens, based in Munich, had been frustrating investors for
years with mediocre profits. With businesses as far flung as
semiconductors, mobile phones, power-plant construction and
medical-imaging equipment, the company has been trying to shave
costs and streamline its organization.
</P>
<P>
   But while Siemens abandoned businesses in dental equipment,
military electronics and personal computers, analysts complained
that it had never confronted its structural problems.
</P>
<P>
   That changed two weeks ago, when Siemans chairman Heinrich von
Pierer announced plans to spin off units with one-seventh of the
company's 416,000 employees, including the chip-making division.
</P>
<P>
   That marked a big departure from past strategy because Siemens
had always argued that it had to have a strong presence in computer
chips if it was going to succeed as a manufacturer of electronic
equipment that relied on such chips.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization at Metro AG, based in Cologne, was also
drastic. The company owns a vast array of retailing companies, from
department stores and discount warehouses to chains of shoe stores.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Metro typified the push toward sheer bigness by
merging with two other large retailers. But analysts said that the
combinations turned out to be disappointing and that competition
was intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   In an abrupt reversal, the company announced it would spin off
divisions accounting for about a sixth of its $38 billion in sales.
Those businesses are to be folded into a new holding company that
will be organized by Deutsche Bank. The idea is to then list as
many as six of these companies on the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   For Metro, the move is an attempt to refocus its capital on its
supermarkets and hypermarkets as European retailers cross national
borders. Analysts said the move was also a response to bruising new
competition, including from Wal-Mart, the biggest American
retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailing is one of the last segments to go international,''
said Nick Jones of Goldman, Sachs in London. ``A lot of retailers,
within and without Germany, have growth ambitions. As individual
subsections of the industry become more and more concentrated,
companies are either forced to keep diversifying or to go abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   In Metro's case, diversification seemed to bring confusion
rather than strength. ``The conglomerate didn't evolve as part of a
coherent strategy,'' Jones said. ``There was no guiding principle
behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Metro is now expected to concentrate on such businesses as its
Galeria department stores, Saturn electronics dealers and Praktiker
home-improvement stores.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts caution that German companies are not necessarily
embracing Wall Street pieties about increasing ``shareholder
value.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the case with Viag, which announced plans to spin
off its interests in logistics services, shipping and steel-trading
businesses that have sales of about $9 billion. Viag has annual
sales of about $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Lynn Reinhardt, head of equity research in Merrill Lynch's
Frankfurt office, maintained that the moves primarily reflected the
change in leadership at Viag, where Wilhelm Simson became chairman
in July. And some of the changes were practical: Viag's decision to
sell its 30 percent stake in a shipping company called Kuehne &AMP;
Nagel came after it failed to persuade the company's controlling
shareholder to sell his stake.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With House Republicans picking their new leaders on
Wednesday, Rep. Dick Armey's aides say he is confident of keeping
his job as majority leader, but his opponents doubt he has the
votes, and a nascent movement to draft a fourth candidate is still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Voting is by secret ballot, making it difficult for candidates
to nail down commitments and track votes.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have only to look at the leadership race four
years ago for a stark reminder of how fluid commitments can be
under the cloak of secrecy. Back then, consultants for Rep. Bill
McCollum of Florida, a candidate for majority whip, claimed he had
110 votes; he received 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all lie to us,'' said one Republican who is campaigning
on behalf of one of the candidates. Said another, ``This whole
thing is an experiment in truth-telling.''
</P>
<P>
   The three active candidates for majority leader _ Armey of
Texas, Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Rep. Jennifer Dunn of
Washington _ were all tied to their telephones Monday, trying to
secure commitments from colleagues. They also were trying to talk
in person, eye-to-eye, with members who are starting to filter back
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``These last two days we're spending checking and re-checking
and making sure people are still there,'' said Michele Davis, a
spokeswoman for Armey. ``We're fairly confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Other last-minute strategies include Largent's sending aides to
pick up returning members at the airport and Ms. Dunn's pointing to
the Democrats, who voted Monday to retain their all-male leadership
team, to press her case that Republicans could bolster their image
with a woman in a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent vote counts are: 71 votes for Largent and 71 for
Armey, say Largent's aides, and 40 for Ms. Dunn. Ms. Dunn's aides
say that Armey has 90 votes, Ms. Dunn has ``above 70'' and Largent
has 50. Armey's aides are not telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't stop at 112,'' said Ms. Davis, the Armey aide,
referring to a majority of the 223 House Republicans. ``Anyone who
would claim victory at 112 obviously has not been through a
leadership race.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that Armey was pursuing a ``second-ballot'' strategy
in case he fails to secure a majority in the first round of voting,
seeking pledges from members for any second vote. Largent and Ms.
Dunn are banking on a second ballot, each expecting the other to
come in third on the first ballot and be forced out of the race,
leaving either Largent or Ms. Dunn in a head-to-head match-up
against Armey.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the vote-counting is a last-minute drive to
draft Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois into the race.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Castle of Delaware and Thomas Ewing of Illinois
wrote in a letter Monday to their fellow Republicans, ``We should
not allow voting commitments to prohibit members of the conference
from considering Dennis Hastert.'' They added, ``The action we are
taking is not done at the request of Denny, but he has indicated
that if he was truly the choice of the conference, he would
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hastert, who is the chief deputy whip, said the
congressman would consider being drafted only if it looked as if he
would win. ``If they came to him and said, `Here's a majority of
the conference and they've all signed this statement that Dick
Armey will not win and they want you,' he'd say OK,'' said Mike
Stokke, the spokesman. ``That's highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   He is right so far. Castle said that as of Monday afternoon,
just four Republicans had committed to Hastert _ and Hastert was
not among them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hastert is committed to Armey. In one of the more bizarre
subplots of this leadership race, Hastert asked Armey to release
him from his pledge, only to have Armey refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert had pledged his support when Armey was running for
speaker earlier this year on the chance that Newt Gingrich might
step down to run for president. He sought release from the pledge
after Gingrich resigned on Nov. 6. Hastert's spokesman said Monday
that his boss would vote for Armey on Wednesday even if his own
name is offered.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, Hastert could draw support from conservatives who
are backing Armey and Largent. Hastert has a 100 percent rating
from the American Conservative Union. He voted against increasing
the minimum wage, in favor of repealing the ban on assault weapons
and is strongly opposed to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Castle, a moderate, supports him. Castle said
Hastert had the right temperament for the job and could ``keep the
place moving forward.''

FLORIDA CITY'S HOPES FOR AIRPORT BOG DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)

<P>
   HOMESTEAD, Fla. _ In the six years since Hurricane Andrew
devastated this agricultural city south of Miami, officials here
have struggled to jump-start the economy. But nature seems to be
against Homestead, again, as plans for turning the closed Homestead
Air Force Base into a commercial airport _ a major project that
could bring dollars and jobs _ have bogged down over the possible
environmental damage to two nearby national parks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After first winning approval from the Federal Aviation
Administration, the airport plan is now undergoing further study to
address concerns about how Biscayne National Park, two miles east
of the base, and Everglades National Park, 10 miles to the west,
would be affected by noise, air and water pollution from their new
neighbor and the development expected to surround it. Plans call
for the airport to handle more than 200,000 flights a year for
passengers and cargo and attract new industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County officials have promoted the airport plan as a
way of relieving some of the traffic at Miami International
Airport, 30 miles to the north, while helping to revitalize the
area. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew inflicted more than $400 million in
economic losses to the region; the Homestead Air Force Base, which
provided about 5,000 military and civilian jobs, was so badly
damaged that it had to close. In 1994 the base was converted into
an Air Force Reserves installation with about 2,000 people that now
occupies about a third of the former base's 3,000 acres. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were crippled twice, all in one night,'' said Homestead
Mayor Steve Shiver, who governs this city of about 25,000 residents
in the heart of Miami-Dade County's farmland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important,'' he said, referring to the airport.
``It's not the single savior but it definitely puts us on the right
track.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal studies to transfer 1,600 acres of the base to the
county found the site compatible with a commercial regional
airport, and the redevelopment plans won Miami-Dade County approval
in 1996. But the federal government's environmental report came
under attack from conservationists for failing to adequately
address the effects on Biscayne National Park, a 180,000-acre
aquatic park that is almost entirely under water, and Everglades
National Park, a wilderness park on 1.5 million acres of sawgrass
marshes, pineland, and mangrove and cypress swamps.
</P>
<P>
   Critics see the airport proposal as undermining the federal
government's own multimillion-dollar restoration project to
preserve the Everglades. The opponents, including the Sierra Club
and the National Audubon Society, contend that noise from passenger
jets would surpass what the National Park Service considers
acceptable. They also worry about degradation of water quality in
Biscayne Bay, fuel dumping and collisions with birds. Already, they
note, the air base is undergoing a petroleum cleanup after the U.S.
Environmental Agency placed it on a priority list of polluted
properties in 1990. Airport proponents counter that today's
environmental laws would prevent such contamination again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Browder, a longtime Everglades conservationist who now
lives in Washington, says the county should promote the area's
natural offerings through eco-tourism and develop hotels and homes
and the kind of tourism facilities that one would expect to find in
such a place: ``Instead of capitalizing on a location with two
world-class national parks, the county wants to turn that area into
an industrial complex.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The environmental concerns have led the Air Force and the FAA to
review the project again, and the scope of the new study has been
expanded to consider adverse effects on agriculture and tourism,
air travel safety and traffic. The study is also looking into
alternative uses for the site, including a theme park, a marine
research center, a space launching facility, and other government
and military use. Public hearings will be held on the study when it
is completed, sometime next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County officials say they still hope to achieve their
goal, with minimal impact to the surroundings. They say they have
been looking for 14 years for a site to accommodate overflow from
Miami International but have not found it. None of the county's
three general aviation airports, which include one in Homestead,
can be expanded, they said, because of their proximity to
residential and business areas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The county has committed $25 million to the Homestead airport
project for a new terminal and renovations. ``You already have an
airfield there,'' said Sandy O'Neil, an adviser to Miami-Dade
County Mayor Alex Penelas. ``It's not like we're going into the
middle of the forest to build an airport.''

WITH AIR STRIKES AVERTED _ FOR NOW _ U.N. WORKERS HEAD BACK TO

<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ United Nations workers began to head back to
Iraq on Monday to open yet another act in the long and stormy drama
between the Baghdad government and the people who enforce U.N.
rules.
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend that brought the United States and Britain close
to a major attack on Iraq, the workers returned to see whether the
Iraqis would honor a renewed commitment to cooperation that
narrowly averted air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The first inspectors who have been at the center of this and
previous standoffs are to fly back on Tuesday from Bahrain. The
trip was preceded by the return of more than 150 relief workers who
had been staying in a hotel in Jordan and returned Monday to posts
that they had left Nov. 11, when the crisis began to reach a danger
point.
</P>
<P>
   An urgent first order of business, U.N. relief officials said,
is to untie logjams at border crossings that threatened to disrupt
internationally monitored food deliveries. The jams, involving 75
trucks that are carrying wheat from Syria and an additional 59 that
are trying to enter from Zakho, on the Turkish border, started when
U.N. contract workers left their posts on the border on Friday for
what their British employer, Lloyds Register of Shipping, described
as safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those 53 inspectors, too, headed back to their jobs at
four crossings, U.N. officials said. But like the stalled weapons
inspections, the stalled food deliveries are a reminder of the
breadth of U.N.-supervised operations in Iraq and their
vulnerability to flaring tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the weekend delays a spokesman for the United Nations in
Baghdad, Eric Falt, said U.N.-supervised stocks of food and medical
supplies there remained satisfactory and were not in danger of
running out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, U.N. officials did not disguise their frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an urgent need to resolve this potential disruption
of the oil-for-food program,'' the undersecretary in charge of the
plan, Benon Sevan, said. Sevan said he feared further delays could
affect shipments of perishable goods.
</P>
<P>
   The border inspectors are a crucial link in the oil-for-food
deal, which provides limited relief from the U.N. sanctions imposed
shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The plan allows Iraq to
sell $5.25 billion worth of oil every six months to buy what are
classified as necessities for its people. But the United Nations
has final say on all contracts, and the border inspectors certify
that the goods have arrived before the suppliers are paid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than 200 U.N. workers in northern Iraq and other locations
outside the capital worked throughout the latest crisis. U.N.
officials who insisted on anonymity suggested that the Lloyds
staff, on the borders with Jordan, Syria and Turkey and at the port
of Umm Qasr on the Persian Gulf, should have stayed on the job
despite the risk of a military attack.
</P>
<P>
   But in Baghdad a skeleton staff of 57 was permitted to remain.
The U.N. staff has more than 300 non-Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were evacuated included all 103 weapons inspectors,
whose job since the Persian Gulf war in 1991 has been to insure
that Iraq fulfills its commitment to end its production of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Their work, a source of tension with Baghdad for more than eight
years, was stalled again on Aug. 5, when Iraq limited U.N.
inspections, and was halted altogether on Oct. 31, when Iraq cut
all ties with the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   A first wave of 84 inspectors is to fly back here on Tuesday
morning from Bahrain, the field office director, Goram Wallen,
said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of staff members spent Monday preparing for the
inspectors' return, reaffixing license plates and flags to U.N.
vehicles, which many feared would not outlast Western air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The return will present the first real test of Iraq's pledge
this weekend to resume full cooperation, the promise that succeeded
in staving off the American and British air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has insisted that Baghdad ``live up to its
obligations,'' and United States and British forces remain in
position to retaliate if the pledge proves hollow.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the work of the weapons inspectors, U.N.
officials have said that observation of the oil-for-food program
continued even over the weekend, albeit at a reduced level. Among
the 151 workers who returned from Amman on Monday, a 30-member
advance party was permitted to fly. The rest traveled by car on bus
600 miles across the desert. U.N. officials said the return would
quickly allow relief operations to resume fully.

ANALYSIS: JAPAN'S STIMULUS PLAN GREETED WITH YAWNS AND SKEPTICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Although the $195 billion economic stimulus plan
announced by Japan Monday is the largest ever announced here, many
investors yawned and shrugged. They have been disappointed in Japan
so many times that they are hard to impress.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose modestly with the announcement. The benchmark Nikkei
index of 225 shares ended at 14,428.27, up 160.06 points, or 1.12
percent. But many critics called the package misguided and
shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   Some contend that the answer to Japan's problems lies not in
throwing money at them, but rather in undertaking structural
changes to create more of a market economy. Other critics say that
money might indeed solve the problems, but that the economy is
sinking into such a big hole that it would take a huge stimulus
effort just to return to the starting point.
</P>
<P>
   An important problem is that the government's credibility is as
fragile as the economy. Officials have promised recovery so many
times that no one knows whether to believe them this time. In any
case the government finds itself having to outdo its previous
record stimulus package, $137 billion in April, to demonstrate that
Japan is going to buoy growth. The new package brings total
spending on stimulus since 1992 to more than $800 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of treadmill,'' Peter Morgan, an economist at HSBC
Securities Japan Ltd., said. ``They keep moving the goal posts.
They get locked into these large packages to just stay neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's announcement Monday included a
giant package of tax cuts, spending and lending. It is an ambitious
grab bag of measures that includes $10 billion to promote housing
investment, $8 billion to create one million jobs, another $8
billion to assist other Asian nations in crisis and $48 billion in
financing to alleviate a nationwide credit squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying problem for Japan has been that corporate
profits, consumption and corporate spending are all sliding, while
unemployment is rising. The package may not appear large enough to
turn around those problems.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the earlier package many economists are predicting an
economic contraction of 2 percent for the year that ends on March
31.
</P>
<P>
   And notwithstanding the new plan, to be carried out in the next
fiscal year, a number of economists are also expecting a small
contraction then, too.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and executives also have other concerns about what
the plan does not include. Some had hoped for a rollback in the 5
percent consumption tax. But the director of the Economic Planning
Agency, Taichi Sakaiya, ruled that out for now.
</P>
<P>
   Other figures had hoped that the long-term tax cuts of more than
6 trillion yen, or $50 billion, would be put into effect
immediately. But taxpayers may not feel the effects until they
submit their tax returns for 1999.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moreover, some economists argue that money is not the only way
to resolve the economic problems and that too much government
spending may create a backlash. They say consumers may fear that
the huge spending package will lead to bigger government deficits
and tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese consumer is not confident about the future,''
said Hiroyuki Inoue, an economist at the Japan Center for Economic
Research in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with tax revenues sliding because of the weaker
economy and with the big spending packages and tax cuts, the budget
deficit is ballooning to 10 percent of total economic output.
</P>
<P>
   That is the highest among the Group of 7 major industrial
countries. It has some economists worried that Japan may be
becoming fiscally negligent. The economists say the government has
to devise a longer-term plan to strengthen its economy, so that
when growth takes hold it will be sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Sakaiya of the Economic Planning Agency did try to highlight the
long-term characteristics of the plan, which he called the ``road
map'' to the future. He suggested that much of the 8.1 trillion
yen, or $66 billion, that is to be spent on public works would go
to build a social infrastructure like optical fiber lines and a
high-technology highway with electronic toll gates.
</P>
<P>
   But some economists were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these measures can increase domestic demand in the short
term, but it's like giving a painkiller when the patient is crying
for help,'' Teizo Taya, an economist at the Daiwa Institute of
Research, said. ``The right objective is to stimulate the kind of
domestic demand that can be sustained from the long-run point of
view. To that end we have to give the freedom of choice to the
consumers.''

TOBACCO PROPOSAL OFFICIALLY UNVEILED  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Mass., Iowa, Ariz., Ind.)   By BARRY MEIER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a muted reprise of last year's ultimately failed
tobacco settlement deal, state officials Monday unveiled a new $206
billion proposal here designed to end all state lawsuits against
cigarette makers to recover the cost of treating smoking-related
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at an emotionally charged news conference, state
attorneys general disclosed a sweeping $368.5 billion settlement
plan intended to change the nation's tobacco landscape through
measures like federal nicotine regulation and the payment of fines
by the industry if youth smoking did not decline.
</P>
<P>
   But the setting for Monday's announcement _ a room at the
National Press Club here with a ceiling that barely cleared the
head of the tallest participant _ symbolized the scaled-back goals
of the newest plan.
</P>
<P>
   The $206 billion, which is to be paid over 25 years, does
include financing for measures like advertisements and research to
deter youth smoking. And cigarette makers have also agreed to end
the use of tobacco billboards and other marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   But because the agreement represents the settling of lawsuits
and does not require congressional approval, it does not include
measures like nicotine regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it appears that the new plan will succeed where the
earlier one failed. So far, more than a dozen states have publicly
announced their support for the proposal and most others are
expected to sign on by Friday, when officials must indicate whether
they will participate in the proposal or continue with lawsuits
against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Gregoire, the Washington state attorney general and a
lead negotiator of the new plan, said she believed that the time
had come to ``stop the legal bickering and move the tobacco fight
out of the courtroom and into the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   If finalized, the plan would entail the largest legal settlement
in this country's history and would cover 46 states that have
either sued the industry or have yet to file a claim. (Four states
_ Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas _ have already settled
lawsuits in deals worth some $40 billion over 25 years.)
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Mike Fisher of Pennsylvania said that fees for
lawyers hired by states to pursue tobacco claims would most likely
not exceed 5 percent of the settlement deal. Even at that level,
those fees, which would be paid by cigarette makers, could reach
$10 billion.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The producers participating in the plan are the Philip Morris
Cos.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Holdings
Corp; Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of the Loews Corp., and Brown
&AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, New York state would receive $25 billion,
New Jersey would receive $7.6 billion, and Connecticut would
receive $3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Both Attorney General Dennis Vacco of New York, a plan
negotiator, and Attorney General Peter Verniero of New Jersey said
Monday they would back the deal. Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal of Connecticut said he was still studying the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco producers have not said how many states must participate
in order for them to finalize the deal. But Attorney General
Jeffrey Modisett of Indiana said he had spoken to other state
officials and believed that support for it was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Modisett said the most likely holdouts were Maryland and
Massachusetts. Both Iowa and Arizona, states once cited as possible
opponents of the plan, have announced their support for it.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President Clinton applauded those involved in
negotiating the deal, calling it an important step. But he, state
officials and public health groups called on Congress Monday to
pass legislation when it convenes in January that would allow the
government to regulate tobacco products and permit measures like
stronger warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan may prove less costly to the tobacco industry than
envisioned. For example, should Congress approve new tobacco excise
taxes and pass some of that money on to the states, producers'
payments under the settlement plan would be reduced.

 &HT;    GATES TESTIMONY MAKES JUDGE CHUCKLE
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS TO BOIES beginning in 6th graph. Moving in (w)
Washington and (f) financial categories.)
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In videotaped testimony at the Microsoft antitrust
trial, an evasive Bill Gates refused Monday to say the software
giant had declared a ``jihad'' against arch-rival Netscape
Communications Corp. to seize control of Internet gateways.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial entered its fifth week, Gates repeatedly declined
to admit that Microsoft viewed Netscape as a competitor in the
super-heated browser market _ until confronted by an e-mail to that
effect from one of his top lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look carefully at any significant opportunity to
gain share vs. Netscape,'' Microsoft vice president of development
Paul Maritz wrote Gates, Microsoft's chairman and co-founder, in
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the Gates tape rolled in the courtroom on a 10-foot screen,
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson chuckled and shook his
head his head in wonder at the often farcical 50-minute verbal duel
between David Boies, the government's lead counsel, and his hostile
witness.
</P>
<P>
   In deposing Gates, Boies also handed him a March 13, 1997,
document from Brad Chase, a Microsoft vice president, that said,
``We need to continue our jihad next year. . . . Browser share
needs to remain a key priority for our field and marketing
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates sparred at length with Boies over the meaning of such
terms as ``competition,'' ``concerned'' and ``market share,'' and
offered his own interpretation of his colleague's use of ``jihad,''
the Arab word for ``holy war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is referring to our vigorous efforts to make a
superior product and to market that product,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   When Boies asked Gates whether he saw the sentence in the
document that said, ``we need to continue our jihad next year,''
Gates replied: ``Now I see _ it doesn't say Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies: ``Well, when it says 'we' there, do you understand that
means something other than Microsoft, sir?
</P>
<P>
   Gates: ``It could mean Brad Chase's group,'' Gates replied after
pausing for 32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When Boies asked Gates again whether he understood Chase as
``referring to Microsoft when he uses the word 'we,''' Gates waited
for another 52 seconds before answering, ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think he means when he uses the word 'we'?'' Boies
persisted, speaking slowly and clearly as one might to a
slow-witted child rather than a chief executive officer with a net
worth of $58 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates tape was meant to underscore testimony from Glenn
Weadock, the fifth witness in the landmark trail. Weadock, the
author of a dozen computer books, serves as a $100-an-hour
government consultant in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Weadock agreed during an exacting cross-examination by Microsoft
lawyer Richard Pepperman that Microsoft's Windows 98 operating
system and its Internet Explorer browser could not be pulled apart
without risking a fatal software crash.
</P>
<P>
   As his central theme, Weadock testified that some users,
including a sampling of Fortune 500 companies, would have preferred
to have been left the choice of removing the integrated Microsoft
browser and working only with Netscape Navigator on their personal
computer desktops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are aware, are you not, Mr. Weadock, that the Department
of Justice compliant filed last May that initiated this trial
demanded that Microsoft separate the browser from the operating
system in Windows 98?'' asked Pepperman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read the complaint,'' Weadock replied.

   BOEING-CFO (Seattle) Boeing on Monday announced that Deborah C.
Hopkins has been named chief financial officer. Hopkins is, by far,
the most senior ranking woman ever at Boeing. She joins Boeing
after serving as vice president of finance and chief financial
officer for General Motors Europe, a $26 billion operating unit of
GM with headquarters in Switzerland. Industry analysts said the
hiring of hopkins signals that Boeing will be much more aggressive
in changing its 1950-style accouting practices. It was that
conservative approach that cost longtime CFO Boyd Givan his job.
Analysts had complained that Boyd provided them with no useful
information. Hopkins, 44, will begin her new duties at Boeing on
Dec. 14. Since the Sept. 1 ouster of former Boeing Chief Financial
Officer Boyd Givan, Boeing President and Chief Operating Officer
Harry Stonecipher has served as acting CFO.

LARGEST BAY STATE HMO TO LIMIT ELDERS' DRUG BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Monday dashed the hopes of
seniors for a one-year reprieve from soaring prescription drug
costs, saying it would not offer unlimited drug benefits to
thousands enrolled in its Medicare health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which drew scathing criticism from patient
advocates who say seniors will suffer from inadequate drug
coverage, means the 220,000 senior and disabled citizens enrolled
in all of the state's Medicare HMOs likely will face limited drug
benefits starting Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim, which said it could not afford to offer the
unlimited benefit, said it would try to ameliorate the impact on
seniors by setting up a program to help low-income seniors purchase
needed medicine. The HMO said it will release details of the
program in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The decision caps months of arduous negotiations by advocates,
politicians, and HMOs in the state to resolve a looming crisis for
seniors come Jan. 1, when the state's Medicare HMOs are planning to
cap the amount they will reimburse for drugs. The talks culminated
last week, when Tufts Health Plan, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Massachusetts, and Fallon Community Health Plan, together
representing nearly 60 percent of the Medicare HMO market, said
they would extend unlimited benefits for a year while policymakers
worked out a long-term solution, but only if Harvard Pilgrim also
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement likely means the HMOs will proceed with
their original plans to cap drug benefits. Fallon and Blue Cross
said they would also cap benefits. Tufts, which has historically
said it would not offer unlimited drug benefits without Harvard,
said it would make an announcement on its drug benefits Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The situation highlights an agonizing national debate over who
should pay for the soaring cost of medication. Medicare, the
federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, does
not cover most outpatient prescription drugs. But because
medications have become an increasingly important and expensive
component of health care, patient advocates have lobbied Congress
to pass legislation to require some level of drug coverage under
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts in 1994 became the first and only state in which
lawmakers tried to address the issue by forcing Medicare HMOs to
give seniors the option of buying a health plan with unlimited
prescription drug benefits. But HMOs challenged the state law in
federal court this year, saying federal laws specifically forbade
states from mandating Medicare benefits. Last month, a federal
judge sided with the HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally, Harvard Pilgrim is not obligated to'' provide drug
coverage, said Stuart Altman, professor of health policy at
Brandeis University. ``If I blame anybody, I would blame the
federal government. Medicare should cover drugs, but it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim, Massachusetts' largest HMO, cited financial
constraints in its decision to limit drug benefits for members of
First Seniority, its Medicare HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that, based on current federal reimbursement rates
and the financial realities facing Harvard Pilgrim, First Seniority
cannot afford to offer unlimited Medicare drug coverage in 1999,''
said a statement from Harvard Pilgrim. The HMO last week posted a
$22.2 million loss in the first three quarters of 1998. Ellen
Offner, Harvard Pilgrim's vice president for Medicare programs,
added, ``If we were making a healthy profit, it would be much more
likely that we would be able to subsidize First Seniority during
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   About 60,000 seniors belong to First Seniority. Harvard in
August said it would cap drug benefits at $200 per quarter. Blue
Cross, which has said it would cap its benefits at $300 per
quarter, is petitioning the federal government to allow it to
change that figure. A Blue Cross spokeswoman declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim's decision outraged senior advocates and
disappointed many policymakers who had hoped Harvard would agree to
a one-year delay, so that a permanent public policy solution could
be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they just hang up a big sign that says: sick people
go away,'' said Michael Miller of Health Care For All, a patient
advocate group that Monday called for HMOs to set up a program to
subsidize medicines for low-income seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to question whether they were more motivated by their
sense of community or by their financial agenda,'' said Rashi Fein,
professor of the economics of medicine &UR;  &LR; at Harvard Medical School.
``This is stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's regretable that Harvard Pilgrim has decided to balance
its budget on the backs of seniors,'' said Barbara Anthony, chief
of the public protection bureau at the state attorney general's
office. ``It's no wonder HMOs are getting a bad name, because they
truly are choosing profits over people. They deserve to be the
object of public disgust.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Mark Montigny, co-chairman of the legislative
health care committee, hinted that Harvard's move did not gain it
much good will among state lawmakers who now are contemplating laws
to regulate the managed care industry. ``We are in a critical
period of figuring just how far we should go to reform managed
care,'' he said. ``And I don't think this kind of decision is
helpful to Harvard or this industry.''

<P>
   I had never been on a cruise, so the idea of sailing the
Caribbean on the largest passenger ship in the world, the new
109,000-ton Grand Princess, seemed irresistible. My husband,
considerably less enchanted, voted to stay home. ``Wasn't Titanic
once the largest passenger ship in the world?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, in July I tried to book on the ship's first seven-day
Caribbean voyage in early October. The Grand Princess was sold out,
but for her cruise two weeks later, I could have a private portside
cabin with an obstructed view for $2,267.10, including round-trip
air fare from New York to Fort Lauderdale, Fla. I took it, and
giggled when the agent told me that I was No. 223 on the waiting
list for the second dinner seating. Welcome to life on the world's
biggest ship.
</P>
<P>
   The aptly named Grand, which made her debut last May in the
Mediterranean, is big in almost every way you can imagine, from her
951-foot length, the equivalent of almost three football fields, to
her 118-foot breadth, too wide to squeeze through the Panama Canal.
When the Grand Princess is filled, her 2,600 passengers and crew of
1,100 could qualify as a small town.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Grand's vastness is taken up by amenities the
Princess line claims no cruise ship has ever offered, including an
enormous 24-hour buffet, a wedding chapel, a virtual-reality arcade
and a digital photography studio, where you can have your picture
inserted, Zelig-style, next to John F. Kennedy or Elvis or on a
surf board atop a 20-foot wave.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there's just more of everything you'd expect _
three capacious dining rooms with assigned seating, two smaller
restaurants requiring reservations, 11 bars, five swimming pools,
nine hot tubs, three theaters, a sprawling casino, a library, a
gym, a spa and a glassed-in disco suspended like a gigantic space
capsule over the ship's rear deck. Even the classic teak deck that
rings the ship is so generous you need to circle it just over two
and a half times to walk a mile; on many ships, a mile is four
circuits, according to the cruise line.
</P>
<P>
   I was eager to sample the Grand because big boats seem destined
to be cruising's future. By this time next year, at least two
equally gigantic ships will sail, and more ultra-mega ships are
planned. The law of economics is partly responsible: It costs less
to accommodate 2,000 passengers on one colossus than to divide them
between more intimate vessels. Large ships can also provide lots of
things to do and see. But will you ever meet the captain?
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible not to gape as our bus from Fort
Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport pulled up alongside the
ship in Port Everglades. With endless rows of navy blue windows and
a hulking white frame, the Grand, built by Fincantieri, the Italian
shipbuilder, looked like a skyscraper on its side.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel loomed more than 12 stories above and dwarfed the
icily air-conditioned warehouse nearby where I checked in with
surprising speed and received a blue plastic ``cruise card.''
Emblazoned with an image of the Grand, the card doubled as a credit
card for shipboard purchases and a room key (``Stick it in the door
slot bow-side first,'' the clerk instructed). I was ready to board
in less than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The gangway opened onto an expansive three-story atrium that
looked like the glitzy lobby of an international chain hotel, with
pale maple-paneled walls, curving marble stairs, peach-colored club
chairs and two glass elevators. As a pianist at a white baby grand
played ``Wind Beneath My Wings,'' passengers milled about, most
casually dressed in shorts and many clutching maps. Crew members in
spotless whites offered directions by the elevators, but nearly
everyone I saw looked a little lost.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly felt lost. Although the layout is supremely logical,
it took almost the entire week for me to figure out where
everything was. ``There's just so much here,'' I overheard a
puzzled looking woman say.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I managed to find my cabin, E-629, without too much
difficulty. On the elevator, a woman's recorded voice silkily
announces each floor (I was on Emerald _ the 8th of 17 floors). And
though the well-lighted hallways that run the length of the ship
look like bowling alleys, each corridor is carpeted in a different
color (your map includes an illustration of the carpet in front of
your cabin).
</P>
<P>
   My luggage was waiting outside the door, and I had just begun to
unpack when it was time to sail. Consulting a map, I headed to a
huge open deck, where hundreds of people sipping drinks stood near
the varnished wood rails and lounged on merrily striped chaises by
an enormous pool. With a vigorous blast of the horn and
``Celebration,'' the old Kool and the Gang song, blaring from the
loudspeakers, the Grand Princess pulled away. On shore, several big
condos flashed their lights as we passed.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the cruise organizers showered us with shopping
tips and touring details for the three ports we'd visit _ St.
Thomas, St. Martin and Princess Cays on Eleuthera in the Bahamas.
But the ship was clearly the star attraction. Its decorators seemed
to have two main goals _ create distinctive High Nineties interiors
with a touch of camp and whimsy, and make barn-size spaces seem
cozy.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, they succeeded. Instead of the hard-edged
chrome and glass identified with cruise ships, there are acres of
light-colored woods, satin-finished brass and custom fabrics in
rich colors. The decks, pools and mosaic-sided hot tubs came in
classic cruise hues _ blues and whites. The custom carpets included
a jaunty jumble of sapphire and green planets in the futuristic
disco, and fanciful lions, leopards and monkeys in the Explorers
lounge, where the bartenders wear pith helmets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to minimize vast spaces were obvious in the dining
rooms, Da Vinci, Michelangelo and Botticelli. Da Vinci, where I had
snared a place at the second seating, held several hundred, but
multiple levels, small groupings of tables and discreet placement
of wood waiter stations, effectively divided up the room. Tiny
twinkle lights winked from the ceiling. And in case you forgot in
whose honor your dining room was named, you needed only to look at
the walls, which were adorned with enormous contemporary renderings
of Renaissance masterpieces, like Botticelli's ``Venus.''
</P>
<P>
   I liked my assigned dinner companions, seasoned cruisers who
seemed a microcosm of the passengers. They included a couple from
Memphis, with grown grandchildren (23rd cruise), a middle-age
couple from Rockland County, N.Y. (6th cruise), a couple in their
20s from San Francisco (2nd cruise) and a grandmother from Cape
Town, South Africa, who went dancing every night after dinner (10th
cruise). ``A cruise is supposed to be a little bit elegant,'' the
woman from Memphis observed, noting with approval that everyone we
could see wore evening clothes on the two formal dress nights.
</P>
<P>
   Like my dining companions, the ambitious cooking served at our
nightly six-course meals represented several generations' tastes.
Caviar, escargot, beef Wellington, king crab legs and lobster
shared the menu with vegetarian offerings (Moroccan vegetable
ragout, broiled eggplant with pistachio mint salsa) and low fat,
low cholesterol selections (mahi mahi with asparagus, fresh fruit
with Armagnac).
</P>
<P>
   The dinners reminded me of hotel banquets _ perfectly acceptable
but not memorable. But the desserts _ profiteroles drizzled with
chocolate, white chocolate mousse, cherries jubilee _ were divine.
I was pleased to see a poster announcing that the pastry chef was
employee of the month, though I'd also have nominated our waiter,
Pepe. When a woman at our table broke her glasses, he dashed to his
cabin and returned, a bit breathless, with a tube of Super Glue.
</P>
<P>
   Because the dinners were so rich, I was grateful for other
eating options. I visited the 24-hour buffet, which was embellished
with ice sculptures and carved fruit, whenever I wanted potato
salad, a late breakfast (great corned beef hash, so-so pancakes),
chocolate cake at midnight or a chance to eat alone and read.
Pizza, hot dogs and hamburgers were available at two poolside
stands all day. There were also two small specialty restaurants,
one Italian, one Southwestern, that everyone talked about.
Reservations cost $3.50 a person, and were so hard to get that I
never succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to spend my days at sea doing whatever I couldn't do at
home, and so did the other passengers. Sun-bathing was a high
priority for most, judging from the crowds around the pools, where
it was hard to find a free chaise. My favorite pool was in the
Conservatory, which had a retractable glass ceiling, potted palms,
mosaic pillars adorned with ceramic fish and live music from a
Caribbean steel band.
</P>
<P>
   But I wanted exercise and opted for the daily three-lap walk on
the breezy deck and a sprint up nine flights of stairs. My first
walk effectively chased away all twinges of cabin fever _ the air,
the teak below my feet, the view, even the ship's gentle rocking
were infectious. I did the Mile Walk daily, in part to earn enough
Cruise Coupons to get a free T-shirt. Coupons were given out after
the aerobics classes, too, which were basic but easily adaptable
for any fitness level. Below a 10-lap-to-the-mile track, the huge,
two-room gym was magnificent, with mirrors, marble and exercise
machines overlooking the water. The classes were full but not
crowded, though there was a sign-up sheet for the treadmills.
</P>
<P>
   I also took a free merengue lesson, had a rather perfunctory $50
pedicure in the spa, borrowed a Walter Mosely novel from the
library, watched the Flip, Flop and Fly contest (10 hefty
passengers trying to make the biggest splash in the pool) and
caught parts of recent movies like ``The Truman Show'' in the
Princess Theater. Most nights before dinner, I curled on a leather
sofa at the Wheelock Bar to hear John de Haas, a cabaret pianist,
play his own intriguing New Age compositions, as well as show
tunes.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, there were at least three entertaining, if very
mainstream, shows _ Broadway revues with singers and dancers, and
variety shows with comedians, magicians and acrobats. If one
theater was full, I'd visit another. A sweet surprise was that I
rarely stood in line for anything.
</P>
<P>
   The other surprise, considerably less sweet, was shipboard fees.
Coffee, tea, iced tea and water were free, but there was a fee, and
a 15 percent service charge, for all other beverages, even soft
drinks at dinner. Those $1.50 fruit punches, $2.50 Haagen-Dazs milk
shakes and $3 drinks of the day (margaritas, rum punches and a
weird Kah-lua-and-banana concoction) added up. So did tours of the
ports _ for $22, I had an enjoyable bus tour of St. Martin _as well
as visits to the Virtual Reality arcade, digital photo studio and
putting green. I paid $47.50 for a five-minute call to New York; at
least the connection was excellent.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't spend a lot of time in my cabin because the rest of the
ship was more interesting. Though more than 700 of the ship's 1,300
cabins have balconies, mine didn't; instead, a large orange and
white life boat was parked outside my window, obstructing the view,
as I had been warned. My crisp blue and white room was comfortable
_ for one person, at least _ and I liked the huge mirror framed in
the same pale stripe fabric as the curtains. The room opened onto a
compact dressing area with narrow floor-to-ceiling shelves and an
open closet with removable wood hangers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there was no place to store a large suitcase. The
tiny bathroom consisted of a stall shower, toilet and sink. (Larger
cabins had bathtubs with showers.)
</P>
<P>
   Handsome wood moldings softened the room's sharp edges and
accented the night stands and desk. A built-in corner cabinet hid
the mini-fridge and had shelves for glasses and a television, which
received two 24-hour movie channels, among others. Two twin beds
were pushed together to form a queen on the opposite wall, where
bedside panels controlled the lights.
</P>
<P>
   The service was excellent. The extra blanket I requested arrived
promptly, fresh towels appeared twice a day, and though I twice
forgot to hang my breakfast request on the front door at bedtime,
my coffee, cranberry juice and three little raisin danish arrived
shortly after I put out the card.
</P>
<P>
   I had worried about getting seasick, but our cruise was
remarkably calm, due in large part to the ship's stabilizers. I was
shocked to discover just how turbulent the water really was the day
we took tenders to St. Martin and I almost fell out. Back on the
ship, however, everything was smooth, with just a slight sway that
was alternately unnerving and soothing, even while moving at 22
knots _ faster than most cruise ships, the line says. I also
relished the special moments that came without warning, like the
night I saw a silvery sliver of moon from the deck or the
dramatically blustery day I watched the sky turn inky blue at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the trip, I'd even found several quiet places to
curl up with a book and forget that 2,599 other passengers were on
board. My favorite was the disco on the top floor, a fantasy room
where Star Wars meets the Starlite Lounge that you'd find only on a
cruise ship. I liked the teal club chairs sprinkled with silver
stars. And I loved the view of the foamy turquoise stripe the ship
left behind as it sailed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, I liked the fact that the ship's noisiest spot by
night was one of the quietest by day. A big impersonal ship could,
in fact, be homey. By the end of the cruise, I had even begun to
see passengers I recognized. But I never did meet the captain.
</P>
<P>
   $2,267, plus Cokes
</P>
<P>
   Though many people book cruises through travel agents, I called
the Princess Cruise Line directly to book my cruise at (800)
774-6237. My $2,267.10 fare for the seven-day cruise in October
included an outside cabin for one, round-trip air fare from New
York to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., port fees and cancellation
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   There is a charge for any extras like soft drinks, alcoholic
drinks or ice cream outside of meals. I spent an additional $208.15
on these and such activities as a tour of St. Martin ($22), a
pedicure ($57.50) and an international phone call ($47.50).
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Princess sails the Caribbean until she crosses the
Atlantic May 23, then cruises the Mediterranean starting June 7.

CULTURE NOTES: LIFE OF EDITH WHARTON; A NIGHTCLUB'S LAST DAYS;
DRAMAS FROM BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Do you yearn for the old New York _ the New York of
genteel society, fine manners and repressed emotions? In other
words, the New York of Edith Wharton?
</P>
<P>
   That New York will be brought to life once again in ``The Life
and Loves of Edith Wharton,'' starring Gayle Hunnicutt and Frank
Barrie, on Friday night at 8 in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   In this dramatic interpretation of Wharton's life, scenes from
``The Age of Innocence,'' ``The Custom of the Country'' and ``The
House of Mirth'' will illuminate the parallels between her emotions
and her heroines'.
</P>
<P>
   Using her own words, the show, written by Barrie and Katrina
Hendrey, draws on Wharton's autobiography, secret diary and
unpublished letters to describe her disastrous marriage, her
intimate friendship with Henry James, her enigmatic relationship
with the lawyer Walter Berry and her tempestuous affair with the
bisexual journalist Morton Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   Swan Songs
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The days dwindle to a precious few. On Dec. 19,
Rainbow and Stars, on the 65th floor of Rockefeller Center, will
join the Persian Room, El Morocco, La Maisonette and the Stork Club
among elegant night spots that exist only in memory. But before it
vanishes under new ownership, Rainbow and Stars is going out with a
song in its sophisticated heart.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night Karen Akers, the quintessential chanteuse who
has been among Rainbow and Stars' most popular performers, opens an
engagement through Dec. 5. She'll be followed by Darlene Love from
Dec. 8 to 12 and Lou Rawls from Dec. 15 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   Imported Goods
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Theater will flower at the Brooklyn Academy of Music
in January when its spring season begins with notable imports from
Britain, including two Racine tragedies starring Diana Rigg and
Toby Stephens from the acclaimed Almeida Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Not content with its coup of ``Phedre,'' and ``Britannicus,''
running for a total of 14 performances from Jan. 5 to 17, the
academy will also present 24 performances of Caryl Churchill's
``Blue Heart'' between Jan. 29 and Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   This Out of Joint production, first staged at the Royal Court
Theater, comprises two one-act plays: ``Heart's Desire'' about a
daughter returning to her family after years abroad, and ``Blue
Kettle,'' about a man who cons a series of women into believing he
is the son they surrendered for adoption. On Saturdays,
``Britannicus,'' adapted by Robert David MacDonald, and ``Phedre,''
adapted by Ted Hughes, will be performed in the afternoons and
evenings, respectively.

PRIVILEGES THAT COME WITH AGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people of a certain age know about the air fare discounts
we fall heir to when we pass 62. But now, like almost everything
else available to the increasing older population, the small type,
while surely getting smaller, is also growing longer, and the
asterisks are proliferating. More than that, airline programs are
much less alike than they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when this column last examined senior benefits, all the
airlines offered 10 percent discounts for any published fare _
which they still do _ plus senior books with coupons to be used in
lieu of a ticket. Prices and conditions were much the same. Now
there are four airline ``clubs'' with other sorts of offers, and
the coupon books cost more and have new rules and wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   If you use different airlines, you might as well settle for the
10 percent discount, enhancing it by using promotional fares
requiring purchase far in advance. If you are flexible about days
of travel, travel agents can maximize this advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what's available in senior airline discounts now. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Either Join a Club ... &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four airlines have programs _ ``clubs'' _ for seniors that
involve paying to join: United, which has just revised its club
fare system; Continental; Delta, and American, which is not open to
membership now but is expected to reopen in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   United's program is called Silver Wings Plus and is open to
people aged 55 and over who belong to the airline's frequent-flier
plan. A lifetime Silver Wings membership costs $225; a two-year
membership $75. The basic benefit is a set of four certificates
that permit purchase of four reduced-fare round-trip tickets, all
for the member or two for the member and two for a traveling
companion of any age.
</P>
<P>
   Until last Sunday, these fares were based on a zone chart. The
new system uses mileage and the day of the week to set the fare.
The least fare, for a round trip totaling 500 miles, is $98 from
Monday to Thursday, $118 Friday to Sunday, airport charges and
departure taxes not included. A 6,000- to 7,000-mile round trip,
for example, from Colorado Springs to Honolulu, has prices of $598
and $618. The recent lowest fares on this route, with the 10
percent senior discount, were $683 and $751.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets must be bought 14 days in advance and there are
length-of-stay requirements and blackout dates. These memberships
come with other discounts and coupons for travel, hotels and
cruises. Members may buy four additional certificates for $25.
United Silver Wings Plus: (800) 720-1765 or
www.silverwingsplus.com.
</P>
<P>
   Continental's program, Freedom Flight Club, has the virtue of
avoiding asterisks on its offers other than those that exist for
the basic ticket. People 62 and over who join get 15 percent or 20
percent off any fare the airline offers, first class included, with
no blackout dates.
</P>
<P>
   A membership for domestic travel costs $75 a year; for travel
outside the United States, $125. For travel in the United States,
to Mexico, Central and South America, Canada and the Caribbean, the
discount is 20 percent on Monday to Thursday and on Saturday; 15
percent on Friday and Sunday. For tickets to Europe, the 15 percent
applies on Friday, Saturday and Sunday; 20 percent Monday to
Thursday. This plan does not accommodate a companion. Continental
Freedom Flight Club: (800) 441-1135 or www.flycontinental.com.
</P>
<P>
   Delta uses the zone system for its Skywise Program. This also
covers both first-class and coach tickets. The cheapest coach
ticket, $118 round trip _ none of these fares include airport
charges and segment fees _ would provide a trip from one place to
another in the Southeast: North and South Carolina, Tennessee,
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   From the Northeast to California, the round-trip fare would be
$298; to Hawaii or Alaska, $658. Annual membership is $40, but
Delta, like American, closes membership at an undisclosed level. It
is open now.

A THOUSAND PICTURES PAINT 1 WORD: BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The other day, my wife told me we needed to buy
another photo album.
</P>
<P>
   She was putting more pictures of our baby in the last few pages
of the current album when she said this. Status of camera at the
time: 16 pictures of a 36-exposure roll taken. Quick visual check
of room: every frame filled. This was just before Halloween, so
more baby photos were definitely on the way.
</P>
<P>
   She was right. We needed another album to continue the ongoing
documentation of our daughter's life.
</P>
<P>
   She's 4 months old.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, we will have to add rooms onto our home by her
10th birthday just to house all the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong, our baby is adorable _ but at this point,
that's about all she is, photographically speaking. Not a lot of
potential for action shots at this point, I'm afraid. Unless
capturing her uncanny ability to stick a stray foot with a clean
sock on it right into the middle of a disgustingly dirty diaper
qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   Like many excited first-time parents, we have been photographing
our child since, literally, the day she was born. Actually,
printouts of ultrasound exams are tucked away somewhere as
keepsakes, so I guess you could say we've been documenting her
since before she was born.
</P>
<P>
   (Imagine sitting around with grandchildren and saying, ``See
that blob that looks like a snail? That's Mommy's eye!''
``Aiyeee!'') &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Strike a pose
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, in almost every picture, the baby is . . . sitting
there. Sometimes she's sitting on someone's lap, sometimes in her
swing, sometimes in her little chair. Occasionally, to really spice
things up, we'll take one of her lying down.
</P>
<P>
   We're quite pleased with her development, but frankly, just
sitting around is pretty much all she does right now. True, in the
last month or so, she has started to smile and giggle. But every
time we point a camera at her, she has the tendency to quickly
shift from a cackling cherub into her best Buster Keaton imitation.
</P>
<P>
   You often hear people with large families say the first child
gets photographed as much as Jack Nicholson on Oscar night, the
second child drops down to Martin Lawrence-at-the-Emmys status, and
after that, the kids may as well be born into the federal
witness-protection program.
</P>
<P>
   Parents get too busy, they say. The thrill and uniqueness of the
first-born child is gone (hey wait, I'm the fifth of five kids _
this explains a lot).
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense. That's not what happens. After the first kid, they've
just exhausted their film budget.
</P>
<P>
   In a new twist, my mother-in-law bought us a video camera. (I'm
glad she waited till after the birth. We didn't need to immortalize
(begin ital) that. (end ital) I'm convinced the only way women ever
give birth to a second child is by blocking out the gory details of
the first. A videotape of the event wouldn't help.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lights, camera . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was thrilled, certain that I was an auteur at heart, merely
lacking the proper tools. The videos _ excuse me, the (begin ital)
films (end ital) _ I would make of my daughter's early life would
bring even the most cynical viewer to tears.
</P>
<P>
   Before I could start polishing my Oscar speech, I began filming
and realized I had a small problem: These would not just be still
pictures of the baby sitting there. These would be (begin ital)
moving (end ital) pictures of the baby sitting there.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, I've been trying mightily to fill a 2-hour tape to
send to my mother-in-law. After capturing a bath and some rolling
over, I moved on to things like the dogs napping on the kitchen
floor, for filler. I spoke to my mother-in-law and explained the
predicament: If it all looks the same, it's going to be boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not boring to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, that's true. She doesn't see this stuff every day. It's
like that wretched campaign NBC used to use to flog reruns: If you
haven't seen it, it's new to you.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the baby will start to crawl. I'll have to load in some
multimedia equipment for that. &QL;

   Each member 62 or over may enroll up to three companions of any
age for $25 each. Saturday night stays are required, with a maximum
stay of 30 days and no blackout dates. Skywise does not apply on
Delta Express or the Delta Shuttle. Delta Skywise: (800) 325-3750
or www.delta-air.com/skywise.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines calls its 62-and-over program the AActive
American Traveler Club. This year, it accepted members from June 1
to the end of October. Its fares, both domestic and international,
are based on the zone system, starting at $98 for short hops Monday
to Thursday, and $20 more each way for Friday, Saturday or Sunday
travel.
</P>
<P>
   Membership was $40 for the person over 62, or $70 for the senior
and a companion of any age. Membership will open again sometime in
the spring; names are taken for a waiting list. American Airlines

   ... Or Buy a Coupon Book &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The seven major airlines all sell senior coupons in books of
four to those over 62, each valid for a year for a one-way trip in
the lower 48 states, and sometimes farther afield. For confirmed
seats, reservations must be made 14 days in advance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coupon books are worth having in two circumstances, even if the
prices do not beat every promotional fare. One case is when a
senior makes an annual trip to someplace warm, for example, and
does not plan to return for a few months. Some deep-discount
tickets have a 30-day limit for the return trip. But coupons can be
used one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The second circumstance is an emergency, when the traveler can
take a coupon to the airport and stand by for a seat. Jens Jurgen
of the Travel Companion Exchange in Amityville, N.Y., says this
enabled him to see a sick daughter when a last-minute ticket would
have been prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines' Northbest book of four coupons costs $540.
They are valid in all 50 states and to and from Canada, with two or
three coupons required for greater distances. (800) 692-6961 or
www.nwa.com.
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines' Senior Travel Pak costs $548 for four,
$1,032 for eight, and covers the lower 48 states; Hawaii; San Juan,
P.R.; Montego Bay, Jamaica; Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, and
Toronto. A pack for a companion of any age costs $648 for four,
$1,132 for eight. (800) 221-2000 or www.twa.com.
</P>

   American Airlines' coupons cost $596 for four; the lower 48
states and Hawaii are covered. (800) 237-7981.

<P>
   US Airways' book of four coupons costs $579. The holder of these
coupons may also use them to take along up to two grandchildren
aged 2 through 11. (800) 428-4322.
</P>
<P>
   Continental sells its four-coupon book for $579, books of eight
for $1,079. These cover the lower 48 states, Canada, Mexico and
Caribbean. Alaska and Hawaii require two coupons each way. (800)
441-1135.

NEELY, IN PAIN, DROPS COMEBACK BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Cam Neely's comeback attempt is over.
</P>
<P>
   The writing was on the wall Saturday morning. While a few of the
Bruins were participating in the optional skate before facing the
Dallas Stars that night, Neely was on the ice, too, but something
was clearly off.
</P>
<P>
   Neely, attempting a comeback after two years of retirement and
nearly three years out of the lineup, looked uncomfortable and
unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   After that skate, Neely continued his attitude of cautious
optimism, but despite his efforts to remain upbeat, it was clear
his hip was hindering his efforts to resume his career. Monday,
late in the afternoon, the club made his decision official.
Everyone knew it was going to be a long shot for him to make it
back. Now he no longer has any shot.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, coach Pat Burns said Neely clearly had been struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Neely skated last Wednesday and Thursday, took Friday off, and
skated for a briefer time Saturday. He took Sunday off and skated
for an equally brief time Monday. He said he wanted a few hours to
see if the pain would subside. It didn't, so he called it quits
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday was a day that took a little longer to warm up out
there and (the same with) today, and that's after having Friday and
Sunday off,'' said Neely. ``That's an indication that it's not
progressing the way I would like.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns could see it as clearly as Neely could feel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult, it's very difficult for him,'' said Burns.
``He feels it. It's all up to him when he decides to raise the flag
or not. I've left it entirely up to him. His body knows. I told him
we just have to continue practicing the way we do and he has to try
to keep up. We can't change our format of practices for him. He
knows that and understands that, and we're just leaving it up to
him right now, but you can see that it's becoming ... it's
difficult for him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Neely first entertained thoughts of a return, he said it
was partly because he hadn't gone out on his own terms. He'd been
forced to retire because of a chronic hip injury. There was no
closure for him. He began working out in an effort to feel better
in normal life so he could run and play with his children and at
33, he was hoping to put off the necessity of a hip replacement for
as long as possible, if not forever. He felt well enough to try a
return to the NHL, but the reality is that he was too far removed
from it for it to be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was given this opportunity to try to see if I could play
again and it was something I didn't want to pass up,'' said Neely.
``I didn't want to be kicking myself in the butt down the road. I
know how I'm feeling now, I know how I felt (Sunday), and I know
how I don't want to feel. I'm young and I don't want to be
struggling at 45 to get around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would absolutely love to play again, that's why I'm out
here. But it's not easy and it's not pain free. Even the process of
getting to this point has been a lot of hard work and a lot of
pain, but it's not something I'm not used to. It would be a thrill
to be able to play again, but I want to play at a certain level. I
don't just want to be out there taking a shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely said he didn't want to chance having the hip deteriorate
to the point he feels the same constant pain he felt when he
retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want it to get to that level,'' he said. ``I don't
want to feel better so I can feel worse again. I felt good when I
was skating with (assistant coach Jacques Laperriere) but alone
with an assistant isn't what I need to do. It might look like I'm
doing all right, but I know how I'm feeling out there.''
</P>
<P>
   As badly as Burns would like to have Neely back, he said he was
never optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for somebody to stop playing that long
and, especially due to the injuries he did have, to be able to come
back,'' said Burns. ``I wasn't optimistic, but I was sure hoping. I
was sure praying it would be possible because I'd love to have Cam
in the lineup, but it all depends on how his body will respond.
He's a great professional and I know he feels he wouldn't want to
embarrass himself, either, and I think that's the most important
thing for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say (his on-ice workouts) have gotten worse.
They've gotten shorter for him. He hasn't been able to sustain the
whole 60 minutes of practice but that's understandable, too,
because of his physical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   With the bleak picture in Boston these days _ Mo Vaughn leaving
the Red Sox, the Patriots struggling, no NBA _ the Neely comeback
story was big. But Neely never made the mistake of getting his
hopes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how I've felt the last couple of days,'' he said. ``As
I've kept going with this, I've noticed the pain kind of lingers
longer than I'd like and it's something I needed to find out. I
wanted to make sure I'm giving it the proper effort I need and
skating like this, at an NHL level, is what I need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As realistic as Neely and Burns have been, the other Bruins
allowed themselves a little bit of daydreaming regarding how much
better they'd be with a healthy Neely in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day out I was pretty excited,'' said forward Steve
Heinze. ``The first day he looked pretty good, he was really laying
into some shots. It's very disapointing but as long as there is
some finalization in it, I think it's going to ease his mind that
he gave it a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze said he can relate on some level because he missed more
than half a season a few years ago because of knee and abdominal
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long, hard road,'' said Heinze. ``Even being healthy
and just sitting around and not working out and letting muscles
atrophy, never mind having an injury on top of that. It's tough to
get that back, especially if you're past your prime, not in your
mid-20s when it's easier to bounce back. A layoff that long without
an injury would be hard enough. To think about coming back is a
credit to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque, who played with Neely and Gord Kluzak, said he has
seen how difficult it is when a player's career is shortened by
injuries. He watched as Neely went through years of rehabilitation
on his balky left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cam, I saw him go through three or four years of just
unbelievable work before and after games and practices,'' said
Bourque. ``It was such dedication just to allow him to go out there
and play the game he loved to play. To have his career shortened
because of injuries ... at the end it was the hip. All that
dedication and hard work was over his knee. To have the hip kind of
creep up on him and end it for him, that's devastating for somebody
to go out that way.''

PRESS IN SOUTH AFRICA TO BE INVESTIGATED FOR RACISM
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Sending a shiver through many of
South Africa's newsrooms, the country's Human Rights Commission
said Monday that it would open an investigation into racism in the
press and that it would use its powers of subpoena and arrest if
need be.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the commission, Barney Pityana, said he hoped
that the inquiry would ``generate debate and dialogue'' among South
Africans about the nature, meaning and incidence of racism in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism is endemic in South African society,'' Pityana said.
``There is no reason to believe that the media are somehow
insulated.''
</P>
<P>
   But some editors warned that the inquiry was a carefully timed
attempt to keep news organizations from criticizing President
Nelson Mandela's government on the eve of national elections next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela and his deputy and likely successor, Thabo Mbeki, have
repeatedly complained about the press, saying that the government's
accomplishments get little attention while the country's problems
are the subject of every headline.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the tension between the government and news
organizations has often been severe. In a key speech last year,
Mandela lashed out, saying the press exploited ``the dominant
position it achieved as a result of the apartheid system, to
campaign against both real change and the real agent of change, as
represented by our movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Some journalists said the commission's investigation was meant
to harass those who covered news that put the government in a bad
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is _ is a kind of racial McCarthyism,'' said Philip
van Niekerk, editor of the weekly Mail and Guardian, which has
often written about corruption in government. ``They are putting
the media on the defensive just as the election campaign gets under
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission said it began looking at the issue because of a
request made by the Black Lawyers Association and the Association
of Black Accountants for bias inquiries into two papers, including
van Niekerk's Mail and Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   The groups pointed out that The Mail and Guardian had written 14
times about allegedly corrupt blacks but only four times about
whites.
</P>
<P>
   The commission then said it had decided that the issue of
journalistic racism was not confined to just two newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Pityana dismissed any suggestion that the commission was acting
in the government's interest. He said he believed news
organizations would benefit from closer scrutiny so they could
``sharpen their capacity to be responsive to the needs of the
people and reflect the true nature of South African society.''
</P>
<P>
   Under apartheid all of the large news organizations were
white-owned, but in recent years, with the breakup of South
Africa's huge corporations, blacks have been able to buy large
stakes in the press. The racial composition in newsrooms has been
gradually changing, as it has in other industries. But most of the
editors of large newspapers are white. Still, the outlets that
reach the most South Africans are the government-owned radio and
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Pityana said the commissioners would study the issue and
announce the details in January. But exactly how they intend to
conduct the inquiry is unclear. He said he did not know whether
they would examine racism in all aspects of the business, to
include hiring practices, for example, as well as editorial
content. Nor had the commission decided yet whether it would look
at radio, television and print or just a particular portion of the
news business.
</P>
<P>
   Pityana said that he hoped his group would be able to do its
work with journalists' cooperation. The commission, while it can
use subpoena and arrest to compel witnesses to testify, does not
have the power to punish. But it can make recommendations to
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission wishes to place on record that it is mindful of
the implications of this exercise for press freedom,'' he said.
``We believe, however, that the best guarantor of press freedom is
a society that respects human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Moloi, president of the lawyers association, said he was
pleased that the commission would cast its net wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newspapers are demoralizing blacks,'' he said, adding:
``If whites have done something, it's just reported. But if a black
has done something they tell you on and on.'' He cited ``things
that are not even newsworthy but meant to denigrate us.''
</P>
<P>
   Free-speech advocates said they would be watching the commission
closely. Laura Pollecutt of the nonprofit Freedom of Expression
Institute said she hoped it would restrict its work to ``a very
scientific look at the content of the news.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Louw, editor of the weekly newsletter Southern Africa
Report, said the commission's decision was reminiscent of attempts
by the Afrikaner-oriented apartheid government, when it first came
to power, to investigate the English press for its ``lack of
patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   Louw expressed concern about the inquiry's timing. ``To operate
in the first half of the year right over the election period means
that we are going to have every politician who is criticized
screaming, `Ah, it's not true, it's just racism.'''

   &UR; Hearth Dining in New York &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am going to be in New York City during the Christmas season
and would like to have dinner in a nice restaurant that has an
operating fireplace. Any suggestions? _ Philip Alspach, Irvine,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are at least a half-dozen restaurants in Manhattan that
have both working fireplaces and two-star ratings from The New York
Times. Ruth Reichl, who awards those stars, and Eric Asimov, who
writes the $25 and Under dining column, suggested three between
them.
</P>
<P>
   Savoy, in SoHo at 70 Prince Street, has a practical fireplace:
it is used for cooking. It is in the chef's dining room, upstairs,
where a four-course dinner with at least one hearth-cooked dish _
recent examples include roasted capon and an organic veal chop _ is
offered for $52.
</P>
<P>
   There are also two conventional fireplaces, one in the lounge
and one in the ground-floor dining room. A three-course meal for
two, with a modest wine, costs about $110. Savoy serves dinner
daily and lunch (downstairs only) every day but Sunday. For
reservations, call (212) 219-8570.
</P>
<P>
   The reviewers also agreed on Chelsea Bistro and Bar, at 358 West
23d Street. This three-year-old restaurant has cozy banquettes,
brass rails, mirrors and a fireplace that is its centerpiece and
that is decorated seasonally (yes, stockings and garland for
Christmastime).
</P>
<P>
   It serves solid bourgeois French food, like a cassoulet of
snails, and a signature entree of hanger steak with dense red-wine
sauce. The wine list includes an extensive selection of half
bottles. Dinner for two with wine is about $85 and up. Chelsea
Bistro serves dinner only; (212) 727-2026.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reichl also mentioned Christer's, a Scandinavian restaurant
at 145 West 55th Street. The fireplace is in the middle of three
rooms, giving the place the feel of a rustic lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Christer Larsson, the chef and owner, specializes in seafood,
especially salmon in several forms: from baked on an oak board to
smoked with an accompaniment of black beans, corn avocado and
tomatillo salsa. A smorgasbord plate (not a buffet) can include
fricadelles, traditional meatballs of veal.
</P>
<P>
   There are pre-theater dinners of two courses for $29 and three
for $36, without drinks, and a three-course a la carte dinner for
two, with wine, can run $100 and up. Dinner is served six days and
lunch Monday to Friday. Closed Sunday; (212) 974-7224.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New Year's in Lisbon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I will be in Lisbon Dec. 30 to Jan. 1, after a
week of hiking near Sintra. Do you have any suggestions for making
this a special holiday celebration? _ R. Borgia, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. In Portugal, New Year's is celebrated not unlike the way it
is in the United States _ with private parties and festivities in
restaurants and hotels _ according to Evelyn Heyward, a spokeswoman
for the Portuguese National Tourist Office. And, not unlike some
American ``first night'' celebrations, there will be a big public
party in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lisbon city government is giving it at Terreiro do Paco, a
park in the city center on the Tagus River, near the government
offices and the ferry terminal. Scheduled for 10 o'clock New Year's
Eve till about 2 or 3 a.m., the event will feature fireworks around
midnight, and music by six Portuguese bands and a Cuban band, Ms.
Heyward said.
</P>
<P>
   In the two days before the party, she suggested, you might tour
the Alfama, the old Moorish section, with its cobblestone streets
and houses dating back to the 15th and 16th centuries. If you
appreciate art, visit the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, 45 Avenida da
Berna, in the Saldanha district, for its eclectic holdings,
including Lalique jewelry and European art that includes two
Rembrandts. Admission is about $3, and it is open 10 a.m. to 5
p.m., except on Monday and holidays.
</P>
<P>
   To see what's new in Lisbon, head for the Oceanarium, built for
Expo '98, which just ended. This innovative aquarium features
curved panels that give visitors a sense of being inside the main
tank. It is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and admission costs about
$8.75. For night life, Doca de Santos, on the river in the
Alcantara district, is newly revitalized with restaurants, cafes
and discos.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, including details about the Lisbon Tourist
Card, which provides free transportation and museum entrances,
contact the Portuguese National Tourist Office, at 590 Fifth Ave.,
New York, N.Y. 10036; (800) 767-8842 or (212) 354-4403.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Short Mississippi Cruises  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to take a short trip on the Mississippi _ a day
or one night. Are there any like this, perhaps leaving from
Natchez, Miss.? _ Diane Day, Los Altos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. While some of the longer excursions on Mark Twain's favorite
river stop at Natchez, there are no tours based there. And most
Mississippi cruises shorter than three days last less than three
hours.
</P>
<P>
   For a daylong cruise of the Lower Mississippi, you may have to
go 260 miles upriver from Natchez, to Memphis, where the Memphis
Queen Co. runs such a trip a few times a year. The dates are not
set for next year, but one usually sails on Memorial Day, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise, either on the Island Queen, a paddlewheeler, or the
Showboat, a barge, leaves Memphis at 9 a.m. and heads 72 miles
downriver to Helena, Ark. The $85 fare includes breakfast and lunch
buffets, sometimes _ if the captain is in a Huck Finn mood _ a stop
on a sandbar, and a tour of the Delta Cultural Center in Helena.
Passengers return to Memphis by bus, about 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   From March to November, the company offers daily
one-and-a-half-hour sightseeing cruises, ($11) and at least two
two-hour dinner cruises a week, ($35, plus tax and tips). Call
(800) 221-6197 for more details.
</P>
<P>
   In Vicksburg, Miss., Mississippi River Adventures, offers
90-minute river history excursions aboard Waves of Glory, a
45-passenger hydrojet boat. These sail three times a day March 1 to
Nov. 15, and cost $17, $8 for children 6 to 12; (800) 521-4363.

 &HT;    Commentary: Americans speak through votes
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What a wondrous impact America's voters have had on
this week's news.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this month's election had any effect on the rioting in
Indonesia or made the shaky standdown with Saddam Hussein any less
tenuous. The White House scandal drags on, with Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr inicting Webster Hubbell yet again and sending up a
fresh batch of information pertaining to Kathleen Willey, in
advance of his testimony this week before the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the context around these events has been changed entirely by
the voters' will, and the timing of other events has been mightily
affected by it.
</P>
<P>
   It may have taken some additional prompting from the 8th Circuit
Court of Appeals, which would have heard a reopened Paula Jones
case, to finally bring Bill Clinton to the table last week. The
election played a more fundamental role, however, affording the
president the political cover to at last get the case behind him,
and convincing Jones's lawyers that a prolonged battle would be
useless.
</P>
<P>
   The election results had a less obvious but no less decisive
role in the tobacco industry's move to settle its case last week.
After a year in which it had largely beaten back the Federal Drug
Administration and the state attorney generals, the industry looked
at a series of reversals capped by the defeat of North Carolina
Sen. Lauch Faircloth, and expeditiously took its best shot at a
soft deal.
</P>
<P>
   The election of a few more Democratic House members hasn't
changed the balance of power, but when the Republicans hold their
caucus this week, Bob Livingston will be chosen House speaker
rather than Newt Gingrich. At that point the impact become
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   In a different political context, Starr's recent moves might
seem more coherent. At this point, a couple more boxes of evidence
that doesn't constitute an impeachable offense is the last thing
the new Republican leaders _ whoever they all turn out to be _ will
be looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Or the next to last thing. Starr's third indictment of Hubbell,
with its frequent mention of an unidentified ``billing partner,''
at the Rose law firm, is being interpreted as an attempt to get at
Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That is so confounding it bears repeating: Just a few days
before he gets his one shot at establishing grounds for impeachment
based largely on the president's lies about cheating on his wife,
the special prosecutor opened a new line of legal attack against
the First Lady. Was this election really such a surprise?
</P>
<P>
   It's dangerous to try to fit a simple interpretation on an
election involving hundreds of races around the nation in a
non-presidential year. Yet it's difficult to think how turbulent
this week might have been, both internationally and in Washington,
and not conclude that the elections this year have had a
stabilizing effect on events.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies democracy's special wonder. The voters did not
absolve Clinton or remove his administration from danger, and they
have probably created more questions for Congress to grapple with
than they answered.
</P>
<P>
   But in the accumulated gravity of votes cast, one by one, the
electorate demonstrated again that it moves more slowly to judgment
and acts more decisively than the leaders it chooses, and that it
intends to outlast all of them. With the subtle effect of that
realization, everyone _ possibly excepting the independent counsel
_ seems calmer than they would have been.

 &HT;    Tobacco settlement could give Georgia more than expectedBy Peter
Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ State Attorney General Thurbert Baker reacted
positively Monday to a proposed national tobacco settlement that
would pay Georgia $4.6 billion over 25 years, but public health
advocates worry the public won't have enough time to evaluate the
details of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Baker has one week to decide whether to accept the deal or
reject it and pursue the state's pending liability suit against the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression at first blush is the proposal gives us a lot
more than we could recover in (the state's lawsuit),'' Baker said.
``Georgia's allotment would be the ninth highest in the country _
$4.6 billion _ and we (sued) for $2.78 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a Fulton County jury could award the state more than
$8 billion because its suit was filed under the state's
racketeering law, which allows for triple damages. But Baker said
pursuit of such a figure would be speculative.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says it needs a ``critical mass'' of states _
perhaps 40 of the 46 eligible _ to accept its settlement offer
before it will go forward. That's one reason the industry has
required the states to decide quickly on whether they want to
participate or not, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   If Georgia and the industry agree, the state would receive
annual payments of $150-$200 million most years through 2024.
</P>
<P>
   Governor-elect Roy Barnes said the money should be used for
``health-related purposes,'' such as reimbursement of Medicaid,
programs to prevent youth smoking and funding for rural hospitals.
He said he wouldn't support bids to use the money for
non-health-projects or tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he wanted to discuss the details of the settlement
offer with Baker, who will make the final call after weighing the
benefits of the offer with the potential benefits of the state's
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   If Georgia accepts the settlement, the state could expect to
receive $58.9 million for 1998 , nothing in 1999, and $157.3
million in the year 2000. The money would flow to the state's
general fund, and the General Assembly would decide how to spend
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil is definitely going to be in the details,'' said
Andy Lord, chairman of CHARGe, a coalition of public health
organizations such as American Cancer Society that want a say in
how settlement money would be spent. ``It needs legal analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement will have a profound long-term effect on
public health in Georgia,'' Lord added. ``Five days is simply an
unreasonable amount of time to review it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said several important provisions in the offered
settlement would not be available to the state through its
litigation, which was filed August 1997 in Fulton County Superior
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bans on cartoon advertising and brand sponsorships are
things we could not reach under our litigation,'' Baker said.

 &HT;    Satellites in harm's way as debris from comet passes byBy Mike
Toner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millions of minuscule meteorites will pepper the Earth's upper
atmosphere today as the planet makes its annual run through a
gantlet of cosmic buckshot. With the intensity of the Leonid meteor
shower expected to be the heaviest in 33 years, satellite
operators, paging systems, television networks and even the
Pentagon are on high alert.
</P>
<P>
   The annual crossing of the debris stream of the Comet
Tempel-Tuttle poses no physical danger to anyone on the surface of
the Earth. But when the Earth crosses the densest portion of the
stream sometime around 2:34 p.m., no one will be surprised if at
least one or two of the 600 satellites circling the globe becomes a
casualty.
</P>
<P>
   At closing speeds of 155,000 miles an hour, even flea-sized
particles of comet dust pack the power of .22 caliber bullets. Even
a dust speck is highly charged enough to fry satellite circuits
that provide space-age society with everything from wakeup calls to
the nightly weather report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the probability of being hit is very remote,'' said
Susan Gorson, a spokeswoman for Intelsat, which operates an
international network of 25 satellites. Even so, Intelsat and other
commercial satellite operators plan to orient their satellites in
space so they will present the smallest target.
</P>
<P>
   Most predictions vary from 200 to 5,000 meteors an hour. If the
forecasts are accurate, engineers say the damage may be limited to
one, perhaps two, operational satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers in Japan and Southeast Asia, where it will be night
during peak activity, will have the best view, with hundreds of
meteors an hour vaporizing in the atmosphere, but U.S. viewers
won't be nearly so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta area skies are clear, local residents might see
perhaps a dozen ``shooting stars'' an hour early Wednesday morning,
as the constellation Leo rises in the eastern sky.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, however, will have an opportunity to join the
white-knuckle party. Starting about 10 a.m., the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration's Space Environment Center will
issue hourly alerts posted on the center's web site at
http://sec.noaa.gov featuring updates on the density of meteorites
as measured by Air Force satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually concentrate on other aspects of space weather _
solar activity and magnetic storms, but this is the biggest event
of this kind in many years,'' said spokeswoman Barbara Poppery.

   JEAN DALRYMPLE DIES; PUBLICIST, PRODUCER EXTRAORDINAIRE  (jw) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jean Dalrymple, who abandoned a nascent acting career
to become a successful publicist, then an even more successful
manager of concert artists and finally a dynamic producer of
musicals and plays for City Center and other stages, died Sunday at
her Manhattan home, across the street from City Center. She was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Dalrymple's stature in the New York theater world was
enhanced by her uncanny ability to lure just the right actor for a
particular role at a price that City Center, with its limited
budget, could afford. Her skillful productions nourished and
entertained audiences there from the 1940s through the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the center's offerings during her tenure as director of
its theater and light-opera companies were plays by Shakespeare and
Shaw, Sartre and Tennessee Williams, with actors like Jose Ferrer,
Charles Boyer, Franchot Tone, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn,
Charlton Heston, Helen Hayes and Tallulah Bankhead. She also
revived musicals by Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Frank Loesser,
Rodgers and Hart, and Rodgers and Hammerstein.
</P>
<P>
   The productions were quite polished. Indeed, after an opening of
one Rodgers and Hammerstein revival, Miss Dalrymple received a
floral tribute from the composers with a note that said, ``We wish
last night had been the Broadway opening.''
</P>
<P>
   In her day, Miss Dalrymple was one of a handful of formidable
female producers; the others included Cheryl Crawford and Irene
Selznick. She was as tough as they were, a woman in perpetual
motion, but she did not seem that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean always had a kind of solid serenity about her,'' said
Robert Whitehead, the producer. ``She had a great determination to
get things done, but she was always very feminine, very pretty. She
was an extraordinary person.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchot Tone, an actor whose work Miss Dalrymple always
admired, thought of her as ``the tenderest little lady.'' But a
writer from The Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote that she was ``as
fragile as a Fragonard painting but hep and with a sense of timing
like a Garand rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to luring actors, she was also able to persuade
producers to give the City Center sets and costumes when their
plays and musicals ended their runs. Thus, her revival of ``My Fair
Lady'' featured the original costumes.
</P>
<P>
   City Center, for which Miss Dalrymple worked so long and hard,
was established on W. 55th Street in 1943 by Mayor Fiorello La
Guardia and City Council President Newbold Morris, who wanted it to
be a ``temple for the performing arts,'' offering productions for a
top price of $2.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Dalrymple was there at the very beginning. Her success with
their dream was such that when the center turned 50 in 1993 and
called itself ``a glorious home for dance, music, opera and dozens
of extraordinary musicals and plays,'' there were many who thought
the phrase an understatement of what Miss Dalrymple had
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Initially serving as volunteer director of public relations and
as a member of its board, Miss Dalrymple remained at the middle of
City Center's publicity apparatus even after she started producing
and directing. At the same time, she served as personal manager to
performing artists like Leopold Stokowski, Mary Martin, Jose
Iturbi, Andre Kostalanetz, Nathan Milstein and Lily Pons.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Dalrymple was born on Sept. 2, 1902, in Morristown, N.J.,
to George and Elizabeth Collins Dalrymple. There was no shortage of
money in her family; her grandfather, an officer in the Civil War,
had founded a coal and lumber business that sustained the family
well.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 9, she finished a short story, ``The Spinning
Top,'' and sold it to a Newark newspaper for $1. Encouraged by this
success, she wrote more stories for a Philadelphia paper, receiving
$5 for each one. But even in those days, she thought of writing as
secondary to her goal of becoming a stage director.
</P>
<P>
   After completing her secondary education, Miss Dalrymple moved
to New York, studied secretarial skills at a business school and
got a stenographer's job on Wall Street when she was only 16. She
even made a respectable sum in the market before the crash of 1929.
The crash propelled her out of Wall Street and into vaudeville. She
created an act with her beau, Dan Jarrett, and worked with James
Cagney and Cary Grant on the Keith-Orpheum circuit.
</P>
<P>
   During this period, she tried her hand at playwriting; ``Salt
Water,'' written with Jarrett, was produced by John Golden. She was
hired by Golden as an understudy, casting director, play doctor and
press agent, and her skill in handling the press so impressed him
that he encouraged her to work at it full time.
</P>
<P>
   It also impressed Ward Morehouse, the drama critic for The New
York Sun, so much so that in 1932 he proposed marriage. It was not
a successful union, but in the five years they were together, they
collaborated on a screenplay, ``It Happened in New York,'' which
was made into a movie by Universal Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Dalrymple was married in 1951 to Maj. Gen. Philip de Witt
Ginder, who died in 1968. No immediate family members survive. The
funeral will be held at 1:30 p.m. Thursday at the West Point
chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Dalrymple was one of the founding members of the American
Theater Wing, the theater service organization. In 1939, she was
its first publicity volunteer, and during World War II, she trained
speakers who sold war bonds during the time of the Stage Door
Canteen.
</P>
<P>
   By 1940, Miss Dalrymple was working as an independent press
agent, much sought after because of her contacts. Among the
Broadway plays for which she handled the publicity were ``Mr. and
Mrs. North'' (1941), ``One Touch of Venus'' (1943) and ``Anna
Lucasta'' (1944).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, she turned to producing. Her first effort, a
collaboration with Marc Connelly, was ``Hope for the Best,'' a
comedy by William McCleery, who had been Sunday editor of the
newspaper PM. She did not leave the publicity business but pursued
more producing ventures, among them ``Brighten the Corner'' (1945)
and ``Burlesque'' (1946). Meanwhile, she began to devote more of
her energy to developing productions for the newly formed City
Center, which was started in the old Mecca Temple that had been
built years before by the Shriners. It had been taken over by the
city for nonpayment of taxes and it stood idle, except for its
occasional use as the site for Civil Service examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Early productions included Thornton Wilder's ``Our Town,''
mostly because it required no scenery and was inexpensive to
produce, and ``Porgy and Bess,'' which the center snared as it was
completing a national tour.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Dalrymple was especially proud of her production of
``Porgy.'' ``I had an overwhelming desire to restore it to its
original form and present it exactly as George Gershwin and DuBose
Heyward had created it, as an opera for the Metropolitan,'' she
once recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1975 memoir, ``From the Last Row,'' she recalled that
Howard Taubman of The New York Times ``loved it'' but that Judith
Crist of The New York Herald Tribune said she preferred the
original Broadway version. ``I wrote her,'' Miss Dalrymple said,
``and told her she had a tin ear.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Miss Dalrymple thought she had scored a coup when she
succeeded in getting Jean-Paul Sartre's permission to produce his
play ``Les Mains Sales'' in an English adaptation by Daniel
Taradash called ``Red Gloves.'' She followed this up by inducing
Charles Boyer to make it his first Broadway role.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a coup threatened to become a coup de grace;
Sartre read Taradash's adaptation after he gave Miss Dalrymple the
go-ahead and was filled with loathing for it. He loudly denounced
it publicly as ``a vulgar, common melodrama with an anti-Communist
bias.'' When the play opened, Brooks Atkinson echoed Sartre's
denunciation and wrote in The New York Times that it was a
production that ``looked and sounded bogus.'' It quickly closed.
</P>
<P>
   But she scored many triumphs in the years that followed. Word of
her organizational abilities spread and in 1951 the State
Department asked her to arrange for what the United States would
offer at the Berlin Arts Festival that year. In 1958, the State
Department called on her again, this time to arrange for the
performances sent by the United States to the Brussels World's
Fair, including those by Harry Belafonte, William Warfield, Jose
Iturbi and the Juilliard String Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, she persuaded Jose Ferrer to star in and direct four
plays at the City Center during an eight-week season: ``Cyrano de
Bergerac,'' ``The Shrike,'' ``Richard III'' and ``Charley's Aunt.''
To help City Center grapple with its tight budget, Ferrer and all
the cast members in these productions worked for the Actors Equity
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer called the center ``this happy beehive of the arts,'' and
donated $1,000 to the cause. The season was a critical and
box-office success. ``They have made the theater seem like a fresh,
exciting, varied form of public art,'' Atkinson wrote in The Times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Miss Dalrymple persuaded Orson Welles to appear in
``King Lear'' (he performed in a wheelchair after breaking a leg in
rehearsals) and Tallulah Bankhead to play Blanche Dubois in ``A
Streetcar Named Desire.'' Both productions earned critical praise.
</P>
<P>
   Among Miss Dalrymple's other warmly received revivals were ``The
Beggar's Opera,'' ``Brigadoon'' (with Edward Villela as the
villain), ``Pal Joey'' (with Bob Fosse in the title role), ``Guys
and Dolls'' (with Walter Matthau as Nathan Detroit) and ``The
Pajama Game.''
</P>
<P>
   When her revivals turned a profit, Miss Dalrymple used the money
to subsidize City Center's other companies, the New York City
Ballet and the New York City Opera, both of which moved to Lincoln
Center in 1964. Her revivals were doomed in the late 1960s,
however, when the city began to experience a series of fiscal
crises.
</P>
<P>
   Among Miss Dalrymple's other books were an autobiography,
``September Child'' (1963), ``Careers and Opportunities in the
Theater'' (1969), ``Jean Dalrymple's Pinafore Farm Cookbook''
(1971) and ``The Folklore and Facts of Natural Nutrition'' (1973).
</P>
<P>
   As a producer, Miss Dalrymple tended to play down her adroit
handling of the press, which is critical in the success of even the
most expertly produced play. ``I never went in for theme parties or
the crazy events that publicists stage today,'' she said in 1993.
``I simply advertised the facts of the production. At City Center,
that was always enough.''

GATES SAYS NEW FONT SOFTWARE WILL SPEED SHIFT TO ELECTRONIC BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
 (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Microsoft Corp. researchers have developed a
software technique that improves the appearance of fonts displayed
on color liquid-crystal display screens to a level that approaches
the visual quality of text printed on paper.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the new technology, which could help spawn a
generation of portable devices for publishing electronic books and
periodicals, was the centerpiece of a presentation by Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates on Sunday here at the Comdex computer industry
trade show.
</P>
<P>
   Gates predicted that the advance would speed the shift from
paper to computerized storage and display of information.
</P>
<P>
   Because Microsoft's new font software improves the resolution of
color flat-panel displays, the kind used by most notebook
computers, by as much as 300 percent, Gates said he believed that
it would foster the acceptance of a new generation of electronic
books, or e-books.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Gates suggested, Microsoft might be able to apply
the technology to icons and graphics as well as to fonts.
</P>
<P>
   The new software, called Cleartype font technology, will be
integrated into Microsoft's Windows 98, Windows NT and Windows CE
operating systems during 1999, Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said that Microsoft was highlighting the new
font software to demonstrate its ability to develop new
technologies internally. The company, which is now spending $3
billion annually on research and development, has been widely
criticized for borrowing technological innovations from
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Several technical analysts said Monday that Cleartype echoed
earlier work done by Apple Computer Inc.'s co-founder, Stephen
Wozniak, in the 1970s. Wozniak obtained a patent covering color and
resolution enhancement for the Apple II computer, said Auri
Rahimzadeh of Envisioneering Inc., a computer industry consulting
firm. Wozniak applied techniques that are similar to those used in
Cleartype to color cathode-ray tube displays, he said, adding that
the patent had expired.
</P>
<P>
   In an impromptu discussion with reporters after his Comdex
presentation, Gates said that researchers had been able to take
advantage of the fact that color LCD screens have a red, green and
blue component for each picture element, or pixel, that makes up
the display.
</P>
<P>
   By systematically and selectively highlighting specific colors
on the edges of characters displayed on a screen, Cleartype
software offers the effect of increased resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, font and display developers have used a variety of
techniques to correct the jagged appearance of small
computer-generated text on displays. However, these techniques,
known as ``anti-aliasing,'' work by actually blurring or smoothing
the edge of a displayed character rather than by sharpening it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleartype technique will work on existing as well as on
future higher-resolution LCD displays, but not on the
television-like cathode-ray-tube monitors that are used with most
desktop computers today. That is because on a standard monitor it
is not possible to separate individual red, green and blue
components of individual pixels, Microsoft executives said.

<P>
   The impetus for the new Microsoft software technology came about
six months ago when Bill Hill, a font researcher, sent e-mail to
Gates asking him for a new challenge. Microsoft's chairman directed
him to begin working with Dick Brass, a company executive who has
been leading a group in Microsoft's research division to develop
e-books.
</P>
<P>
   Technology was not the only thing on Gates' agenda Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of his presentation, he acknowledged that this had
been ``an exciting year'' and then proceeded to show a video recap
of Microsoft mishaps. These included a Justice Department news
conference in May announcing a new antitrust suit against
Microsoft, a product demonstration that crashed during the
announcement of Windows 98, and Gates getting a pie in the face
while on a visit to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   After his presentation, Gates declined to accept questions about
the antitrust lawsuit under way in Washington.

SUPREME COURT REJECTS CAMPAIGN SPENDING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in a major blow to the movement
to reduce the influence of money in politics, refused Monday to
hear a challenge to its landmark 1976 ruling that campaign spending
limits violate the right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In a setback for President Clinton and attorneys general in 26
states, the justices turned away an appeal, filed by the
Boston-based National Voting Rights Institute, aimed at restoring
spending caps for City Council races in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and many advocates of overhauling the campaign finance
system considered the Cincinnati case the best hope of prompting
the court to reverse its 1976 ruling in Buckley v. Valeo and allow
changes in the way the nation's elections are funded. The attorneys
general for states including Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont,
and Connecticut had joined the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices refused, without further comment, to reconsider
their position that unlimited campaign spending is a form of free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   In a related case, the court declined to hear an appeal aimed at
reviving an Arkansas law that strictly limited contributions to
election campaigns by individuals and political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the court actions, Vermont still plans to enforce in
2000 the nation's first mandatory limit on campaign spending in
state elections. Vermont enacted the curb after spending in all
federal campaigns mushroomed to more than $2 billion in 1996,
leading to abuses that remain the focus of criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain confident that one day the US Supreme Court will
revisit its ruling in Buckley v. Valeo and will recognize that
unlimited campaign spending poses a serious threat to our
democratic process,'' said John C. Bonifaz, executive director of
the National Voting Rights Institute. ``When that happens,
Cincinnati will go down in history as the city that led the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati enacted spending limits in 1995 after the total
spending on council races increased to $2.3 million from less than
$1 million six years earlier. The cap for individual candidates was
set at three times the annual salary for a city councilor, or about
$140,000.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Kruse, a Republican who spent more than $200,000 in an
unsuccessful race for City Council in 1995, challenged the limit,
calling it an ``incumbent-protection act.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Voting Rights Institute, on Cincinnati's behalf,
argued in its brief to the Supreme Court that the case ``is of the
utmost importance to the nation and to the state of American
democracy. ... Unlimited spending has seriously undermined public
confidence in our electoral process and in our democratic
institutions. It has presented an increased threat of actual
corruption as large contributors dominate the financing of public
election campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lower federal courts backed Kruse and threw out the
spending cap. Rejecting the argument that unlimited campaign
spending increases the possibility of public corruption, the US
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in April that ``the
spending of money legally raised by candidates themselves poses no
risk of quid pro quo corruption, and campaign spending limits
cannot be justified by the anti-corruption rationale.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional foes of overhauling campaign finance laws have
relied heavily on the Supreme Court ruling in Buckley v. Valeo. Led
by Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who has called
himself the ``Darth Vader'' of the campaign-finance debate,
opponents used parliamentary tactics to kill three overhaul
measures in the last two years, even though the bills were
supported by a majority of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell had no immediate comment Monday on the court's action.
</P>
<P>
   But two leaders of the congressional effort to change the
campaign finance system _ Representatives Martin T. Meehan, a
Massachusetts Democrat, and Christopher Shays, a Connecticut
Republican _ said the court's refusal to reconsider Buckley v.
Valeo would not hurt their cause, which they plan to revive in the
next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in this decision will prevent us from moving forward
with our proposal to cut off the unlimited supply of money into
federal campaigns,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is expected to have more opportunities to hear
a challenge to campaign spending limits. But Michael Carvin, a
lawyer who challenged Cincinnati's spending cap, said the court's
refusal to take the case Monday ``sends a strong signal that the
court is not inclined to review its longstanding precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the Arkansas case was the court's ruling in 1976
that reasonable campaign contribution limits could be set to help
prevent public corruption. In 1996, Arkansas passed a law reducing
the maximum individual contribution to candidates for the top
statewide offices from $1,000 to $300.
</P>
<P>
   But an appeals court struck down the law as a violation of
free-speech rights, ruling that the contribution limits were too
low to permit meaningful participation in the election process.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, in refusing to hear the case, effectively
upheld the appeals court ruling.

PROMOTING POLITICAL PROCLAIMERS

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Whereas, Gov. Jane Hull and Gilbert Mayor Cynthia
Dunham have upset members of the general public and the American
Civil Liberties Union by proclaiming Nov. 22-29 ``Bible Week,''
and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, proclamations by a governor (or any other politician)
are, according to Gov. Hull's own spokeswoman, ``not binding on
anybody,'' and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, the governor issues worthless proclamations for just
about every month, week and day of the year, and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, some days, weeks and months receive multiple
proclamations. For instance, October, which in Arizona was
``European American Heritage Month'' and ``Breast Cancer Awareness
Month'' and ``Masonry Industry Month'' and ``Native American Indian
Heritage Month,'' and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, every once in a while a governor with lots of
supposedly important stuff to do proclaims a week (in this case
Aug. 1-7) ``Clown Week,'' and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, the actual proclamation for that week has a line in it
stating ``the clown leaves happiness where he goes, and takes
misery away with him,'' and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, Gov. Hull also has issued proclamations for
``Firefighters Day,'' ``Korean Cultural Day,'' `'Read Across
Arizona Day,'' ``Kiwanis Week,'' ``Arizona-Germany Friendship
Week,'' and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, I'd guess there were a lot of conservative voters and
one or two radio talk show hosts in Arizona who didn't realize Gov.
Hull had proclaimed the entire year of 1998 as ``Women's Rights
Movement Year'' in honor of the 150th anniversary of the first
women's rights convention held in 1848, and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, I'd guess those same people didn't know she'd also
proclaimed March as ``Women's History Month,'' and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, any one of these meaningless proclamations potentially
provides press people with possible pap for publication;
</P>
<P>
   Now, therefore, I, E.J. Montini, a columnist for ``The Arizona
Republic,'' do hereby proclaim my complete support for ever (begin
ital) more (end ital) proclamations on the part of our politicians,
along with my wholehearted opposition to the ACLU or anyone else
who would impede that process. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Why join me? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I would urge you to join me in this effort, primarily because:
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, the proclamation is overused, outdated and, other than
this hubbub over Bible Week, completely ignored and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, some of you believe abolishing the practice of issuing
proclamations would save taxpayers from having to pay elected
officials to perform purposeless pronouncements and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, a legal challenge of Bible Week by the ACLU could have
a chilling effect on such practices, which, at first glance, you
think of as a positive step, and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, you might also consider the fact that a government
unencumbered by the tradition of dispensing unnecessary
proclamations almost certainly will be tempted to conduct actual
business and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, that kind of activity often carries serious
consequences for the average guy and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, those consequences tend to cost a lot more than is
being wasted on the issuing of proclamations and; &QL; 
 &QL; 
Expand proclamations &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, we could probably save ourselves more money by doing
just the opposite. In other words, by forcing politicians to (begin
ital) expand (end ital) the number of proclamations they must
issue, going beyond the year, month, week and day into issuing
proclamations for each hour, minute and second and;
</P>
<P>
   Whereas, doing this would most likely occupy the time of so many
bureaucrats it would cause state government to come to a grinding
halt, which some of you may not philosophically agree with. But, I
figure I can get each and every one of you to go along with idea,
contingent upon the following promise;
</P>
<P>
   Now, therefore, I, E.J. Montini, a columnist for ``The Arizona

a column in the form of a proclamation and I swear never, ever to
begin another paragraph with the word ``whereas.'' &QL;

LIVINGSTON PACKS A TEMPER, A BLACK BELT AND A BIPARTISAN APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE and RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hours after his swift emergence last week as the
presumptive new Speaker of the House, Rep. Bob Livingston
telephoned an old friend, former Rep. Jimmy Hayes, for advice. He
did not ask Hayes how best to keep his Republican flock in line, or
for counsel on issues. Instead, he quizzed his fellow Louisiana
Republican about how he could best build a relationship with Rep.
Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Tell me about Dick Gephardt the person,''' recalled
Hayes, a onetime Democrat who is close to both men. ```I want to
know more about this guy.' ``Livingston was saying, `I know he
listens great. I want him to talk more.'''
</P>
<P>
   That Livingston wants to talk at all to Gephardt, who hungers
for his job, underscores the bipartisan, accommodationist approach
of the new leader. The man Livingston will replace, Newt Gingrich,
had considered Gephardt so irrelevant that he rarely spoke to him.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Livingston, both Tulane graduates, are vastly
different. While Gingrich built his career as a rebel, Livingston
has always reached across the aisle. Both are conservatives, but
Gingrich is ideological and Livingston is pragmatic. While Gingrich
has called himself ``a transformational leader,'' Livingston is not
known for his vision, intellect or ego, and until he was elevated
to chairman of the Appropriations Committee, was not considered a
heavyweight in Washington, or back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet there are a lot of people in New Orleans, still, who
wouldn't even recognize him if you showed them Livingston's
picture,'' said Ed Renwick, who heads the Institute of Politics at
Loyola University.
</P>
<P>
   In an era in which Speakers have been defined by belligerent
partisanship _ particularly Gingrich and the Democrat he hounded
from office, Jim Wright _ Livingston represents an older strain of
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   While Wright and Gingrich were tainted by scandal, Livingston
has not been. And while Gingrich had long predicted greatness for
himself, and plotted for years to become speaker, there are no such
stories about Livingston. ``I don't think it ever entered his
head,'' said Fred Carroll, an investment banker and a friend for
more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is perhaps best known on Capitol Hill for his
incendiary outbursts on the House floor and in private meetings (he
cools down quickly). ``He has a huge temper,'' said Rep. W.J.
(Billy) Tauzin, another Louisiana Republican. ``He's going to have
to learn to use it and control it.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming speaker has a gift for timing, a relentless and
plodding nature and a gangly, even awkward demeanor that has led
many to underestimate him. Even his closest friends say they never
considered him likely to become one of the most powerful men in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who has been there at the right time, time after
time, and he's always taken advantage of it,'' said John Bolles, a
former classmate and close friend for four decades. ``This is not a
terribly complicated guy. This is not a guy with a lot of hidden
agendas. He's got a good, healthy ego, but no delusions of
grandeur.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, 55, who has represented Louisiana's relatively
affluent 1st District since 1977, pursues what he wants with the
same single-mindedness that he brings to his hobbies: playing the
harmonica, doing impersonations and becoming a black belt in Tae
Kwan Do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got that black belt, in the first minute of the test
he broke his big toe on a board but he just kept right on going,''
said Quin Hillyer, an editorial writer at The Mobile (Ala.)
Register, who was the congressman's press secretary. ``You know how
painful that is? He's tough. He's got a very strong will.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston has carried that strong will to Congress. He was
appalled when the Federal Election Commission conducted a random
audit of his first successful campaign. Ever since, he has crusaded
against the agency, slashing staff members and starting
investigations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   With similar zeal, Livingston sought the speakership. Earlier
this year, he announced that he would seek the post whenever
Gingrich stepped aside. But in the wake of the Republicans' net
loss of five House seats on Nov. 3, Livingston turned on the man
who had been his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to meet with us more often and talk about
process,'' Gephardt said of his new sparring partner. But the
Democratic leader, in perhaps an unintended compliment to Gingrich,
said: ``Newt's great strengths were that he had both a vision and
an ideology and a set of issues and thinking that he could express,
at least to some people, in a compelling way _ and that's important
in a leader. You have to be able to express ideas. And I don't know
whether Bob can do that or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Linlithgow Livingston was born in Colorado Springs,
Colo., where his mother's family lived. Eventually, the family
settled in New Orleans, where his father took a job with National
Distillers. The job did not last long, and neither did the
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, when Robert (``It wasn't until he became a politician
that he became Bob,'' Carroll said) was 7 years old, his father
walked out on the family. ``He turned out to be an alcoholic,''
said Livingston's mother, Dorothy Billet, who stayed in New
Orleans, got a divorce and a job at the Avondale Shipyards. She
remarried after her son and daughter grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Billet later learned that her first husband had settled in Spain
and died at 55. ``Of course, Robert was very upset by his father
going away like that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, though, said the young man rarely mentioned it. ``I'm
sure it had a negative impact,'' Bolles said. ``But he never talked
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Billet settled Robert and his younger sister into a modest home
in New Orleans' Uptown neighborhood, a couple of blocks from Tulane
University. One important effect of the departure of Robert's
father was that the family was always strapped. Young Robert helped
out financially.
</P>
<P>
   Always among the youngest and tallest in his class, Robert
Livingston was a shy boy, his mother said. ``I remember when he was
124 pounds and 6 foot 4,'' she said. ``He wanted to be the athletic
type. He really wanted to be. But he was always a year behind in
athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   Billet, an active Episcopalian, received partial scholarships
for her children from the church that allowed them to attend St.
Martins Episcopal School, one of New Orleans' most prestigious
schools. At 14, Livingston worked cleaning up after elephants at
the New Orleans Zoo. For several summers, he earned college money
at the Avondale Shipyards, ending up as a welder's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   After Livingston, like many of his Uptown friends, settled on
Tulane, his life nearly came unstuck. ``What happened is that he
went to college and got in with a group of guys who liked to party,
including me,'' Bolles said. Livingston joined the Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity. Robert's fraternity brothers rechristened him
Doc (as in, ``Dr. Livingstone, I presume'') and many still call him
that.
</P>
<P>
   After only one year at Tulane, Livingston was asked in 1961 to
take a sabbatical from the university, Bolles said, explaining that
school authorities complained that he and his friends partied too
much.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Livingston joined the Navy, serving for two years, and returned
from his military tour a subtly changed man. ``The Navy
straightened him out,'' Bolles said. ``He kept on partying with us,
but he was more able to handle the partying and the classes
together. He had more confidence, was more focused.'' He began to
talk about law school.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston also met and married his wife, Bonnie, a Louisiana
State University student. They have three sons and a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Livingston graduated from Tulane's law school and took
a job at a civil law firm whose partners included David Treen, a
Republican who later was elected governor of Louisiana. ``He was
interested in a political career right from the beginning,'' Treen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Treen said he advised Livingston to establish himself as a
success in some career before running for office. The young man
agreed and, after two years with the firm, asked Treen to help him
get a job as an assistant U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The hard living continued in his early years as a prosecutor,
his friends said, when he would often go out drinking in the French
Quarter to celebrate a victory or unwind. Late one night,
Livingston came home to find that his wife had placed his dinner _
the entire place setting, from water glass to cutlery _ neatly on
the front step, where it was swarming with vermin. Friends said the
incident contributed to his slowing down the fast life.
</P>
<P>
   When a seat opened in the 1st Congressional District in 1976,
Livingston was not the Republican establishment's first choice. But
after one potential candidate developed financial difficulties and
a second declined to switch his party affiliation, the Republicans
approached Livingston, who eagerly agreed to run.
</P>
<P>
   He was defeated by a Democrat who, within months, was
investigated and eventually jailed for campaign finance
irregularities. In a special election in 1977, Livingston,
untainted and fresh in the voters' minds, easily won election to
the seat he has held ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The only other race Livingston lost was when he ran for governor
in 1987. Even then his accommodationist inclinations were apparent.
After a bitter contest in which Livingston and a rival, Tauzin, who
was serving in the House as a Democrat, lost in their parties'
primaries, Livingston took the unheard of step of raising money to
help pay off Tauzin's debt. ``Bob felt it would be the right thing
to do because it was not good for a member of our delegation to be
so preoccupied with debt,'' said Tauzin, who became a Republican
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston had planned to retire from Congress this year to
pursue a career as a lobbyist and make more money. But Gingrich was
among those who convinced him to stay. And Livingston would never
have been in a position to drive Gingrich from office had the
speaker not chosen him over others with more seniority to preside
over federal spending as chairman of the Appropriations Committee
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a tough-minded chairman, battling Democrats who want
to spend more as well as Republicans who want to deliver projects
to their districts. He displayed his bipartisan bonafides _ and
outraged some conservatives _ by keeping several Democrats on the
committee staff who had held their jobs before the Republicans took
over Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Livingston did not waver from traditional Republican goals,
like slashing billions of dollars from the federal budget and
eliminating hundreds of federal programs, while resisting
reductions in military spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call him a social activist,'' said Jimmy Hayes, the
former congressman. ``The only theme that fits Bob is the fiscal
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   As he angled to move up the hierarchy, Livingston established
his own political action committee, dutifully raising money for
colleagues.He also became known for quickly getting to the bottom
line. Rep. Joe Scarborough, a R.-Fla., recalled being dressed down
by the chairman after he opposed a measure to increase spending for
House operations and delivered a speech that was criticized as
being unduly self-righteous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was offended by my speech and basically told me
that I needed to work with the team _ or not expect the team to
work for me,'' Scarborough said. ``I respect somebody who tells me
straight instead of someone smiling, patting me on the back, and
then trying to do me in. With the last group, regrettably, you had
a hard time filtering out what to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich named Livingston to head the committee, they had
struck an implicit bargain: The new chairman would work with the
leadership. But as time wore on, Livingston began to chafe at the
speaker's tight rein.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Gingrich on Nov. 6, Livingston _ in what amounted
to a cry for a return to the tradition of powerful barons presiding
over their committees _ outlined 15 demands, including that he be
given the freedom to ``run the committee as I see fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Gingrich announced his resignation, pushed out by
his once-loyal protege. Now, it will be Livingston's turn to run
the House and, like his predecessor, to try his hand at the
ultimate challenge: building a record of legislative accomplishment
while satisfying a chamber of restive partisans.

FOUR BIG RETAILERS FLOUT PRICING RULES, MASS. AG SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Four national retailers are flouting a Massachusetts
regulation requiring prices to be stamped on individual items
within stores, according to a survey by the attorney general's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Depot and Home Quarters hardware store chains were not
complying at all, while discount retailers Kmart and Wal-Mart had
haphazard compliance. Only CVS Pharmacy stores performed well in
the survey conducted in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, the stores could face fines of up to $5,000 per
violation, but the attorney general's office chose instead to send
them a warning letter this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've told them we'll be coming out again,'' said Diane L.
Szafarowicz, assistant attorney general in the consumer protection
and antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have made no secret in recent years that they don't
like stamping individual prices on store items, primarily because
of the possibility for human-error price mixups as well as the
labor costs involved.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say prices on individual items are a key tool
used by shoppers to compare prices and detect checkout scanner
errors. Edgar Dworsky, who runs Consumerworld.org on the Internet,
said compliance with the law has been spotty, particularly on items
that are on sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers have thumbed their noses at the item-pricing law.
They don't like it. They don't want to do it. They're waiting for
someone to make them do it,'' Dworsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Szafarowicz said her office put stores on notice two years ago
at a retailer conference that the state's 21-year-old item pricing
regulation was a priority. She said the survey results indicated
retailers are not taking that warning to heart.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, based in Atlanta, was the worst offender. No prices
were marked on items surveyed at the chain's stores in Somerville,
Tewksbury, North Dartmouth and West Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Melcher, Home Depot's public affairs manager, said the
chain had been under the impression that only items that would be
found in grocery stores needed to be price-marked individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think we needed to have all items individually
price-marked,'' Melcher said. ``Right now we're confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot apparently was also confused in Michigan. The
attorney general's office there fined the chain $250,000 for
failing to comply with that state's item-pricing law. Home Depot
officials said Michigan officials reduced the fine to $125,000 when
the chain complied with the law quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Home Quarters Warehouse, of Virginia Beach, Calif., wasn't much
better than its rival Home Depot. Only one item out of 80 surveyed
at four stores in Norwood, Brockton, Shrewsbury and Danvers was
price-marked.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of
Bentonville, Ark., had spotty compliance with the law. Four
Massachusetts stores at each chain were surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Only CVS did well in the attorney general's survey. In her
letter to the pharmacy chain, Szafarowicz noted some items at CVS
stores in Boston, New Bedford, Springfield and Lowell were not
marked, but overall the record was exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   While most retailers are subject to the attorney general's
regulation requiring item pricing, supermarkets are covered by a
specific law. Supermarkets have long chafed under the law. With
close to 50,000 items in some of their stores, the supermarkets say
the need to match the prices on the individual item, on the store
shelf and at the checkout scanner is a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets are now engaged in a state-supervised study to see
if shelf price tags tied in electronically with checkout scanners
would reduce pricing errors and make item-pricing unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Derouen, director of political and legislative affairs for
the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 791, said
retailers are opposed to item pricing because it costs them money.
He said enforcement of the state's laws and regulations on item
pricing is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say most retailers are not complying completely with
the law,'' he said. ``They're going to get away with whatever they
can get away with.''

ON TAPE, GATES SEEMS PUZZLED BY ``MARKET SHARE'' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR and JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft Corp.,
stubbornly debated the meaning of words like ``we'' and ``concern''
during an hour of his videotaped deposition shown in court Monday.
Even ``market share'' seemed a curiously alien term to a man whose
company owns just about all of the market in major product
categories of the personal-computer software business.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant for the antitrust case against his company,
Gates said that he did not recall what he was thinking or what he
meant when he wrote in a January 1996 e-mail to top aides,
``Winning Internet browser market share is a very, very important
goal for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The government used the Gates tape _ the third excerpt from his
deposition shown in the Microsoft trial _ to attack Microsoft's
defense that it decided to fold Internet browsing software into its
Windows operating system to improve its centerpiece product,
Windows. Its main rival in the browser market, Netscape
Communications Corp., may have been harmed, Microsoft argues, but
its actions were guided mainly by its desire to improve its product
and to benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft contend
instead that the decision was an illegal scheme to use Microsoft's
monopoly in operating systems to increase its share of the browser
market, and to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said Monday that the government's tactic of repeatedly
showing portions of the taped deposition is turning the trial into
a ``sideshow'' _ a personal attack on Gates, the nation's richest
person.
</P>
<P>
   But the government argues that the Gates tapes provide important
context for its case by showing what Gates, the central actor at
Microsoft, did and what he said about it. The deposition excerpts,
culled from more than 20 hours of tape, have been selected by the
government, though some questions and answers Microsoft wanted to
show have been included.
</P>
<P>
   The government insists that Microsoft's defense is an exercise
in revisionist history. When presented with internal company e-mail
and documents from a couple of years ago, the prosecutors say,
Gates' evasive performance at his deposition shows the weakness of
Microsoft's defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw today shows that Microsoft was quite concerned
about Netscape in early 1996, and that Microsoft was not merely
trying to improve its product,'' said David Boies, the Justice
Department's lead trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Gates has a reputation as a brilliant, hands-on executive whose
fingerprints are on every major decision made at Microsoft. Yet his
deposition performance is so at odds with that reputation,
professing to be forgetful and only vaguely aware of key decisions
in the browser market, that it does seem to cast doubt on his
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's legal advisers say that in his deposition, Gates
was merely taking a characteristically competitive and combative
approach to what deposition witnesses are supposed to do _ to try
to narrow the questions asked, fence with interrogators and avoid
broad or responsive answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of time-consuming jousting goes on in depositions,''
said Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney who is a Microsoft
legal consultant. ``A deposition is fundamentally an ugly thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gates' determined resistance to the questions asked by
Boies at his deposition apparently struck even legal veterans as
unusual. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson chortled and shook his head
at some of Gates' replies. Microsoft's lawyers laughed a few times.
Even Gates flashed a tight smile, once or twice, as he seemed to be
enjoying the give-and-take when he felt confident he was giving
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Gates paused before answering questions for even longer periods,
up to 30 seconds or so, than he had in the earlier excerpts shown.
At times, he played a waiting game with his interrogator.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Boies asked, ``Do you understand the question, Mr.
Gates?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pausing to see if I can understand it,'' Gates replied.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Boies said he would ask another question,
since Gates did not have an answer to his previous question. ``I
have an answer,'' Gates replied quickly. ``The answer is I don't
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gates was asked about his e-mail on Jan. 5, 1996, in
which he wrote that increasing browser market share was a ``very,
very important goal for us.'' Boies asked, ``So you don't remember
what you were thinking when you wrote it and you don't remember
what you meant when you wrote it; is that fair?''
</P>
<P>
   Leaning forward and grinning, Gates replied, ``As well as not
remember writing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The verbal fencing over terms like ``market share'' relates to
the antitrust case because the government is trying to demonstrate
that regardless of Microsoft's courtroom arguments, the company
regarded its Internet Explorer browser as a separate product,
marketed separately and measured separately.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that Internet Explorer is a ``feature'' of its
Windows operating system, and not a separate product. Indeed, a
U.S. appeals court ruling in a related case agreed that Microsoft
should be free to determine what software is included in its
operating system as long as there is some consumer benefit from the
integration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the Gates deposition, the government's fifth witness,
Glenn Weadock, a computer consultant, took the stand to be
cross-examined by a Microsoft lawyer, Richard Pepperman.
</P>
<P>
   Weadock's testimony, submitted in written form last Friday, is
that many companies, like Boeing, find Microsoft's practice of
tightly folding its browser into Windows to be a costly
inconvenience. This is especially true, he testified, if corporate
customers want to use the Netscape browser with Windows, since
Microsoft's browser software is deeply embedded into recent
versions of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, though, he did say that there is plenty of
debate within the industry about what should and should not be in
an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Weadock also said some companies undoubtedly find having the
browser integrated into the operating system to be an advantage.
The issue, he said, was whether consumers had a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere in my testimony,'' Weadock said, ``did I say there are
no companies that find the integration of Internet Explorer
appealing. But there are those who don't, and they can't get rid of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In court on Monday, the government also introduced many new
documents into evidence. For example, one internal e-mail from
Gateway Inc., a large personal-computer maker, described a
conversation with a Microsoft executive in February 1997,
suggesting that Microsoft used its market muscle to force PC makers
to adopt Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft representative, according to the Gateway
executive, mentioned Microsoft marketing and sales campaigns to
promote Gateway machines, but ``they won't do it if they see
Gateway is anything but pro-Microsoft'' on the browser.

DOW BACK ABOVE 9,000 ON EXPECTATIONS OF RATE CUT
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices rose Monday, pushing at least one key
measure to a level not seen since late July, on hopes that the
Federal Reserve Board would lower interest rates at a policy-making
meeting in Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism about another cut in the overnight federal funds rate
persists even though recent data show the economy remains healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think equity investors are conditioned for a friendly Fed
policy,'' said Bob Gasser, head of block trading at J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co. Though improved, ``fixed-income markets are still suffering
from a lack of liquidity,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were also helped Monday by news of a new Japanese
stimulus plan, this one a huge $195 billion package of tax cuts,
spending and lending measures intended to help ratchet the world's
second-largest economy out of a deep malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks opened sharply higher, lost much of their gains by early
afternoon and then had a late rally.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 91.66
points, or 1.03 percent, at 9,011.25. It was the blue-chip
average's first close above 9,000 since July 30. Despite its sharp
plunge in August and September, the Dow average is now up nearly 14
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market indexes also advanced. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index gained 10.15 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,135.87.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 13.69 points, or 0.74 percent, to
1,861.68. And the Russell 2000 index of mostly small-capitalization
companies gained 1.06, or 0.27 percent, to 390.42.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations of another rate cut helped push up shares of banks
and other financial service companies. And the possibility that
Japan and Asia might be over the worst of their problems helped
buoy big exporters and multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese have always believed that no action is better
than lots of action, but they are moving fast,'' said Jack
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Toting up all the stimulative measures Tokyo has announced this
year, Shaughnessy said the amount equaled ``more than 7 percent of
their gross domestic product.''
</P>
<P>

   PRAGUE _ Czech police have arrested four people, including two
Americans, on charges of physically abusing and imprisoning
American youths at an unlicensed reform school for wayward
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The school, Moravia Academy, reportedly opened earlier this year
in a secluded hotel about 200 kilometers (120 miles) from Prague as
a home for troubled American teens sent abroad by their parents.
Reports said the youths were mainly from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that youths who misbehaved or broke the school's
strict rules were subjected to severe punishments that violated
Czech law and the child protection treaty of the United Nations,
and that several children had been sent back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they were forced to lie on their bellies with their
hands tied, they were denied hot food and given limited amounts of
liquids, and they were all refused medical care,'' and sometimes
toilet facilities, said a police investigator, Petr Netik.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy director of the school, Steven Roach, was being held
by the police, but the director, Mr. Roach's wife, Glenn, was
arrested and released on medical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials said they had visited the school on
several occasions and found nothing amiss. But when the police
asked embassy officials to return Saturday, four children asked to
leave with the diplomats, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the school arose in October when a Czech teacher
who had taught there told the newspaper Lidove Noviny about the
alleged abuse. The teacher said that the students were also
forbidden to leave the grounds, which are protected by guard dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the youths' days were programmed from 6:30
A.M. to 9:30 P.M. and that they were forced to ``sing positive
songs, read positive books and were subjected to 30 minutes of
psychological pressure from tape recordings.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the school, Connie Johnston, refused to give
details of the school's program.
</P>
<P>
   The school's Internet site (www.teenhelper.com) says Moravia
Academy is part of a chain of six similar for-profit programs; the
others are in Utah, Montana, Jamaica, Costa Rica and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site says that for $80 per day, the institutions will
help troubled teens with ``tasks, academics'' and ``behavior
modification.'' &QL;

STATES OFFER TOBACCO COMPANIES $206 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As state prosecutors unveiled details of a proposed
$206 billion deal to settle lawsuits against the tobacco industry,
President Clinton Monday endorsed the agreement, but called on
Congress to pass its own tough anti-tobacco regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger met with
anti-smoking advocates and came under renewed pressure to reject
the deal, which would settle state claims against tobacco companies
for the cost of treating tobacco-related illness. But Harshbarger
gave no indication of whether he would join the settlement or
continue with plans to prosecute cigarette makers in state court.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at a White House appearance with attorneys general who
negotiated the deal, called the proposed settlement ``a milestone
in the long struggle to protect our children from tobacco. . . . It
reflects the first time tobacco companies will be held financially
accountable for the damage their product does to our nation's
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some public health advocates, however, said the deal might kill
any momentum for Congress for anti-tobacco measures that are not
included in the state settlement. Others said the states themselves
could have won better terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a settlement,'' said John Garrison, chief executive
of the American Lung Association. ``It is a partnership agreement
between the tobacco companies and the attorneys general that allows
Big Tobacco to continue its nefarious business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal between state prosecutors and four major cigarette
companies was reached on Saturday, but new details became known
Monday as attorneys general from the states that led the
negotiating discussed the settlement in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the agreement would strip cigarette-makers
of a variety of tools that critics say are used to market tobacco
to youths. Tobacco companies would no longer advertise on
billboards, use cartoon characters in their ads, or distribute
apparel with cigarette logos. They would also face new restrictions
on sponsoring sporting events and handing out free samples.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the tobacco industry would also spend $1.5
billion over five years on anti-smoking ads, as well as $250
million on a foundation to reduce teen smoking. It would also
disband the Tobacco Institute and other industry support and
lobbying groups.
</P>
<P>
   The industry would make payments to states indefinitely into the
future, worth $206 billion in the first 25 years. Massachusetts
would receive about $7.6 billion, adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The amount would fall, however, if the industry sells fewer
cigarettes in the future, and it would rise if it sells more
cigarettes. The amount paid to states would also fall if Congress
passed new laws that take money from the tobacco industry and pass
it to states for public health programs.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is open to 46 states whether or not they filed lawsuits
against the tobacco industry. States must decide whether to sign on
by noon Friday. Because cigarette makers want to eliminate their
risk from state lawsuits, they may walk away from the settlement if
not enough states sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Four states are excluded _ Mississippi, Florida, Texas and
Minnesota _ because they have already settled suits against the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal comes five months after a more comprehensive,
$368.5 billion agreement to settle state lawsuits died in Congress.
That failure prompted state prosecutors to craft a narrower
settlement this time that needs no approval from lawmakers _ only
from states, tobacco companies, and judges presiding over state
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new proposal does not include some
anti-tobacco restrictions that were included in the first proposal,
but which require federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, state prosecutors said Monday, only Congress can
fine tobacco companies for failing to reduce the number of teens
who take up smoking, and only Congress can force the industry to
recover the cost of its payments to states by raising the price of
cigarettes. Anti-smoking advocates want that provision, arguing
that higher cigarette prices would discourage teens from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Monday called on Congress to pass its own
``comprehensive national tobacco legislation,'' but he listed only
two items that should be in the bill: protection for tobacco
farmers and a ``clarification'' of the authority of the Food and
Drug Administration to regulate tobacco. Separately, the Clinton
administration Monday said it would ask the Supreme Court to review
whether the FDA can regulate tobacco under existing law.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, who filed suit against the tobacco industry in
1995, Monday said he wanted to study the deal and to consult with
state public health advocates before deciding whether to sign on.
``The proposed settlement is not all that I had hoped for when it
comes to protecting our children and improving the public health,''
he said in a written statement. ``The decision I must make now is
whether this is the best Massachusetts can do or whether more can
be achieved at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has what is considered to be one of the strongest
cases against the tobacco industry. But aides to Harshbarger
pointed out that jurors in a similar Minnesota case, which was
settled out of court, said afterward that they doubted they would
have awarded much money to the state.

<P>
   LONDON _ Ronaldo, the best and too often the least active soccer
player in the world, is preparing for his future. He is not buying
a pension, as you or I might, but buying the club that pays his
breathtaking salary.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo's wages are so high that the player might own a
controlling share in Internazionale of Milan before his playing
days are done.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, rich, troubled Ronaldo. Since that last traumatic World
Cup night in Paris in July, when a billion viewers around the globe
stared in disbelief at the parody of his greatness, the Brazilian
has managed four appearances on the field.
</P>
<P>
   He is anything but a cheat. He knows nothing but the game. He
plays it to the limits his body allows, and when his body allows
those limits are beyond the physical and mental capability of any
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday night, in a match against AC Milan, the San Siro was
throbbing with 80,000 fans. Fleetingly they saw the best of
Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
   He burst with that unrivaled turn of acceleration between two
opponents, scored with unerring accuracy, and then struggled
through a pained anonymity that lasted until halftime, when he had
to surrender, again, to knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that both his knees are riddled with tendinitis; at
just 22 years of age we might already have seen the sustained best
of this phenomenal match winner.
</P>
<P>
   With Ronaldo sidelined, Inter, even though it has strikers Ivan
Zamorano, Roberto Baggio, Nicola Ventola, Youri Djorkaeff and
Andrea Pirlo to choose from, subsided to tie the derby game, 2-2,
albeit due to a dubious AC Milan penalty equalizer. By then,
Ronaldo could barely walk.
</P>
<P>
   It is a familiar state. The knees, the true cause of Ronaldo's
distress throughout the World Cup and throughout the year before
that, are casualties of the weight of games a player of his worth
is obliged to attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, in Serie A and in Europe, he played 47 games for
Inter. He also played 17 times, fit and half-fit, for Brazil as the
Brazilian soccer federation and Nike, which has contracts with both
Ronaldo and Brazil, held him to an obligation that, apart from the
matches, often imposes on him more air miles than the athletic body
should undertake.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts will tell him anything. His thighs are too big,
developing too much power and pace for the knee joints to bear.
</P>
<P>
   His journey through his adolescence, as he catapulted from
Cruzeiro to PSV Eindhoven to Barcelona and to Milan, has made him
and his inevitable agents among the richest in the sport _ feeding
off a reported annual income from wages, bonuses and sponsorships
of $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo in motion is worth a lot of money. Inert, the Brazilian
is a huge drain on resources.
</P>
<P>
   It was in one of his chats with Massimo Moratti, the oil magnate
who has revived Inter, that the idea of Ronaldo's buying into the
club took shape.
</P>
<P>
   In Ronaldo's closeted life, there are not enough Ferraris, not
enough video screens or computer games to absorb all his income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronaldo buying into the club is not a sentimental thing,''
Moratti said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a game. The club balance sheet is $35 million in the
red, a significant but not a frightening amount given the market
value of the overburdened playing staff Moratti has accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all our financial advisers say things will turn round very
quickly, especially with the changes in UEFA club competitions,''
Moratti said. ``I will be selling Ronaldo 69 percent of my family's
stake in the club.'' He would then be no ordinary
worker-shareholder, rather a potential future president of Inter.
</P>
<P>
   There is sport, there is business, and rapidly since the freedom
of contract that came with the Jean-Marc Bosman ruling there is an
inexorable merger of the two. One day, it would come to this, the
team's star player is wealthier than the club.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, more than any place, welcomes back the sons of the
playing field into the corridors of ownership and power. But the
precedents suggest that it happens after the playing career is
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo would be unique _ the boss and part owner while still
the star performer. Who would decide what risks to take with his
physical welfare then? Who could drop him, who could call time on
his playing career, who would dare suggest that his performances
are self indulgent, or lazy or at odds with team needs?
</P>
<P>
   There have long been critics who moan that Ronaldo runs too
little, that he spares himself the drudgery of effort and rests on
his laurels between fantastic cameos of his art. Maybe they are
right, or maybe those ``rests'' are periods when he is gathering
himself to crash through the pain barrier.
</P>
<P>
   He is enviable. He has come from poverty to celebrity, so who,
apart from his mother, his fiancee and possibly his president,
wants to hear of his suffering?
</P>
<P>
   Be quiet, Ronaldo, go count your money and your pains elsewhere.
Join the exclusive club of injured star performers. It's the price
they pay for the maladministration of those presidents who want
more even than a pound of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe around the year 2006, President Ronaldo will understand
the difference between break-even and breaking point. &QL;

Zamorano, Roberto Baggio, Nicola Ventola, Youri Djorkaeff and
Andrea Pirlo to choose from, subsided to tie the derby game, 2-2,
albeit due to a dubious AC Milan penalty equalizer. By then,
Ronaldo could barely walk.
</P>
<P>
   It is a familiar state. The knees, the true cause of Ronaldo's
distress throughout the World Cup and throughout the year before
that, are casualties of the weight of games a player of his worth
is obliged to attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, in Serie A and in Europe, he played 47 games for
Inter. He also played 17 times, fit and half-fit, for Brazil as the
Brazilian soccer federation and Nike, which has contracts with both
Ronaldo and Brazil, held him to an obligation that, apart from the
matches, often imposes on him more air miles than the athletic body
should undertake.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts will tell him anything. His thighs are too big,
developing too much power and pace for the knee joints to bear.
</P>
<P>
   His journey through his adolescence, as he catapulted from
Cruzeiro to PSV Eindhoven to Barcelona and to Milan, has made him
and his inevitable agents among the richest in the sport _ feeding
off a reported annual income from wages, bonuses and sponsorships
of $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo in motion is worth a lot of money. Inert, the Brazilian
is a huge drain on resources.
</P>
<P>
   It was in one of his chats with Massimo Moratti, the oil magnate
who has revived Inter, that the idea of Ronaldo's buying into the
club took shape.
</P>
<P>
   In Ronaldo's closeted life, there are not enough Ferraris, not
enough video screens or computer games to absorb all his income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronaldo buying into the club is not a sentimental thing,''
Moratti said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a game. The club balance sheet is $35 million in the
red, a significant but not a frightening amount given the market
value of the overburdened playing staff Moratti has accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all our financial advisers say things will turn round very
quickly, especially with the changes in UEFA club competitions,''
Moratti said. ``I will be selling Ronaldo 69 percent of my family's
stake in the club.'' He would then be no ordinary
worker-shareholder, rather a potential future president of Inter.
</P>
<P>
   There is sport, there is business, and rapidly since the freedom
of contract that came with the Jean-Marc Bosman ruling there is an
inexorable merger of the two. One day, it would come to this, the
team's star player is wealthier than the club.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, more than any place, welcomes back the sons of the
playing field into the corridors of ownership and power. But the
precedents suggest that it happens after the playing career is
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo would be unique _ the boss and part owner while still
the star performer. Who would decide what risks to take with his
physical welfare then? Who could drop him, who could call time on
his playing career, who would dare suggest that his performances
are self indulgent, or lazy or at odds with team needs?
</P>
<P>
   There have long been critics who moan that Ronaldo runs too
little, that he spares himself the drudgery of effort and rests on
his laurels between fantastic cameos of his art. Maybe they are
right, or maybe those ``rests'' are periods when he is gathering
himself to crash through the pain barrier.
</P>
<P>
   He is enviable. He has come from poverty to celebrity, so who,
apart from his mother, his fiancee and possibly his president,
wants to hear of his suffering?
</P>
<P>
   Be quiet, Ronaldo, go count your money and your pains elsewhere.
Join the exclusive club of injured star performers. It's the price
they pay for the maladministration of those presidents who want
more even than a pound of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe around the year 2006, President Ronaldo will understand
the difference between break-even and breaking point. &QL;

   LONDON _ Ronaldo, the best and too often the least active soccer
player in the world, is preparing for his future. He is not buying
a pension, as you or I might, but buying the club that pays his
breathtaking salary.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo's wages are so high that the player might own a
controlling share in Internazionale of Milan before his playing
days are done.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, rich, troubled Ronaldo. Since that last traumatic World
Cup night in Paris in July, when a billion viewers around the globe
stared in disbelief at the parody of his greatness, the Brazilian
has managed four appearances on the field.
</P>
<P>
   He is anything but a cheat. He knows nothing but the game. He
plays it to the limits his body allows, and when his body allows
those limits are beyond the physical and mental capability of any
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday night, in a match against AC Milan, the San Siro was
throbbing with 80,000 fans. Fleetingly they saw the best of
Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
   He burst with that unrivaled turn of acceleration between two
opponents, scored with unerring accuracy, and then struggled
through a pained anonymity that lasted until halftime, when he had
to surrender, again, to knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that both his knees are riddled with tendinitis; at
just 22 years of age we might already have seen the sustained best
of this phenomenal match winner.
</P>
<P>
   With Ronaldo sidelined, Inter, even though it has strikers Ivan
Zamorano, Roberto Baggio, Nicola Ventola, Youri Djorkaeff and
Andrea Pirlo to choose from, subsided to tie the derby game, 2-2,
albeit due to a dubious AC Milan penalty equalizer. By then,
Ronaldo could barely walk.
</P>
<P>
   It is a familiar state. The knees, the true cause of Ronaldo's

   HOMESTEAD, Fla. _ In the six years since Hurricane Andrew
devastated this agricultural city south of Miami, officials here
have struggled to jump-start the economy. But nature seems to be
against Homestead, again, as plans for turning the closed Homestead
Air Force Base into a commercial airport _ a major project that
could bring dollars and jobs _ have bogged down over the possible
environmental damage to two nearby national parks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After first winning approval from the Federal Aviation
Administration, the airport plan is now undergoing further study to
address concerns about how Biscayne National Park, two miles east
of the base, and Everglades National Park, 10 miles to the west,
would be affected by noise, air and water pollution from their new
neighbor and the development expected to surround it. Plans call
for the airport to handle more than 200,000 flights a year for
passengers and cargo and attract new industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County officials have promoted the airport plan as a
way of relieving some of the traffic at Miami International
Airport, 30 miles to the north, while helping to revitalize the
area. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew inflicted more than $400 million in
economic losses to the region; the Homestead Air Force Base, which
provided about 5,000 military and civilian jobs, was so badly
damaged that it had to close. In 1994 the base was converted into
an Air Force Reserves installation with about 2,000 people that now
occupies about a third of the former base's 3,000 acres. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were crippled twice, all in one night,'' said Homestead
Mayor Steve Shiver, who governs this city of about 25,000 residents
in the heart of Miami-Dade County's farmland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important,'' he said, referring to the airport.
``It's not the single savior but it definitely puts us on the right
track.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal studies to transfer 1,600 acres of the base to the
county found the site compatible with a commercial regional
airport, and the redevelopment plans won Miami-Dade County approval
in 1996. But the federal government's environmental report came
under attack from conservationists for failing to adequately
address the effects on Biscayne National Park, a 180,000-acre
aquatic park that is almost entirely under water, and Everglades
National Park, a wilderness park on 1.5 million acres of sawgrass
marshes, pineland, and mangrove and cypress swamps.
</P>
<P>
   Critics see the airport proposal as undermining the federal
government's own multimillion-dollar restoration project to
preserve the Everglades. The opponents, including the Sierra Club
and the National Audubon Society, contend that noise from passenger
jets would surpass what the National Park Service considers
acceptable. They also worry about degradation of water quality in
Biscayne Bay, fuel dumping and collisions with birds. Already, they
note, the air base is undergoing a petroleum cleanup after the U.S.
Environmental Agency placed it on a priority list of polluted
properties in 1990. Airport proponents counter that today's
environmental laws would prevent such contamination again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Browder, a longtime Everglades conservationist who now
lives in Washington, says the county should promote the area's
natural offerings through eco-tourism and develop hotels and homes
and the kind of tourism facilities that one would expect to find in
such a place: ``Instead of capitalizing on a location with two
world-class national parks, the county wants to turn that area into
an industrial complex.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The environmental concerns have led the Air Force and the FAA to
review the project again, and the scope of the new study has been
expanded to consider adverse effects on agriculture and tourism,
air travel safety and traffic. The study is also looking into
alternative uses for the site, including a theme park, a marine
research center, a space launching facility, and other government
and military use. Public hearings will be held on the study when it
is completed, sometime next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County officials say they still hope to achieve their
goal, with minimal impact to the surroundings. They say they have
been looking for 14 years for a site to accommodate overflow from
Miami International but have not found it. None of the county's
three general aviation airports, which include one in Homestead,
can be expanded, they said, because of their proximity to
residential and business areas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The county has committed $25 million to the Homestead airport
project for a new terminal and renovations. ``You already have an
airfield there,'' said Sandy O'Neil, an adviser to Miami-Dade
County Mayor Alex Penelas. ``It's not like we're going into the
middle of the forest to build an airport.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Since January, no story has seemed more
engrossing to American audiences, or more illustrative of American
immaturity, than the saga of the president and the intern. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, even as pictures of Monica Lewinsky eclipsed those of
Princess Diana and Leonardo DiCaprio on the newsstands, I heard
once again the two-century-old cliche that Americans are puerile
and puritanical.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, as the principal victims of a media culture that has
spread throughout the world, Americans appeared to be hypnotized by
the tales of presidential sex in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of my European friends regarded the American
fixation on the scandal as a menace to international stability,
since it threatened to remove from office the leader of the world's
only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   They also saw it as a symptom of how the American media turns it
audiences at home, and potentially abroad, into passive receptacles
for hype and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Election Day, America's infantile obsessions mysteriously
vanished. Did the American voter turn out to be a European-style
adult after all? Was the electorate willing at last to distinguish
between a president's private life, and his public policies? Or did
European critics and American pundits alike overestimate the power
of the media to influence what people think and how they act?
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly true that for nearly a year Americans have been
deluged with stories about President Bill Clinton's misbehavior,
and with prophecies of his imminent resignation or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings and sales figures do not lie. The weekly newsmagazines,
as well as CNN and MSNBC, all saw their audiences expand with each
sensational revelation. The presidential ``crisis'' became a staple
for radio talk-show hosts and for the more solemn interviews with
politicians on the Sunday morning television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood contributed to the pandemonium. Although the movie
version of ``Primary Colors'' was more successful at attracting
publicity than at seducing ticket-buyers, ``Wag the Dog'' entered
the lexicon as a scenario for using war to distract attention from
White House improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   The election's astonishing results do not necessarily signify
that Americans are indifferent to the sexual transgressions of
their leaders. But the results do suggest that the U.S.
communications industry has far less impact on audiences than is
usually claimed by those who fear the global ascendancy of American
mass culture.
</P>
<P>
   People in America (and in other countries, too) are not
permanently plugged in to their television sets or the Internet.
They spend much of their time doing, and caring about, other
things.
</P>
<P>
   They are swayed not by the media's preoccupations but by their
own concerns _ by how they were raised, by the opinions of their
peers, by the pressures they encounter at work and at home.
</P>
<P>
   What the election also indicates is that people are selective in
their reactions to mass culture. Audiences tend to be skeptical,
accepting some information while distrusting most of what they
hear. It is not just that people reinterpret the media's messages
to suit their needs. More often, they simply discard whatever has
no relevance to their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   This mistrust of the media may be a sign not only of America's
growing maturity, but also of its loss of faith in heroes of all
kinds.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA tests showing that Thomas Jefferson had an affair with a
slave have not endangered his place in the pantheon of American
political leaders. But the news does make him appear more human,
and thus more Clintonesque.
</P>
<P>
   As for the decline in the stature of journalists, recall the
scene that ends the movie ``All the President's Men.'' Robert
Redford and Dustin Hoffman, Hollywood's incarnations of Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein, are pounding away at their typewriters
while on a television screen Richard Nixon's presidency is seen to
disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the media's power never seemed more noble. Today, its
ability to shape events has never seemed more negligible. &QL;

   Hollywood contributed to the pandemonium. Although the movie
version of ``Primary Colors'' was more successful at attracting
publicity than at seducing ticket-buyers, ``Wag the Dog'' entered
the lexicon as a scenario for using war to distract attention from
White House improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   The election's astonishing results do not necessarily signify
that Americans are indifferent to the sexual transgressions of
their leaders. But the results do suggest that the U.S.
communications industry has far less impact on audiences than is
usually claimed by those who fear the global ascendancy of American
mass culture.
</P>
<P>
   People in America (and in other countries, too) are not
permanently plugged in to their television sets or the Internet.
They spend much of their time doing, and caring about, other
things.
</P>
<P>
   They are swayed not by the media's preoccupations but by their
own concerns _ by how they were raised, by the opinions of their
peers, by the pressures they encounter at work and at home.
</P>
<P>
   What the election also indicates is that people are selective in
their reactions to mass culture. Audiences tend to be skeptical,
accepting some information while distrusting most of what they
hear. It is not just that people reinterpret the media's messages
to suit their needs. More often, they simply discard whatever has
no relevance to their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   This mistrust of the media may be a sign not only of America's
growing maturity, but also of its loss of faith in heroes of all
kinds.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA tests showing that Thomas Jefferson had an affair with a
slave have not endangered his place in the pantheon of American
political leaders. But the news does make him appear more human,
and thus more Clintonesque.
</P>
<P>
   As for the decline in the stature of journalists, recall the
scene that ends the movie ``All the President's Men.'' Robert
Redford and Dustin Hoffman, Hollywood's incarnations of Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein, are pounding away at their typewriters
while on a television screen Richard Nixon's presidency is seen to
disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the media's power never seemed more noble. Today, its
ability to shape events has never seemed more negligible. &QL;

ALLEGED HIGH SCHOOL HIT SQUAD CHARGED IN MURDER CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Wis. _ Three teenage boys were charged with
conspiracy to commit murder Monday for allegedly fashioning
themselves into a high school hit squad, ready to take vengeance on
at least 15 fellow students, the principal and his assistant, a
teacher and a police officer they believed had wronged them.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said they suspended two other male students who
also were allegedly involved in plotting an armed assault at
Burlington High School that authorities said had been scheduled to
take place Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, freshmen and sophomores ages 15 and 16, were described
by fellow students as part of a clique of outcasts known as
``freaks'' or ``Goths.'' They allegedly assembled a target list out
of a desire to strike back, particularly at popular students they
felt had bullied them, according to police, city and school
officials. Their identities were not released because of their
ages.
</P>
<P>
   Their alleged plan _ which police said went far beyond a prank _
called for them to hold administrators hostage while forcing them
to lock the school building. Then, they planned to seek out
targeted students in classrooms ``and handle what they thought they
had to do,'' said police Lieutenant Gary Large.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively large number of students involved in the alleged
conspiracy stood in sharp contrast to other recent incidents of
school violence, most of which involved one or at most two
assailants. The size of the group ultimately may have been its
undoing: Police said the alleged plot unraveled when an informant
revealed the plan to school officials.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the five boys had not obtained weapons but were in
the process of trying to do so when they were arrested Sunday at
their homes. Police said one member of the group who had access to
guns backed out of the conspiracy, and the remaining plotters were
looking for alternative sources. Few here doubted they would find
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns are pretty easily accessible. There's a lot of hunting
that goes on,'' said Burlington Mayor Jeannie Hefty.
</P>
<P>
   News of the arrests, and fears that Burlington High School was
nearly added to the list of US schools smeared with the blood of
students and faculty, shook this sedate suburban community of 9,500
people 25 miles southwest of Milwaukee. About 220 of the school's
1,200 students were absent Monday, compared with 60 on a normal
day, and several more became distraught and left school early.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were crying, hugging today. All I could think
this morning was, `Oh God, what if I was on that list?'' said
senior Travis Smith, 17.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of the five boys reportedly had some previous
run-ins with police, but there was no indication they were members
of a gang or any other organized group. Rather, fellow students
said the boys seemed drawn together in loose-knit camaraderie by
their shared status as social misfits, dressing in black, shaving
portions of their hair, wearing dark eye makeup and attaching
headless stuffed animals to their backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Julia Kraschnewski said the boys were frequent foils for
popular school athletes, who would taunt them in study hall. ``They
got picked on a lot. They were different, not in with the popular
crowd,'' said Kraschnewski, 17, secretary of the Student Council.
</P>
<P>
   Students and teachers said a pall was cast over the school
Monday, with none of the usual high-spirited banter in classes or
hallways. Late in the afternoon, however, one student ran toward a
friend yelling: ``Bang, bang, bang, you're dead.'' Then, the two
laughed, and the joker said, ``Nah, you're not on my list.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just the kind of black humor administrators had hoped
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hitting Burlington that we're part of this big
world, and there are going to be bad things that happen here. It's
an unfortunate way some kids are resolving their anger, through
violence,'' said Principal Jose Martinez, who allegedly was among
the students' targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned for myself, my safety, but I'm more concerned
for the students and for my own children,'' said Martinez, whose
two sons attend the school, one as a senior and the other an
eighth-grade student who comes to the high school for advanced math
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Police said in addition to Martinez the target list included
assistant principal Richard Peterson; police Sgt. Mark Johnston,
who patrols the school; a female teacher who has not been
identified; and 15 to 20 students from grades nine through 12.
Peter Smet, the school district's business manager, said the list
was allegedly discussed and agreed upon by the boys under arrest,
but police have no evidence it was written down.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he knew two of the five boys from minor discipline
problems, characterizing their misbehaviors as ``nothing out of the
ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefty, the city's mayor, said parents were calling for metal
detectors and other increased security measures at the school.
``There's a lot of stress and concern out there,'' she said.
``We're looking for some healing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Administrators and police scheduled a meeting at the school to
help calm the fears of parents and community members.
</P>
<P>
   The three students arrested were being held in a juvenile
detention facility in Racine. The other two were released into the
custody of their parents, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of violence here followed a bloody springtime at
schools elsewhere around the country, including a March 24 attack
in Jonesboro, Ark., in which two middle school students rang a
false fire alarm, then shot to death four girls and a teacher, and
wounded 10 others. Both were convicted of murder in juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Dwyer, president-elect of the National Association of
School Psychologists, said it was possible the alleged Burlington
conspirators were swept up in a ``mob mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids will drink more together than alone, they'll engage in
more illegal behavior as a group,'' Dwyer said. ``Males have a
propensity for this, particularly teenage males.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer said one lesson from all the school shootings is the need
for early intervention. ``If kids are being bullied and picked on
because they are small, or because of their sexual orientation, or
their race, or because they're poor in a wealthy school district,
or for any reason, and if people know about it and don't intervene,
then this kind of thing can happen,'' Dwyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If schools don't address these problems early on, they fester,
and if they fester they can explode,'' he added. ``If we do
intervene early, we'll reduce the number of cases. They won't go
away, but maybe there'll be fewer.''

STATES OFFER TOBACCO COMPANIES $206 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As state prosecutors unveiled details of a proposed
$206 billion deal to settle lawsuits against the tobacco industry,
President Clinton Monday endorsed the agreement, but called on
Congress to pass its own tough anti-tobacco regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger met with
anti-smoking advocates and came under renewed pressure to reject
the deal, which would settle state claims against tobacco companies
for the cost of treating tobacco-related illness. But Harshbarger
gave no indication of whether he would join the settlement or
continue with plans to prosecute cigarette makers in state court.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at a White House appearance with attorneys general who
negotiated the deal, called the proposed settlement ``a milestone
in the long struggle to protect our children from tobacco. . . . It
reflects the first time tobacco companies will be held financially
accountable for the damage their product does to our nation's
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some public health advocates, however, said the deal might kill
any momentum for Congress for anti-tobacco measures that are not
included in the state settlement. Others said the states themselves
could have won better terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a settlement,'' said John Garrison, chief executive
of the American Lung Association. ``It is a partnership agreement
between the tobacco companies and the attorneys general that allows
Big Tobacco to continue its nefarious business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal between state prosecutors and four major cigarette
companies was reached on Saturday, but new details became known
Monday as attorneys general from the states that led the
negotiating discussed the settlement in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the agreement would strip cigarette-makers
of a variety of tools that critics say are used to market tobacco
to youths. Tobacco companies would no longer advertise on
billboards, use cartoon characters in their ads, or distribute
apparel with cigarette logos. They would also face new restrictions
on sponsoring sporting events and handing out free samples.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the tobacco industry would also spend $1.5
billion over five years on anti-smoking ads, as well as $250
million on a foundation to reduce teen smoking. It would also
disband the Tobacco Institute and other industry support and
lobbying groups.
</P>
<P>
   The industry would make payments to states indefinitely into the
future, worth $206 billion in the first 25 years. Massachusetts
would receive about $7.6 billion, adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The amount would fall, however, if the industry sells fewer
cigarettes in the future, and it would rise if it sells more
cigarettes. The amount paid to states would also fall if Congress
passed new laws that take money from the tobacco industry and pass
it to states for public health programs.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is open to 46 states whether or not they filed lawsuits
against the tobacco industry. States must decide whether to sign on
by noon Friday. Because cigarette makers want to eliminate their
risk from state lawsuits, they may walk away from the settlement if
not enough states sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Four states are excluded _ Mississippi, Florida, Texas and
Minnesota _ because they have already settled suits against the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal comes five months after a more comprehensive,
$368.5 billion agreement to settle state lawsuits died in Congress.
That failure prompted state prosecutors to craft a narrower
settlement this time that needs no approval from lawmakers _ only
from states, tobacco companies, and judges presiding over state
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new proposal does not include some
anti-tobacco restrictions that were included in the first proposal,
but which require federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, state prosecutors said Monday, only Congress can
fine tobacco companies for failing to reduce the number of teens
who take up smoking, and only Congress can force the industry to
recover the cost of its payments to states by raising the price of
cigarettes. Anti-smoking advocates want that provision, arguing
that higher cigarette prices would discourage teens from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Monday called on Congress to pass its own
``comprehensive national tobacco legislation,'' but he listed only
two items that should be in the bill: protection for tobacco
farmers and a ``clarification'' of the authority of the Food and
Drug Administration to regulate tobacco. Separately, the Clinton
administration Monday said it would ask the Supreme Court to review
whether the FDA can regulate tobacco under existing law.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, who filed suit against the tobacco industry in
1995, Monday said he wanted to study the deal and to consult with
state public health advocates before deciding whether to sign on.
``The proposed settlement is not all that I had hoped for when it
comes to protecting our children and improving the public health,''
he said in a written statement. ``The decision I must make now is
whether this is the best Massachusetts can do or whether more can
be achieved at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has what is considered to be one of the strongest
cases against the tobacco industry. But aides to Harshbarger
pointed out that jurors in a similar Minnesota case, which was
settled out of court, said afterward that they doubted they would
have awarded much money to the state.

 &HT;      WATTS CLAIMS HE HAS THE VOTES TO KNOCK OFF BOEHNER
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ronald F. Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 -- Oklahoma Congressman J.C. Watts now
believes he has more than enough votes to knock John Boehner out of
his leadership position in the House of Representatives. The West
Chester Republican's camp, however, is not ready to give up its
perch as the GOP's fourth-ranking member.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Tobi Edwards, Watts' spokeswoman, said her boss now
has the support of more than half the Republican congressmen in his
quest to unseat Boehner as chairman of the House Republican
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case,'' Boehner spokesman John Schnittger said
of Watts' vote count, ``when John wins on Wednesday we can call him
the 'Comeback Kid.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 223 members of the conference will choose their leadership
team for the 106th Congress tomorrow (Nov. 18).
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at 100 (votes) late last week, and J.C. just kept
calling members all weekend. We feel like we have a pretty solid
113,'' Edwards said. ``But we are not going to take this for
granted. This is still politics, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Most insiders said Watts would be wise to keep working the
phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are secret ballot votes. There is a lot of lying going
on,'' observed Norman Ornstein, congressional scholar for the
conservative American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Democrat Rosa DeLauro learned that lesson the hard
way Monday, when the Democrats voted for their new leaders. DeLauro
had claimed commitments from 108 members voting in her race for
Democratic Caucus chair -- but she lost to Martin Frost of Texas,
109-97 with five Democrats abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner's team is conceding nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe John will have a successful
re-election,'' said Boehner spokesman Dave Schnittger. ``These
contests always boil down to the relationships between the
candidates and each member. ... We are comfortable with the
commitments we have gotten. Our relationships are more than enough
to compensate for anyone's spin.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if Boehner loses? Some have speculated he may retire
from Congress altogether rather than return to the GOP rank and
file.
</P>
<P>
   Schnittger refused to entertain that question, answering,
``There is a sense we are right where we want to be and are looking
forward to the vote on Wednesday.''

SMALLER, OLDER CROWD CHEERS GLENN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a dim echo of the last time John Glenn took a
ticker-tape parade through the Canyon of Heroes, but how could it
have been otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   The parade Monday celebrating Glenn's second trip to outer space
was attended by a crowd that was much smaller, quieter, and older
than the teeming throngs of the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn returned from that first space flight, 37 years ago, as an
authentic war hero. Granted, it was the Cold War _ the race for
space with the Soviets _ and not a shooting war. But the stakes
were as high and the physical dangers as real.
</P>
<P>
   So no wonder that, on March 1, 1962, roughly 4 million citizens
braved sub-freezing temperatures to turn out for Glenn's first
parade, packing the sidewalks of Broadway from Battery Park to City
Hall _ the mile-long route that heroes have marched or motored up
for more than a century _ to roar their thankful acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   However, Glenn's second voyage came after dozens of space
shuttle flights. Orbiting the earth is now considered dully
routine.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's very presence on this flight at the age of 77 gave it a
very different, but no less remarkable, theme _ that an old
space-hoofer can still get blasted off the planet. It was a paean
to lost dreams and recovered youth. You can go home again.
</P>
<P>
   The whole phenomenon has not only been a high-five for Americans
of Glenn's generation, many of whom feel discarded by a society
that treats them as ready for nothing but the rest home.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been a soothing balm for the baby-boomers, who are
old enough to remember Glenn's first flight and are just now
beginning to experience the anxieties of backaches, joint pains,
and conjugal fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   So no wonder that most of the people who turned out for Monday's
parade were old or middle-aged, clapping and beaming as if they
understood all too clearly that the parade was as much for them as
for any astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   Schools chancellor Rudy Crews had announced late last week that
pupils could skip class to come to the parade, but few under-40s
bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a couple of hundred thousand people lined the street to
wave and cheer. Office workers dumped four tons of confetti out
their skyscraper windows.
</P>
<P>
   These are small numbers compared with those of Glenn's first
parade _ about one-twentieth the turnout and one one-hundredth the
bulk of shredded-paper _ though, then again, not bad, given the low
key of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   It was a quiet bunch by other standards, too. Just last month,
when the New York Yankees covered the same parade route after
winning the World Series, the roar of the crowd, ringing off the
walls of the buildings, made the street sound like a jet plane on a
runway. Monday there were cheers and hurrahs, but nothing loud
enough to carry as far as a block.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Glenn seemed pleased, smiling and waving while
riding in a classic 1952 Phaeton convertible, dressed in his blue
NASA flight suit, his wife Annie at his side, smiling and waving,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani awarded the keys of the city
to Glenn and his six fellow space shuttle astronauts _ the most
anonymous collaborators since Anthony Russo helped Daniel Ellsberg
steal the Pentagon Papers.
</P>
<P>
   The clearest signal that this was a parade of nostalgic hope was
the presence, on the award ceremony's dias, of Walter Cronkite, the
retired TV newsmen who did as much as anyone to promote America's
space program _ and who remains enshrined, in the boomers' memories
especially, as a sort of national father-figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Glenn shows...that older Americans are vibrant
contributors to our society,'' Cronkite, now 83, proclaimed. Glenn,
he added, echoing what Martin Luther King once said about color,
``is defined not by his age but by his character.''

   After months of angling for a lucrative book deal and a
television forum, Monica Lewinsky has finally signed agreements for
an interview with Barbara Walters of ABC News and for the
publication of a book from St. Martin's Press tentatively titled,
``Monica's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lewinsky settled on a British and an American
publisher to tell her side of the scandal that followed her affair
with President Clinton, but at a price that is more modest than the
millions once predicted _ a $600,000 advance plus bonuses for
bestseller rankings. The book, which will be published in February,
will be written by Andrew Morton, the author of a best-selling book
about Diana, Princess of Wales. Ms. Lewinsky also has signed an
agreement to talk to Ms. Walters on the program 20/20 for which she
will not be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said she had met with Ms. Lewinsky twice, both times
within the last couple of weeks. Their agreement, which Ms.
Lewinsky signed Friday, gives Ms. Walters exclusive rights to the
first television interview, and prohibits ABC from selling that
interview outside North America, so that Ms. Lewinsky's
representatives can negotiate other interviews for her in other
countries and grant exclusivity in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Richard Hofstetter, said that ``Monica
received offers of more than $5 million and turned them down.'' He
would not identify the companies that had made such offers, but
there were reports that Ms. Lewinsky's representative had gone far
in negotiations with the tabloid show, ``Hard Copy,'' the day-time
talk show host, Oprah Winfrey and News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives said that she had asked for $2 million, but they
were willing to pay less than half that.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said that Lewinsky will reveal a side of herself
that has not been apparent from the reams of grand jury testimony
that has was released by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not silly. She is well-spoken. She is intelligent,''
Ms. Walters said, adding, ``There's a lot not in the record _ what
this year has been like for her, what it felt like when the
president made his statements, her reaction, her views on the
various people involved, the jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear if there are any restrictions on Ms. Lewinsky
that would limit her from speaking out. In an immunity deal she
signed with prosecutors last summer, Ms. Lewinsky agreed that she
would not speak to any news organizations without the consent of
the independent counsel while the inquiry into President Clinton's
actions was proceeding. Recently Ms. Lewinsky, who has faced
mounting legal bills, had renewed her request to the independent
counsel's office for permission to grant interviews. Charles G.
Bakaly III, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, declined to
comment Monday on whether Ms. Lewinsky would be allowed to speak
now or under what conditions.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press, which has paid more for books like ``The
Arthritis Cure,'' reached an agreement with Ms. Lewinsky after a
week-long flurry of negotiations for the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general theme will be how a young woman comes to
Washington, has a relationship with the president and then what she
went through from there, said John Sargent, the chief executive of
St. Martin's Press, who described Ms. Lewinsky as a ``pawn in
Washington power games.''
</P>
<P>
   The project grew out of a torturous and often public search for
a publisher that would pay handsomely for Ms. Lewinsky's story and
ended with a deal at St. Martin's Press. The deal was struck
despite Sargent's public comments ten months earlier that he didn't
think her tale merited a book. ``Do you want to read a whole book
by Monica?'' he asked in February.
</P>
<P>
   At various times, Ms. Lewinsky's asking price for a book varied
from $2 million to $10 million depending on which trial balloon
surfaced in various publications. Judith Regan, the maverick
publisher of Regan Books, had estimated that the title could
command an advance up to $5 million and until recently she was
negotiating a deal that would have included books and television
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the top publishing houses that could afford a
generous advance remained reluctant to sign a book because of fears
that she had nothing left to reveal, particularly after the
publication of the report by the office of the independent counsel
and the events that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The book deal finally came together through the efforts of a
British publisher, Michael O'Mara Books, which sold St. Martin's
Press the rights to publish the book in the United States while
retaining the rights to publish the title in the rest of the world.
The company publishes the books of Morton, whose book about Diana
candidly described her unraveling royal life.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Mara, the publisher, said that initially he was not
interested in publishing a book about Ms. Lewinsky. The idea was
first broached to him by a British television program, which was
seeking to package a television interview along with a book to be
written by a ghost writer that he characterized as a ``nobody.''
After he declined to participate, O'Mara said that Ms. Lewinsky's
attorney, Hofstetter, called him about a week ago to ask him about
the rejection and then the conversation shifted to other potential
authors, such as Morton, who, as it turns out, was interested.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, Morton and O'Mara met Ms. Lewinsky at the
officers of her lawyer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one terrific discussion and we discussed that Monica
Lewinsky as a human being is actually completely a different
person: lively, intelligent, very well-spoken, a typical American
girl. They clicked, very loudly, and they were making progress on
the book before he signed,'' O'Mara said.
</P>
<P>
   Several publishing executives with knowledge of the negotiations
said that O'Mara had approached other publishers to gauge their
interest. Her advance for North American rights, the primary market
for a book by Monica Lewinsky, amounted to more than $600,000
against royalties, a sum that could climb to a million if the books
earns bonuses for making bestseller lists.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Martin's Press, the publisher will be rushing to produce
the book as fast as it can, according to Sargent, who said the book
will essentially be Morton's view of what happened to Ms. Lewinsky.
Morton will be the sole author.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters made it clear that Ms. Lewinsky is not getting any
form of compensation for her appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No money, no other deals,'' said Ms. Walters. ``No Disney
movie, no show on Lifetime, and not for putting out any videos. We
were very meticulous because we knew we'd be scrutinized and we
read all the rumors'' about potential under-the-table compensation
for Ms. Lewinsky, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said it was her belief that Ms. Lewinsky had spurned
``enormous amounts of money'' from Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is giving her credit for doing this interview out of
desire to maintain her credibility and for turning down millions,
millions from Fox,'' she said.

SEN. KENNEDY GEARING UP FOR 2000 ELECTION FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hoping to forestall the sharp political challenge he
faced in 1994, US Senator Edward M. Kennedy is already laying the
groundwork for his year 2000 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, Kennedy has seemingly been everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He campaigned across the state with Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger during the gubernatorial election run, then showed up
with Governor Paul Cellucci scarcely a week after the election for
a bit of bipartisan jawboning of HMOs on seniors' prescription drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday alone, Kennedy appeared at two events with Boston
Mayor Thomas Menino, and on Friday was at a $1,000-a-head
fundraiser at the Boston Harbor Hotel that netted about $80,000.
Monday, Kennedy joined nephew, US Representative Joseph P. Kennedy
II in Boston to highlight the problems of hunger in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, and what you have is a 66-year-old seventh-term
term senator taking nothing for granted as he seeks a six-year
extension of his senatorial lease.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kennedy wasn't joking after all when, in an election-night
call made to US Representative Martin Meehan, he quipped that with
Meehan now safely re-elected he could finally get a little
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week if he was gearing up early for the 2000
campaign, Kennedy replied: ``We never stopped from the last one.
... We have always taken elections seriously, and we are taking
this next one seriously too.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Kennedy's efforts are not just an early offense,
but also a preventative defense. Friends and associates say his
true goal is to preclude the sort of challenge he faced in 1994,
when venture capitalist Mitt Romney put together a well-funded,
hard-hitting campaign that gave the long-time senator a real scare.
In the end, Kennedy won, 58 percent to 41 percent, but only with
the help of a negative ad campaign that played fast and loose with
the facts of Romney's business career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important to show early on that he is
extraordinarily strong in the state, and it may be in the end no
one of any real consequence will run against him,'' said Phil
Johnston, former regional director of Health and Human Services and
a close Kennedy family ally.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Kennedy, who had to borrow several million to fund
his $12 million 1994 campaign, has already started his fundraising
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made a lot of calls already, and he has people all
around the country calling around to do fundraisers for him,'' said
one Democratic Party loyalist.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Kennedy's current team has been far more conscious of
the need to be prepared than the low-key crew that seemed to coast
unaware into the 1994 malestrom. Bad publicity from the 1991 rape
trial of nephew William Kennedy Smith, and the spotlight it shed on
Kennedy's drinking, raised doubts about the senator in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That lesson hit home: As far back as the summer of 1997, the
Kennedy's political advisers were discussing ways to keep the sex
scandal that started with his nephew Michael's tryst with a teenage
sitter from affecting his own fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Kennedy's death, that controversy has ended. But as
Kennedy heads toward a new campaign, there is another potential
family image problem on the horizon. Connecticut prosecutors appear
to be focusing on Michael Skakel, nephew of Kennedy's sister-in-law
Ethel Kennedy, as the lead suspect in the 1975 murder of Greenwich
teenager Martha Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, whose family hasn't cooperated with the probe, worked as
an aide in Kennedy's 1994 re-election campaign and later at
Citizens Energy Corp., the nonprofit firm Michael Kennedy ran.
Still, that matter is far more removed from Kennedy than was the
Palm Beach controversy, which cast the senator himself in an
unfavorable light.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's determined activity hasn't been lost on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kennedy had the scare of his life four years ago, in a
race that was much closer than he was used to, or he ever thought
it would be,'' said Charles Manning, who worked for Romney in 1994.
``I think he is leaving nothing to chance this time, and that is
why you see him so active.''
</P>
<P>
   It's early to talk about a Republican challenger coming forward.
But in a party with only a handful of A-team players, prospects are
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurer Joseph D. Malone, who ran against Kennedy in 1988, is
sometimes mentioned, but Malone's camp says that's highly unlikely.
In 1997, former Governor William F. Weld gave Kennedy his word
won't run against him in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, speculation focuses on two possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Confidants say Andy Card, former US secretary of transportation
for President George Bush, will likely look at running. And
Republican sources say Romney, who has maintained a relatively high
profile since his 1994 loss to Kennedy, has also expressed interest
in a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitt has some interest, but he knows that if he ran and lost,
that would be it for him,'' said a top GOP source. ``He has said
that to do it, he would have to have a better chance of winning
than he did last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Day by day, Kennedy is doing his best to make sure that won't
happen.

   LONDON _ A leading arms control group is calling on all powers
to de-activate _ or ``de-couple'' in the jargon of Doomsday
planning _ their weapons, to avoid possible massive and hugely
perilous systems failures brought on by the so-called ``Millennium
bug.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report published Thursday, the British American Security
Information Council (BASIC) bluntly describes the Pentagon's
efforts to meet the fast-approaching deadline as ``a mess,'' with
what it calls ``severe and recurring problems across the
spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, it says, has for its part barely woken up to the year
2000, or Y2K, risk _ even though the general decay of its military
since the demise of the Soviet Union has made the danger even more
acute.
</P>
<P>
   For all the visible work already done to iron out the date
recognition problem, BASIC argues there is no way of knowing if
``embedded'' systems _ i.e. semi-independent
``systems-within-systems'' in the colossal American defense
apparatus _ are being straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   These could allow the YK2 bug to spread, unknown to America's
defense controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Repairing and testing affected systems could see costs ``in the
multibillion dollar category,'' with no guarantee of success. As
the U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said recently,
``Everything is so interconnected, it's very hard to know with any
precision that we've got it fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to BASIC, the biggest YK2 danger is not the ultimate
nightmare of nuclear weapons either launching or exploding because
of faulty computer information. Since it still requires human
authorization for a missile or warhead to be launched, this sort of
catastrophe is ``unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Far more likely, however, is the prospect of a leader, under
pressure from hairtrigger response mechanisms, pressing the nuclear
button on the basis of inaccurate data.
</P>
<P>
   This is the real significance of September's early warning
agreement between Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton in
Moscow, which BASIC would like to see leading to a joint and
independent nuclear warning center independent of the two national
defense bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Such a U.S.-Russian agreement should form the basis of a broader
pact between all nuclear weapons states, declared and undeclared.
Even so, given both sides' desire to keep a first-strike capacity,
the danger of a rogue launch would remain.
</P>
<P>
   Far better, says BASIC, to separate warheads from their delivery
vehicles, and thus dramatically increase the amount of time needed
to launch an attack. &QL;

 CELEBRATING CLAIRE McCARDELL

 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Staring out from a photograph taken when she was a
young woman, Claire McCardell resembles the ideal her fashions
would come to embody: an easy, confident, athletic American woman,
free and optimistic. McCardell's work is the subject of an
exhibition that opened recently at the Museum at the Fashion
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   McCardell is no mere historical curiosity. Her spirit was
inescapable in the spring 1999 collections shown by designers like
Anna Sui, Cynthia Rowley and Yeohlee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is easy to understand why Valerie Steele, the chief
curator at the FIT museum, was at first a reluctant booster of
McCardell. By themselves, her designs are underwhelming, lacking
the grandeur or panache of McCardell's contemporaries from the
1940s and '50s like Norman Norell, Christian Dior or even Coco
Chanel. Diana Vreeland, the fashion editor, who became a champion
of McCardell, once described a McCardell dress as pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes must be thought of in their historical context _
designs stretching back 40, 50 and even 60 years to an age of stiff
crinolines, padded shoulders and the dominance of French style.
Then, and only then, does McCardell look like the revolutionary she
was.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, her designs were featured in the ``American
Ingenuity'' show at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. But the FIT exhibition, ``Claire McCardell and the
American Look,'' which runs through Jan. 9, is an unusual and
welcome focus on her alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging over McCardell's career, the show includes illustrations
from 1927 and 1928, when McCardell, just starting out, sketched a
generic '20s look, to clothes of the 1950s, when she was a star
recognized for signature styles she called ``McCardellisms.''
</P>
<P>
   Further explanation is provided by a timely book, ``Claire
McCardell: Redefining Modernism'' (Harry N. Abrams) by Kohle
Yohannan and Nancy Nolf. Yohannan, a teacher at Parsons School of
Design, is also the curator of ``Claire McCardell: Forging an
American Style,'' which opened Oct. 8 and runs through April 18 at
the Maryland Historical Society, in Baltimore. (McCardell was born
in Maryland.)
</P>
<P>
   From the 1930s through the '50s, McCardell's casual, modern
clothes urged women toward greater freedom and flexibility in
fashion and promoted an aesthetic that Americans can now claim as
their own. Through McCardell, fashion kept abreast of changes like
jazz, realism, women's wartime emancipation and an optimistic
postwar nationalism. ``We look at her as the founder of democratic
American fashion,'' Ms. Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   McCardell's influence on contemporary fashion is both conceptual
and precise. What is remarkable about the outfits on display at FIT
is how appropriate many of them would be for today: an
urban-looking pair of black wool leggings, hooded top and striped
zippered anorak; an elegant brown one-shoulder column with twisted
strap; shorts for bicycling, and an evening shirtdress of men's
cotton ticking tied with a red sash.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was obviously a total tomboy and did a lot with men's
clothes,'' Ms. Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   A black cotton hooded coat with three patent-leather buckles
down the front, which McCardell designed about 1949, is
astonishingly up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
   Defining the waist of an unconstructed dress with a sash or
spaghetti strings tied around the waist or under the breasts became
one of McCardell's signatures, allowing women, she proclaimed,
greater freedom. Another style, the monastic or monk's dress, fell
unfettered from the shoulders, suited every body shape and was a
look McCardell would return to frequently.
</P>
<P>
   In their book, Yohannan and Ms. Nolf recount how during World
War II, a request to design a dress for newly busy housewives with
responsibilities in and outside the home resulted in McCardell's
first version of her famous popover dress. It was blue, had a
surplice neckline and came with a matching oven mitt. ``It started
as a wartime victory-garden cover-up,'' McCardell later said.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ingenious pairing of function and style, which marked
McCardell's design philosophy. The popover was literally meant to
be popped over a bathing suit, a pair of trousers or bare skin, or
worn as a coat.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive still, the dress sold in the thousands for $6.95
at a time when Norells, Mainbochers and Hattie Carnegies ran in the
hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It was McCardell who laid the bedrock of today's sportswear by
asking: What if ``a dress could be cut to pieces?'' And she
popularized the ballet slipper as a shoe because of wartime
rationing of leather.
</P>
<P>
   She was not alone in her embrace of effortless, sports-inspired
clothing. Tina Leser, Bonnie Cashin, Elizabeth Hawes and Tom
Brigance were proposing these ideas, too. And earlier, of course,
Paul Poiret and Chanel had dramatically freed women from
restrictive clothing. But no one else took it as far.
</P>
<P>
   McCardell spoke often and passionately about a need for clothes
that fit an American woman's lifestyle and athletic carriage. The
sashes and wide, soft leather belts, which she said were inspired
by kimonos or girdle belts worn by the ancient Greeks, were to
avoid zippers and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   She pioneered the use of humble fabrics like ticking stripes
from pajamas, calico, denim and chambray. Always adventurous,
McCardell used what were considered day fabrics, like men's
shirtings and wool, in evening wear, and wool in bathing suits. To
these fabrics she applied the most challenging design techniques,
many learned in France and culled from Madeleine Vionnet, whom she
admired all her life.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cynthia Rowley's clothes often impart more than a whiff
of the carefree, simple spirit of McCardell. ``The No. 1 thing is
that she took sportswear fabrics that were unexpected and made them
into things that were part of every wardrobe, like denim for
evening,'' Ms. Rowley said.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Rowley showed cashmere bikinis for spring two weeks
ago, she was following the late designer's lead. McCardell
famously, and with attendant scandal, made bathing suits more
revealing, suggesting that the era's swim dresses and corseted
swimsuits were unnecessarily restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   She predicted _ and to some extent, in her full cotton print
shirtdresses, toyed with _ the New Look of small waist and full
skirt, which was to sweep the fashion world in 1947, when all the
credit went to Dior.
</P>
<P>
   But McCardell did not want for attention. At her height of
power, she earned a Time magazine cover.
</P>
<P>
   In her spring 1999 collection, Anna Sui, who said she was not
familiar with McCardell until she heard about the planned
exhibition and subsequently researched her at FIT, showed such
McCardell-inspired pieces as shirts and ``crossover dresses'' of
nylon chambray, halter tops, wide rapper pants and Indian scarf
prints cut in square or diamond geometrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a revelation to me,'' Ms. Sui said. ``What I
truly appreciate was her fabric sensibility, even with more
constructed fabrics like denim. She made them all look so soft and
drapy. The halters she did were so modern. The thing is, you look
at some of the things she did, and you can't believe it was the
'40s.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Mizrahi's collections, including his last one now in the
stores, were rich with references to McCardell, like a red satin
ball gown with baby carrier, the '90s descendant of that first
kitchen popover dress. And in the approaches of Donna Karan, Calvin
Klein and Norma Kamali, one can see the refreshing breeze that
McCardell let into American fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion being elitist by nature, it is not surprising that
McCardell is rarely mentioned in any historical list of top
designers. The price of a garment and its luxuriousness have always
conspired to put designers of lush fashion like Dior, Norell and
Mainbocher ahead of those, like McCardell, who believe in
accessible style.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps, too, McCardell, who was born in 1905 and died of
cancer 53 years later, did her job to its fullest, presenting ideas
that have become so well digested into today's fashion that they do
not stand out.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``What Shall I Wear?'' published in 1955 by Simon &AMP;
Schuster, McCardell herself observed: ``Most of my ideas seem
startlingly self-evident. I wonder why I didn't think of them
before.''

 &HT;    Eyes roll, heads spin at mention of Super Bowl
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They're no longer playing for the division lead. They
have that. They're now playing to position themselves for something
that nobody dared mention three days ago, something that even now
barely seems conceivable. The Atlanta Falcons are playing for a
shot at the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1981, when Leeman Bennett's anointed Team of the '80s
unraveled years too soon, have those four words _ Atlanta Falcons,
Super Bowl _ been part of a credible sentence. Certainly no Falcons
coach since Bennett has fielded the question Dan Reeves was asked
Monday: Is yours a Super Bowl team?
</P>
<P>
   This is how Reeves, eight times a Super Bowler as player and
coach, answered: He gave a half-laugh and said, ``Certainly the
49ers are a Super Bowl team.'' And the Falcons, as you've heard,
just beat the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Then Reeves said something else: ``I'm asking the same question
myself.'' He left it hanging. He didn't say yes. More
significantly, he didn't say no.
</P>
<P>
   Among NFC teams, only Minnesota has a better record than the
Falcons. The Vikings have Green Bay, Dallas and Jacksonville still
to play. Of the Falcons' final six opponents, only Miami has a
winning record. ``People are talking about us running the table,''
said Reeves, being a coach, ``but we've got to go one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his team figures to be favored in its next six games.
(This assumes Chris Chandler and Jamal Anderson stay healthy.
Otherwise, yikes.) Let's say the Falcons win five of the six. That
would make them 13-3 and give them a realistic chance _ deep breath
now _ at holding home-field advantage through the NFC championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this is speculation so head-spinning as to warrant
cold compresses. ``My goal before the season was to make the
playoffs,'' Reeves said. ``(The Super Bowl) is beyond anything I
even dreamed about.'' That, however, was before the Falcons exposed
Carolina as a heralded fraud, before they won in the Meadowlands
and in Foxboro, before they outfought the 49ers in a show-me game.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are 8-2 without having won on a fluke. They're 8-2
and gathering strength as they go. There was jubilation after
beating San Francisco but no great surprise. ``This has been
well-earned,'' Reeves said. ``This has been well-earned. (The
players) aren't in awe of anybody. They don't go into a game
feeling it'll be lucky if we win.''
</P>
<P>
   There's precedent here: In 1988 the Cincinnati Bengals rose from
4-11 to the Super Bowl, improably coalescing around the Ickey
Shuffle, a dance as goofily convoluted as the Dirty Bird. ``I'm
being a little hesistant,'' Reeves said. ``I don't want to go
overboard. There's so little difference between winning and
losing.'' And sometimes that difference is that a team of modest
means catches a wave and rides clear into January.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it sounds wrong. A Super Bowl for the franchise hope
forgot? Get real. But here, as of Nov. 17, 1998, is reality: If the
Falcons keep winning they'll have a first-round bye and a home game
in Round 2; win Round 2 and they'll be playing for the NFC title;
play for the NFC title and they're on the cusp of Superdom.
</P>
<P>
   Another compress, please.

<P>
   Why is there a new crisis in the Gulf?
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 Gulf War the U.N. told Iraq to disclose what
preparations it had made to build weapons of mass destruction, and
dismantle them. But it has fought against this regime for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Iraq severely limited the activities of U.N. weapons
inspectors and, earlier this month, it halted them altogether. It
demanded an end to U.N. sanctions, but the U.S. blocked this. Now
the U.S. and Britain are threatening to attack unless Iraq lets the
weapons inspectors start their work again.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the latest of his famous miscalculations, Saddam
Hussein expected Clinton to lose the midterm elections, and thought
that impending impeachment would leave the discredited president no
choice but to let him get away with it. Instead the opposite is
true.
</P>
<P>
   Can the U.S. and Britain strike at any time?
</P>
<P>
   It is arguable whether they need further U.N. approval. The U.S.
tends to argue that it doesn't, because the original U.N.
resolutions contain all the authorization necessary, whereas
Britain leans towards gathering as much diplomatic support as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   How likely is major military action?
</P>
<P>
   More so, probably, than at any time since the 1991 Gulf War.
Saddam's latest defiance, at the very moment the U.N. was ready to
set a timetable for lifting sanctions, has exasperated even
countries like France which had previously argued against the
military option.
</P>
<P>
   What are the likely targets of an attack?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. would first have to take out Iraq's air defense system.
It would probably target the remaining sites where Iraq is
suspected to be building weapons of mass destruction, but
Washington admits that it would be impossible to destroy its
capacity to build chemical and biological weapons from the air.
</P>
<P>
   More likely is an assault on command and control sites,
communications, and targets linked to Saddam Hussein's inner
political circle, including the Republican Guard.
</P>
<P>
   What would be the objective of an assault?
</P>
<P>
   That is less clear. A large-scale attack would virtually rule
out putting the weapons inspectors back into Iraq. The U.S. has
recently approved new aid for the Iraqi opposition, and is trying
to build a strategy to replace Saddam in the long term. But there
is little evidence that it has thought through any effort to
overthrow him now. More likely is a punitive attack.
</P>
<P>
   How soon might it happen?
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, by the time you open this newspaper. The U.S.
already has the force in place to launch airstrikes at Iraqi
military targets, and insists it has all the authorization it needs
from existing U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, probably not for 10 days or a fortnight. This would
allow time for a formal deadline to be given Baghdad, and for a
further build-up of allied forces, including ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   What could stop it?
</P>
<P>
   A climb-down by Saddam, in which he not only promises but
delivers full compliance with U.N. weapons inspectors. This is
still possible but not very likely. Or a blanket opposition by
Washington' s Arab allies to the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   How likely is this ? The $64,000 question. The U.S. maintains it
has broad and strong backing in the region for punitive action
against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is less clear, and has been blurred further by
Israel's footdragging over the Wye accords, raising the old
question of double standards.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big powers, Britain is solid with Washington, as
(apparently) is France. Russia and China

   JEAN DALRYMPLE DIES; PUBLICIST, PRODUCER EXTRAORDINAIRE (Eds., a
longer version, OBIT-DALRYMPLE, has moved.)  
(jw) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jean Dalrymple, who abandoned a nascent acting career
to become a successful publicist, manager of concert artists and
finally a dynamic producer of musicals and plays for City Center
and other stages, died Sunday at her Manhattan home, across the
street from City Center. She was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Dalrymple's stature in the New York theater world was
enhanced by her uncanny ability to lure just the right actor for a
particular role at a price that City Center, with its limited
budget, could afford. Her skillful productions nourished and
entertained audiences there from the 1940s through the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the center's offerings during her tenure as director of
its theater and light-opera companies were plays by Shakespeare and
Shaw, Sartre and Tennessee Williams, with actors like Jose Ferrer,
Charles Boyer, Franchot Tone, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn,
Charlton Heston, Helen Hayes and Tallulah Bankhead. She also
revived musicals by Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Frank Loesser,
Rodgers and Hart, and Rodgers and Hammerstein.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Miss Dalrymple was one of a handful of formidable female
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean always had a kind of solid serenity about her,'' said
Robert Whitehead, the producer. ``She had a great determination to
get things done, but she was always very feminine, very pretty. She
was an extraordinary person.''
</P>
<P>
   City Center, for which Miss Dalrymple worked so long and hard,
was established on West 55th Street in 1943 by Mayor Fiorello La
Guardia and City Council President Newbold Morris, who wanted it to
be a ``temple for the performing arts,'' offering productions for a
top price of $2.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Dalrymple was there at the very beginning, initially
serving as volunteer public relations director and board member. At
the same time, she managed artists like Mary Martin and Lily Pons.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Dalrymple was born on Sept. 2, 1902, in Morristown, N.J.,
to George and Elizabeth Collins Dalrymple, a well-to-do family in
the coal and lumber business.
</P>
<P>
   After completing her secondary education, Miss Dalrymple moved
to New York, studied secretarial skills and got a stenographer's
job on Wall Street at age 16. But the crash of 1929 propelled her
into vaudeville, creating an act with her beau, Dan Jarrett, and
working with James Cagney and Cary Grant on the Keith-Orpheum
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   She also tried playwriting; ``Salt Water,'' written with
Jarrett, was produced by John Golden. He then hired her as an
understudy, casting director, play doctor and press agent. Her
skill in handling the press so impressed Golden that he encouraged
her to work at it full time.
</P>
<P>
   It also impressed Ward Morehouse, The New York Sun drama critic,
so much so that in 1932 he proposed marriage. In the five years
they were together, they collaborated on a screenplay, ``It
Happened in New York,'' which Universal Pictures made into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Miss Dalrymple married Maj. Gen. Philip de Witt Ginder,
who died in 1968. No immediate family members survive. The funeral
will be at 1:30 p.m. Thursday at the West Point chapel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, Miss Dalrymple turned to producing. Her first effort, a
collaboration with Marc Connelly, was ``Hope for the Best,'' a
comedy by William McCleery, a newspaperman. She then began to
devote more of her energy to developing productions for City
Center, which was started in the old Mecca Temple that had been
built years before by the Shriners but had been taken over by the
city for nonpayment of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Early productions there included Thornton Wilder's ``Our Town,''
mostly because it required no scenery, and ``Porgy and Bess,''
which the center snared as it was completing a national tour.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Dalrymple was especially proud of her production of
``Porgy.'' ``I had an overwhelming desire to restore it to its
original form and present it exactly as George Gershwin and DuBose
Heyward had created it, as an opera for the Metropolitan,'' she
once recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1975 memoir, ``From the Last Row,'' she recalled that
Howard Taubman of The New York Times ``loved it'' but that Judith
Crist of The New York Herald Tribune said she preferred the
original Broadway version. ``I wrote her,'' Miss Dalrymple said,
``and told her she had a tin ear.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, she persuaded Jose Ferrer to star in and direct four
plays at the City Center during an eight-week season: ``Cyrano de
Bergerac,'' ``The Shrike,'' ``Richard III'' and ``Charley's Aunt.''
To help City Center grapple with its tight budget, Ferrer and all
the cast members in these productions worked for the Actors Equity
minimum. Ferrer called the center ``this happy beehive of the
arts.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Miss Dalrymple persuaded Orson Welles to appear in
``King Lear'' (he performed in a wheelchair after breaking a leg in
rehearsals) and Tallulah Bankhead to play Blanche Dubois in ``A
Streetcar Named Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Miss Dalrymple's other warmly received revivals were
``Brigadoon'' (with Edward Villela as the villain), ``Pal Joey''
(with Bob Fosse in the title role), ``Guys and Dolls'' (with Walter
Matthau as Nathan Detroit) and ``The Pajama Game.''
</P>
<P>
   When her revivals turned a profit, Miss Dalrymple used the money
to subsidize City Center's other companies, the New York City
Ballet and the New York City Opera, both of which moved to Lincoln
Center in 1964.

in the world, more than a day before the expected peak of this
year's Leonid meteor shower, which astronomers say could turn into
a rare, dramatic meteor storm sometime Tuesday. The early signs of
activity suggest that the shower could be even more intense than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonid shower, which can produce spectacular storms of
activity every 33 years, occurs every year in mid-November, and
either this year or next is expected to produce major activity. The
last big Leonid storm was in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites in orbit could be affected, or even completely
disabled, in the event of a direct hit. Scientists estimate a
chance of somewhere from one-tenth to one percent that any given
satellite will be hit, which means that with more than 600 in orbit
there is a good chance that at least one will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the predawn hours Monday, about a day and a half before
the expected peak of ``shooting star'' activity, one experienced
meteor observer in California called it ``the best meteor shower
I've ever witnessed,'' with an unusually high proportion of the
extremely bright meteors known as fireballs _ those that blaze
brighter than the planet Venus at its brightest.
</P>
<P>
   George Zay, the observer in rural southern California who works
as a fireman by day and has been recording meteor activity by night
for eight years for the International Meteor Organization, said one
of the early-Monday fireballs for a second or two blazed several
times brighter than the full moon. (It reached a brightness
astronomers refer to as magnitude -15, in a scale where the larger
the negative number, the brighter. The full moon is magnitude -13,
and the sun is -26). ``The stars totally disappeared and the sky
looked like daylight blue for a second or two,'' Zay said. ``It was
pure excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate of meteors, so long before the expected peak, was not
extraordinary _ only about ten Leonids per hour, Zay reported _ but
the number of bright ones was far greater than average, making for
a dramatic show. ``I've never seen 25 fireballs in one night
before,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports from Mongolia, where some scientists had traveled
to be in the best position for the expected peak of the storm, also
indicated that the activity was picking up early, with rates of
more than one per minute and with many bright fireballs.
</P>
<P>
   Two US research planes will be observing the peak activity over
Asia, using ultraviolet cameras, radar and other instruments to try
to determine the size and numbers of particles entering the
atmosphere. All estimates of the amount of material burning up
during a meteor shower have been calculated based on the bright
trails seen from the ground, but some researchers have suggested
that there may be far more material entering the atmosphere
invisibly at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Another experiment, being carried out by National Aeronautics
and Space Administration scientists, will attempt to catch a piece
of the falling debris before it burns up in the atmosphere, using a
high-altitude weather balloon. The scientists estimate the chances
of successfully catching a ``falling star'' are only about 10
percent, but the potential scientific payoff _ getting the first
laboratory sample ever of material from a comet _ is worth the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   This meteor storm ``is like room service for science,'' said
David Noever, a member of NASA's Astrobiology Institute. ``Instead
of us going to the comet, it's coming to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding out just how much material is hurtling into the upper
atmosphere, and what it is made of _ all of it is believed to be
sand-sized debris shed by a comet called Tempel-Tuttle _ could be
crucial to those planning for how to protect satellites during
future meteor storms.
</P>
<P>
   The early reports of activity Monday are an encouraging sign for
viewers in New England and the rest of the United States, who
according to the early forecasts were expected to be left out of
the spectacular show altogether. While nobody thinks we will
experience the rates of thousands of meteors in one hour that are
expected in Asia, the high proportion of fireballs suggests that
this could be a show well worth watching, even here.
</P>
<P>
   While last night was overcast in the Northeast, the forecast
calls for partly to mostly cloudy conditions tonight, which may
provide enough openings for observers in locations with dark skies
_ the farther from city lights the better _ to catch some of those
brighter meteors. The best times to watch are between midnight and
dawn. The meteors can show up anywhere in the sky, but all appear
to be radiating outward from the constellation Leo in the
southeast.

MARIJUANA ARRESTS AT RECORD LEVEL IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arrests on marijuana charges here have jumped to a
record level this year, driven by the Giuliani administration's
``zero tolerance'' approach that has police officers pursuing
anyone found possessing, selling or smoking even small amounts of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials project that at the current pace, the
New York City Police Department could arrest as many as 40,000
people by the end of the year on charges of possessing or selling
marijuana. That would be eight times the number of arrests just six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring tally is the result of routine sweeps by
plainclothes police details through known drug-dealing locations
and unprecedented undercover efforts in which officers pose as
street-corner ``smoke sellers'' to catch marijuana buyers,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives, part of a continuing assault on misdemeanor
crimes that police officials credit for curtailing more serious
offenses, have already led to the arrest of 31,330 people on
marijuana charges this year. The vast majority of those arrested _
80 percent _ were accused of possessing, not selling, the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in arrests is a drastic departure from the days, not
so long ago, when smoking a marijuana cigarette in public often
drew no more than an angry glare from a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is more marijuana on the street today,''
said Jack Ryan, chief assistant district attorney in Queens.
``There is probably less. But you don't have a situation anymore
where you can smoke a joint on the subway and, if you do get
caught, the cop just says, `Throw it away.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those arrested today are held for arraignment and may
spend 16, 24, even 36 hours in custody before being released, in
sharp contrast to the past, when those arrested on low-level
possession charges were often given a summons and released. Some
critics called the tougher handling of marijuana offenders
Draconian and inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a waste of resources, a colossal waste,'' said Gerald
Lefcourt, a criminal defense lawyer who serves on a legal committee
for NORML, a national organization that advocates the reform of
marijuana laws. ``Most of the people who are arrested for marijuana
are no threat to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasing number of arrests in New York is part of a
national trend by law enforcement agencies to curb marijuana use,
which the federal government contends _ and some scientists deny _
is a greater health threat than previously believed. Nationally,
the number of marijuana arrests has nearly doubled since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   National surveys indicate that marijuana use is up, but the
increase is not nearly as steep as the surge in arrests. According
to a University of Michigan study last year, half of the
high-school seniors surveyed said they had tried the drug, up from
a third who said they had used it six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the increase in arrests grew out of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's pledge last year to make the fight on drugs, including
marijuana, a major goal of his second term. The city's efforts have
been particularly visible in Washington Square Park in Greenwich
Village. The park once resembled a farmer's market for marijuana
sales, but now has its own police command post and is monitored by
closed-circuit cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community in general is tired of walking through the park
and being hassled by having someone yelling `Smoke, smoke' at
them,'' said Arthur Strickler, district manager of Community Board
2 in the Village.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, marijuana arrests have surpassed the 27,264
people arrested in all of 1997 _ itself a record-setting year,
police said. ``We have changed the traditional strategy,'' said
Chief Martin O'Boyle, commander of the Organized Crime Control
Bureau, which oversees drug enforcement efforts. He said officers
now concentrate more on sting operations against buyers and less on
having undercover officers buy from marijuana dealers, who even
when caught do little jail time. ``Now we try to discourage the
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the arrest numbers are way up, those charged with
misdemeanor possession of marijuana do not face more severe
penalties. First offenders caught with as much as several ounces of
the drug _ which sells for roughly $125 per ounce depending on the
strength _ are eligible for a probation program known as
adjournment contemplating dismissal, in which charges are dismissed
if a defendant stays out of trouble for a set period of time.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six months, for example, the Manhattan district
attorney's office said that 4,866 defendants were arraigned in
Criminal Court on charges of possessing less than an ounce of
marijuana. Some 63 percent of those cases were adjourned
contemplating dismissal at arraignment, according to Barbara
Thompson, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But by the time the defendants were arraigned, several criminal
defense lawyers said, their clients had already spent a half day or
more in custody, being fingerprinted, strip-searched and checked
for possible outstanding arrest warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call that doing your jail time up front,'' said Tony
Elitcher, a staff lawyer with the Legal Aid Society's criminal
defense division. ``You are doing your sentence before you ever get
in front of the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the amount of marijuana involved is miniscule, police
officials said, the warrant and fingerprint checks made on those
arrested often turn up people sought for more serious offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Also, said O'Boyle: ``We should not be in a position of
determining who we arrest for breaking the law. We have to treat
all of these folks equally.''
</P>
<P>
   Court officials said that channeling everyone accused of
misdemeanor offenses, such as marijuana possession, through the
booking system has put a strain on the Criminal Court, although
they said more efficient procedures have prevented the system from
becoming overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we are asking the Legislature for an increase of 23
judges citywide to address the larger caseloads,'' said Mai Yee, a
spokesperson for the Office of Court Administration.

DEMOCRATS SIFT CONFIDENTIAL STARR PROBE DOCUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee pursued
reams of confidential material from Independent Counsel Kenneth W.
Starr as they prepared to challenge his conduct and credibility
when he testifies Thursday in the impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent effort to build the foundation for a blistering
cross-examination of Starr, the Democrats asked him to turn over a
vast array of documents, including FBI reports, phone records,
notes, and summaries of interviews with Arkansas state troopers, as
the lawmakers explored the most sensitive details of Starr's
inquiry into Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also asked Starr to bring four of his former and
current top deputies to be questioned at Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The developments unfolded Monday amid the buildup to Starr's
pivotal appearance, as both sides scrambled for an advantage in the
high-stakes proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, committee Republicans prepared to release
Tuesday 22 hours of edited audiotapes of Linda R. Tripp's secretly
recorded conversations with Monica S. Lewinsky, Clinton's former
paramour.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in a letter Monday to Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
J. Hyde, agreed to make available a small amount of material the
Democrats sought but only documents that were jointly requested by
Republicans on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Those documents involve Starr's request of Attorney General
Janet Reno that she grant him jurisdiction over circumstances
surrounding Clinton's sexual affair with Lewinsky, a former White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have expressed suspicion that Starr may have violated
the independent counsel law and other federal statutes in his
preliminary investigation of the matter before Reno gave him
permission to pursue it.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans on the committee refused a request by the
panel's highest ranking Democrat, Representative John Conyers Jr.,
to approve a subpoena for evidence of possible wrongdoing in at
least 10 areas of Starr's investigation. And Starr rejected an
appeal from the Democrats to voluntarily supply the material.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Starr rebuffed a Democratic request for FBI notes
of interviews, asserting a legal privilege by describing them as
``confidential work-product.''
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the material sought by the Democrats are documents
concerning contacts between Starr's office and representatives of
Paula Corbin Jones, whose sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton
was pivotal in the disclosure of Clinton's affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``These documents are highly relevant to the question of
whether'' Starr's office ``was aware that some witnesses involved
in its investigation may have been used for partisan political
purposes,'' Conyers said in a letter to Hyde, an Illinois
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Conyers said in the letter, the documents Democrats are
seeking may shed light on how Starr's office ``may have engineered
its involvement in the Paula Jones case, whether it sought to sway
congressional or public opinion through leaks of investigative
information, what material it sent with its referral, and what
information it chose to keep from us.''
</P>
<P>
   When Starr testifies on Thursday, he will be given two hours to
present his case for Clinton's possible impeachment. In his
445-page referral to Congress last month, Starr cited ``serious and
credible'' evidence that Clinton may have committed 11 impeachable
offenses, including perjury, witness tampering, and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's presentation will be followed by several hours of
questioning the Judiciary Committee's 37 members: 21 Republicans
and 16 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers will then have 30 minutes to question Starr.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Democratic request for Starr to bring his current and
former deputies to the hearing, Jim Jordan, spokesman for the
comittee Democrats, said the appeal was necessary because there
``may be times when the CEO is unaware or uninformed of the actions
of his employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr had yet to respond Monday night to the request.

EXCERPTS FROM GATES DEPOSITION AT ANTITRUST TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST)  
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from an hour of videotaped
testimony shown Monday in U.S. District Court during antitrust
proceedings against Microsoft. David Boies and other lawyers for
the Justice Department questioned the chairman and chief executive
of the company, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   DAVID BOIES. The industry and Microsoft track what is referred
to as browser market share; correct, sir?
</P>
<P>
   BILL GATES. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. No? Does Microsoft track browser market share?
</P>
<P>
   A. I've seen usage share.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've seen usage share?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh-huh. But not _ market share usually refers to something
related to _ not to usage. And with browsers, I've seen mostly
usage. Now, some people might refer to that as a market share, but
it's not a market share.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is a market share?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, when I think of a market share, I think of where you're
comparing the revenue of one company to the revenue of another
company.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The total revenue of a company?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, the revenue related to one company's product to the
revenue of another company's product.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And that's what you think of when you use the term market
share; is that your testimony?
</P>
<P>
   A. Usually.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you aware of documents within Microsoft that describe
browser share as the company's number one goal?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I'm aware of documents within Paul Maritz's group that
may have stated that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is Paul Maritz's group within Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but his _ he doesn't set the companywide goals. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now, let's say that you meant browser usage because that's
what your testimony is. What browser usage were you talking about
in terms of what your share of browser usage was? What browsers?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not getting your question. Are you trying to ask what I
was thinking when I wrote this sentence?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let me begin with that. What were you thinking when you _
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't remember specifically writing this sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does that mean you can't answer what you were thinking when
you wrote the sentence?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So since you don't have an answer to that question, let me
put a different question.
</P>
<P>
   A. I have an answer. The answer is I don't remember.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You don't remember what you meant. Let me try to ask you _
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't remember what I was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there a difference between remembering what you were
thinking and remembering what you meant?
</P>
<P>
   A. If the question is what I meant when I wrote it, no.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So you don't remember what you were thinking when you wrote
it and you don't remember what you meant when you wrote it; is that
fair?
</P>
<P>
   A. As well as not remember writing it. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. What non-Microsoft browsers were you concerned about in
January of 1996?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know what you mean ``concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is it about the word ``concerned'' that you don't
understand?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not sure what you mean by it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is _
</P>
<P>
   A. Is there a document where I use that term?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the term ``concerned'' a term that you're familiar with in
the English language?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does it have a meaning that you're familiar with?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Using the word ``concerned'' consistent with the normal
meaning that it has in the English language, what Microsoft _ or
what non-Microsoft browsers were you concerned about in January of
1996?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I think I would have been concerned about Internet
Explorer, what was going on with it. We would have been looking at
other browsers that were in use at the time. Certainly Navigator
was one of those. And I don't know which browser AOL was using at
the time, but it was another browser.

<P>
   Ever walked into a room that just felt really good? You couldn't
explain why, but everything felt right. The energy just worked.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are _ even if the person who arranged the room didn't do
it on purpose _ the place had good feng shui.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui is the ancient Chinese art of arranging a balanced
environment to create a positive flow of energy. Popular for years
among decorators, it's now moving into the office, according to a
new book, ``Feng Shui at Work,'' by Kirsten Lagatree, who says it
can have dramatic results in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Put your furniture in the proper place, hang the right things in
the right places on your walls, and seat your employees
strategically _ then watch as the office becomes a more comfortable
place to work, relationships among co-workers improve, and your
business grows.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with your desk. It must face the door. Like much
with feng shui, this is rooted in common sense. If your back is to
the door, you'll be caught off guard when people walk in, says
Lagatree, and you won't be able to keep an eye on things. Sit
catercorner from the door with two walls intersecting behind your
desk to stay in visual and physical command of the space.
</P>
<P>
   Having either side of your desk up against a wall blocks energy,
says Steven Post, CEO of the San Francisco-based Geomancy/Feng Shui
Education Organization. The path of movement around your entire
office should be smooth and unencumbered, says Post. Doors should
almost never be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Clutter stops the flow of energy. ``Clutter is a series of
postponed decisions,'' says Lagatree. ``You are surrounded by
things that are calling for your attention, so you're never really
concentrating on the thing in front of you at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Strive for Zen surfaces in your office, says Hope Karan Gerecht,
a feng shui consultant in Baltimore. That means at least half the
vertical and horizontal surfaces should be clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind needs a place to rest and relax as it is
problem-solving and creating,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Think carefully about the objects you surround yourself with,
says Gerecht: ``Everything around us is creating our lives on a
daily basis.'' Is an item something that pleases you? Or something
you're using because you have it?
</P>

<P>
   Ever walked into a room that just felt really good? You couldn't
explain why, but everything felt right. The energy just worked.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are _ even if the person who arranged the room didn't do
it on purpose _ the place had good feng shui.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui is the ancient Chinese art of arranging a balanced
environment to create a positive flow of energy. Popular for years
among decorators, it's now moving into the office, according to a
new book, ``Feng Shui at Work,'' by Kirsten Lagatree, who says it
can have dramatic results in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Put your furniture in the proper place, hang the right things in
the right places on your walls, and seat your employees
strategically _ then watch as the office becomes a more comfortable
place to work, relationships among co-workers improve, and your
business grows.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with your desk. It must face the door. Like much
with feng shui, this is rooted in common sense. If your back is to
the door, you'll be caught off guard when people walk in, says
Lagatree, and you won't be able to keep an eye on things. Sit
catercorner from the door with two walls intersecting behind your
desk to stay in visual and physical command of the space.
</P>
<P>
   Having either side of your desk up against a wall blocks energy,
says Steven Post, CEO of the San Francisco-based Geomancy/Feng Shui
Education Organization. The path of movement around your entire
office should be smooth and unencumbered, says Post. Doors should
almost never be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Clutter stops the flow of energy. ``Clutter is a series of
postponed decisions,'' says Lagatree. ``You are surrounded by
things that are calling for your attention, so you're never really
concentrating on the thing in front of you at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Strive for Zen surfaces in your office, says Hope Karan Gerecht,
a feng shui consultant in Baltimore. That means at least half the
vertical and horizontal surfaces should be clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind needs a place to rest and relax as it is
problem-solving and creating,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Think carefully about the objects you surround yourself with,
says Gerecht: ``Everything around us is creating our lives on a
daily basis.'' Is an item something that pleases you? Or something
you're using because you have it?
</P>
<P>
   Also, don't keep anything broken in your office; it saps energy.
The office should have a feeling of life energy, whether you create

GORE BACKS OUSTER OF MAHATHIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Vice President Al Gore Monday night
championed the ``brave people'' demanding the ouster of Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, infuriating his host and shifting
attention from a summit on the Asian economic crisis to the
widespread crusade for political change the crisis has inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's strong words on the necessity of democratic change to
underpin economic reforms overshadowed his announcement of a
landmark $10 billion US-Japanese support package for flailing Asian
banks and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Amid an atmosphere of regional political foment, the incendiary
comments at a dinner meeting of heads of state and business leaders
at the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' summit
threaten to undermine the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   An evening that could have been an opportunity to applaud a
joint effort between the United States and Japan _ in contrast to
head-butting over trade in recent days _ instead sparked a row that
might force leaders to take sides and refuse to cooperate on
alleviating the economic crisis and liberalizing trade.
</P>
<P>
   US endorsement of political change here could become a catalyst
for demonstrations during the summit today and tomorrow, despite
the deployment of 5,700 security officers to deter protests. Monday
night, emboldened activists posted Internet messages calling for
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracies have done better in coping with economic crisis
than nations where freedom is suppressed,'' Gore told 1,000
business leaders. ``And so, among nations suffering economic
crises, we continue to hear calls for democracy, calls for reform
in many languages _ ... doi moi, reformasi,'' he said, referring to
Vietnamese promises of reforms to communism, and Indonesian and
Malaysian demands for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear them today _ right here, right now _ among the brave
people of Malaysia,'' he added, to the shock of Malaysian
officials, referring to protests that began two months ago
demanding an end to Mahathir's 17 years as prime minister. The
protests were launched by ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim, who clashed with Mahathir on economic policy and is on
trial on sodomy and abuse of power charges.
</P>
<P>
   Outside during Gore's speech, about 150 riot police stood guard
to discourage antigovernment protests.
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived Monday to stand in for President Clinton, who
skipped APEC to focus on the Iraqi crisis. A White House official
stood by Gore: ``No question that the president backs everything
the vice president said.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore's arguably preachy style differed markedly from
Clinton's disarming delivery that allowed the president to lecture
Chinese leaders on human rights in Tiananmen Square without
sparking a diplomatic incident.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also chose not to stay for Monday night's dinner. He
stiffly shook Mahathir's hand before walking out, while his host
smiled weakly.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, himself a notoriously outspoken leader who refuses to
pull punches whatever the political fallout, did not publicly
respond to Gore's remarks, but was overheard saying: ``I've never
seen anybody so rude.''
</P>
<P>
   His trade minister, Rafidah Aziz, was less restrained, calling
it ``the most disgusting speech I've heard in my life.'' She said
``the economic summit was ``completely spoiled before it has
started.''
</P>
<P>
   But others interviewed said it was high time Mahathir _ who has
attacked foreign currency traders and made inflammatory comments
about Jews _ got a dose of his own medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Salehuddin Hashim, a prominent lawyer who specializes in turning
around bankrupt companies, recalled a CNN interview in which
Mahathir said that in politics, some things must be said, no matter
how unpopular. ``As a Malaysian, I'm proud he said that. But why
doesn't that apply to him? How come I don't get to say things I
want to because I'd get arrested?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Malaysian people are pretty civilized and don't like to cross
lines of propriety, which is maybe why Mahathir managed to go on as
long as he has. But now people have had enough,'' Salehuddin said.
``In the coming weeks and months, you'll see more from the
civilized, urban, intellectual population.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also referred to the widespread ``corruption and cronyism''
in Asia that is blamed for undermining equitable economic growth in
the past decades and creating a rotten core that hastened the
financial collapse last year.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of corruption and nepotism differs within Asia, as
does the level of political freedom. Unlike former President
Suharto in neighboring Indonesia, a general who ruled for 32 years
before being drummed out in May, Mahathir is a civilian who was
elected by his party, which leads a coalition that has won every
election since independence in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   And so Malaysians used to bristle at the comparison between
Suharto and Mahathir, until two months ago when many were shocked
by the downfall and silencing of Mahathir's former protege, Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   Though the government has rounded up opponents under Draconian
security laws _ dramatically in 1987, when 106 people were
arrested, including the head of the opposition, and three
newspapers were shut down _ it has also allowed more dissent than
Indonesia. Mahathir was challenged in his party a decade ago, and
had to contend with a splinter group that stole significant
support.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove that it allows other voices, the government
invited a political comedy troupe to perform for APEC ministers
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's brouhaha shifted attention from the US-Japan
initiative for recession-hit Asia. Asked about the US offer of $5
billion on top of $5 billion from Japan and multilateral
organizations, trade minister Rafidah said: ``To me it's not worth
five cents.''
</P>
<P>
   The $10 billion-plus package is intended to recapitalize Asian
banks and provide credit to debt-ridden corporations unable to
generate growth. Japan has separately offered $30 billion in aid to
its struggling neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments capped an extraordinary day at APEC, during
which the CEO of Goldman Sachs, Jon Corzine, made a surprising call
for regulating international capital flows to emerging markets. The
controversial case for regulating financial markets has been
championed by Mahathir, who isolated himself and dismayed investors
by imposing capital controls. But Corzine added weight from an
unexpected quarter to arguments to regulate hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung made a
surprising admission of his country's culpability for the fall into
recession, referring to ``collusive ties between politics and
businesses, government-controlled financing and widespread
corruption and irregularities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of failing to develop both democracy and a market
economy, Korea lost international competitiveness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the summit of 21 leaders Tuesday follows the
failure Sunday of trade ministers to reach full agreement on a
fast-track liberalization deal covering $1.5 trillion in trade. The
package was sent on to the World Trade Organization for approval by
other countries.

SADDAM EXPECTED TO BREAK HIS PROMISE, TOUCHING OFF AIR STRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
 (htv) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE and STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States, its allies and past
defenders of Iraq said Monday that they did not expect President
Saddam Hussein to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors, and that
if he broke his promise it would set off a military response
without a Security Council debate.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton stayed his hand over the weekend, in
part because of his concern about losing international support for
an attack on Iraq, there was an unusually strong consensus Monday
that American and British bombing was almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   American and U.N. officials, along with diplomats from a variety
of countries, including some that have been sympathetic to Iraqi
arguments in the past, said the respite was temporary. The
situation is markedly different from past crises, the officials
said, with Saddam having no further room for maneuver in the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   As U.N. weapons inspectors prepared to return to work y in Iraq,
most officials said they expected that the real test of Saddam's
willingness to comply in the next two or three weeks _ as soon as
the chief inspector, Richard Butler, can assemble the experts he
needs to conduct surprise inspections at the sorts of sites from
which Saddam has been barring the U.N. specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're setting off into some pretty important territory,''
Butler said in an interview in New York. ``It is well understood by
all concerned that this is not ephemeral. This is real. This is
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   American and British forces are standing by, in new locations
within striking distance of Iraq, and could be sent to combat in
hours, not the days that it took in the most recent buildup,
American officials said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is watching Saddam Hussein to see if he follows the
words he uttered with deeds,'' Clinton said in brief remarks
Monday. ``Our forces remain strong and ready if he does not.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam could ``comply and give up his weapons of mass
destruction,'' a senior American official said Monday. But he
called that possibility ``highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more probable he will not comply and there will be a
confrontation,'' the official continued. ``But it will be under
circumstances of our choosing. There's no question in my mind that
when we act we will do so in such a way that it will be sustainable
internationally and domestically.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam averted an American attack over the weekend by promising
once again to cooperate fully with the team of U.N. inspectors,
known as Unscom, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, to let
them inspect whatever sites they choose and to hand over crucial
documents on Iraq's secret biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said the time for testing would
not be long. ``I think that we will see very quickly, in the next
few weeks or perhaps even longer, but nonetheless within a short
period of time, as to whether he is going to fully comply,'' Cohen
said. ``I think everyone understands that this is the last
go-around as far as Saddam is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair said that next time there
would be ``no warnings, no wrangling, no negotiations, no
last-minute letters.'' In remarks to Parliament, Blair said, ``The
next withdrawal of cooperation and he will be hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he expected to restart the comprehensive monitoring
of Iraqi sites on Wednesday, with inspectors' taking air, water and
soil samples and repositioning and checking cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Challenge inspections, in which experts armed with clues demand
entry to new sites to check for prohibited arms, components or
documents, will follow as soon as Butler can assemble international
teams of specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he hoped to concentrate initially on missile
systems, where only a few issues remain to be settled, and on
chemical weapons, where more is known, than on biological weapons,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   American and U.N. officials said Unscom, in particular, wants
two documents, one on chemical weapons development, found last
summer by Unscom but seized by the Iraqis, and one on biological
weapons, which Unscom knows about but has never seen. The
International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna will also send
additional inspectors to Iraq, perhaps later this week. But
officials say that other than long-term monitoring, there is little
left for Iraq to do on the nuclear issue beyond passing a law.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative and the Security
Council's chairman of the Iraq sanctions committee, said Monday
that ``nobody really knows'' how much cooperation the inspectors
may or may not get.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test is on the ground,'' he said. ``We have the
experience of the past, and we have to be cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   American and British forces remain on standby around the Persian
Gulf and could attack Iraq with less preparation than before, a
senior American official said. While it took eight or nine days to
prepare the strikes that were aborted on Saturday, the official
said, it would take fewer now, and they would mostly be spent in
insuring that U.N. workers are evacuated from Iraq and key allies
like Israel are informed.
</P>
<P>
   The senior official was eager to defend Clinton's Saturday
morning decision to abort air strikes on Baghdad when it became
clear that Saddam appeared to be backing down from his refusal to
cooperate with the U.N. weapons inspectors of Unscom.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States had bombed on Saturday, the official said,
``we are the ones who would be isolated and the target of
criticism, not Saddam Hussein.'' The Arab world would be split,
Saddam would receive undeserved sympathy, the United States would
be ``accused of killing Unscom'' and the ``good word'' of the
United States would be tarnished, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It matters that the world believes in the word of the United
States,'' the official said. If Washington had attacked despite
indications that Saddam was about to do what was demanded of him,
``it would have called into question our own long-term
credibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The official insisted that Washington is pursuing ``a long-term
strategy'' and is better positioned than before. ``We've positioned
ourselves extremely well'' if Saddam reneges again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors of Unscom now have more support from the Security
Council than they've had in nearly two years, another senior
American official said. ``The whole world supports Unscom's right
to go wherever it wants in Iraq.'' That provides an extraordinary
window for Unscom to work, the official said, at least until Saddam
decides to close it.
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat at the United Nations echoed the point.
Unscom has more support in the Security Council, he said, while
Saddam has sapped much of the trust wavering nations seemed willing
to place in his promises in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unscom with military backing is now in a much stronger
position,'' the diplomat said.

GORE BACKS OUSTER OF MAHATHIR

<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Vice President Al Gore Monday night
championed the ``brave people'' demanding the ouster of Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, infuriating his host and shifting
attention from a summit on the Asian economic crisis to the
widespread crusade for political change the crisis has inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's strong words on the necessity of democratic change to
underpin economic reforms overshadowed his announcement of a
landmark $10 billion US-Japanese support package for flailing Asian
banks and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Amid an atmosphere of regional political foment, the incendiary
comments at a dinner meeting of heads of state and business leaders
at the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' summit
threaten to undermine the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   An evening that could have been an opportunity to applaud a
joint effort between the United States and Japan _ in contrast to
head-butting over trade in recent days _ instead sparked a row that
might force leaders to take sides and refuse to cooperate on
alleviating the economic crisis and liberalizing trade.
</P>
<P>
   US endorsement of political change here could become a catalyst
for demonstrations during the summit today and tomorrow, despite
the deployment of 5,700 security officers to deter protests. Monday
night, emboldened activists posted Internet messages calling for
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracies have done better in coping with economic crisis
than nations where freedom is suppressed,'' Gore told 1,000
business leaders. ``And so, among nations suffering economic
crises, we continue to hear calls for democracy, calls for reform
in many languages _ ... doi moi, reformasi,'' he said, referring to
Vietnamese promises of reforms to communism, and Indonesian and
Malaysian demands for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear them today _ right here, right now _ among the brave
people of Malaysia,'' he added, to the shock of Malaysian
officials, referring to protests that began two months ago
demanding an end to Mahathir's 17 years as prime minister. The
protests were launched by ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim, who clashed with Mahathir on economic policy and is on
trial on sodomy and abuse of power charges.
</P>
<P>
   Outside during Gore's speech, about 150 riot police stood guard
to discourage antigovernment protests.
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived Monday to stand in for President Clinton, who
skipped APEC to focus on the Iraqi crisis. A White House official
stood by Gore: ``No question that the president backs everything
the vice president said.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore's arguably preachy style differed markedly from
Clinton's disarming delivery that allowed the president to lecture
Chinese leaders on human rights in Tiananmen Square without
sparking a diplomatic incident.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also chose not to stay for Monday night's dinner. He
stiffly shook Mahathir's hand before walking out, while his host
smiled weakly.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, himself a notoriously outspoken leader who refuses to
pull punches whatever the political fallout, did not publicly
respond to Gore's remarks, but was overheard saying: ``I've never
seen anybody so rude.''
</P>
<P>
   His trade minister, Rafidah Aziz, was less restrained, calling
it ``the most disgusting speech I've heard in my life.'' She said
``the economic summit was ``completely spoiled before it has
started.''
</P>
<P>
   But others interviewed said it was high time Mahathir _ who has
attacked foreign currency traders and made inflammatory comments
about Jews _ got a dose of his own medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Salehuddin Hashim, a prominent lawyer who specializes in turning
around bankrupt companies, recalled a CNN interview in which
Mahathir said that in politics, some things must be said, no matter
how unpopular. ``As a Malaysian, I'm proud he said that. But why
doesn't that apply to him? How come I don't get to say things I
want to because I'd get arrested?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Malaysian people are pretty civilized and don't like to cross
lines of propriety, which is maybe why Mahathir managed to go on as
long as he has. But now people have had enough,'' Salehuddin said.
``In the coming weeks and months, you'll see more from the
civilized, urban, intellectual population.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also referred to the widespread ``corruption and cronyism''
in Asia that is blamed for undermining equitable economic growth in
the past decades and creating a rotten core that hastened the
financial collapse last year.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of corruption and nepotism differs within Asia, as
does the level of political freedom. Unlike former President
Suharto in neighboring Indonesia, a general who ruled for 32 years
before being drummed out in May, Mahathir is a civilian who was
elected by his party, which leads a coalition that has won every
election since independence in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   And so Malaysians used to bristle at the comparison between
Suharto and Mahathir, until two months ago when many were shocked
by the downfall and silencing of Mahathir's former protege, Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   Though the government has rounded up opponents under Draconian
security laws _ dramatically in 1987, when 106 people were
arrested, including the head of the opposition, and three
newspapers were shut down _ it has also allowed more dissent than
Indonesia. Mahathir was challenged in his party a decade ago, and
had to contend with a splinter group that stole significant
support.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove that it allows other voices, the government
invited a political comedy troupe to perform for APEC ministers
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's brouhaha shifted attention from the US-Japan
initiative for recession-hit Asia. Asked about the US offer of $5
billion on top of $5 billion from Japan and multilateral
organizations, trade minister Rafidah said: ``To me it's not worth
five cents.''
</P>
<P>
   The $10 billion-plus package is intended to recapitalize Asian
banks and provide credit to debt-ridden corporations unable to
generate growth. Japan has separately offered $30 billion in aid to
its struggling neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments capped an extraordinary day at APEC, during
which the CEO of Goldman Sachs, Jon Corzine, made a surprising call
for regulating international capital flows to emerging markets. The
controversial case for regulating financial markets has been
championed by Mahathir, who isolated himself and dismayed investors
by imposing capital controls. But Corzine added weight from an
unexpected quarter to arguments to regulate hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung made a
surprising admission of his country's culpability for the fall into
recession, referring to ``collusive ties between politics and
businesses, government-controlled financing and widespread
corruption and irregularities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of failing to develop both democracy and a market
economy, Korea lost international competitiveness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the summit of 21 leaders Tuesday follows the
failure Sunday of trade ministers to reach full agreement on a
fast-track liberalization deal covering $1.5 trillion in trade. The
package was sent on to the World Trade Organization for approval by
other countries.

REPLACEMENT FOR PLANE PART HAS CRACKS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After two Boeing 737s crashed in a way that
suggested rudder malfunctions, the Federal Aviation Administration
ordered the replacement of rudder-control valves in all 737s. Now,
cracks have been found in several replacement valves that have not
even been installed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the order, in January 1997, the new part has been
installed on 1,000 planes, with up to 2,000 more due in the next
few months. A spokesman for the aviation agency said Monday it was
still evaluating whether to inspect those 1,000 planes.
</P>
<P>
   The part in question is a hydraulic valve that controls the
rudder, which investigators suspect caused the crash of a 737 flown
by USAir, now US Airways, near Pittsburgh in September 1994, and a
737 flown by United Airlines, a unit of UAL, near Colorado Springs,
Colo., in March 1991. No official cause for the crashes, which
killed 157 passengers and crew members, has been established.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore announced in January 1997 that the
aviation administration would require replacement of the valves in
all 737s. Boeing and its supplier, Parker Hannifin Corp., of
Cleveland, then changed the material and the manufacturing process
for one part of the valve and said they would supply the
replacement valves free, though airlines would have to pay to
install them.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials warned at the time that the malfunction rate for
the old parts was low, approximately once per million flight hours,
and that the agency and Boeing would have to be careful to assure
that any replacement was more reliable than that.
</P>
<P>
   In September, cracks were found in nine valves in the inventory
at a Parker Hannifin factory. The discovery was first reported by
The St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The cracks are in a piece of metal, about the size of a
forefinger, that slides back and forth inside a valve the size of a
soft drink can. The piece of metal was redesigned because engineers
working in a laboratory to determine the reason for the Pittsburgh
crash have found that sometimes that part, called a secondary
slide, binds. In some cases that makes the plane's rudder swing in
the direction opposite the one commanded by the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, however, have not presented any evidence that
this happened on either plane that crashed. The National
Transportation Safety Board, which is in charge of the
investigation, was supposed to issue a report this week, but has
delayed it until March.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Young, a spokesman for Boeing, said that the new part
was functioning as designed, and would do so even if the slide
cracked completely in two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've fatigue-tested them through five lifetimes, and they've
performed as intended,'' he said. The part's lifetime is 20,000
flight hours, which engineers simulated through working the valve
harder, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Les Dorr, a spokesman for the FAA, said, ``We're still in the
process of working with Boeing to figure out what the best approach
to this situation is.'' He said the agency was looking for a
resolution, if possible, ``without basically putting airplanes on
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The 700 new valves in inventory might be ``a useful sample,''
Dorr said.
</P>
<P>
   Since rudders became a suspect in the airplane crashes, airlines
have changed the way they fly the 737 to make it less vulnerable to
rudder jam.

UNITED NATIONS: diplomat said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Butler said that he intends to write to Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, Saddam's liaison on arms issues, telling him what
documentation and other material Unscom needs to begin answering
outstanding questions and closing files. Iraq cannot hope to see
sanctions lifted until it has been declared free of all prohibited
weapons and the means to make them.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who took over as chairman of the Special Commission in
August 1997, has faced mounting problems with Iraq as his
inspectors close in on some final _ and deceivingly small _ pieces
of a large jigsaw puzzle, such as documents that would give away
how big prohibited Iraqi programs once were, which would help
determine how much of the cache has been found and destroyed.
Unscom had also been narrowing physical searches to sites closer to
Saddam and his Special Republican Guard, whose duties include the
guarding of secret weapons and their facilities.
</P>
<P>
   These factors seem to be making the Iraqis especially resistant
to cooperation. Butler said that in trying to get to the bottom of
files he has listed for Iraq's attention, he has been dealt with by
the Iraqis ``in a deceitful way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are facts,'' Butler said. ``One, the materials involved
exist, either in hard form or in documentary form. Two, they are in
the possession of the government of Iraq. Three, they can chose, if
they wish, to give them to us. This is the core of what we will now
be dealing with. They are small in number but large in
significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cirincione, an arms-control expert at the Carnegie
Endowment, said that ``the first priority is getting from Iraq a
complete record of what they had. That will be the first test of
whether Iraq is going to cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the past, Cirincione said of the Iraqis, ``they have
repeatedly lied. They've lied on top of lies. They've lied inside
other lies. So the inspectors' job has been incredibly complicated:
trying to search for toxins in a haystack.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said Monday that in missile development, there is still
accounting to be done on some missing warheads and more information
needed on Iraq's indigenous production facilities. There are also
outstanding questions about why Iraq needs missile propellants
specifically designed for longer-range, and therefore prohibited,
Scud missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In the chemical weapons area, Butler said he wants crucial
information on past stocks of munitions and on certain equipment.
He also needs to learn more about Iraqi use of the nerve gas VX, a
colorless, odorless agent that can kill within hours.
</P>
<P>
   On biological weapons, the inspectors are very far from
completion, with large quantities of weapons agents unaccounted
for.
</P>
<P>
   The countries on the Security Council who have supported Iraq in
the past will have little room for maneuver in coming weeks as
Butler and the IAEA decide whether Iraq is cooperating sufficiently
to trigger the comprehensive review of Baghdad's relations with the
United Nations that Saddam wants, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During the inspections, Iraq is expected to fall back on tactics
like prohibiting work in areas considered of importance to the
country's ``sovereignty and dignity.'' Supporters of Iraq, led by
the Russians and Chinese, have already raised flags about the
behavior of Unscom inspectors, and Iraq has accused them of being
cowboys who want to invade the privacy of homes and palaces.
</P>
<P>
   Danilo Turk, Slovenia's representative and an expert in
international law who now sits on the Security Council, said in an
interview Monday that it is very difficult to see how sovereignty
can be invoked when handing over a document is the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro, who took part in diplomatic inspections of the
so-called presidential properties in Baghdad in April, added that
he also does not see any impediment to Unscom's returning to those
sites for follow-up inspections without a diplomatic escort.

DISNEY RETIREES TO PICKET IN CONTROVERSY OVER MEDICAL BENEFITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A group of Walt Disney Co. retirees will picket in
front of the entertainment giant's headquarters Thursday to call
attention to its dispute over medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is locked in a legal battle over benefits to as many as
4,000 retirees and may face a class-action suit because the company
changed its long-standing policy that 20-year employees receive
free medical insurance once they turn 62.
</P>
<P>
   Disney contends its contracts allow it to charge retirees
because of the rising costs of coverage. ``That was always a
condition of the contracts,'' a spokesman said. It began charging
the retirees premiums in 1995 unless they joined health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always told that if we got to 20 years, we'd get free
medical benefits from Disney for the rest of our lives,'' said Jean
Perkins, who retired in 1978 at the age of 59 after two decades in
the corporate legal records department. ``I spent my last six
months back then commuting to Las Vegas so I could get those
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, a Reno resident who plans to attend the demonstration,
said Disney recently paid only $191 of a $700 hospital bill,
forcing her to pay the rest. ``I simply can't afford that,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in benefits led to seven retirees filing a federal
lawsuit last year. Disney agreed to a tentative settlement that
would have sharply cut premiums but that deal collapsed when
plaintiffs' attorneys discovered Disney contended that it would
still be allowed to boost premiums in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class-action status for
the suit last April and U.S. District Court Judge Terry Hatter is
expected to rule by the end of the year.

 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It begins about the time the first rooster crows, when
Charley Taylor settles in behind his desk. He has been the Falcons'
director of public relations for 12 seasons, but has never dealt
with anything like the craziness he's experiencing now.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Falcons have compiled the first 8-2 record in the
franchise's 33-year history, the world suddenly wants to know
what's up with the team. Taylor's job is to provide the answers, to
spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become a national team in that we're hearing from people
that we haven't been hearing from because we're the story,'' Taylor
said. ``In addition to taking all those calls we normally don't, we
have to stop what we're doing when (national media) are here and
help them and then go back to work. I never set my alarm clock, and
yet I always can get here because I'm so excited to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's Monday changed dramatically after Atlanta's victory
over the 49ers on Sunday put the Falcons in first place in the NFC
West. But those changes were felt throughout the training facility
at Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
   It's the price of being a winner, the price of success.
</P>
<P>
   _ The telephone rang constantly at the Falcons' ticket office.
Ticket manager Jack Ragsdale said that approximately 6,000 tickets
were sold during the day for the three remaining home games, this
Sunday against the Bears, Dec. 6 against the Colts and Dec. 27
against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   That's more tickets sold in any one day during the season than
Ragsdale can remember. A local TV station was filming outside the
Georgia Dome ticket office, where Ragsdale was working overtime.
That's fine with him. Almost 20,000 tickets are left for the Bears
game, and he has a strong product to push.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been wild,'' he said. ``Today has been gangbusters.
Tickets are moving especially fast for the Bears game and the
Dolphins game.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Falcons' locker room, trainer Ron Medlin and his staff
arrived around 8 a.m. Medlin's only customer was reserve linebacker
Ruffin Hamilton, who was lying on his back playing a video game.
</P>
<P>
   Medlin is superstitious, and although Sunday's game against the
49ers produced only three sprained ankles, he was not going to jinx
things by saying he's suddenly got it good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun for me all the time,'' he said. ``For our department,
there's no difference. Everybody says, `When you win, I guarantee
your room is not going to be crowded tomorrow,' but that's not
always the way it is. It is nicer for the building, though, when
we're winning.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Players were downright giddy in the weight room while going
through mandatory workouts. Quarterback Chris Chandler was
stretching. Rookie linebacker Keith Brooking was talking about the
San Francisco screen play he sniffed out and stuffed a day earlier.
Tight end O.J. Santiago was ribbing middle linebacker Jessie
Tuggle.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of Atlanta's 41-10 victory at New England a week
earlier, Santiago unveiled the ``Dirty Bird Dance'' after each of
his touchdowns. Several players now have unveiled different
versions, similar only in that they all flap their arms.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, they wanted to know what Tuggle was doing Sunday
after he scored on a fumble return. Santiago told Tuggle how
ridiculous he looked on SportsCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying I was too muscular, too stiff,'' Tuggle said
with a grin. ``I got in the end zone, and I thought I would give it
a shot. Hey, that's all right. I'll take this. When you win, the
atmosphere is totally different. You wake up in the morning, and
your coffee tastes better; your kids treat you better; your friends
are joking and laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Everywhere, players wore black T-shirts that say ``Dirty Bird
Football'' on the front and ``You can do eet'' on the back. The
latter is a line by actor/comedian Adam Sandler in the movie ``The
Water Boy.'' Sandler mailed the shirts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Upstairs, receptionist Gail Warren was laughing. She was busy
taking hundreds of congratulatory calls. There is fan mail. Lots of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mail is way, way up,'' Warren said. ``Chris (Chandler) maybe
would get three or four (letters) a day at the beginning of the
season. Now it's 20 or 30.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Around the corner, Greg Beadles, a CPA who usually works in
the club's finance department, prepared to ship merchandise orders
to fans. When the team's gift shop closed at the Falcon Inn Hotel
in September, the team's web site (www.atlantafalcons.com) became
the primary outlet for fans to purchase gear.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, they've been getting a lot, and Beadles, with help from
computer operations man Randy Kopp, can barely keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it was just all the inventory we had left (from the
gift shop), but it's just gone crazy,'' Beadles said. ``I have to
keep ordering stuff, and we had to hire someone to help part-time.
We're sending about 100 orders a week. It was about five or six a
week at the beginning of the season. In the last two weeks, we
moved about $20,000 in merchandise. We did $15,000 all of last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The marketing department is loving this winning thing. But
there aren't enough tents. Before home games, the team has a fan
festival on the east side of the Dome, and for the first home game,
against the Eagles, there were two corporate hospitality tents.
</P>
<P>
   That number increased to 10 for Sunday's game. Sales and
marketing assistant Todd Marble said the staff is scrambling for
more tents for the Bears game, because corporations want to get
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for the early games, we sold about four or five suites in
the Dome ($5,000 to seat 16; $6,000 to seat 24), but we doubled
that last week,'' Marble said. ``People are calling for jobs; we've
got car dealers that want displays outside the Dome; people are
wanting their corporate logo on the JumboTron, and local bands are
wanting to perform (at the festival). We're getting calls, calls,
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dan Reeves' regular Monday press conference was attended by 10
print journalists, three of the four local TV stations, a couple of
local radio stations and CNN/SI. ESPNEWS broadcast Reeves live. At
the beginning of the season, there were four reporters and one
local TV station. Monday, Reeves spoke for 36 minutes. He was asked
if the Falcons could make it to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody laughed.

 &HT;    Falcons win may mean end of Niners' dynasty
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a quiet San Francisco locker room Sunday, coach
Steve Mariucci and veterans such as strong safety Tim McDonald and
defensive tackle Bryant Young spoke eloquently of the character of
the 49ers and how they must respond to the challenge. The words
were meaningful and heartfelt. Given the way the 49ers wilted
against the more physical Falcons, though, they might ring hollow.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons victory should not suggest the local team is about
to become a dynasty in the NFC West. But it may have augured the
end of the 49ers' decade-and-a-half grip on the division and
reinforced the notion that San Francisco is vulnerable in many
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The king, it seems, is dead. Or at best, on life support.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons defeated the 49ers four times previously in this
decade, but think about how those victories were accomplished: In
1991, Atlanta won 39-34 at San Francisco when a defender slipped
and Deion Sanders went 100 yards with a kickoff. Later that season,
the Falcons won 17-14 at home when five 49ers defenders stood
flat-footed and watched Michael Haynes snatch Billy Joe Tolliver's
desperation heave into the end zone. In '93, Dexter Carter fumbled
twice in the final five minutes to hand the Falcons a 27-24 gift at
the Georgia Dome. In the '95 finale, the upset came when Terance
Mathis virtually willed himself into the end zone and the Falcons
into a wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such luck involved Sunday, no fluke element
attached to the victory. Perhaps sensing that Steve Young is more
infirm than advertised, the Falcons defenders pounded him. The
wounded quarterback spent the day tossing wounded ducks. By the
end, the swagger was gone from San Francisco, and players who have
never respected the Falcons were forced to pay homage.Manning steps
to front
</P>
<P>
   While Ryan Leaf seeks maturity in San Diego and Charlie Batch
continues to look for (and not find often) wide receiver Herman
Moore in Detroit, the premier rookie quarterback is clearly Peyton
Manning. That was obvious even before he rallied Indianapolis over
the New York Jets in the final minute Sunday. There are plenty of
reasons for Manning's progress, but often overlooked is the play of
the Colts' offensive line. Manning has been sacked only twice in
the past six games. Center Jay Leeuwenburg, guards Tony Mandarich
and rookie Steve McKinney, and tackles Tarik Glenn and Adam Meadows
have allowed Manning to be sacked only 13 times in 379 drop-backs.
</P>
<P>
   Waiver woes
</P>
<P>
   While they keep winning on the field, the Falcons continue to
lose to the NFL's waiver wire. Last week they attempted to add two
former 49ers, wide receiver-punt returner Iheanyi Uwaezuoke and
safety-special teams standout Curtis Buckley, and were beaten each
time. Miami got Uwaezuoke and Buckley went to the New York Giants.
That brought to four the number of unsuccessful waiver claims in
'98 for the Falcons, who earlier in the season tried to acquire
cornerbacks Juran Bolden (claimed by Carolina) and Rod Smith (Green
Bay).
</P>
<P>
   Sack attack
</P>
<P>
   Led by Green Bay's Reggie White (14), Carolina's Kevin Greene
(13) and Baltimore's Michael McCrary (12 1/2), there are eight
players on pace to record at least 15 sacks this season. In the
previous five seasons combined, only four players reached 15 sacks.
They were: Bryce Paup of Buffalo (17 1/2) in 1995, Minnesota's John
Randle (15 1/2) in '97, San Francisco's Dana Stubblefield (15) in
'97 and Neil Smith of Kansas City (15) in '93.
</P>
<P>
   More happy returns
</P>
<P>
   There were eight more returns for touchdowns Sunday, bringing
the season total to 77, including 16 the past two weekends. At the
current pace, the league will have 124 touchdowns via returns this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tops
</P>
<P>
   With Green Bay desperate for a running game to take pressure off
Brett Favre, tailback Darick Holmes responded. Acquired from
Buffalo last month, Holmes didn't have a carry entering the game
against the Giants, and coach Mike Holmgren was frustrated by his
inability to assimilate the offense. But Holmes rushed for 111
yards on 27 carries and caught two passes for 13 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive best
</P>
<P>
   In one of the biggest victories in franchise history, the
least-heralded member of the Falcons defensive line stepped up.
Tackle Shane Dronett had six tackles, 1 1/2 sacks and one pass
defensed, and forced a fumble by San Francisco quarterback Steve
Young that was recovered by Jessie Tuggle for a touchdown. Dronett
dominated Niners guard Ray Brown the entire afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Truly special
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of quarterback Jeff George, the Oakland Raiders
need points and field position any way they can get them. Desmond
Howard provided both, returning eight kicks for 181 yards in a win
over Seattle. The former Super Bowl MVP had a 63-yard punt return
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Stat stuff
</P>
<P>
   The Colts finally have more extra-point attempts than two-point
conversion tries. Mike Vanderjagt hit three PATs Sunday to give the
Colts nine for the year. They have gone the two-point route a
league-high eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing . . .
</P>
<P>
   In just his second start, Redskins third-round tailback Skip
Hicks ran for 94 yards and three touchdowns. Hicks may be getting
an early audition for the starting job in '99. Veteran Terry Allen
is proving to be brittle, is scheduled to earn $3.425 million next
season and may be too expensive for the rebuilding Redskins to
keep.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas was 0-4 on the road against NFC East rivals a season ago.
Sunday's win at Arizona gave rookie coach Chan Gailey a 4-0
divisional record on the road in '98. . . . Leaf has two touchdown
passes in 231 attempts. Replacement Craig Whelian has three in 86
passes. . . . Add New England, where Pete Carroll is in trouble, to
the clubs said to be interested in former 49ers coach George
Seifert. In two meetings, the Oilers defense held Pittsburgh
tailback Jerome Bettis to 55 yards on 25 carries, a 2.2-yard
average.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Rams coach Dick Vermeil after Sunday's 24-3 loss at
New Orleans: ``I stink. My coaching staff stinks. We all stink.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ David McCorkell ran from the fuselage before the
flames set in. But images of suffering all across the hayfield
compelled the computer trainer from Minnesota to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Circling closer, he heard first officer Matt Warmerdam's pleas
for help from inside the smoky cockpit. Warmerdam, trying to break
free, told McCorkell he didn't have enough room to swing his
hatchet. He passed the hatchet through a hole in the glass to
McCorkell and put his life in the hands of a man he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   As McCorkell banged away, shards of glass flew into his hair and
face. Warmerdam pointed to show him where to hit. McCorkell's left
hand tired, so he switched the hatchet to his right. Black smoke
thickened as Warmerdam pressed his face to the hole, gasping for
air.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, McCorkell widened the hole enough for Warmerdam to
stick out his head and one arm.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkell heard a loud pop underneath the cockpit. A blast of
heat shot at his legs, pushing him back several steps.
</P>
<P>
   Scared, McCorkell wondered what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't going to let me die, are you?'' Warmerdam cried
out.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers gathering nearby flinched at Warmerdam's terror. The
young deputy from Virginia, Tod Thompson, thought of the handgun in
his overnight bag and wondered: Should I shoot out the glass?
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, McCorkell saw flight attendant Robin Fech, bleeding
from a head wound, pointing at the glass. He stepped up and banged
on the glass even harder. The hatchet head flew off, and he
reattached it.
</P>
<P>
   In a few moments Carroll County, Ga. Sheriff's Deputy Guy Pope
appeared, the first of the rescue workers. McCorkell handed Pope
the hatchet and said, ``The pilot's still in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope whacked away at the glass. ``It's getting hot in here,''
Warmerdam told him. ``Get me out!''
</P>
<P>
   Then the hatchet broke. As Pope sent someone to get an ax from a
nearby house, Warmerdam shouted, ``Tell my wife I love her!''
</P>
<P>
   His face disappeared into the darkness of the cockpit. Pope
sensed the first officer had decided he was going to die.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Aleshire, the 18-year-old airman who had been in row
three, jumped on the first arriving fire truck, commandeered a hose
and pulled it toward the cockpit. Two more borrowed axes had broken
on the cockpit's glass panel as a disoriented Warmerdam meditated
inside. (ITAL)''I've got work to do. I've got to make sure people
get away from the plane.'' (END ITAL) Pope and Aleshire sprayed
water into the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Pope feared that Warmerdam already had burned to death.
</P>
<P>
   The county's fire chief, Steve Chadwick, rushed in and his crew
doused the cockpit. Chadwick, realizing that Warmerdam couldn't be
pulled through the glass side panel, broke through the back of the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping inside, he saw the first officer from the back:
third-degree burns from the top of his head down his back, almost
to a charcoal state.
</P>
<P>
   In 19 years of firefighting, Chadwick had never seen anyone
survive burns like this. A fatality, Chadwick thought.
</P>
<P>
   Then the fatality turned around and said, ``Get me out of
here!''
</P>
<P>
   It took time to extricate him. Warmerdam called out, ``Put more
water on me.'' Cool water was sprayed lightly over his body.
</P>
<P>
   Once more, Warmerdam said, ``Tell my wife I love her!''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick said, ``No, you tell her!''
</P>
<P>
   McCorkell watched Warmerdam freed from the cockpit and carried
away by paramedics, his burned arm held rigid in the air. (ITAL)He
won't survive, (END ITAL) McCorkell thought.
</P>
<P>
   Walking to a triage area hastily set up across the field,
McCorkell heard the screams and moans of burned passengers. He felt
the eyes of a rescue worker upon him. McCorkell, his shirt ripped
open across his chest and with small burns on several fingers,
translated the rescue worker's look: (ITAL)You S.O.B, you ran,
didn't you? How dare you survive when women and old people were not
taken care of! (END ITAL) Even though the rescue worker never said
a word, guilt rushed through McCorkell.
</P>
<P>
   In an ambulance, Baltimore teacher Dawn Dumm, her leg and foot
in pain, cried and bit a towel. A Catholic, Dumm prayed, first
silently and then aloud, (ITAL) ``Our Father . . . Thy kingdom
come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven . . . '' (END
ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Beside her, Warmerdam, an oxygen mask over his mouth, mumbled
something. A nurse leaned closer to hear. Then the nurse told Dumm,
``He wants you to keep praying out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   So Dumm continued her prayers aloud.
</P>
<P>
   The first officer and McCorkell shared a broken cockpit window
and a hatchet 14 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   Before it came to that, when ASA Flight 529 was about to crash
in a field filled with grass and clover, the two men's thoughts
about the most important things in their lives crystallized as
never before.
</P>
<P>
   Warmerdam, 28, a commercial pilot for five months, called out to
his wife in the final words on the cockpit voice recorder: ``Amy, I
love you!''
</P>
<P>
   McCorkell, 37 and twice divorced, had no one to call for. He
traveled so often that his two teenage sons had no idea where he
was. As he prepared to die, McCorkell was alone, bitterly so.
</P>
<P>
   Warmerdam had been chasing a dream, McCorkell a paycheck. One
lived to fly, the other flew to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crash, their lives have been redirected in ways they
could not have imagined. Where once Warmerdam, with a young man's
strut, focused on flying and on a wife he cherished, now he fought
only to stay alive. When his survival was assured he turned to
newer challenges, like buttoning his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkell, on the other hand, was barely scratched in the crash,
but his dash from the flames would become the first steps in a
search for new meaning to his life. Over time, that search would
make him feel freer and less empty.
</P>
<P>
   Warmerdam, with burns over 42 percent of his body, spent 100
days in the burn unit at Chattanooga's Erlanger Medical Center,
then six weeks in the cardiac unit. Even as he was fed 9,000
calories a day intravenously, his weight fell from 208 pounds to
139 on his 6-foot-3 frame. Potentially fatal infections threatened
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a minute-by-minute thing,'' Amy Warmerdam says. ``He
got off the vent(ilator). A week later, his lung collapsed. . . .
It's a total cycle. You can't get excited, you can't get down.''
</P>
<P>
   McCorkell and several other passengers phoned him during those
first few months. But Amy and his doctors permitted no contact in
person or by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendant Fech and her boyfriend, Chris Price, then an
ASA mechanic, were the first allowed in, six weeks after the crash.
They barely recognized Warmerdam. His face had swollen from water
retention; his hands were bandaged; his entire left side was burned
raw to the crown of his head; his left ear had been virtually
seared off.
</P>
<P>
   Fech sat at his bed and asked to touch him. He said yes. She put
her arm on his.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the room cried.
</P>
<P>
   Price remembers Warmerdam, medicated with morphine, asking him
that day what had caused the crash. ``He couldn't tell if it was
his fault,'' Price says. ``Matt had a lot of guilt, survivor's
guilt. He just didn't know if he and Ed (Gan-
</P>
<P>
   naway, the pilot) had done it right. And they did. . . . He was
a brand-new first officer, and I guess that would be the fear of
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Fech reaffirmed to him that he and Gannaway had done superlative
work in bringing the plane to the ground, and she thanked him for
it: ``You saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Warmerdam feels he owes his own life to Amy, his steadfast
companion and protector since the crash.
</P>
<P>
   They met in 1990 in Warmerdam's hometown, Santa Rosa, Calif. He
sold stereos while saving money for flight school; she attended
junior college.
</P>
<P>
   A mutual friend sent her into the store. Warmerdam not only sold
her a stereo, but gave her the employees' ``family discount.'' They
soon became inseparable, and he began pretending to pull an
engagement ring from his pocket. Finally, he did it for real, on a
knoll in the California wine country reachable only by gondola.
</P>
<P>
   He had wanted to fly planes since he was 6. Amy says, ``He loved
flying. I mean, how lucky somebody is to find what they really,
truly love and are able to do it.'' They went to Florida for flight
school, and in the spring of 1995, Warmerdam was hired by ASA. He
called it the realization of ``22 years of dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Warmerdam never envisioned a crash nor what it would be like to
wear a stretchable body stocking designed for burn victims. It was
like a wet suit, uncomfortable, and caused him to itch. He wore it
in pieces: a long-sleeved shirt, and pants down to his ankles; and
then, reconfigured, pants down to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, he relived the crash as if he were watching a movie:
``I'm looking from standing over my shoulder, in the doorway (of
the cockpit). I can see myself and Ed doing everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   While he underwent rehabilitation therapy the spring after the
crash, the Warmerdams got an apartment in Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   Late one night, in a Winn-Dixie, Amy pushed Matt's wheelchair
with one hand, a shopping cart with the other.
</P>
<P>
   They passed a lobster tank. ``Wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!'' Matt
said. For 20 minutes, they watched lobsters step on one another's
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, look at this one over here!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to come and get you!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no! Don't step on my head! Oh, nooooooooooo!''
</P>
<P>
   They laughed and squealed. They were, in Warmerdam's words,
``just being dorks.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy to be alive, happy to be together.
</P>
<P>
   The night of the crash, McCorkell stood before a mirror in a
Carroll County motel room. He reeked of jet fuel, an acrid smell.
He saw shards of cockpit window glass in his dark hair and
mustache. He wanted to shower. But first he felt compelled to
stare. ``I couldn't believe that all of my parts were there. I
couldn't believe that I got through this in one piece. . . . You
feel guilty, but you feel very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   A short time before, he had been sitting outside a hospital in
Bowdon with several other survivors who had minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking a cigarette, McCorkell watched the sun set. ``Did you
think you'd ever see another one of those?'' he asked. He didn't
expect, or get, a reply.
</P>
<P>
   But he knew then that ``every sunset is important and not to be
taken for granted.'' And he vowed to live life to its fullest.
(ITAL)``Make no more excuses!'' (END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Given a second chance, he decided life wasn't only about
obligation _ it also was about possibilities, many wondrous.
</P>
<P>
   He was not proud of his accomplishments. At 17, in Northfield,
Minn., he married a high school classmate. They had two sons before
the marriage dissolved. He retained custody of the boys.
</P>
<P>
   For the next dozen years, he answered the call of responsibility
and obligation: He raised his two sons as a single parent, cooking
macaroni and cheese and Hamburger Helper, the only recipes he knew.
Early on, he worked in a grocer's warehouse. Determined to obtain a
college degree, McCorkell became the oldest person in a room of
people taking the SAT the same week he was the youngest enrolling a
kindergartner.
</P>
<P>
   His degree at the University of Minnesota four years later
earned him a promotion into the grocer's purchasing department,
where he helped to develop a computerized buying system.
</P>
<P>
   On the job, he met Lila Gilbert, who would become his second
wife. She had two sons, too: an instant family of six. Dave and
Lila shared the 40-mile commute to Minneapolis and spent 12 hours a
day together.
</P>
<P>
   But then McCorkell accepted a job working for a competitor,
training clients to use his new employer's software programs. His
travel was designed to be 50 percent of the job, but it was more
like 75 percent. When he called home from the road, he heard Lila's
stress and her growing complaints about the kids.
</P>
<P>
   So he called home less and they grew apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really,'' McCorkell says, ``all that traveling caused my
marriage to break up.'' So amicable was the split after six years
of marriage, they used the same lawyer to draw up the papers.
</P>
<P>
   He was close to his sons, but his frustration with them grew. He
had urged them to pursue education, but neither met his
expectations. After all he had given up for them in his own life,
McCorkell says, ``they didn't want to achieve, so now it's like a
double whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been divorced 13 months and was en route to Mobile, Ala.,
when the plane crashed in the hayfield.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged from the crash suffering from an affliction that can
be as debilitating as burns: loneliness. He determined to transform
himself and to be less inhibited.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the crash, he climbed into a three-seat plane
and flew over Newfoundland, with a client's son as his pilot.
McCorkell didn't even mention the ASA crash. He didn't want to talk
about it or his fears.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, fear of flying was illogical, McCorkell decided. ``If
you were in a car crash, you'd probably get in a car again.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1996 _ about the same time Matt and Amy Warmerdam
giggled at the lobsters in Chattanooga _ McCorkell moved with a son
to Alaska. He rented a two-bedroom apartment in Anchorage and took
a pay cut to work as a buyer for a grocery chain.
</P>
<P>
   He moved there to watch gorgeous sunsets and catch 60-pound fish
in rushing rivers _ the perfect spot for introspection or, as he
says, ``to figure out: What the hell is going on with Dave?''
</P>
<P>
   To get beyond the horror of the hayfield, he had moved to a
place nearer Siberia than Carrollton.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, McCorkell pursued solitary escapes: fishing, skiing,
hiking, golf, reading.
</P>
<P>
   A new home, a new life, a new Dave.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beside a glacier-fed stream outside Anchorage last
summer, snow-capped peaks in every direction, McCorkell explained:
``When you live in the city all of your life, and towns, you start
thinking that everything is man-made. This is not. This is nature
to the Nth degree. And I guess you feel a little bit dinged up from
what man has done anyway. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``So I came out here to check out what nature and God has given
us. It's a real good feeling I got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel safe. I feel like I could heal here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, McCorkell recognized a more personal truth: Amid the
grandeur and beauty of the Alaskan landscape, he still was alone.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 21, 1996, the first anniversary of the crash, Amy
Warmerdam pushed her husband's wheelchair onto the tarmac of a
small airport.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico on a family visit, they explained to airport
officials Matt's need to fly that day.
</P>
<P>
   They boarded a Cessna: Amy in back, Matt next to the flight
instructor. Warmerdam wore his burn stocking and had just undergone
the first of several surgeries on his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   To him, this first flight since the crash was only a formality.
He knew he would fly again, so he told himself, ``OK, let's get
this over with. This will be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot took them up for 15 minutes. He did a pattern, a
touch-and-go. ``I was totally stoked to do it,'' Warmerdam says. In
flight, he put his splinted left hand on the yoke and steered a
little.
</P>
<P>
   To Warmerdam, the experience was about ``conquering.'' He sought
to regain his supremacy over the flying machine.
</P>
<P>
   He says he wants to fly a Brasilia again, and has one purpose in
mind: ``Me kicking its ass instead of it kicking mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times, he has been back in the ASA training simulator,
an exact replica of the Brasilia cockpit, in Atlanta. He had
worried: ``Would it be claustrophobic? Would the sounds scare me?''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the simulator, he watched the video re-creation of Runway
9-Right in Atlanta, a nighttime landscape complete with images of
car and truck headlights along the interstate. ``It was like I had
never left,'' he says. Brightening, he assesses his performance
that day: ``Ex-cellent!''
</P>
<P>
   Warmerdam weighs more than 240 pounds now, having sailed past
his goal of 199. Sporting a beard, he talks about the crash, and
himself, with bravado and humor. (When Fech moved into a home in
Macon this year, Warmerdam gave her a fire extinguisher as a
housewarming gift. ``A little twisted,'' he admits with a laugh.)
</P>
<P>
   Warmerdam's healing process took him in the spring of 1996 from
Chattanooga to the Dublin, Ga., home of Jackie Gannaway, the
pilot's widow. In her living room, Warmerdam faced the three sons
he often had heard Ed Gannaway talk about, and he offered to answer
their questions.
</P>
<P>
   They asked powerful ones: Was their father scared? Did he know
he was going to die? Did he suffer?
</P>
<P>
   Warmerdam told them their father was too busy to be scared, that
he and Ed thought they were going to land the plane safely and
that, no, he did not suffer. Jackie Gannaway remembers that
Warmerdam's scars were severe, but ``his spirits were good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was an intensely personal thing for me to be the
last person to be with him alive,'' Warmerdam says. He hoped his
visit would help the boys: ``It was like a gift I could give back
to them to say, `This is what your dad was like, and you should be
very proud of him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Matt and Amy Warmerdam also visited Carroll County, wanting to
thank Steve Chadwick and the fire rescue crew. Warmerdam urged
Chadwick to ask questions: ``You won't hurt my feelings, just ask
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick took a deep breath. He saw the first officer's heavy
scarring, his disfigured left ear. He asked, ``Did we do you a
favor?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yeah!'' Warmerdam replied. He said he had much to live
for, ``and let's face it, the world is a fantastic place with me in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   His recovery has been slow and hard. In one cosmetic surgery,
doctors put a tissue expander beneath his scalp, then inflated it
with saline twice a week for several months. ``I had this big
bubble head,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He dreads an upcoming operation on his left hand: His thumb must
be repositioned and the web space between it and the index finger
reduced. Pointing to the left wrist, Warmerdam says, ``They need to
recover this whole area with a better skin cover so that it's more
pliable. So they are going to take a muscle out of my abdomen and
graft it over the top, kind of starting over my (left) wrist'' and
``take a tendon out of my foot, graft it to hook this finger back
up. . . . That's the one I'm not looking forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the Warmerdams purchased a gated hillside estate
with a rose garden and swimming pool on a Marin County hillside
overlooking San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   He says he doesn't want to be known as ``Matt the Millionaire,''
and he stresses that his crash settlement has not changed ``who I
am, what I value, the ideals that I hold onto.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole lot of life left for me, and this hasn't
ruined me. And I'm fighting back. I'm going to be OK. And I already
am OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Here the first officer moves beyond dependence on others and
reclaims parts of his life, little by little. ``Instead of acting
tragic,'' he says, ``it becomes more of a game.'' Once he marveled
over his ability to pour a glass of orange juice. In the summer, he
drove to a mall and got Amy a birthday present. ``It felt great.''
</P>
<P>
   He talks of flying again. ``Now that I don't have to, I want to.
It's what I do, you know? It's unfinished business,'' he says. ``If
I'm going to quit, I want to quit when I say I want to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   He spends a lot of time with doctors and in physical therapy. He
swims and lifts weights. Recently, he and Amy had special handrails
installed in the house to accommodate his needs.
</P>
<P>
   Warmerdam says they hope to have children someday, but that is a
``down-the-road type thing.'' He and Amy recently got a golden
retriever puppy. Its name is Runway.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery on his hand will come early next year. ``I don't see
very far past that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people that God just laughs when you make plans
anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotion overcomes him only when he talks of Amy. When he looks
at her, an emotional depth and devotion are obvious, as if an ideal
has been met. In June, in celebration of their fifth anniversary,
they recreated their honeymoon with a trip to Carmel on the
California coast. ``I almost didn't make it,'' Warmerdam says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, of course,'' he would add later, looking across the
kitchen table with tears in his eyes, ``I'd like to thank the
wonderful love of my life over there, who is the reason I still
want to be here and the reason this life is OK still.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the same person I was,'' McCorkell says. He pinpoints
January 1998 as the moment when ``the feeling of not knowing the
answers went away.'' All at once, he stopped worrying about his
sons, felt totally accepted by friends and even quit smoking. His
transformation was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, he saw Lila Gilbert, his ex-wife, for the
first time in two years, at her son's wedding. ``We hit it off,''
McCorkell says.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crash, he says, ``I would have looked the other way
from my wife _ and let my pride take over.'' But now, seeing
himself differently, he saw her in a different light. Before he
returned home to Alaska, Lila told him she loved him. McCorkell
didn't know what to say _ until he arrived in Anchorage eight hours
later and phoned from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the same way,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   He was to see her next at his son's wedding in June, two months
away. But Dave and Lila couldn't wait until then, so she flew to
Anchorage for a long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In July, McCorkell packed his things and drove a sightseeing
5,500 miles back to the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   He moved in with Lila.
</P>
<P>
   She sees big changes in him. ``Dave values family a lot more
than before,'' she says. ``He's taking more time to listen now. He
says that nobody should have to see what he saw (in the hayfield).
How could that not change your life?''
</P>
<P>
   They are talking about giving marriage another try.
</P>
<P>
   An irony is that Lila has his old job _ the one he had at the
time of the crash. ``We've discussed it. We both want jobs that
don't require travel,'' McCorkell says. ``We both want jobs that
will let us make our relationship the No. 1 priority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird that this brought Dave and I closer,'' Lila says of
the crash. ``I don't want to lose the guy. I want him to be in my
life always.''
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of the crash came to McCorkell one day in the
Alaskan frontier: ``What good is it to see this if you can't turn
to somebody and say, 'Isn't that beautiful?' ''

HOUR BY HOUR: FROM BRINK TO BLINK IN WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER and PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen told the president
to attack Iraq. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was then
en route to an economic summit in Malaysia, would agree.
</P>
<P>
   But it was President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, serving as the conduit between the senior officials and the
president, who prevailed. Spurred by a vague bulletin on CNN,
Berger advised Clinton on Saturday morning to hold off.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 minutes before 300 cruise missiles were to rain down on
Baghdad, Clinton called off what would have been the deadliest
military attack of his presidency, according to a reconstruction of
this weekend's events, based on interviews with several of the
participants who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very close, as close as it could possibly come,'' said
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was set to begin at 9 a.m, ET, on Saturday. A few
minutes past 8 a.m., the phone rang in Berger's Washington home.
The galvanizing news came not from the CIA, but CNN, reporting from
Baghdad that Iraq had blinked. The Iraqis had sent a letter to the
United Nations agreeing to allow weapons inspectors to resume their
work.
</P>
<P>
   The president would have to decide whether to call off the
attack or kill an unpredictable number of Iraqis, including
civilians, even as Iraq was appearing to capitulate. Armed only
with this secondhand information, Berger raced to the White House,
arriving in his office in the West Wing at about 8:15. Nobody knew
what the Iraqi letter said. And even if the Iraqis had agreed to
allow the resumption of arms inspections, why should the United
States trust them this time?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was touch and go,'' said a senior administration official.
``Sandy's saying, `Get me the text of that letter right now! Get
what you can off the wires right now! We've got 60 minutes, 45
minutes left.' And the president had to sit there and stare at the
phone and make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sat by a phone in his residence on the second floor of
the White House. With only minutes to go, Berger called the
Pentagon, the State Department and the office of Vice President
Gore, asking all to offer advice on whether the president should
delay the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Berger felt the attack should be delayed to study the Iraqi
offer. Cohen thought the attack should go forward, and that the
Iraqi letter was too late and too confused. Senior aides who had
spoken to Albright, who was then flying to Malaysia for a summit
meeting of Pacific Rim leaders, said that she would also want the
attack to proceed. Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said in an interview on Monday that ``all the pros and
cons were discussed'' and that the military had been ready to carry
out president's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Clinton said he was troubled by Pentagon estimates that
several thousand Iraqis, including civilians, would be killed in
the airstrikes, a death toll far greater than from any other
American military strike since the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you order a military mission that kills thousands of
people if there is the possibility that your adversary is giving in
to your demands?'' asked a White House official. ``To my mind, he
had no choice but to delay this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton picked up the phone, called Cohen, and called off the
attack. By the time the president's order reached seven B-52
bombers nearing Iraq and 14 warships in the Persian Gulf poised to
fire nearly 300 cruise missiles, it was 8:45 a.m. _ fifteen minutes
to go until an assault that could have killed thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton realized that he was about to make war on a nation that
might have just sued for peace, his aides said. ``The president
decided at that point to halt _ to put a pause, actually _ in the
operation to see what that response was,'' another senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a day and a night of non-stop talks in secret
counsels within the White House and around the world. The argument
swung back and forth. The attack was rescheduled for Sunday. But
after receiving assurances from the Iraqis and Kofi Annan, the
secretary-general of the United Nations, that that the ousted
weapons inspectors could return to work unhampered by Saddam
soldiers and spies, the president decided there would be no war.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little after 3 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 40 hours before, Clinton had ordered the Pentagon to
bombard Saddam's strongholds. ``We were going to give it to him
with both barrels,'' one administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Saddam tossed a monkey wrench into the war machine, in the
form of a four-page fax to Annan. A copy of the letter reached the
White House at mid-morning Saturday, as the president, Gore and the
government's top national-security officials convened in person and
by telephone at the White House situation room. The meeting went on
into late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   They studied the letter and decided it might be another Iraqi
ruse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we looked at it, the less we liked it,'' one senior
official said. ``The president said `I'm not prepared to accept
this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The war plans were back on.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, in the White House situation room, the
director of central intelligence, George Tenet, offered the CIA's
opinion that if Iraq readmitted the weapons inspectors, Saddam
would probably cooperate for a few days, perhaps a few weeks _
unless the inspectors found his a cache of biological or chemical
weapons materiel. But sooner or later, the CIA's analysts
predicted, the Iraqi leader would return to his old ways of
concealment and deception, blocking the inspectors' work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Saturday evening, two more letters arrived at the White House.
They had been sent to the U.N. Security Council by the Iraqi
ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon. At 7:20 p.m., the Iraqis offered
unconditional cooperation with the weapons inspectors. By
telephone, the British prime minister, Tony Blair, weighed in,
saying Iraq should specifically renounce its Aug. 5 and Oct. 31
refusals to comply with the weapons inspectors. A second letter
from the Iraqis followed at 9:06 p.m. It met Blair's demand.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the United States thought it had what it sought,
an unconditional, unequivocal statement that Iraq would let the
weapons inspectors do their work. But the argument continued
through the night: should the attack plans be called off? Should a
lesser attack proceed? Could the Iraqis be trusted in any way,
given their record of breaking agreements with the inspectors?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to the Oval Office shortly after 9 p.m. He
spent most of the next five hours on the telephone with Gore, who
was in Air Force One, on his way to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; with
Albright, who already had arrived there after a 20-hour trip; with
Cohen, Tenet, Shelton, Blair and the French leader, Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's exhausted,'' one senior official said. ``The
stakes are high. There were some very emotional moments. It was an
all-nighter. Sandy never left the office. Albright didn't get any
sleep. She and Sandy spoke I don't know how many times. There was
still a commitment to thinking it through, consulting everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, senior officials said, the consensus was that the
United States could not strike Iraq if the Iraqis had essentially
done what Washington had demanded.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m. on Sunday, Berger talked to Annan in New York, trying
to make sure that they were agreed on what the Iraqis' statements
meant. They did.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Berger called Shelton at the Pentagon and
transmitted an order from the president: cancel the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Now the decision had to be explained to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials, including Berger, had been
saying privately all week that the U.N. weapons inspections program
was essentially dead, killed by Saddam's intransigence. The weapons
inspectors had not conducted a thorough search since August; 100
days had passed, allowing Saddam to hide evidence of his suspected
biological and chemical weapons programs. Now the United States had
to strike Iraq swiftly and severely or lose all credibility, they
argued.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton evidently disagreed. On Sunday, he called the weapons
inspectors' ability to return to Iraq ``the best outcome'' of the
crisis, the saving grace of the frustrated war plans. Bombing Iraq,
he argued, probably would not have achieved that result.

 &HT;    Marcus revels in philanthropy
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot Chairman and co-founder Bernie Marcus
remembers a friend in Los Angeles years ago who was making $5
million a year and giving away only $750.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke up that friendship,'' said Marcus. ``He never knew why
I quit being his friend. He still gives away nothing, and he feels
good about it.'' Marcus plans to leave a far different legacy, one
based not on how much he has accumulated but on how much he has
helped others. ``I want to give away as much as I can in my
lifetime,'' said Marcus, whose fortune has been estimated at $1.8
billion by Forbes magazine. He plans to direct his money to
children, health care, education and Jewish causes. Marcus, 69,
adds that his family and children are well provided for and have
been trained in the joy and the art of giving.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Marcus will be honored as Georgia Philanthropist of the
Year by the National Society of Fundraising Executives for his
giving to the Atlanta Jewish Federation, as well as several other
contributions over the years, including more than $4 million to the
Shepherd Center.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, Marcus gave away $45 million to the
Baltimore-based Kennedy Krieger Institute to aid in its merger with
the Atlanta-based Marcus Institute. The money will go to help
children with developmental disorders, including those with brain
injuries or serious behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   Such a commitment to giving places him in the same league as Ted
Turner, vice chairman of Time-Warner, who gained notoriety for a
10-year gift of $1 billion to a foundation supporting the efforts
of the United Nations. ``This is one area where Ted Turner and I
are right in line,'' Marcus said. ``He realized you have to give
back to society. It's a social obligation. And it just feels good
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Turner, Marcus also criticized the wealthy who have trouble
giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand these wealthy people in the United
States,'' he said. ``I think about people like Warren Buffett and
others who have accumulated massive amounts of money. It's almost
as though they are keeping score on who can get richer. I don't
understand that game when there's so much to be done to help
others.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marcus, giving became a way of life at an early age. He
still remembers his mother telling him that he had to share
whatever he had. Even before he became a millionaire many times
over, Marcus gave by volunteering. Along the way to becoming
wealthy, Marcus has kept a spiritual perspective on his life. ``I
think that God had a great deal to do with it,'' he says of his
business success. ``I feel I've been rewarded for the way I've
lived my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that everybody can do something. If you can't do
it financially, you can do it physically. The two are relatively
the same,'' Marcus said. ``There's a joy and a happiness in
participating. Making money is great. I enjoy that. I'm competitive
as well. But there's a feeling you get when you know you've touched
somebody's life. It makes it all worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a joy Marcus is experiencing a lot these days. Almost
everywhere he goes, someone comes up to him with a story of the
needs of children with developmental disorders or people with
disabilities. Often people tell Marcus how one of his gifts has
helped their family.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus said he and Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank have tried
to spread the spirit of giving throughout Home Depot's 700 stores.
One of his favorite stories was a call he received from someone in
Virginia Beach, Va., after a hurricane. The caller said she had
driven by the Home Depot and saw employees giving out free water
while the competition was selling water for $5 a gallon. That
decision was made by the store managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is telling them to do it,'' Marcus said. ``They do
what's right and the soul is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot has been criticized for not participating in an
employee campaign for United Way. Marcus, who contributes
individually to United Way, does not believe in burdening his
employees with another payroll deduction. ``We believe in United
Way. We chose to give our money in a different way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Marcus said one can find Home Depot employees building
homes for Habitat for Humanity or working in communities _ using
skills they have developed in the stores. ``It's not that we write
out a check,'' Marcus said. ``We don't pay our employees to
volunteer. Our people do it off the clock, which is much more
meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   And bucking the trend of many other major corporations, Marcus
does not believe in linking Home Depot's philanthropic causes with
marketing. ``I'm not in favor of that,'' he said. ``Very little of
what we do is publicized. If it were, it would go on ad nauseam. We
don't want people to think we do it for the advertising content.
It's not for the company to feel good. It's for them to feel
good.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With golden sunlight glazing the autumn leaves and a
light breeze sweeping down Broadway, it seemed a great day to honor
John Glenn, and for tens of thousands of people, it was.
</P>
<P>
   But for the longest time Monday morning, almost the only people
to show up to honor the 77-year-old astronaut, U.S. senator and
undisputed American hero were the police, firefighters and
sanitation workers assigned to handle the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And even once the parade got under way, crowds were _ by New
York standards _ modest if not thin, with indications along the
traditional parade route that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani might have
overestimated the public's appetite for a third ticker-tape
extravaganza since October.
</P>
<P>
   Piles of special newspaper editions that were published to mark
the parade remained unsold on sidewalks; once the parade started,
the confetti that substitutes for ticker tape was sparse, and the
large crowds never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   While the police estimated that 500,000 people turned out to
honor the astronauts of the recently returned space shuttle
Discovery, the crowds were only three or four deep along much of
the parade route. A ticker-tape parade last month for the Yankees,
by contrast, drew an estimated 3.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's turnout amounted to a pale reprise of the gigantic
celebration for Glenn in March 1962 when he returned from his
launch into space, the second American to do so. That parade set
the all-time record for the dumping of ticker tape, 3,474 tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tremendous then,'' said Rudy Josenhaus, who had left
his accounting office to witness the celebration of Glenn's
becoming the first American to orbit the earth. ``This is like
Mickey Mouse. This is small potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations with offices along the parade route reported
frenzied calls from mayoral aides urging them to dispatch employees
to the street. Tickets to the private City Hall ceremony were being
passed out until the very last minute.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who did show up, there were many cheerful scenes
of people enjoying themselves during their brush with history.
Fathers hoisted children on their shoulders, children waved
American flags, and people lined up to buy commemorative T-shirts.
A woman from Dallas beamed as she explained how she had emerged
from the subway and found herself watching the parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just came out of the subway and stumbled right into it,''
the woman, Janella Cox, said. ``This is just too lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   One 34-year-old father, Matt Moran, brought his 3-year-old son,
Harry, from Queens to watch from a second-floor office on Broadway.
Moran carried a flag, and Harry a bullhorn. The two had been
studying old National Geographic photographs of rocket missions in
preparation for Monday's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a ticker-tape parade worthy of its participants,''
Moran said. ``It's a connection with our history, history I want to
pass on to my children.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The parade _ which made its way through the traditional Canyon
of Heroes, with Glenn and his wife, Annie, seated in a vintage
Phaeton convertible _ also honored the other six crew members of
Discovery: Lt. Col. Curtis Brown, the shuttle's commander; Lt. Col.
Steven Lindsey, the pilot; Stephen Robinson, a mission specialist;
Scott Parazynski, a mission specialist and the senator's attending
doctor in space; Pedro Duque, another mission specialist, and
Chiaki Mukai, the payload specialist. They and Glenn were given
keys to the city in a ceremony on the steps of City Hall after the
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggested that the low turnout resulted from a lack of
sufficient notification. But another reason may have been
exhaustion from the Yankees' ticker-tape parade and another last
month for Sammy Sosa _ or from the fact that a successful shuttle
flight would naturally have trouble competing with a world-champion
home team.
</P>
<P>
   Others noted that the first time Glenn went into space, he was a
pioneer venturing into unknown territory. And while even Glenn
himself worried this time about his fitness for the trip _ whether
his eyeballs would burst, or if he would suffer inner-ear damage _
this time around the environment was somewhat familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing was a goofy public-relations ploy,''
said Don Howes of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Diggs, who said she is in her 50s and works for a financial
company in lower Manhattan, said she could not understand why the
parade was ``such a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done this before, and there are many people who have
accomplished more and haven't been honored in this way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But numerous others made it clear that they considered Glenn
more of a hero than millionaire athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame more importance is placed on overpaid athletes
than real heroes like John Glenn,'' said Neghan Zerener, a
23-year-old English major at William Patterson University in Wayne,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Cecere, a marketing manager who lives in Rockland
County, said: ``John Glenn deserves as much recognition as the
Yankees. People have gotten complacent about the space program and
the shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's day began with a news conference and a breakfast at the
American Museum of Natural History, which is building a new
planetarium that will work closely with the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Futter, the museum's president, set the tone by saying
that the museum's new ability to communicate directly with space
stations meant that New York, sometimes called the capital of the
world, was now the capital of the universe. She said this made
Giuliani ``mayor of the universe,'' a remark that seemed to delight
him.
</P>
<P>
   The light mood continued when Gabe Pressman, the Channel 4
newscaster, prefaced a question by telling Glenn that he had also
covered Glenn's first New York parade. ``You're getting old, aren't
you?'' Glenn said. Pressman shot back, ``You bet.''

COMMENTARY: A KANGAROO COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For most Americans, impeachment is a dead issue. But
that is not the reality in Washington. Republicans on the House
Judiciary Committee are pressing on, by all signs as determined as
ever to approve an impeachment resolution.
</P>
<P>
   This week the committee holds hearings with Kenneth Starr as the
main, perhaps only, witness. Think about what an extraordinary
proposition that is: as if, in a criminal trial, the jury heard
only opening and closing speeches from the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is an able and experienced advocate who will no doubt be
impressive. But he has no firsthand knowledge of anything. His
testimony will be another stage in his single-minded campaign to
persuade the country that President Clinton should be removed from
office _ a campaign that he has carried on by leaks and disclosure
of grand jury material to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, Henry Hyde, has made it extremely
difficult for the Democrats on the committee to question Starr
about the only subject on which he does have firsthand knowledge:
his methods. There is evidence that those methods include abuse of
witnesses, violation of Justice Department regulations and lawless
leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has blocked many Democratic requests for relevant documents
and witnesses, and Starr's office has refused to supply others. One
request was that some of Starr's principal deputies be called to
the hearing as well as he. The deputies have been involved in
well-known instances of bullying, such as the surprise
confrontation of Monica Lewinsky last January and the attempt to
get her to sign an immunity agreement without the advice of a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Democrats unsuccessfully asked chairman Hyde to join
in requesting documents about contacts between the Office of
Independent Counsel and Paula Jones' lawyers. There have been
reports of such contacts before the date on which Starr first said
he heard about the Monica Lewinsky business, Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats may even be barred altogether from asking Starr
about his staff's reported abuses. There are unconfirmed reports
that Hyde will forbid such questions.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Democrats will be unable to get into a highly
significant aspect of Starr's performance: leaks. That is the
subject of an investigation by the Chief Judge of the U.S. District
Court in Washington, Norma Holloway Johnson, and a special master
whom she has appointed. Judge Johnson found prima facie evidence
that 24 stories carried by the four television networks, The New
York Times, The Washington Post and other newspapers and magazines
were based on leaks from Starr's office. They attributed facts to
unnamed sources with such descriptions as ``prosecutors'' and
``lawyers close to the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure forbids
government lawyers to disclose grand jury material. Starr said last
February: ``I have made the prohibition of leaks a principal
priority of this office. It is a firing offense.'' It is also
punishable as criminal contempt.
</P>
<P>
   In the new issue of the magazine Brill's Content, Steven Brill
chides the press for not covering Judge Johnson's leak inquiry more
enthusiastically. Reporters will not answer if asked who their
sources were, arguing that they agreed to hide the identities. But
Starr could be asked whether he will release reporters from any
such undertakings to members of his staff _ if chairman Hyde does
not block the question.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's apparent strategy to protect Kenneth Starr from vigorous
questioning indicates the intensely partisan nature of this
impeachment process. Barring some sudden change of mind, the
Judiciary Committee will vote out an impeachment resolution.
</P>
<P>
   On the House floor, the Republican majority may well approve the
resolution _ despite the election, despite public opposition. That
would mean a trial of President Clinton in the Senate, with Chief
Justice William Rehnquist presiding. For months, all three branches
of the United States government would be paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Republicans find a way to change this disastrous course
_ disastrous for the country and for them? It is still an open
question.

CLEMENS WINS FIFTH CY YOUNG

<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday was another memorable day for Roger Clemens, a day when
he became the first pitcher in history to snare five Cy Young
awards. Clemens won the American League Cy Young unanimously, won
it for the second straight year with the Toronto Blue Jays and
marched even closer to his eventual place in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday was also another unstable day for Clemens, a day when
he continued to wonder if the Jays would improve through trades or
free-agent signings or if they would stay stagnant. If Toronto
remained status quo, he sounded as if he would be a perturbed ace
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   As elated as Clemens was about achieving an unprecedented honor,
he emphasized that he longed to return to post-season play. While
Clemens is signed with Toronto through the 2000 season and said his
priority was to help lead the Blue Jays into meaningful games in
October, he wanted to know whether the team was serious about
contending now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm just going to win games and make it exciting for fans,
great, I enjoy doing that,'' he said. ``I wish someone would let me
know. I don't hear anything from the office about catching up with
the Yankees, Baltimore and Cleveland. I don't hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who was 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA and 271 strikeouts in
2342/3 innings, was named first on all 28 ballots cast by two
writers from each AL city from the Baseball Writers Association of
America. Boston's Pedro Martinez finished second while the Yankees'
David Wells and David Cone were third and fourth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Clemens also won the award for the Red Sox in
1986, 1987 and 1991. Greg Maddux and Steve Carlton have four Cy
Youngs each. Only two other pitchers have won the AL award
unanimously _ Denny McLain in 1968 and Ron Guidry in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming to have done this five times,'' Clemens
said. ``It's never been done before in this manner. It really
hasn't sunk in yet.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting the season sluggishly, Clemens remembered how he
peered up at the scoreboard, saw that his record was 5-6 after a
May 29 loss and said he felt embarrassed. He never lost after that
day, going undefeated in his last 22 starts with 15 victories. He
topped the league in ERA and strikeouts and was tied with Cone for
the most triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clemens' agents talked to the Jays about the possibility
of a trade last July. Clemens was buoyed when Toronto made a dash
at the Red Sox for the wild-card berth. But, six weeks later, the
Jays have not made any major personnel moves, and Clemens is antsy.
Antsy enough to answer questions about the seemingly farfetched
possibility of returning to Boston in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Red Sox are trying to be competitive,'' Clemens
said before rambling on about how he prefers the intensity of the
cities in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's general manager, Gord Ash, is waiting for the team's
owner, Interbrew, to provide him with a budget, so the Blue Jays
have moved methodically. Toronto offered Jose Canseco a one-year
contract for $2.25 million and $750,000 in bonuses and an option
year for similar money, but the 34-year-old designated hitter, who
hit 46 homers, wants four years for $28 million. ``I'm gone for
sure,'' Canseco told The Toronto Sun. ``I don't think they ever had
any intention of bringing me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who said the Jays would be taking ``a couple of steps
backward'' by not signing Canseco, said the team needed a
``big-time center fielder,'' a second baseman and a left-hander who
could win 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first and foremost desire is to win in Toronto,'' Clemens
said. ``Not for me to win, for us to win. Even though I've won
games, I'd rather be 10-10 and them giving me the ball in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens could have signed with the Yankees or the Indians, who
both seriously courted him as a free agent in the winter of 1996
and reached the post-season the last two years. The Yankees,
Indians, Red Sox and others would be interested in Clemens, but the
Jays would have to be overwhelmed to trade their most valuable
pitcher and the one and only five-time Cy Young winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lot of say-so,'' Clemens said. ``I'm locked in.
I'm glad to be locked in. I want to get to the post-season again.
It would be great if it could happen again.''

 &HT;    NL honor may return to Glavine
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Seven years and 1,533 innings removed from his first
prize, Tom Glavine waits for another phone call this afternoon. No
one said Cy Young only rings once.
</P>
<P>
   Either Glavine, Kevin Brown or Trevor Hoffman will win the
National League Cy Young Award in what is expected to be a very
close vote among the membership of the Baseball Writers'
Association of America. Brown (18-7) nearly willed San Diego into
the World Series, while Hoffman's 53 saves for the Padres tied the
NL record set five years ago by Randy Myers.
</P>
<P>
   But Glavine's 20 wins led the league, while his 2.47 ERA
represented a career-low, and his 11-2 mark in starts after a
Braves loss proves his value. Glavine was named to the NL All-Star
team for the sixth time last season and already this fall was
awarded his fourth Silver Slugger award.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux, who led the league with a 2.27 ERA and won the
Players' Choice award for NL pitcher of the year as voted by the
players, is expected to be an also-ran after finishing the second
half with a 6-7 record.
</P>
<P>
   The BBWAA voting was concluded before the postseason began,
which negates Brown's heroics in the division series and NLCS.
Brown's ERA (2.38) was second only to Maddux among NL starters and
his 257 innings were second only to Curt Schilling. Both Brown and
Glavine threw three shutouts while Brown struck out 257 batters,
100 more than Glavine in 28 more innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is attempting to become the first reliever to win the NL
Cy Young since Mark Davis won one for the Padres in 1989. He
converted 53 of 54 save opportunities for a .981 success rate, the
highest ever by a closer with more than 30 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Once a staple in the Cy Young voting, Glavine not only won the
award in 1991 but finished in the top three three times through the
1993 season. Since then, he drew votes only in 1995 (third behind
Maddux) and had been shut out the last two seasons.

 &HT;    Falcons' pass offense success not coincidental
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That the Atlanta Falcons were able to beat the San
Francisco 49ers 31-19 on Sunday despite the fact that wide
receivers caught just five passes total was no small feat.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a fluke, either, as Atlanta has continued its
expansion of the passing offense so that tight ends and running
backs play a more prominent role.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Bob Christian was the chief benefactor Sunday, catching
four passes to tie WR for the team high, and his 48 receiving yards
were more than anybody else. On a few occasions, the 5-foot-11,
230-pound, seventh-year veteran even split out wide, and had one of
his receptions as a wideout.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest play was a 19-yard screen on first-and-20 in the
third quarter, and it helped Atlanta keep alive a drive. Last week,
his 39-yard screen play on the second play of the game took the
ball to the New England 1, and set up a Jamal Anderson touchdown,
the start of a 41-10 rout.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Rams a week before that, Christian had a 17-yard
reception.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 catches for 182 yards and a TD, he's now ahead of his
pace from last year, when he caught 22 passes for 154 yards and a
TD.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start as a receiver this season, as he was called
upon frequently to help block while the offensive line was
struggling with blitz pickups, Christian is rolling, and Atlanta
coach Dan Reeves said that will happen even more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got more than we bargained for last year when we signed
him,'' Reeves said. ''We knew he was an excellent blocker, and he's
showing us he's much better with the ball in his hands than we
thought. We're going to have to keep finding ways to get him
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, TEs O.J. Santiago and Brian Kozlowski had one catch
apiece Sunday, and now have 17 and five catches, respectively.
Kozlowski's total matches that of WR Todd Kinchen, who is well
behind starting WRs Terance Mathis (41 for 689 yards and five TDs)
and Tony Martin (36 for 654 yards and four TDs). Santiago also has
three TDs.
</P>
<P>
   They combined for four catches and two TDs against the Patriots,
and Santiago had two catches against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Ron Medlin reported nothing more serious from Sunday's
game than the ankle sprains originally reported by Anderson, DE
Lester Archambeau, and LB Craig Sauer.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, however, was wearing a temporary cast on his lower
left leg Monday. That's more precautionary than anything, as a
similar ankle sprain bothered Anderson the first half of last
season, when he had less than 300 yards in the first seven games.
He never immobilized it in '97, and is being extra careful this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   CB Ronnie Bradford, who dressed Sunday for the first time Sunday
after missing two games with a strained knee ligament, did not play
on defense, but played a few snaps on punting teams. His role is
expected to increase Sunday against the Bears. Reeves said that
once Bradford is 100 percent healthy, he will return to the
starting lineup, even though Michael Booker has played well. Reeves
said no starter will lose a job because of an injury. . . . Did you
notice in Sunday's game that when 49er QB Steve Young kept trying
to argue with officials who were conferring on what ended up being
offsetting interference penalties against Falcon CB Ray Buchanan
and 49er WR Jerry Rice, Falcon LB Cornelius Bennett followed the
49er QB all around the huddle of officials, blocking him from
getting involved? . . . With S Chris Bayne (hamstring) inactive
Sunday, it was the first game rookie S Omar Brown dressed. He
played only on kickoffs and didn't get to do much, as four of K
Morten Andersen's kicks were not returned. . . Andersen, who scored
seven points, has 401 points as a Falcon, passing K Norm Johnson
(395) to move into second place in franchise history. K Mick
Luckhurst leads with 558. . . QB Chris Chandler's 78-yard TD pass
to Mathis was his longest throw as a Falcon, and the second-longest
of his career (82). Chandler's club record for TD passes in
consecutive games grew to 21, and he has thrown at least one pass
of 30 or more yards in every game this season. It was the
second-longest reception of Mathis' career ('81, vs. SF in '94). .
. . Reeves singled out DT Shane Dronett for outstanding play after
Dronett had six tackles, 1.5 sacks, forced a fumble that MLB Jessie
Tuggle scored on, and defended a pass. . . . WR Ronnie Harris,
signed Wednesday after WR Jammi German was put on injured reserve,
was deep with Elijah Williams to return kicks. Harris also returned
punts (he fair-caught three), and he and Williams were the outside
cover men on punts.

ONLINE MAGAZINE IN DILEMMA OVER MICROSOFT TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Michael Kinsley _ editor of the online magazine Slate,
which is owned by Microsoft Corp. _ first heard that Microsoft was
going to trial in an antitrust lawsuit filed by the Justice
Department, he knew he would not emerge unscathed. How does a
magazine owned by a giant corporation cover its parent's antitrust
trial?
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial thought was, `Can we get away with skipping it?'''
Kinsley said. But he felt he would disappoint readers if he did not
cover some aspects of the trial. Kinsley hired the rapier-witted
journalist and author Michael Lewis to post his impressions from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, Lewis fired off his first tart dispatch. He wrote
that Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, looked in his videotaped
testimony ``as if he had swallowed a bad oyster.'' He continued,
``I doubt any sane and reasonable man could come away from today
thinking anything but that Microsoft is guilty of many awful
things, and if those things aren't strictly illegal, they should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' correspondence seemed mightily unfettered by Microsoft.
He referred to a Microsoft lawyer, John Warden, as ``a great
Hogarthian ball of pink flesh with jowls that ripple over his
white, starched shirt.'' Lewis dismissed the ``ineptitude'' of the
Microsoft lawyers. In his last missive on Nov. 5, he described
another Microsoft lawyer as having ``the warmth of a corpse.'' He
added, ``If the courtroom population were asked to vote who in the
chamber was most likely to be a vampire, he'd win.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley joked about the close relationship between Slate and
Microsoft in his regular letter from the editor. On Oct. 23, he
posted a disclaimer of sorts in his weekly ``Read Me'' column:
``Lewis' views do not reflect those of Slate magazine, its editors,
or its advertisers. Especially its editors.''
</P>
<P>
   His disclaimer set the press critics in motion. The New York
Observer pointed out how difficult it was for Slate to cover the
trial and keep the ``whole enterprise honest when that doesn't
interfere with the mother corporation's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the ``vampire'' salvo, Lewis resigned. The Internet
magazine Salon published an article last week suggesting that
higher powers at Microsoft had asked for Lewis' resignation.
Readers of Slate began to e-mail in complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who is a contributor to The New York Times Magazine, said
Monday that he and Kinsley had long ago agreed that he would write
the column only for a limited time, and that he intended to return
to work on a book about Silicon Valley to be published next year.
Lewis pointed out that ``there were so many conflicts of interests
here it was impossible to keep track of them, to be honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley said he had tried to solve the problem by asking Lewis
to write the impressionistic essays for which Lewis is well known,
rather than straight reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was replaced on Nov. 10 by Herbert Stein, former chairman
of the Council of Economic Advisers under Presidents Nixon and
Ford. Stein _ who opened his first column with a lengthy, drowsy
football metaphor _ wrote only two columns, turning it over last
Friday to Jodie Allen, Slate's Washington editor. Ms. Allen began
her column by announcing her fidelity to Microsoft: ``I will not
pretend to be an objective observer of the Microsoft trial. You
wouldn't believe me if I did.''

 &HT;    Deal offered by tobacco companies
 &HT;    (EDS: Can run with GA-TOBACCO.)
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ In what is potentially the biggest financial
settlement in U.S. history, a dozen states have endorsed a sweeping
proposal that would use $206 billion from cigarette makers to
reimburse states for treating sick smokers and to discourage young
people from lighting up.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the states' attorneys general agreed to drop their
health-related lawsuits against the nation's biggest cigarette
producers, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson and
Lorillard.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is among 34 states that face a Friday deadline to join
the proposed national tobacco settlement, unveiled Monday amid
criticism from some health advocates and uncertainty by tobacco
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal would let the industry get off cheap,'' said consumer
advocate Ralph Nader in Washington. ``The deal's public health
measures are very weak.''
</P>
<P>
   The new settlement would not affect agreements already reached
by four states_Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Attorney General Mike Easley, who signed the new
agreement during a news conference in Raleigh, said tobacco
companies have indicated they'll go along with the settlement as
long as about three-fourths of the states endorse it. Tobacco farm
leaders also indicated they will back the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in December, the industry would make five up-front
payments, totaling $12.7 billion billion through 2003, according to
the deal. Annual payments starting in April 2000 would make up the
bulk of the agreement, totaling $183.2 billion through 2025. Easley
said that, after 2025, annual payments would continue as long as
the industry produced cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Easley rebuffed criticism that the attorneys generals need
longer than five days to consider the complicated deal. He said he
and the seven other attorneys general who negotiated the agreement
over the past five months have kept their colleagues across the
country informed about its progress.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where President Clinton joined some of the
attorneys general who negotiated the deal, the president endorsed
the proposed settlement as a first step. He urged Congress ``to
finish the job'' by enacting comprehensive tobacco legislation that
would address the government's jurisdiction over tobacco, take
further steps to reduce youth smoking, and guarantee protection for
tobacco farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In Raleigh, officials representing North Carolina farmers and
state chapters of the American Cancer Society, the American Heart
Association and the American Lung Association voiced their support
for the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   They described it as a reasonable compromise between public
health in North Carolina and the economic importance of tobacco in
the state, America's biggest producer of flue-cured leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize in this state that to have healthy communities, you
need healthy economies,'' said Lisa Poovey Greene, an American
Cancer Society official in Raleigh. ``The people who are tobacco
growers are our friends, our neighbors and our families.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be worked out in coming months, Easley said, is
how farmers would be compensated in the event that marketing
restrictions and higher prices reduce demand for cigarettes and
thus cut into tobacco production. The agreement requires that
cigarette companies meet with farmers' representatives to ``address
concerns about the potential adverse economic impact'' on
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers want compensation for the losses they incur in
equipment, earning power and the quota'' on how much the federal
government allows them to plant, said Bruce Flye, a North Carolina
tobacco farmer and president of the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative
Stabilization Corp., which represents farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Easley said he and the seven other attorneys general were able
to negotiate a settlement because they avoided the political rancor
that in June doomed a broader settlement proposal debated in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to take this important issue away from politics and
get a solution_one that will inform the consumers, protect kids and
bring stability and certainty to tobacco farmers,'' Easley said.
``I believe this agreement accomplishes that.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia would receive $4.6 billion over 25 years in exchange for
dropping the lawsuit it earlier filed against cigarette
manufacturers. Claiming that the companies improperly induced
people to smoke, the state is trying to recover the Medicaid costs
of treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's suit seeks $2.8 billion from tobacco companies, but
damages could amount to three times that amount. That's because the
suit was filed under the state's Racketeering Influenced and
Corrupt Organization law.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker has briefed Gov. Zell
Miller, Gov.-elect Roy Barnes and legislative leaders about the
proposed settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said Monday he plans to meet with public health leaders
and decide whether the state will join the settlement, or proceed
with its lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The eight states that negotiated the deal are California,
Colorado, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania and Washington. The four other states joining the
agreement Monday are Arkansas, Arizona, Iowa and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, political bickering and industry opposition
doomed ambitious efforts to enact legislation that would have
forced cigarette makers to pay up to $516 billion over 25 years. In
exchange, the industry would have been protected from many of the
health-related lawsuits against it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement announced Monday, cigarette companies would
not be shielded from lawsuits by individuals or groups of
plaintiffs, or from lawsuits by states which do not join the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Also under the agreement with the states, cigarette makers would
stop advertising on billboards and on public buses, and restrict
brand-name sponsorship to a single event.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, R.J. Reynolds, would have to decide between
sponsoring the Winston Cup NASCAR series or the Vantage
professional golf tournament, Easley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoon characters in ads also would be banned. Companies also
could not pay to have its products promoted in movies, live
performances and video games.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies could not lobby against state laws aimed at
restricting youth access to cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The pact would create a foundation with a nearly $1.5 billion
education fund for grants and programs at the state and community
levels. A second foundation with $250 million would research teen
smoking and substance abuse.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Roth, the head of programming for the Fox television
network, announced his resignation Monday, becoming the second
entertainment-division president to depart a network in the last
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a subsidiary of News Corp., is expected to appoint Doug
Herzog, the president of the cable channel Comedy Central, as its
new head of programming on Tuesday. NBC appointed Scott Sassa
president of its entertainment division on Oct. 26 after the
resignation of Warren Littlefield.
</P>
<P>
   In a shift that may reflect the conclusion of the broadcast
networks that they need to change their approach to programming,
both Herzog and Sassa will now run the entertainment divisions of
broadcast networks after building their careers guiding the
entertainment operations of cable networks. Before joining NBC,
Sassa ran the entertainment operations for the Turner cable
channels.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's move was not entirely unexpected because the network
started the television season in September with several weeks of
disappointing ratings and was quickly forced to cancel four
comedies. That initiated rumors that Roth would be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks Fox rebounded and is now within reach of
scoring the biggest victory in its history, a first-place finish
among the 18-to-49-year-old audience most coveted by advertisers,
during a sweep month, one of three special ratings periods during
the television season.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, under Roth, Fox added two hits in the last two
seasons, ``Ally McBeal'' and ``King of the Hill,'' and was poised
to add several promising animated shows this winter, including one,
``Family Guy,'' that is being talked about as having the potential
to be the first breakout hit in what has been a hitless network
season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one aspect of the timing of Roth's departure is not
unusual. Fox has changed its entertainment president every other
fall for the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Monday, Roth, who declined to comment further,
said he would start a production company. ``I am pleased to have
helped contribute to the success that Fox Entertainment has enjoyed
during my tenures at both 20th Century Fox television and more
recently the Fox Broadcasting Company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roth had previously run the television-studio arm of Fox. There
he helped develop such successful series as ``The X-Files,''
``Picket Fences,'' ``Chicago Hope'' and ``The Practice.'' The last
three of those shows, along with ``Ally McBeal,'' were created by
David Kelley, the prolific television writer with whom Roth had a
close working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has offered Roth a production deal in conjunction with the
network, much the same as Littlefield's deal at NBC. But Roth has
not decided whether he will stay with Fox or go on his own, an
executive with knowledge of the Fox offer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Roth will stay in television, however. He was widely known as
one of the most passionate advocates of the business and had taken
a leading role in urging network television to revolutionize its
programming operations, both by putting programs into development
all year round and by finding innovative ways to inject new
programs into summer months, when wall-to-wall repeats have helped
advance the exodus of viewers to cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog was responsible for some of the programs that have been
pulling those viewers away.
</P>
<P>
   He did not return phone calls Monday, and Fox executives refused
to confirm that he would replace Roth. But numerous executives
close to both Herzog and Roth confirmed that Herzog had accepted
Fox's offer and would join the network shortly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Herzog was named president of Comedy Central in July 1995,
arriving after establishing a reputation as an innovative
programmer for MTV. Comedy Central was a little-regarded all-comedy
network at the time, relying mostly on repeat programs that once
ran on one of the broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   But under Herzog, the network, which is owned by Viacom and Time
Warner's HBO unit, has improved its ratings for 14 consecutive
quarters. It scored one of the biggest breakthroughs in cable
history last season when it introduced the animated series ``South
Park'' and immediately began scoring some of the highest ratings
for any nonsports programming on cable television.
</P>
<P>
   The series received both wide critical acclaim for its
outrageous language and subject matter (one of the four main
animated children characters is luridly killed in every episode)
and criticism because of its especially potent appeal to teen-age
and preteen viewers. Herzog argued that the show was telecast at a
late hour and was intended for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog was also instrumental in the creation of the channel's
nightly satirical report on the day's news events, ``The Daily
Show.'' While not as successful as ``South Park,'' the show built a
loyal following.
</P>
<P>
   The show's star, Craig Kilborn, was hired away by CBS for that
network's forthcoming new late-night program. Herzog responded by
hiring a far better-known comedian, Jon Stewart, to replace Kilborn
when he leaves ``The Daily Show'' early next year.
</P>
<P>
   While at MTV, Herzog was credited with building the channel's
news operation and its expansion into regular programs like the
game show ``Remote Control,'' the concert series ``Unplugged'' and
the much-talked-about cinema-verite summer series ``Real World.''

DISPUTE OVER CONCEALING EVIDENCE FROM WIRETAPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A judge has refused to ban a much-disputed
procedure used by the Los Angeles district attorney to conceal from
defendants the fact that some cases originated in wiretap
surveillance from other investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the procedure, known as a handoff and used dozens of times
in recent years, investigators who hear of criminal activity while
listening to a wiretapped conversation pass that information to a
second set of officers without identifying its source.
</P>
<P>
   Those officers then establish independent probable cause for an
arrest and the defense is never told of the existence of the
wiretap and the tip.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal defense lawyers contend that the procedure violates
defendants' rights to due process and discovery rights by
precluding them from challenging the evidence in court. They also
say that it violates state and federal laws that say evidence
derived from a wiretap cannot be admitted unless the existence of
the wiretap is disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that they are entitled to conceal the
existence of a wiretap if revealing it would render it useless in
another investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The public defender's office here sought a ban on the procedure
and also asked the court to order the notification of all
defendants charged with crimes based on concealed wiretaps.
Further, the public defender requested documentation of wiretap
applications, orders and transcripts so that new trials could be
sought for all those convicted as a result of tips obtained from
the wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   But in a ruling last Thursday, Judge Larry Fidler declined to
bar prosecutors from using the procedure. He said, however, that
prosecutors must inform all defendants when their cases are
generated by wiretap surveillance, unless doing so would jeopardize
an ongoing investigation, in which case they must get a judge's
permission to conceal the source of their information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view it as an affirmation that we were doing the right
thing,'' William Hodgman, who oversees the narcotics division of
the district attorney's office, said of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Quant, a deputy public defender, said she would appeal the
judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In June, District Attorney Gil Garcetti acknowledged the
hand-off procedure had been used to conceal wiretap evidence in 58
cases since 1993, and agreed to inform all defendants affected by
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-off procedure came to light for the first time in
March, when lawyers for three men charged in a cocaine trafficking
case filed a routine discovery motion and were surprised to find
prosecutors seeking confidential hearings with the judge, who
ultimately ruled that the wiretap evidence had to be turned over to
defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a series of hearings in which defense lawyers
questioned police and prosecutors about how long and how frequently
they had used the procedure.

COURT LIMITS SCOPE OF ARBITRATION PACTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Va.)   (jw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vaguely worded clauses in labor contracts that
require submitting workplace disputes to arbitration cannot be
invoked to deprive individual employees of the right to bring
employment discrimination cases in federal court, the Supreme Court
ruled unanimously Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in one of the more closely watched discrimination cases
of the current term, the court stopped short of answering the
obvious next question: Would an explicitly worded arbitration
clause, reflecting a clear intent to channel discrimination claims
as well as other issues into arbitration and out of court, be
enforceable?
</P>
<P>
   Because the union in this case had in fact not clearly waived
the right of its members to go to court, there was no need to
answer that question, Justice Antonin Scalia said in his opinion
for the court. But at at a minimum, he said, ``the right to a
federal judicial forum is of sufficient importance to be protected
against less-than-explicit union waiver'' of the right to go to
court.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Wright vs. Universal Maritime Service Corp., No.
97-889, overturned a 1997 ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Richmond. That court interpreted an arbitration clause
in a collective bargaining agreement between the International
Longshoremen's Association and the Port of Charleston, S.C., as
having stripped a longshoreman, Caesar Wright, of his right to sue
under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The clause provided for a grievance and arbitration procedure
for all ``matters under dispute between the parties,'' without
referring explicitly to rights under the federal statutes that
prohibit discrimination in the workplace on the basis of race, sex,
age or disability. Nonetheless, the Fourth Circuit said, Wright
could not go to court with his claim of disability discrimination
because his union had effectively waived that right when it
negotiated the arbitration clause.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stephen Ralston, a senior staff attorney with the NAACP
Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represented Wright, said
Monday that the Supreme Court's decision could have a significant
practical effect, despite the fact that the justices were silent on
whether an explicit waiver of the right to sue could be enforced.
Although arbitration clauses are common in collective-bargaining
agreements, Ralston said, few of them explicitly waive rights given
under federal anti-discrimination laws, and so would not be
enforceable under the test the court set on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, along with many civil rights and
labor groups, filed briefs on behalf of the longshoreman, as did
the National Academy of Arbitrators. The group, which represents
professional arbitrators, told the court that the traditional
function of arbitration in the workplace was to resolve disputes
over the interpretation and application of the contract.
Unmistakable evidence of the intent of the parties should be
required before extending an arbitration clause to a case involving
individual rights, the arbitrators' brief said.
</P>
<P>
   Employer groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the
National Association of Manufacturers filed briefs for the
employer.
</P>
<P>
   As Scalia acknowledged Monday, the court's precedents on
arbitration in the labor-management setting have been to some
degree inconsistent. A 1974 case, Alexander vs. Gardner-Denver,
held that employees covered by arbitration clauses retained the
right to go to court for individual discrimination claims. A 1991
case, Gilmer vs. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., upheld the
enforceability of arbitration provisions for such cases in
securities industry agreements that applied to stockbrokers.
``There is obviously some tension between these two lines of
cases'' that remains unresolved, Scalia said.

is trimmed with a jewel-color fringe of pleated silk, which Isogawa
rescued from old kimonos in his native Japan. Gutsy, navy silk
trousers cut like pajamas have a deep waistband of white elastic.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from about $125 for a sleeveless nylon top to
$2,252 for a gown of calico with Japanese art motifs beaded and
embroidered by hand in silver and gold. A lining of brilliant red
jacquard silk is visible on the dress' semicircular train.
</P>
<P>
   Isogawa emigrated from Japan to Sydney 11 years ago, and his
designs bear traces of his homeland. ``There is some element of
Japanese in all my collections,'' said Isogawa, who was in New York
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Barneys will carry the collection exclusively in New York,
Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Isogawa's work to Barneys was one of the last important
decisions that Bonnie Pressman, former executive vice president for
women's wear, made before leaving to join Ralph Lauren this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Gilhart, the vice president of women's wear at Barneys,
accompanied Ms. Pressman on the trip to Australia in May. ``We were
so blown away by his show,'' she said. ``We didn't expect to see
something up to this stature.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; An Uptown Cousin &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Intermix, which revived hip, affordable designer shopping
downtown five years ago and was beaten uptown by boutiques like
Scoop and Olive &AMP; Bette, is fighting back. Last Thursday, Intermix
opened a store at 1003 Madison Ave. (77th Street). Its original
store is at 125 Fifth Ave. (19th Street) in the Flatiron district.
</P>
<P>
   The new store is carrying the heart of the downtown boutique's
look, with designers like Daryl K., Vivienne Tam and Andasimo, and
handbags by Kate Spade. But it is lacking Rodney Walker, its
celebrated salesman, who moved on earlier this year to Untitled, a
downtown store.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the uptown Intermix will carry new lines, like
Elspeth Gibson, Martin Margiela's Six, Clements Ribiero and
Catherine by Catherine Malandrino, and will have a shoe department
featuring the designs of English designer Jimmy Choo.
</P>
<P>
   The uptown store is a bit higher-end than its downtown cousin,
but Khajak Keldjian, who with his brother Haro owns the two stores
here, as well as two in Japan, would rather not promote the
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really not about being a designer store,'' he said.
``We're still about introducing new designers. Uptown, we are
trying to keep things a little bit different because the customer
is a little different. Downtown is a little hipper. It's more
cutting edge. Uptown we're trying to keep the same feeling with a
little more femininity.''

HEWLETT-PACKARD'S EARNINGS EXCEED WALL ST. ESTIMATES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hewlett-Packard Co. reported fourth-quarter
earnings Monday that exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates but
said that revenue and growth in orders remained weak.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the sluggish sales, Hewlett-Packard officials
attributed the unexpectedly strong earnings to the company's
continuing cost-cutting efforts. The quarter was the first in many
years in which expenses did not grow compared to the same period a
year earlier. This was only the second time in 11 quarters that
Hewlett-Packard earnings did not fall below the consensus estimate.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Oct. 31, Hewlett-Packard reported earnings
of $710 million, or 68 cents a diluted share, a decline of 12
percent compared with $806 million, or 75 cents a share, in the
period a year earlier. Revenue rose 4 percent, to $12.23 billion
from $11.79 billion. Special charges of approximately $170 million,
taken for voluntary severance programs and writedowns, reduced
earnings by 11 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Without those charges, Hewlett-Packard earned 79 cents a share.
Analysts estimated Hewlett-Packard would earn 74 cents a share,
according to the First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
Before Hewlett-Packard reported its results after the close of the
market, its shares rose 87.5 cents, to $66.125.The shares fell as
low as $65.8125 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they did the best they could given the circumstances,
but it's still a very murky picture,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an
analyst with J.P. Morgan. ``They did a great job on expenses, and
PC's didn't hurt them as much,'' he said, referring to previous
quarters where Hewlett-Packard sold PC's at unprofitable prices to
maintain market share. ``They need to emphasize product areas where
they have higher gross margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Together with unexpectedly strong results from the Intel Corp.
and a predictably positive report from the Dell Computer Corp. last
week, Hewlett-Packard's results point to a rejuvenated market for
personal computers, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finished the year with a reasonably good quarter, and we're
pleased that, on an operating basis, earnings per share came in
above analysts' consensus,'' Lewis E. Platt, the company's
chairman, president and chief executive, said in a statement.
``Several businesses did quite well, especially laser jet printers
and PC's,'' he said. `` However, our overall revenue growth
remained sluggish, in part reflecting continued weakness in Asia
and, more recently, in Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wayman, Hewlett-Packard's chief financial officer, added
in a telephone conference call with analysts: ``Many things went
well, but top-line growth was weak. So we didn't take full
advantage of significant progress in our cost structures.'' Order
growth in the quarter was just 6 percent, compared with a 14
percent increase in the quarter a year earlier, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayman said Asia Pacific remained weak, with revenue in dollars
down 20 percent compared with results from the fourth quarter of
1997 and 3 percent from the third quarter of 1998. The company also
saw some softening of demand in the United States, where revenue
growth was 4 percent, compared with 17 percent in the quarter a
year earlier and 9 percent in the third quarter. Demand also
slackened in Latin America, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Hewlett-Packard reported earnings of $2.95
billion, or $2.77 a diluted share, a decline of 6 percent compared
with $3.12 billion, or $2.95 a share, in 1997. Revenue increased 10
percent, to $47.06 billion from $42.90 billion.

TOUGH TALK REPLACES STATESMANSHIP AS LEADERS FACE DOWN CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ISRAEL-WESTBANK) 
 (nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Breaking free of the restrained, statesmanlike
demeanor that has recently characterized his public persona,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat this weekend threatened another
Palestinian uprising, complete with rifles, if the peace effort
stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in turn, demanded a
public disavowal of violent threats, saying he would freeze the
return of the next chunk of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   And, feeling particularly provoked, Israeli Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon went so far as to advise Jewish settlers in the West
Bank to grab every possible hill before the withdrawal of Israeli
troops begins.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the war of words these last few days, one could have
been led to believe that the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord was
in jeopardy. But even as the words were flying fast, the Israelis
and the Palestinians were moving closer than ever to carrying out
the land-for-security plan that they signed at the White House last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Parliament, which began a rowdy debate Monday, is
expected to approve the peace agreement on Tuesday by a significant
majority. An airport named after Arafat is expected to open this
week in Gaza, equipment permitting. And with bypass roads under
construction now, the first part of the West Bank is expected to be
turned over to the Palestinians by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as their subordinates, with the help of American
envoys, negotiated crucial technical details, both the Palestinian
and the Israeli leaders were playing to the home front with tough
talk. Arafat was facing down his critics by dusting off his
revolutionary words. And Sharon and Netanyahu, forced to respond,
were at the same time trying to convince the settlers that they
have not been abandoned by the right-wing leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are words meant to distract from the reality of the
moment,'' said Yossi Beilin, a Labor Party member of Parliament and
an architect of the peace effort. ``And the reality of the moment
lies in the maps.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at the Wye Plantation in Maryland, Arafat donned the
cloak of elder statesman, and he had remained calm in the face of
every Israeli delay and even what his aides aides saw as direct
provocations.
</P>
<P>
   When the Israelis packed their bags as if to stomp off from the
American-mediated peace talks, when they postponed carrying out the
accord, and even when they took the first steps last week toward
constructing a new Jewish neighborhood in southeastern Jerusalem,
Arafat soaked it all up, as if he were above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   But last weekend, at a rally in Nablus, a party meeting in
Ramallah and a Voice of Palestine radio broadcast, Arafat feinted
back to the hard line in the face of internal dissent.
</P>
<P>
   First, he told a cheering crowd of thousands in Nablus that he
still intended to establish a Palestinian state by May, when the
nearly five-year-old Oslo interim peace accord _ the framework for
the recent memorandum signed in Washington _ expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will declare our independent state on May 4, 1999, with
noble Jerusalem as its capital, whether they like it or not,''
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the radio and in Ramallah on Sunday, he said ``the path
of peace'' would be abandoned if the Israelis did not honor their
commitments. ``Our rifles are ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last weekend, Arafat's eye, it had seemed, was fixed on
the prize: the handover of 13 percent of the West Bank to
Palestinian civil control, and the transfer of 14 percent more from
Palestinian civil control to complete Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   So his words took the Israelis by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   They immediately responded with demands for an apology and
threats of reprisal. They said if statehood really was declared,
they would feel free to annex parts of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a Parliament of hecklers Monday, Netanyahu said that
if Arafat did not take back his words, the first pullback of
Israeli troops would be threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not intend to implement any withdrawal under such
conditions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday evening, Arafat summoned Israeli reporters to his
offices in Jericho and said he remained committed to a peaceful
resolution of the conflict. ``For us, peace is a strategic choice,
and we will not shift course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Bar-Illan, a spokesman for Netanyahu, said the Palestinian
leader's response was ``neither a retraction or a disavowal.'' He
said the decision on whether to turn over the land would be made on
Thursday by the Israeli Cabinet, which ratified the agreement last
week in an 8-to-4 vote, with 5 abstentions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like Arafat, the hawkish Sharon, who was appointed foreign
minister to placate the right, had been soft-spoken through the
negotiations. Meeting with a group of settlers on Sunday night,
however, after Arafat's speeches, Sharon sallied forth with his
most provocative comments since he assumed the post.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were broadcast on Israeli radio Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should take action, should run, should grab more
hills,'' said Sharon, a longtime advocate of the settlers who now
feel betrayed by him. ``We'll expand the area. Whatever is seized
will be ours. Whatever isn't seized will end up in their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, Netanyahu received an unexpected
present from the party that supposedly represents the settlers. The
National Religious Party voted late Sunday to stay in his coalition
for the moment, which helps protect him from being toppled.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the verbal sallies were launched, though, the Israelis
and the Palestinians were negotiating the nitty-gritty of the first
steps of carrying out the accord. The Israelis were showing maps to
the settlers. Bypass roads were being cut through Arab land. And
the American envoys, Dennis Ross and Aaron Miller, were helping
iron out the latest practical and diplomatic wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, there's a certain amount of kabuki theater
here,'' said Larry Schwartz, a spokesman for the American Embassy
in Tel Aviv. ``They're all doing their C-Span lecturing to an empty
theater so the public can know where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he said, ``a regrettable amount of
hostile rhetoric has seeped into the public conversation, and even
if the forward motion is there, it creates a nasty climate.''

AT SEASON'S CROSSROAD, JETS STILL ASKING FOR DIRECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Back in Indiana, they are talking about Peyton
Manning coming of age, while here in the Jets' locker room some
players wondered Monday just when the Jets will grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Just one loss, and now the Jets' psyche _ so healthy before
kickoff against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday _ is being probed
and dissected.
</P>
<P>
   The team, cornerback Aaron Glenn said, ``is at a crossroads.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Vinny Testaverde said Monday: ``I don't think we
came out with intensity. You could sense it during the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-examination is worthwhile. The Jets, who won four
consecutive games against teams with winning records, have now lost
three games to teams with miserable records to drop to 6-4 overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts (2-8), the latest upstarts to sidetrack the Jets,
scored with 24 seconds left in a 24-23 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells' hauled in his first-year players _
including safety Kevin Williams, who missed three tackles Sunday _
for a meeting Monday. Presumably, it was to complain about their
play.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to his gloomy Monday, Parcells mulled the Jets' next
opponents, the Tennessee Oilers, this Sunday in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps luckily for the Jets, who have showed no fear of the
better teams this season, the Oilers also have a winning record _
6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a young team,'' Testaverde suggested, ``you can be fooled
by your record and think you're better than you are. We're not a
great football team. We're a good football team and we can get to
the playoffs if we continue to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss to the Colts did not hurt the Jets as much as a victory
would have helped them. By winning, they would have been 5-0 in
division play. At 4-1, they still have the best division mark in
the American Football Conference East, as well as the best
conference record of 5-2. And the Jets are tied for second in the
East at 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a big difference between being 7-3 and 6-4,''
Testaverde said.
</P>
<P>
   That 7-3 record would look even more impressive because the 7-3
Dolphins, the 5-5 Patriots and the 6-4 Bills, go head to head over
the next few weeks. The Jets face those teams over the last three
games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he could not explain why the Jets made so many
mistakes against the Colts. Normally, a team should win if it can
produce any of the following: a return for a touchdown, a 100-yard
rusher or a pair of 100-yard receivers. The Jets did all of these
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six or seven plays could have ended the game on a positive
note for us,'' Parcells said, referring to blown tackles or dropped
passes. ``They have one chance to win it, and they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts' winning 80-yard drive included Marshall Faulk's
fourth-and-15 reception from the rookie quarterback Manning. Three
tacklers were supposed to have Faulk in their sights on the play,
but he managed to get past Corwin Brown, Williams and Ray Mickens.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Peyton connected for the pivotal touchdown on a
14-yard pass to Marcus Pollard, who was covered by Otis Smith. The
smaller defensive back _ Smith is 5 inches shorter and 65 pounds
lighter than Pollard _ was unable to stop the tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed up all night reliving the play,'' Smith said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Said linebacker Bryan Cox, who is becoming the monitor of the
club's mental health: ``We've got some guys on the team with
learning disabilities because we just don't get it.'' As usual, his
target was the ``younger guys,'' a vaguely defined group whom he
gets on weekly, whenever he is trying to spur players to pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Parcells is a master of this, yet he seemed baffled
by the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had been just a little bit sharper _ there was an
alertness, an awareness missing,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he had come in very early Monday to look at films
of the Oilers. Usually, he does not do that until he speaks to the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already looked at three Tennessee films on both sides of
the ball,'' he said at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Parcells' mood alternated from second-guessing plays to the
reality of the Jets' situation: ``If we can play well from here on,
that's what counts. But this was a missed opportunity because we
could have put at least three teams behind us, at least
temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   So, was this failure a sign of immaturity?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Parcells said. ``It was a sign that we got beat.''

EDITORIAL: THE INSPECTION AGENDA IN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 17:
</P>
<P>
   The days ahead must see the resumption of an aggressive program
of weapons inspections in Iraq. That is the only way to test Saddam
Hussein's latest pledge of full cooperation with United Nations
investigators responsible for uncovering and eliminating Baghdad's
chemical and biological weapons and missile delivery systems. There
can be no return to last spring's misguided American policy of
reining in the inspectors to head off objections from Iraq or its
allies. Inspections can be a more effective disarmament tool than
air strikes, but only if U.N. specialists can look wherever they
need to and get honest answers about what Iraq has done with its
mass-destruction weapons, many of which it acquired before the
Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmarks President Clinton set on Sunday make clear what
Iraq has to do. It must give the inspectors access to every
laboratory, factory, presidential palace, computer hard drive and
desert hiding place they need to see. It must hand over every
pertinent document the inspectors request. It must satisfactorily
answer all the inspectors' questions about what has become of
weapons ingredients. Iraq must also accept the inspectors'
independence from political control and fully abide by all Security
Council resolutions requiring the destruction of its terror weapons
and long-term monitoring of its weapons activities.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the drama surrounding the inspections has come from
Iraqi attempts to bar investigators from entering buildings where
crucial records or other evidence may be hidden. Surprise
inspections and vigilant monitoring of weapons plants remain
essential. An intensive effort must now be made to track any
equipment that may have been moved or modified while the inspectors
were kept at bay in recent months. Iraq's promises must also be
tested by early visits to buildings run by Iraq's Special Security
Organization and Special Republican Guards where Baghdad's weapons
concealment effort is believed to be centered.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger problem has been Iraq's withholding or
falsification of information about the biological and chemical
ingredients it has assembled over the years. Iraqi authorities must
be asked directly about some 2,000 gallons of deadly anthrax
bacteria and nearly 5,000 gallons of botulinum toxin that have
never been adequately accounted for. They need to explain what has
become of this material and back up their assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad has also failed to produce records for its production of
VX nerve gas for part of 1989 and all of 1990, a period in which it
is known to have been running production lines in preparation for
and after the invasion of Kuwait. Those records must now be handed
over. Iraq must also account for some 200 tons of missile
propellant it bought from the Soviet Union that can be used only to
power the kind of long-range missiles Baghdad is no longer allowed
to possess.
</P>
<P>
   If these answers and access are not provided, Washington will
have to turn anew to the option of military force. In the absence
of effective inspection, the only way to control Iraq's weapons
development is with a sustained campaign of bombing and missile
strikes. &QL;

A WEAK TOBACCO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Nov. 17: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The deal negotiated by eight state attorneys general and the
tobacco industry would do far too little to combat teen-age
smoking, the primary goal that any legal settlement should advance.
Instead, this proposal is mostly a financial agreement in which the
companies would pay off state lawsuits for Medicaid costs incurred
for smoking-related diseases. The states that were not at the
negotiating table have been given until Friday to accept the
settlement. That is an unreasonably short time for the public to
review a deal of this magnitude. At a minimum, there needs to be
opportunity for comment and input from health experts.
</P>
<P>
   For small states, a quick settlement may be hard to resist. But
for big states like New York and California, which are both
participants, giving up the right to sue _ a condition of the
settlement _ means handing over to the tobacco industry the big
legal cudgel it fears most. Many observers believe the industry
would not have agreed to any deal without the two big states'
participation.
</P>
<P>
   New York state's attorney general, Dennis Vacco, helped
negotiate the proposed settlement, which could reportedly bring the
state $25 billion over 25 years. The money is enticing, but the
deal, which has not been subject to any public debate, does not
look good enough for New York to abandon its lawsuit. Although
Vacco has the power to make this deal, the lawsuit cannot be
withdrawn until the court overseeing the case approves the
settlement. There is good reason for public health advocates to
argue before the court that the public should have some say in
whether New York goes forward with this deal.
</P>
<P>
   The odd political circumstances also militate against a rush to
settlement. Eliot Spitzer, who is locked in a tight election vote
count with Vacco and may yet win the New York State attorney
general's office, is one of those who opposes the settlement as too
lax on public health measures.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would pay the states roughly $206 billion over 25
years. Minnesota, Florida, Texas and Mississippi, which have
already settled their suits for a total of more than $40 billion,
would not be part of this deal. Apart from the money, the industry
would agree to some advertising restrictions, such as bans on
billboard ads and promotional gifts. The plan would set up a
foundation to reduce teen-age smoking and offer funding for a
smoking-cessation campaign. But these measures are fig leaves for a
plan that would have very little impact on tobacco use. Tobacco
companies would have no trouble shifting the nearly $6 billion a
year they spend on marketing to formats that are not prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The total settlement is expected to raise cigarette prices by 35
cents per pack over five years. Health economists argue that the
cost must increase by $1.50 to $2 a pack to have a significant
impact. The plan contains no industry penalties if teen-agers'
consumption continues to rise. New data show that youth smoking has
soared in the past decade, a reflection of tobacco marketing
efforts. The plan's elements are not ambitious enough to attack
this trend. Significantly, the public health community was not
allowed at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   If the states reject the deal, they can still seek individual
settlements. Indeed, Minnesota achieved a substantial settlement on
its own. It will receive $6.1 billion, along with a billboard and
promotional product ban, a ban on placing tobacco products in
movies shown nationwide, more lobbying disclosure and a decree
banning industry misrepresentation of health risks. Evidence from
the Minnesota trial, which forced the industry to settle, will be
useful in trials elsewhere. There is something to be said for a
uniform nationwide deal. But the health-related benefits must be
greater than what Vacco has bargained for.

SADDAM EXPECTED TO BREAK HIS PROMISE, TOUCHING OFF AIR STRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
 WRITETHRU-2ATKES-NYT 
(Changing dateline, fixing graf 4, general smoothing)  (htv) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE and STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States, its allies and past defenders of Iraq said
Monday that they did not expect President Saddam Hussein to
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors, and that if he broke his
promise it would set off a military response without a Security
Council debate.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton stayed his hand over the weekend, in
part because of his concern about losing international support for
an attack on Iraq, there was an unusually strong consensus Monday
that American and British bombing was almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   American and U.N. officials, along with diplomats from a variety
of countries, including some that have been sympathetic to Iraqi
arguments in the past, said the respite was temporary. The
situation is markedly different from past crises, the officials
said, with Saddam having no further room for maneuver in the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   As U.N. weapons inspectors prepared to return to work in Iraq,
most officials said they expected the real test of Saddam's
willingness to comply to come in the next two or three weeks. They
said that will occur as soon as the chief inspector, Richard
Butler, can assemble the experts he needs to conduct surprise
inspections at the sorts of sites from which Saddam has been
barring the U.N. specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're setting off into some pretty important territory,''
Butler said in an interview in New York. ``It is well understood by
all concerned that this is not ephemeral. This is real. This is
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   American and British forces are standing by, in new locations
within striking distance of Iraq, and could be sent to combat in
hours, rather than the days that it took for the most recent
buildup, American officials said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is watching Saddam Hussein to see if he follows the
words he uttered with deeds,'' Clinton said in brief remarks
Monday. ``Our forces remain strong and ready if he does not.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam could ``comply and give up his weapons of mass
destruction,'' a senior American official said Monday. But he
called that possibility ``highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more probable he will not comply and there will be a
confrontation,'' the official continued. ``But it will be under
circumstances of our choosing. There's no question in my mind that
when we act we will do so in such a way that it will be sustainable
internationally and domestically.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam averted an American attack over the weekend by promising
once again to cooperate fully with the United Nations Special
Commission, known as Unscom, and the International Atomic Energy
Agency, to let them inspect whatever sites they choose and to hand
over crucial documents on Iraq's secret biological and chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said the test period would not
be long. ``I think that we will see very quickly, in the next few
weeks or perhaps even longer, but nonetheless within a short period
of time, as to whether he is going to fully comply,'' Cohen said.
``I think everyone understands that this is the last go-around as
far as Saddam is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair said that next time there
would be ``no warnings, no wrangling, no negotiations, no
last-minute letters.'' In remarks to Parliament, Blair said, ``The
next withdrawal of cooperation and he will be hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he expected to restart the comprehensive monitoring
of Iraqi sites on Wednesday, with inspectors' taking air, water and
soil samples and repositioning and checking cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Challenge inspections, in which experts armed with clues demand
entry to new sites to check for prohibited arms, components or
documents, will follow as soon as Butler can assemble international
teams of specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he hoped to concentrate initially on missile
systems, where only a few issues remain to be settled, and on
chemical weapons. More is known about Iraq's chemical weapons
program than, for example, its biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   American and U.N. officials said Unscom, in particular, wants
two documents, one on chemical weapons development, found last
summer but seized by the Iraqis, and one on biological weapons,
which Unscom officials know about but have never seen.
</P>
<P>
   The International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna will also send
additional inspectors to Iraq, perhaps later this week. But
officials say that other than long-term monitoring, there is little
left for Iraq to do on the nuclear issue beyond passing a law.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative and the Security
Council's chairman of the Iraq sanctions committee, said Monday
that ``nobody really knows'' how much cooperation the inspectors
will not get.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test is on the ground,'' he said. ``We have the
experience of the past, and we have to be cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   American and British forces remain on standby around the Persian
Gulf and could attack Iraq with little preparation, a senior
American official said. While it took eight or nine days to prepare
for the strikes that were aborted on Saturday, the official said,
it would take less time now, and that would mostly be spent in
insuring that U.N. workers are evacuated from Iraq and key allies
like Israel are informed.
</P>
<P>
   The senior official was eager to defend Clinton's Saturday
morning decision to abort air strikes on Baghdad when it became
clear that Saddam appeared to be backing down from his refusal to
cooperate with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States had bombed on Saturday, the official said,
``we are the ones who would be isolated and the target of
criticism, not Saddam Hussein.'' The Arab world would be split,
Saddam would receive undeserved sympathy, the United States would
be ``accused of killing Unscom'' and the ``good word'' of the
United States would be tarnished, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It matters that the world believes in the word of the United
States,'' the official said. If Washington had attacked despite
indications that Saddam was about to do what was demanded of him,
``it would have called into question our own long-term
credibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The official insisted that Washington is pursuing ``a long-term
strategy'' and is better positioned than before. ``We've positioned
ourselves extremely well'' if Saddam reneges again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors of Unscom now have more support from the Security
Council than they've had in nearly two years, another senior
American official said. ``The whole world supports Unscom's right
to go wherever it wants in Iraq.'' That provides an extraordinary
window for inspectors to work, the official said, at least until
Saddam decides to close it.

UNDATED: close it. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A European diplomat at the United Nations echoed the point.
Unscom has more support in the Security Council, he said, while
Saddam has sapped much of the trust wavering nations seemed willing
to place in his promises in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unscom with military backing is now in a much stronger
position,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said that he intends to write to Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, Saddam's liaison on arms issues, telling him what
documentation and other material Unscom needs to begin answering
outstanding questions and closing files. Iraq cannot hope to see
sanctions lifted until it has been declared free of all prohibited
weapons and the means to make them.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who took over as chairman of the Special Commission in
August 1997, has faced mounting problems with Iraq as his
inspectors close in on some final _ and deceivingly small _ pieces
of a large jigsaw puzzle, such as documents that would give away
how big prohibited Iraqi programs once were, which would help
determine how much of the cache has been found and destroyed.
Unscom had also been narrowing physical searches to sites closer to
Saddam and his Special Republican Guard, whose duties include
protecting secret weapons and their facilities.
</P>
<P>
   These factors seem to be making the Iraqis especially resistant
to cooperation. Butler said that in trying to get to the bottom of
files he has listed for Iraq's attention, he has been dealt with
``in a deceitful way'' by the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are facts,'' Butler said. ``One, the materials involved
exist, either in hard form or in documentary form. Two, they are in
the possession of the government of Iraq. Three, they can chose, if
they wish, to give them to us. This is the core of what we will now
be dealing with. They are small in number but large in
significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cirincione, an arms-control expert at the Carnegie
Endowment, said that ``the first priority is getting from Iraq a
complete record of what they had. That will be the first test of
whether Iraq is going to cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the past, Cirincione said of the Iraqis, ``they have
repeatedly lied. They've lied on top of lies. They've lied inside
other lies. So the inspectors' job has been incredibly complicated:
trying to search for toxins in a haystack.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said Monday that in missile development, there is still
accounting to be done on some missing warheads and that more
information is needed on Iraq's indigenous production facilities.
There are also outstanding questions about why Iraq needs missile
propellants specifically designed for longer-range, and therefore
prohibited, Scud missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In the chemical weapons area, Butler said he wants crucial
information on past stocks of munitions and on certain equipment.
He also needs to learn more about Iraqi use of the nerve gas VX, a
colorless, odorless agent that can kill within hours.
</P>
<P>
   On biological weapons, the inspectors are very far from
completion, with large quantities of weapons agents unaccounted
for.
</P>
<P>
   The countries on the Security Council who have supported Iraq in
the past will have little room to maneuver in coming weeks as
Butler and the IAEA decide whether Iraq is cooperating sufficiently
to trigger the comprehensive review of Baghdad's relations with the
United Nations that Saddam wants, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During the inspections, Iraq is expected to fall back on tactics
like prohibiting work in areas considered of importance to the
country's ``sovereignty and dignity.'' Supporters of Iraq, led by
the Russians and Chinese, have already raised flags about the
behavior of Unscom inspectors, and Iraq has accused them of being
cowboys who want to invade the privacy of homes and palaces.
</P>
<P>
   Danilo Turk, Slovenia's representative and an expert in
international law who now sits on the Security Council, said in an
interview Monday that it is very difficult to see how sovereignty
can be invoked when handing over a document is the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro, who took part in diplomatic inspections of the
so-called presidential properties in Baghdad in April, added that
he also does not see any impediment to Unscom's returning to those
sites for follow-up inspections without a diplomatic escort.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Giants Coach Jim Fassel said Monday that
he had not decided whether to bench the starting quarterback Danny
Kanell, but people in the organization indicated he was leaning
toward replacing Kanell with Kent Graham against the Philadelphia
Eagles this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel called his team's performance Sunday against the Green
Bay Packers pitiful and said he was considering changes at several
positions. He also said such changes would be made ``with an eye on
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   While that might not explain why he would remove the struggling
Kanell, who will turn 25 on Saturday, for Graham, who is 30, there
appears to be a consensus among the offensive coaches that Kanell
has become so harried in the pocket that his skills are regressing.
Kanell's long-term development, at least in theory, could be
advanced by the chance to get out of the line of fire for a week or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel and his coaches were particularly distressed by Kanell's
hurried, and ultimately poor, decision-making that led to two
interceptions Sunday, and caused Kanell to squander a good chance
for a touchdown pass early in the Packers' 37-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   On the first interception, which came after a missed Green Bay
field goal in what was still a 7-0 game, Kanell overlooked a
wide-open Gary Brown to throw into coverage and was intercepted by
the Packers' Leroy Butler. Kanell made a similar mistake on what
became Butler's second interception in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, on a third down at the Green Bay 7,
Kanell ignored wide receiver Amani Toomer, who was open in the end
zone, and instead threw into double coverage toward Ike Hilliard.
The pass was incomplete, and the Giants settled for their only
score of the game, a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make any statements about who's starting,''
Fassel said. ``Danny did not play as well as I hoped he would.
Right now, he's not functioning, but he's not getting a lot of help
around him either.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel believes Kanell's pass protection has been woefully
inadequate, and when Fassel replaced Kanell with Graham in the
third quarter of Sunday's game, he also benched right tackle Scott
Gragg and left guard Greg Bishop. But Fassel seems to be wondering
if Kanell has lost some confidence, and the people familiar with
his thinking, who insisted on anonymity, say that may prompt the
coach to go with Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, in some aspects, he's trying to survive,'' Fassel
said of Kanell. ``There were some times in that game that he had
time to make a play, but he has come off real quick. Whether it was
a lack of confidence, I don't know, but he made some mistakes. I'm
going to sit down and have a long talk with him and see where he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel planned that meeting for Monday afternoon. He said he
would make his decision on whom to start at quarterback against the
Eagles Monday night. Since the players are off Tuesday, that
decision will probably be announced Wednesday when the team resumes
practice; the play repetitions in practice for the starting
quarterback are usually five times those taken by the backup.
</P>
<P>
   The third-string quarterback Mike Cherry isn't a likely option
to see time yet. He has yet to attempt a pass in two NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Graham started three games as a rookie in relief of the Giants'
Jeff Hostetler in 1992, and one game in 1994 as Dave Brown's
replacement. He started eight games with the Arizona Cardinals in
1996 when Fassel was the team's offensive coordinator and six more
games with the Cardinals in 1997 after Fassel left.
</P>
<P>
   Signed as a free agent by the Giants last winter, Graham said
Monday that he was preparing to start Sunday even though he didn't
know which way Fassel would go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not lobbying for the job,'' said Graham, whose record as a
starter is 5-13. ``But I want the opportunity. I want to play. Then
you see what happens. I want the shot to prove I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if starting Graham might provide a spark for the team,
Fassel said: ``It could. I'm not ruling that out at all. But there
are a lot of considerations in doing that. I'll evaluate that and
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell was not available for comment Monday. He was not in the
locker room before the players gathered for their private team
meetings inside Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that Fassel may decide that Kanell's confidence
could be boosted by playing against a struggling team he may have
success against like the 2-8 Eagles. If Kanell failed again, then
Fassel could always replace him with Graham.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fassel, however, clearly hasn't given up on Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   ``For young quarterbacks to progress, those guys need a
supporting cast,'' Fassel said. ``Don't forget that last year, in
his first year starting in the NFL, he may not have put up dramatic
numbers, but we won. His supporting cast was playing a lot better
than they are right now. He was getting a lot more help, and I
protected him to a degree better.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond quarterback, there are positions where auditions are
likely to begin Sunday, though it's possible Fassel may put these
players into the game as it progresses rather than alter the
current starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   At left guard, since Greg Bishop has been a disappointment most
of the season and will be a free agent after the season, the Giants
will probably turn to Lonnie Palelei in an attempt to determine
Palelei's value for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Palelei, 28, who started 14 games for the Jets last season,
played Sunday in relief of Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   At center, Derek Engler, a second-year player and former
starter, may see his role increased at the expense of the starter,
Lance Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the rookie safety Shaun Williams, who regained his post as
the team's nickel defensive back Sunday, could play at strongside
safety in place of Percy Ellsworth, who is out of position there.
Ellsworth could then replace or split time at free safety with Tito
Wooten.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The Giants said linebacker Jessie Armstead reinjured the right
ankle sprain that plagued him earlier this season. But Coach Jim
Fassel didn't think Armstead would be seriously inhibited against
the Eagles Sunday. The report was similar on linebacker Corey
Widmer, who sustained a concussion against the Packers.

STARR APPEARANCE SETS OFF MANEUVERING BY BOTH SIDES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Mo.)  (mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Kenneth Starr set to lay out his case against
President Clinton for the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday,
the White House was told Monday that it will have 30 minutes to
cross-examine the independent counsel and Democrats signaled that
they intend to focus as much on the prosecutor as on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of publicly released letters and statements, the
committee's Republicans and Democrats maneuvered furiously for
advantage before the high-stakes appearance of the independent
counsel. Starr, who advised Congress that there is ``substantial
and credible evidence'' of 11 impeachable offenses by the
president, could well turn out to be the lone witness to testify
before the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are hoping that Starr, an experienced litigator,
will present a forceful case against Clinton and refocus the public
on the questions of whether Clinton lied under oath and obstructed
justice in his efforts to hide his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky. They also want to give Starr a chance to rehabilitate his
image after months in which his role as a prosecutor has left him
unable to make public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats are seeking to make Starr's own tactics an
issue. In a letter Monday to Starr, Rep. John Conyers Jr. of
Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the committee, demanded reams of
phone records, messages, letters, notes, evidentiary materials and
FBI reports that could help Democrats question whether the
prosecutor himself broke rules as he investigated the president.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers also called for four senior deputies to Starr to appear
along with him for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' request came as law enforcement officials with
the Justice Department said that aides to Attorney General Janet
Reno had, for the first time, asked Starr to turn over information
about whether his office improperly put pressure on Ms. Lewinsky
into cooperating at the outset of his inquiry last January.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Monday, the Justice Department said it had
already reviewed and dismissed a number of accusations raised by
Clinton's lawyers and others against Starr. The statement did not
specify those accusations deemed not warranting ``further
inquiry.'' Law enforcement officials said that a review found no
evidence that Starr had acted unethically or withheld pertinent
information about the timing of his initial contacts with witnesses
like Linda Tripp when he asked the Justice Department to expand his
inquiry to include the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Those circumstances surrounding Starr's application to broaden
his inquiry and his relationship with Mrs. Tripp are among the
pieces of information sought by the Democrats. They are also
seeking documents about the Independent Counsel Office's
relationship with a circle of conservative lawyers and lawyers for
Paula Corbin Jones and any notes or interviews with former Arkansas
state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly III, a spokesman for Starr, called charges
against Starr groundless and accused the Democrats of trying to
turn attention away from the president. ``We believe we have been
the victims of a series of allegations intended to challenge
prosecutorial authority,'' he said, ``and shift the focus from the
facts and evidence that we gathered during the investigation to the
practices of the prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats made their requests public just hours after Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the committee chairman, told Starr that he
would be willing to accept such information in closed session
provided that it would not damage continuing investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also alerted the White House that a lawyer for Clinton
would be given a half-hour to question Starr after his two-hour
presentation. Republican and Democratic investigative counsels will
also be granted a half-hour each and the committee's 37 members
will each get five minutes to ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Hyde, Starr agreed to provide certain materials
sought by the Democrats. But he said he would hold back two
documents concerning his request to Reno to expand his
investigation because they ``may interfere with an unrelated
ongoing criminal investigation'' by the Justice Department. He did
not elaborate. He also declined to turn over FBI notes of
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Hyde, in a response to the Democrats, said the
impeachment inquiry was not an appropriate forum to investigate
Starr's actions, and said Reno had the authority to dismiss Starr
but had not done so. And he signaled that he would not press for
Starr's deputies to appear on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of suspended animation, the Judiciary Committee is
now pushing toward a vote next month on whether to recommend
articles of impeachment against Clinton. If the committee votes for
impeachment, the full House is expected to take up the issue before
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Although many lawmakers now believe there may not be the votes
in the House for impeachment, even Democrats are not ruling out
some punishment of the president. ``What the president did was very
wrong and reprehensible,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said Monday
after he was re-elected House minority leader. ``I believe that
some action should and will be taken. I'm not ready to conclude
what I think should be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House is expected to respond on Tuesday to the offer
of 30 minutes to question Starr. And for the first time, the public
on Tuesday will hear the voice of Ms. Lewinsky as the committee
releases Mrs. Tripp's secretly recorded tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are likely to try to question Starr about other
investigations into the actions of his office. Those outstanding
inquiries include:
</P>
<P>
   _ An inquiry into charges that Starr's deputies improperly
disclosed federal grand jury information to news organizations. The
investigation is being conducted by John Kern III, a senior
District of Columbia judge.
</P>
<P>
   _ An examination of whether David Hale, an important Whitewater
witness, received payments from political adversaries of Clinton.

`MONICA'S STORY' TO BE TOLD ON TV AND IN BOOK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd and 3rd grafs for inserts and re-editing)  (htv) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL and LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of angling for a lucrative book deal and a
television forum, Monica Lewinsky has finally signed agreements for
an interview with Barbara Walters of ABC News and for the
publication of a book from St. Martin's Press tentatively titled,
``Monica's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer said Monday that on Friday, she settled on
both British and an American publishers to tell her side of the
scandal that followed her affair with President Clinton, but at a
price that was more modest than the millions once predicted _ a
$600,000 advance plus bonuses for bestseller rankings. The book,
which will be published in February, will be written by Andrew
Morton, the author of a best-selling book about Diana, Princess of
Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's interview with Ms. Walters, for the program
``20/20,'' will most likely be broadcast in February. Ms. Walters
will not be paid for it, Ms. Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said she had met with Ms. Lewinsky twice, both times
within the last couple of weeks. Their agreement, which Ms.
Lewinsky signed Friday, gives Ms. Walters exclusive rights to the
first television interview, and prohibits ABC from selling that
interview outside North America, so that Ms. Lewinsky's
representatives can negotiate other interviews for her in other
countries and grant exclusivity in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Richard Hofstetter, said that ``Monica
received offers of more than $5 million and turned them down.'' He
would not identify the companies that had made such offers, but
there were reports that Ms. Lewinsky's representative had gone far
in negotiations with the tabloid show, ``Hard Copy,'' the day-time
talk show host, Oprah Winfrey and News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives said that she had asked for $2 million, but they
were willing to pay less than half that.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said that Lewinsky will reveal a side of herself
that has not been apparent from the reams of grand jury testimony
that has was released by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not silly. She is well-spoken. She is intelligent,''
Ms. Walters said, adding, ``There's a lot not in the record _ what
this year has been like for her, what it felt like when the
president made his statements, her reaction, her views on the
various people involved, the jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear if there are any restrictions on Ms. Lewinsky
that would limit her from speaking out. In an immunity deal she
signed with prosecutors last summer, Ms. Lewinsky agreed that she
would not speak to any news organizations without the consent of
the independent counsel while the inquiry into President Clinton's
actions was proceeding. Recently Ms. Lewinsky, who has faced
mounting legal bills, had renewed her request to the independent
counsel's office for permission to grant interviews. Charles G.
Bakaly III, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, declined to
comment Monday on whether Ms. Lewinsky would be allowed to speak
now or under what conditions.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press, which has paid more for books like ``The
Arthritis Cure,'' reached an agreement with Ms. Lewinsky after a
week-long flurry of negotiations for the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general theme will be how a young woman comes to
Washington, has a relationship with the president and then what she
went through from there, said John Sargent, the chief executive of
St. Martin's Press, who described Ms. Lewinsky as a ``pawn in
Washington power games.''
</P>
<P>
   The project grew out of a torturous and often public search for
a publisher that would pay handsomely for Ms. Lewinsky's story and
ended with a deal at St. Martin's Press. The deal was struck
despite Sargent's public comments ten months earlier that he didn't
think her tale merited a book. ``Do you want to read a whole book
by Monica?'' he asked in February.
</P>
<P>
   At various times, Ms. Lewinsky's asking price for a book varied
from $2 million to $10 million depending on which trial balloon
surfaced in various publications. Judith Regan, the maverick
publisher of Regan Books, had estimated that the title could
command an advance up to $5 million and until recently she was
negotiating a deal that would have included books and television
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the top publishing houses that could afford a
generous advance remained reluctant to sign a book because of fears
that she had nothing left to reveal, particularly after the
publication of the report by the office of the independent counsel
and the events that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The book deal finally came together through the efforts of a
British publisher, Michael O'Mara Books, which sold St. Martin's
Press the rights to publish the book in the United States while
retaining the rights to publish the title in the rest of the world.
The company publishes the books of Morton, whose book about Diana
candidly described her unraveling royal life.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Mara, the publisher, said that initially he was not
interested in publishing a book about Ms. Lewinsky. The idea was
first broached to him by a British television program, which was
seeking to package a television interview along with a book to be
written by a ghost writer that he characterized as a ``nobody.''
After he declined to participate, O'Mara said that Ms. Lewinsky's
attorney, Hofstetter, called him about a week ago to ask him about
the rejection and then the conversation shifted to other potential
authors, such as Morton, who, as it turns out, was interested.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, Morton and O'Mara met Ms. Lewinsky at the
officers of her lawyer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one terrific discussion and we discussed that Monica
Lewinsky as a human being is actually completely a different
person: lively, intelligent, very well-spoken, a typical American
girl. They clicked, very loudly, and they were making progress on
the book before he signed,'' O'Mara said.
</P>
<P>
   Several publishing executives with knowledge of the negotiations
said that O'Mara had approached other publishers to gauge their
interest. Her advance for North American rights, the primary market
for a book by Monica Lewinsky, amounted to more than $600,000
against royalties, a sum that could climb to a million if the books
earns bonuses for making bestseller lists.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Martin's Press, the publisher will be rushing to produce
the book as fast as it can, according to Sargent, who said the book
will essentially be Morton's view of what happened to Ms. Lewinsky.
Morton will be the sole author.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters made it clear that Ms. Lewinsky is not getting any
form of compensation for her appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No money, no other deals,'' said Ms. Walters. ``No Disney
movie, no show on Lifetime, and not for putting out any videos. We
were very meticulous because we knew we'd be scrutinized and we
read all the rumors'' about potential under-the-table compensation
for Ms. Lewinsky, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said it was her belief that Ms. Lewinsky had spurned
``enormous amounts of money'' from Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is giving her credit for doing this interview out of
desire to maintain her credibility and for turning down millions,
millions from Fox,'' she said.

U.S. FORCES SET TO STRIKE IRAQ IN HOURS IF CALLED ON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All of the weaponry that the United States was
prepared to let loose against Iraq on Saturday remains in the
Persian Gulf and could be used to strike again within hours of
receiving notice, senior administration and Pentagon officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pentagon announced on Sunday that it would suspend
the deployment of dozens of additional warplanes and ground troops,
the attack that President Clinton called off 15 minutes before it
was to begin relied entirely on forces already in the region, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The planned attack, they said, would have involved a first
strike of nearly 300 cruise missiles fired from eight warships in
the gulf, followed by bombing raids by dozens of F-14 and F-18
fighters aboard the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, the
officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said the proposed strike was ``still a valid operational plan,''
and for that reason he declined to discuss the matter further
except to say that the United States was prepared to strike almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw this time how fast our response came,'' Shelton said in
a telephone interview, referring to President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq. ``The next time it could come faster.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon as elsewhere in official Washington, there was
deep frustration that the United States had once again geared up
for a military strike only to see Saddam reverse course and pledge
anew to abide by U.N. resolutions. And there was almost universal
agreement that Hussein would provoke a confrontation again.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen warned Saddam Monday that this
latest confrontation was ``the last go-around.'' He strongly
suggested that the United States would react swiftly and without
warning if Iraq once again ended cooperation with international
arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has had more than sufficient warning,'' Cohen said
at a ceremony swearing in the new Navy secretary, Richard Danzig.
``I don't believe that any additional warning is required.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States still has nearly 200 aircraft in the Persian
Gulf and 23 Navy vessels, 14 of them combat warships, as well as
more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.
</P>
<P>
   A second aircraft carrier, the Enterprise, is scheduled to
arrive in the gulf in a week, replacing the Eisenhower, though for
a time both will be there.
</P>
<P>
   After the last confrontation with Iraq in February, the United
States sharply reduced its forces in the region but, significantly,
doubled the number of Tomahawk cruise missiles kept aboard Navy
cruisers, destroyers and attack submarines plying the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Those missiles and the carrier's strike fighters allowed the
administration to prepare an attack with less buildup than those
for previous strikes. And the officials said they could rely on
those missiles and fighters again.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 139 additional aircraft that Clinton sent to the region
on Wednesday, only 23 completed the trip, including four B-1
bombers and seven B-52s.
</P>
<P>
   Another 53 planes, including three squadrons of fighter jets,
went as far as bases in Spain, Italy and Germany before the attack
was called off. The rest never left the United States, though they
remain on standby. The nearly 4,000 additional Army troops who were
to have gone will also remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   None of the aircraft being sent to the Gulf were involved in the
strike that was aborted on Saturday morning _ not even the B-52s.
They left air bases in Louisiana and England on Friday night and
were flying at the time toward Diego Garcia, the British island in
the Indian Ocean, where they remain.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Pentagon's attack plan, the B-52s and the other planes
headed to the region would have taken part in follow-up strikes
that were to have lasted a number of days, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he would recommend recalling the forces extra that
had been sent. ``They will be at the ready and can be called back
at a moment's notice,'' he said.

THE METS RETURN PHILLIPS TO GENERAL MANAGER'S JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A week after the Mets surprised the baseball world by
announcing that General Manager Steve Phillips was taking a leave
of absence to deal with problems caused by a series of extramarital
affairs, the team came up with another surprise Monday: Phillips is
back on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the 35-year-old Phillips was announced at a press
conference at Shea Stadium that was not attended by the team's
owners, Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday, who instead issued a
statement in which they said they remained ``steadfast in our
belief'' that Phillips was the right person to run the Mets'
baseball operations and that the best thing for the Phillips family
and the Mets was for ``Steve to get back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips himself spoke forthrightly about the problems he had
created for his family and said that getting everything back in
order in his personal life was ``going to be a lengthy process.''
</P>
<P>
   But the press conference ultimately took on a bizarre tone when
a lawyer, Dominic Barbara, stood up, disrupted the proceeding and
let it be known that he represented a former Mets employee who
intended to sue Phillips for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, the stated threat of a suit didn't come as a surprise
because an allegation of sexual harassment had been cited by the
Mets when Phillips took his leave of absence a week ago. At the
time, the team said it had investigated the allegation and found
that it stemmed from a consensual affair between Phillips and a
former employee at their Port St. Lucie complex in Florida and that
there was no basis for the harassment charge.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the Mets' position, the issue hasn't gone away.
That became clear Monday when Barbara, a Long Island-based attorney
whose clients have included Joey Buttafuoco and Jessica Hahn, got
to his feet, pointed to a folded piece of paper in his breast
pocket and said he had a statement he had been prepared to read.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, having listened to Phillips talk openly of the
damage he had done to his own family life, he said he believed
Phillips was truly contrite and that he would therefore not read
the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will vigorously fight for my client,'' Barbara said. ``But I
believe Phillips is very sincere in what he's saying. That said, I
will litigate like I always do.''
</P>
<P>
   Polite as always, Phillips actually thanked Barbara as the
attorney walked out of the room with a contingent that included two
Miami-based lawyers _ Stephen Malove and Michael Kaufman _ who are
believed to be involved in representing the Florida woman at the
source of the original sexual harassment allegations.
</P>
<P>
   As Barbara departed, half of the reporters present got to their
feet and chased him to the elevator. The other half remained to
listen to Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   And no one was talking about trades or free agents. Those who
pursued Barbara were unable to get him to acknowledge the identity
of his client, or whether he represented more than one person in
his threatened action against the Mets. When asked when he intended
to file a suit, he said, ``Probably by Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who stuck around to listen to Phillips and David Howard, a
Mets vice president and the team's chief legal counsel, heard
Howard state he had been aware along that Barbara planned to attend
the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to stand at the door and bar him from
entering,'' said Howard. ``I knew he was going to be here. I didn't
know he was going to make a comment.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went on a day when other major league teams were
presumably busy trying to improve their rosters.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by Wilpon and Doubleday ran three paragraphs. ``We
have expressed our strong opinion about the inappropriateness of
his conduct, both publicly and privately to Steve,'' the statement
said. ``Right now the best thing for the Phillips family and the
New York Mets is for Steve to get back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, the owners said the leave of absence had come
about primarily to allow Phillips to get his personal life back in
order and that discussions with Phillips and his wife and family
counselors had led them to conclude he should return to his job.
</P>
<P>
   In his own statements Monday, Phillips addressed the question of
why he had chosen to disclose a whole series of extramarital
affairs when the leave of absence was first announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than make up a story of where I was, I thought it was
important to tell the truth,'' Phillips said. ``I needed to make my
family situation a priority and be home to deal with the problems I
caused.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And in those last two weeks, we've started the process. I'm
not back up here with my collar buttoned down and my tie in place
saying that everything is back in order. This is going to be a
lengthy process. And I don't know what the ultimate result will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said his comments about his personal life would be the
last ones he would make and that he would be available again,
beginning Tuesday, to talk about baseball subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, the Mets made one significant move _ acquiring
former Met Bobby Bonilla from the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange
for Mets reliever Mel Rojas, a deal Phillips had worked on before
the leave of absence was announced. In fact, the Mets had scheduled
a press conference Monday to reintroduce Bonilla to New York but
had to cancel it to make room for the Phillips announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he did not think his weeklong absence would have
any adverse affect on his dealings with other general managers and
with player agents. However, it's possible that the distraction
created by Phillips' problems may have enabled the Colorado Rockies
to lure away a valuable Mets bench player _Lenny Harris.
</P>
<P>
   And it also may have kept the Mets from making a contract offer
Monday to B.J. Surhoff, whom the Mets appear to be interested in
making their starting left-fielder.

ADVERTISING: PRESCRIPTION-DRUG SALES SOAR WITH HELP OF ADS 
</HEADLINE>

being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(lb) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly souping up their
advertising for prescription drugs in a style more commonly
associated with products sold from open shelves in drugstores and
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the blow-ups of Joan Lunden, a former host of ABC's
``Good Morning America,'' elbowing aside other drugstore displays
in a promotion for Claritin, an allergy treatment. Ms. Lunden is
also featured in television commercials for the drug _ the first TV
celebrity endorsement of a prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough Corp., which makes Claritin, has even handed out
leaflets inviting customers to try Claritin and enter a contest to
win a vacation in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co. has also joined the promotional fray, offering a
money-back guarantee in full-page newspaper ads to customers who
are not satisfied with Zocor, a cholesterol-lowering drug, after
six months. Pharmaceutical analysts said the offer was yet another
first for prescription-drug advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on consumer advertising has exploded since the Food and
Drug Administration in August 1997 loosened longstanding restraints
on television commercials for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advertising for prescription drugs rose to $100 million
a month this year, almost five times the total only three years
ago, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a marketing research
firm. The ads have paid off for a number of drugs, particularly
allergy treatments, whose sales have surged.
</P>
<P>
   But the demand generated by consumer advertising has raised
questions about how such ads are changing the practice of medicine.
Some physicians contend that the ads artificially stoke demand for
the most expensive treatments and waste time for both patients and
doctors. And insurers complain that the demand is inflating their
pharmaceutical budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three patients in 10 who had taken any prescription drug
said they had talked with their doctors about a drug they saw
advertised, according to a survey of 2,015 people in June by Louis
Harris &AMP; Associates for the Harvard School of Public Health,
Andersen Consulting and London &AMP; Associates. But only 40 percent
said the doctor had prescribed the drug they had discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harvard study means half the effort caused by the
advertising is probably wasting the doctor's time and wasting
expense within the HMO, which drives up the cost for everybody,''
said Stephen Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical
management and economics at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful ads have been for treatments for allergies,
stomach problems, and impotence _ conditions that are apparent to
the sufferers, unlike, say, high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, sales of three allergy treatments _ Claritin, Hoechst
Marion Roussel Inc.'s Allegra and Pfizer Inc.'s Zyrtec _ have risen
sharply this year, according to IMS Health, a health-care
information company.
</P>
<P>
   Claritin was the No. 1 prescription-drug advertiser in the first
half of the year. Its sales rose 32 percent, to $912.5 million, for
the six months from the similar period a year ago, said Neil Sweig,
a Wall Street analyst at Southeast Research Partners. Allegra sales
doubled to $186 million in the first half of 1998, while Zyrtec
sales rose 56 percent, to $178 million.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, spending on consumer advertising for the
three products jumped 15 percent, to $132 million from the first
half of 1997, before the FDA lowered some barriers on commercials,
according to Competitive Media Reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Strong sales gains were also shown by Zyban, Glaxo Wellcome
PLC's new smoking-cessation treatment; Prilosec, Astra
Pharmaceuticals LP's treatment for stomach problems; and Paxil,
SmithKline Beecham PLC's anti-depressant, also showed strong sales
gains.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug commercials are following temporary guidelines
issued by the FDA in August 1997. The guidelines allow drug makers
to name their products and discuss their effectiveness without
including a full list of possible side effects. Only doctors can
prescribe the products, and the agency requires advertisers to tell
consumers that they can get more information by consulting a
physician, a print ad or a Web site, or by calling a toll-free
number.
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturers say their advertisements are educating
consumers and empowering them to discuss useful treatments with
their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, market-research surveys affirm the effectiveness of drug
ads in alerting prospective customers. But no one has measured
precisely how many people visited a doctor solely to ask about an
advertised condition, compared with those who broached the subject
during a visit scheduled for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some health-care economists contend that the advertising
is fueling a renewed upswing in drug costs, which rose 12 percent
to 15 percent this year and are projected to be even higher in
1999, according to Watson Wyatt, a management consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, drug costs have also been pushed higher by the
introduction of dozens of effective new drugs and the growing
reluctance of embattled HMOs to anger members by denying their
requests.
</P>
<P>
   But ads ``are essentially encouraging the more expensive drugs
within a category,'' said Dr. Thomas Simmer, medical director of
the Health Alliance Plan of the Henry Ford Health System in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Patient visits to doctors increased 2 percent between January
and September but visits for allergies rose five times as fast,
said Scott-Levin, a drug marketing research firm. Looked at another
way, the number who got in touch with a doctor after seeing an
antihistamine ad increased to 9 percent in 1998, from 7 percent in
1997 and 5 percent in 1996, when Claritin began its consumer
advertising, said Market Measures Inc., another drug market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   In seven heavily advertised groups, there were 3.2 million, or
22 percent, more new patients in the first half of 1998 than in the
first half of '97, according to IMS Health. The areas were
cholesterol problems (Pravachol), smoking cessation (Zyban),
osteoporosis (Evista), hair loss (Propecia), ulcers (Prilosec),
postmenopausal problems (Premarin) and depression (Prozac).
</P>
<P>
   There was a cost for a doctor's time, and at least half the
consultations motivated by drug ads did not result in a
prescription for the drug. A recent study by Princeton Survey
Research Associates for Prevention magazine said 54 million people
had spoken to their doctors about a medicine they had seen
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Fee-for-service physicians often charge more than $100 for a
routine visit. Employers and employees often divide that cost. A
visit to a managed-care doctor costs less _ about $60, on average,
said Gary Lin, an actuary with Watson Wyatt, ranging from $40 in a
health-maintenance organization in Minneapolis to $70 in some New
York health plans.
</P>
<P>
   And insurers say that growing demand for heavily advertised
drugs is inflating health-plan pharmaceutical budgets. ``Except for
antibiotics, we are spending more money on runny noses than
anything else,'' said Mark DiGiorgio, a spokesman for Cigna
Healthcare, a big health-maintenance organization. It spends 10
percent of its $250 million pharmacy budget for allergy and sinus
drugs, a Wall Street analyst estimated.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some employers and health plans plan to buck the trend by paying
for only 60 percent of the price of expensive, advertised drugs in
some cases, if other equally effective, less costly drugs are
available, said Helen Darling, a health-care expert with Watson
Wyatt. Health plans typically pay all but a nominal amount for
drugs on their approved lists.
</P>
<P>
   A daily dose of Claritin, Allegra or Zyrtec can cost $2 or more,
while Tavist, an over-the-counter allergy treatment costs about 96
cents a day, pharmacists said. (Tavist, made by Novartis, is more
likely to cause drowsiness.)
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for drug makers and advertisers say that many
medicines, however costly, reduce costs by keeping patients out of
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all eager to attempt to address the major problems _
underdiagnosis and undertreatment of disease,'' said Alan Holmer,
president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
Association, a trade group. ``All the consumer ads are doing is to
empower the patients so they can have a more informed conversation
with their doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   And such conversations can have unexpected benefits. The study
by Prevention also showed that one in 20 patients who spoke to a
doctor about an advertised medicine were found to have a different
problem that might otherwise have gone untreated.
</P>
<P>
   If advertising ``leads to a discussion, that's fine,'' said Dr.
Phil Manning, an associate vice president of health affairs at the
University of Southern California. But he is concerned that
insistent demands by patients ``open the door to injudicious use of
certain drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, almost three in 10 respondents in a recent market survey
for Time Inc. said they would consider switching doctors if they
did not get a prescription they requested.
</P>
<P>
   Health-plan officials said that some drug companies were
brandishing the statistic in an unsubtle sales pitch. But Caryn
Klein, associate director of research at Time, said she was not
satisfied with the finding, because respondents were not asked
about specific drugs and maladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patient is not an educated consumer,'' said Dr. Brian
Strom, chairman of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University
of Pennsylvania. ``The patient is really an unwitting tool of the
manufacturer's marketing department.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ostrove, chief of marketing practices at the FDA, said the
agency was evaluating consumer ads to see whether they were
undermining physician-patient relationships, promoting
``inappropriate prescribing'' or otherwise affecting public health.
She said the increased costs, if any, generated by the ads were not
within the FDA's purview.
</P>
<P>
   The lowering of barriers to medical marketing _ once confined
largely to professional journals and visits to physicians by
salespeople _ has not been limited to TV.
</P>
<P>
   For their blockbuster products, drug makers have Web sites where
prospective customers are offered referrals to doctors, information
about medical problems and personalized newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   And as drug makers pursue new marketing opportunities, they are
also continuing their longstanding tactic of dispatching thousands
of salespeople to visit doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts expect the FDA to revise the guidelines within
a few months. But unless the rules are drastically tightened,
aggressive campaigns to reach consumers are expected to continue,
even though many physicians object.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmaceuticals are not toothpaste or types of cereal,'' Strom
said. ``If a patient isn't bothered by a problem, why create demand
by driving them to the physician? We spend too much on health care.
The focus nationally is on trying to reduce health costs.''

 EDITORIAL: CATCHING UP WITH SUVs  
 (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Nov. 17: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all passenger vehicles are created equal, especially when it
comes to the amount of pollution that flows from their tailpipes.
Minivans, sport utility vehicles and light-duty pickup trucks _ all
now wildly popular with Americans _ throw off higher levels of
nitrogen oxides and other smog-causing gases than cars do. This
happens because they are not subject to the same emissions
standards that ordinary cars are. California wisely did away with
this inequality on Nov. 5, issuing new, more stringent emission
limits that will also apply to minivans, SUVs and light-duty trucks
of up to 8,500 pounds, starting with the 2004 model year.
</P>
<P>
   California's policy will provide the Environmental Protection
Agency with a valuable model as it develops new federal standards
for cars, light-duty trucks, minivans and SUVs. The proposed rules
could be released as early as January.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, minivans, SUVs and other truck-like passenger
vehicles now account for nearly 50 percent of new purchases. Their
popularity and their increasing share of vehicle miles traveled
could, in a decade or so, obliterate recent improvements in air
quality. That predicament can be averted, so long as the EPA
follows California's example and adopts an umbrella emission
standard that applies to the vast majority of passenger vehicles
regardless of type.
</P>
<P>
   However, the benefits of a uniform emission standard, measured
in grams per mile, will be limited unless the EPA also issues
companion regulations for lowering the sulfur content of gasoline.
High levels of sulfur hinder the efficiency of a vehicle's
catalytic converter, the device that cleans car exhaust of nitrogen
oxide and other pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, state pollution officials have urged the EPA
to adopt California's low-sulfur limit of 40 parts per million as
the national standard. This will not please refiners. Much of the
gasoline now sold has a sulfur content of 340 parts per million,
and refiners argue that to reduce it to California levels will mean
costly retooling of refineries and will add up to six cents a
gallon to the cost of gasoline at the pump. Others insist that new
technology can cut the cost to a penny or two. Refiners favor two
standards _ a California-type standard by 2010 for parts of the
country where air quality is poor, mainly east of the Mississippi,
and a more lenient standard elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The automobile makers are also complaining. California estimates
that its new tailpipe rules will add $100 to $300 to the cost of a
vehicle. The auto makers say the costs will be much more.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA certainly cannot turn a deaf ear to these complaints.
Nor is it required to follow California's rules and timetables to
the letter. But the history of air pollution battles in this
country shows that industry often exaggerates the costs of
environmental controls, whereas California is often right about
policy. Indeed, the industrialized world often takes its cue from
California _ Canada and the European Union have recently embraced
similar low-sulfur rules. Washington would be wise to listen to
Sacramento.

BIONDI OUSTED AS CHAIRMAN OF UNIVERSAL STUDIOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Frank Biondi Jr., the Seagram Co.'s highest-ranking
Hollywood executive and chairman of Universal Studios, was ousted
on Monday by Seagram's chief executive, Edgar Bronfman Jr., who
said he would take more hands-on control of the company's growing
entertainment operations.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi will be replaced by his No. 2, Ron Meyer, the president
and chief operating officer at Universal, who will report directly
to Bronfman. Under the arrangement, Meyer will oversee three of
Universal's entertainment businesses: movies, television and theme
parks. Separately, Doug Morris, chairman of Universal's music
business, will also report to Bronfman.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman said in a telephone interview that the shifts would
help the company run more smoothly as it nears completion of its
$10.4 billion purchase of Polygram N.V., the world's largest music
company. That purchase _ coupled with Bronfman's decision last year
to sell most of Universal's television assets to Barry Diller's USA
Networks _ seriously diminished the power of Biondi, a respected
figure on Wall Street. Bronfman personally negotiated the Polygram
deal and has a personal and active interest in music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically, the company has taken a couple of very
significant turns since Frank joined them,'' said Jeffrey Logsdon,
an analyst at the Seidler Cos. He said Bronfman's company was
seeking to turn into the dominant player in the music world and was
increasingly emphasizing theme parks in its expansion efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not businesses that Frank had a great deal of
experience with coming into the job,'' Logsdon said. In fact,
Biondi's expertise, in previous top jobs at Viacom Inc. and Home
Box Office, a unit of Time Warner Inc., was in television and
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman said the company had completed most of its significant
expansion efforts in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question, Bronfman said he had been thinking
about removing Biondi for a while. ``I thought this was the best
way to do it,'' he said. ``It was the right way to structure the
company.'' Bronfman added that he personally had ``more confidence
to manage the business more actively and productively as a result
of three and a half years here.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The closure of the Polygram transaction is really
the final step of Seagram's transformation into an operating
company which is a leader in the field of entertainment and spirits
and wine,'' Bronfman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman said that his focus in the last few years had been
deals _ he called them ``asset transformation'' _ involving areas
such as music and television. ``It's been a large and, I think,
pretty dramatic series of asset transformations,'' Bronfman said.
``Those asset transformations are behind us now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the past confusion in the entertainment business
about who does what at Seagram _ and the seemingly overlapping
responsibilities between Meyer, Biondi and even Bronfman _ the
43-year-old scion of the Bronfman family fortune replied tartly:
``There's really room for one CEO, and it's me.''
</P>
<P>
   As to Universal's sluggish movie division, and the disappointing
opening over the weekend of ``Meet Joe Black,'' Bronfman said,
``There's no question we've had a disappointing year, although I
have confidence in `Meet Joe Black.''' He said Universal's slate of
coming films ``is looking pretty good in the next couple of
quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Biondi is expected to leave with a severance package as high as
$30 million. The 53-year-old executive was similarly forced out of
Viacom in 1996 after its chairman, Sumner Redstone, said he wanted
to take a larger role in day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi said in an interview that he held no bitterness toward
Bronfman. ``Edgar said he wanted to be more hands on,'' Biondi
said. ``It's his company, and that's his prerogative.'' He added,
``In some respects, it really wasn't a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Biondi said his job had changed considerably and unexpectedly
since he took over Universal, formerly MCA Inc., three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not really what I signed up for,'' Biondi said. ``The
company has been changed. The job has been changed. Assets have
been sold. Assets have been bought. Line reporting has been
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Biondi, who noted that he had no immediate job plans, i said of
Bronfman: ``His family is the controlling shareholder, and he's the
CEO. He can do it. These things happen. They treated me better than
fine.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Biondi added that Bronfman ``has a lot riding on Polygram and
making Universal continue to grow.'' He added that Universal would
have ``a sensational year and, hopefully, film performance will
improve.'' Actually, Biondi barely focused on the troubled film
side, leaving decision-making to Meyer and Casey Silver, the studio
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Seagram fell 25 cents on Monday, to $34.0625. The
company's shares have dropped from about $45 in May, partly because
of Seagram's downturn in its liquor business in Asia, the result of
economic turmoil there.
</P>
<P>
   Although Universal's music division has revived under Morris,
the movie side and, in some cases, the corporate hierarchy, had
been besieged in the last two years by executive turnover. At the
same time, Universal seemed to be floating listlessly, until the
Polygram deal, without a viable strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Seagram's announcement also said that two other divisions _
the Spirits and Wine Group and Chateau and Estate Wines _ would
also report to Bronfman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our decision to acquire Polygram N.V., coupled with our
ongoing commitment to maximize shareholder value, led us to
critically examine Universal's existing structure and operations,''
Bronfman said in a statement. ``As a result of that evaluation, we
have implemented today's changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer essentially replaces Biondi, but not in title. A
well-liked figure in the movie business, Meyer was one of the
founders of the Creative Artists Agency with Michael Ovitz and
several others. ``Ron Meyer has proven himself as one of the
industry's most effective executives at managing and developing
talent across entertainment sectors,'' Bronfman said.

BRAZIL'S DOZEN PHONE SPINOFFS COME TO TRADE IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ Bolstered by the rescue agreement reached
between the Brazilian government and the International Monetary
Fund last week, the 12 holding companies spun off from the
telecommunications giant Telebras during its privatization this
summer began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, the government monopoly _ formally
Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras SA _ has been the most widely held
foreign stock on U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   In July, however, Telebras was broken up into a long-distance
carrier and three regional fixed-line and eight cellular telephone
holding companies, which fetched a combined $19 billion from eight
groups of foreign investors, including one led by MCI
Communications, now the merged MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   The trading arrangement that began on the New York Stock
Exchange on Monday will allow investors to buy American depository
receipts in any of the dozen successor companies to Telebras. And
they will continue to have the option to retain an equivalent of
their Telebras holdings through a separate instrument containing
all 12 of the so-called ``Baby Bras'' companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectation is that for a short time, investors will take
positions in the basket security because they are still developing
their evaluations'' of the new successor companies, said Carlos
Constantini, a telecommunications analyst with Paribas BBA in Sao
Paulo. ``But once they have an idea of what they want to overwrite
and underwrite, they will move rapidly to the 12 companies, or some
combination of three or four of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle to attract U.S. stockholders and fund managers, who
have fled Brazilian holdings since the collapse of Russian finances
in August amid generalized concerns about emerging markets, is
expected to be fierce. Brazilian analysts, who have been trading in
the Telebras spinoff companies for nearly two months, said the
larger bellwether companies were most likely to benefit, at least
initially, rather than the smaller cellular concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market always tends to seek liquidity, and in the short
term, that means people will gravitate toward Telesp and
Embratel,'' predicted Oliver Mizne, a telecommunications analyst
with Banco Garantia, referring to the Sao Paulo regional phone
company and the national long-distance carrier. ``Those are the two
biggest, so they offer a convenient temporary solution, and later
on people will decide if they want to move somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Telesp, which closed Monday at 28 7/16, was the most
actively traded among the regional spinoff companies, with more
than 880,000 units changing hands on a when-issued basis. Embratel
closed at 15 9/16, also when issued. Continuing to trade after its
original listing on July 28, 1998, is the Telebras American
depository receipt, the basket security, which rose 4 9/16 Monday,
to $84.50.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The start of trading in the spinoff phone companies coincided
with a burgeoning political controversy, in which the privatization
of Telebras has emerged as a central issue. In a series of
illegally tapped phone conversations that were published Monday by
the weekly news magazine Veja, two senior government officials
supervising the auction can be heard profanely disparaging one
group of bidders and passing information to a rival group that
included a former business partner.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, Communications Minister Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros
and National Development Bank president Andre Lara Resende have
denied any wrongdoing and rejected demands that they resign. Their
supporters in the government have defended their conduct, saying
their intention was to stimulate competition and noting that the
eventual winners were the same consortium that at one point was
described on the tapes as ``a bunch of rats.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantini of Paribas said that even though ``the process and
the price were fair,'' there had been ``a certain loss of
transparency'' as a result of the fracas over the Telebras
privatization. ``The loser is the government, not the telephone
companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, analysts said, the Baby Bras companies are
likely to be strengthened by the $41.5 billion rescue package
negotiated with the IMF and announced on Friday. The package will
permit the Baby Bras to tap international capital markets for the
funds essential to their expansion plans. In many parts of Brazil,
the waiting list for a fixed-line telephone is as long as two
years, and pent-up demand for cellular phones is extremely high.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF agreement requires the Brazilian government to continue
and broaden the privatization process begun by President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, the program will focus on public utilities,'' such as
``state-owned companies in the electrical sector,'' the accord
stated, but also including such highly attractive entities as
Banespa, the former bank of Sao Paulo state that is now in federal
hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government is also committed to a further opening
of the telecommunications market, beginning in January. That is
when bids will begin for licenses to compete head to head with each
of the companies privatized in July, with one new competitor to be
allowed in each region of this country of more than 160 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition in the recently privatized telecommunications
sector will be fostered through concessions to the private
sector,'' the IMF agreement said. By 2003, according to the plan
the Brazilian government has developed, all of the companies in
operation will be allowed to offer any service in any region, even
more sweeping than what has occurred in the United States after the
break-up of AT&AMP;T in the 1980s.

 GreenTree Hopes E-Vitamins Take Off  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
GreenTree Nutrition would like to be the Amazon.com of vitamins and
nutritional supplements. But it would be the first to acknowledge
that it has a big ``snake-oil'' image on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem: The San Francisco company sells products
that don't undergo the same rigorous regulation as prescription
drugs _ even though Americans are swallowing them to the tune of
$12 billion a year, for ailments ranging from high blood pressure
to arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the Federal Trade Commission warned that many
vitamin sellers make false or deceptive claims for substances like
shark cartilage, which is reputed to alleviate arthritis or cancer
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hokum can actually hurt people,'' said Jodie Bernstein,
director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is an added challenge for GreenTree, which hopes
to sell its products for 20 percent less than store-bought
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry has picked up the aura of the snake-oil
salesman,'' said chief executive Don Kendall, who considers
countering this image as important as competing with the retailers
who dominate the vitamin market.
</P>
<P>
   Since the San Francisco Web site went online last month, it has
offered hundreds of products, including Echinacea, a plant extract
taken to ward off the flu; St. John's Wort, a popular
anti-depression palliative; and even shark cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside each product, GreenTree serves up what Kendall called
``factual'' information about what is and isn't known about the
beneficial health effects or harmful side effects of each product.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of shark cartilage, GreenTree offers a choice of
nine products, and this caveat: ``no independent scientific test or
clinical trial has yet proven that it is an effective course of
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said that to have a chance as a business, GreenTree must
offer consumers the same products they already can get from
speciality retailers like GNC, superstores like Costco, mail-order
catalogs or face-to-face Amway salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   But he hopes to dodge the ``snake-oil'' label by avoiding the
hype that seems to surround these unregulated pills and potions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to build a brand name people can trust, and to do
that, we have to offer solid, credible information,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old entrepreneur learned a thing or two about
brand-name management at the knee of his father, Donald Kendall,
77, who retired several years ago after a long career as the chief
executive of PepsiCo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepsi connection helped the younger Kendall recruit a
high-powered board that includes former Apple Computer Chairman _
and Pepsi alumnus _ John Sculley, and made it easier to raise more
than $14 million to fund his 22-person operation.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco venture capitalist Neil Weintraut, a lead investor
in GreenTree, said what sold him on Kendall's business plan was
that it tapped into a fundamental lifestyle trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In everything from personal finance to personal health, people
are taking more responsibility for themselves,'' Weintraut said.
</P>
<P>
   That trend was evident in the findings of the NPD Group, a New
York market research firm. It recently reported that 45 percent of
Americans now take some form of vitamin, herbal product or mineral
supplement daily _ often without consulting a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Whether prompted by genuine concern or out of fear of losing
their prerogatives, the medical profession has sharply criticized
the self-health phenomenon. A strongly worded editorial in the
Journal of the American Medical Association recently blasted the
``uncritical acceptance of untested and unproven alternative
therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Americans seem disinclined to heed such warnings, giving
GreenTree a big opportunity to become the Web heavyweight in this
fast-growing _ if controversial _ category.

 New Twist in Events at Net Domain Organization  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Esther Dyson, the technology guru and best-selling author who has
quietly taken over the new organization responsible for selling the
Internet's most popular domain names _ yesterday dismissed
conspiracy theories swirling around her secretive group. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are such things are coincidences,'' said Dyson, interim
chairman of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and
Names.
</P>
<P>
   On October 1, the responsibility for selling top-level domain
names _ those ending in .com, .org, .net, .gov and .edu. _ was
officially transferred from a U.S. government contractor to ICANN,
a worldwide nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   During the next few weeks, a series of events had conspiracy
theorists working overtime: Jon Postel, a key architect of the
plan, died; another key figure behind the scheme, Ira Magaziner,
resigned; and a U.S. congressman launched an inquiry into the
transfer, which has gone anything but smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the plot thickened.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Battista, chief executive of Network Solutions, resigned.
Network Solutions is the Virginia company that until last month had
an exclusive contract from the U.S. government to sell top-level
domain names.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson yesterday said the events are unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner, who was President Clinton's high-profile Internet
adviser, ``intended to retire for some time and Jon Postel was in
poor health. Those were not surprises. To read anything more into
it is a stretch,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson was surprised to hear that Battista resigned from Network
Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief financial officer, Robert Korzeniewski, will
run day-to-day operations until a full-time replacement is found.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Battista, 54, said he is joining a Pennsylvania
long-distance reseller, Tel-Save.com, as chairman and CEO in
January because it represents ``a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some take that statement at face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an instance of very bright individuals pursuing
other interests,'' said Jeff Richards, executive director of
Internet Alliance, a Washington, D.C., trade organization.
``Listen, this is one of the most exciting and exhausting times for
the Net. It is also a burnout phase for some of the leaders. They
are going to exit and enter other roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Internet observers say the events are too improbable
not to question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation is curious,'' said Naseem Javed, president
of ABC Namebank International, a brand-name consulting company in
New York. ``Here we have a plan with huge implications for the
Internet, and the major decisions are taking place behind closed
doors. And with all that has happened in the last few weeks, this
shaky transition is on the verge of collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson, 47, was elected ICANN chairman at a closed-door meeting
in New York late last month. Even though Dyson is one of the most
influential women in high tech, and her last book, ``Release 2.0,''
got widespread publicity, her appointment went almost unnoticed in
the media.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson said she plans to make ICANN far more open. Critics
charged that the transfer of domain-naming power from Network
Solutions to ICANN was done with almost no public input. Another
complaint is that despite the transfer, Network Solutions is
maintaining its exclusive right to sell domain names during the
next few months while ICANN gets up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson expects ICANN to start assigning domain-naming rights in
March. Under the new scheme, any company can buy rights to sell
domain names.
</P>
<P>
   The ICANN board is comprised of five U.S. representatives from
the high-tech and education fields, as well as officials from
Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, France and Australia.

   DOW AVERAGE TOPS 9,000 ON HOPE FOR A RATE CUT
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices rose, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average past
9,000 for the first time since late July, on hopes the Federal
Reserve will lower interest rates at Tuesday's policy-making
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow industrials were up 91.66 points, or 1.03 percent, at
9,011.25. Broader market indexes also advanced. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.16 points, or 0.9 percent, to
1,135.88, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 13.69 points, or 0.74
percent, to 1,861.68.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices fell for the first time in more than a week on
uncertainty over a rate cut. The 30-year bond yield rose to 5.29
percent.

<P>
   HEWLETT-PACKARD EXCEEDS FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard reported a 12 percent drop in fourth-quarter
earnings that nevertheless exceeded analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION OFF IN OCTOBER
</P>
<P>
   Industrial production unexpectedly fell one-tenth of a percent
in October, the fourth drop in five months. Output at utilities and
mines declined, but factory output was up.
</P>
<P>
   TWO PLEAD GUILTY IN INSIDER CASE
</P>
<P>
   Two former brokers, Robert Breed, formerly of First United
Equities, and Jennifer D'Antoni, formerly of Duke &AMP; Co., pleaded
guilty to taking secret stock information, another victory for New
York state prosecutors in an important insider trading case.
</P>
<P>
   AMAZON.COM IN HOLIDAY EXPANSION
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online retailer that dominates Internet book
sales and, increasingly, music, is expanding into a much broader
array of merchandise with a holiday gift selection that includes
consumer electronics, games, toys and other items.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT SLIDE CONTINUES AT TOYS `R' US
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us, the world's biggest toy retailer, reported a 57
percent slide in third-quarter operating profit. The fall was
expected because of slow sales and competition from discount chains
like Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   NIKE SHIFTS TO SAFER SOLVENTS
</P>
<P>
   Nike said it was shifting to safer glues and solvents, so that
less than 1 percent of its Asian work force would come into contact
with dangerous vapors from petroleum-based solvents, a
three-quarters reduction from last year.
</P>
<P>
   SKEPTICISM GREETS JAPANESE PLAN
</P>
<P>
   Although the $195 billion economic stimulus plan announced by
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan is the nation's largest ever,
investors were not overly enthusiastic. They have been disappointed
in Japan so many times that they are hard to impress. The benchmark
Nikkei index of 225 stocks ended up 160.06 points, or a modest 1.12
percent, at 14,428.27. But many critics called the package
misguided and shortsighted because it lacked a plan for deficit
reduction and sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
   TELEBRAS SPINOFFS TRADE ON NYSE
</P>
<P>
   The 12 holding companies spun off from Brazil's
telecommunications giant Telebras during its privatization in the
summer began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, bolstered by
the government's rescue agreement with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   CORPORATE GERMANY CUTTING BACK
</P>
<P>
   The streamlining of corporate Germany is accelerating,
reflecting pressure to shed businesses that drag down overall
profit. In the last two weeks three of the biggest conglomerates,
Siemens, Viag and Metro, have announced plans for huge spinoffs of
units that employ tens of thousands of people.

BOEING GOES TO GENERAL MOTORS FOR NEW CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. has reached into the ranks of General
Motors executives for its new chief financial officer who will be
responsible for modernizing accounting practices that industry
analysts have long complained are too conservative, too secretive
and out of date.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Hopkins, vice president of finance for GM's European
operations, will be highest ranking woman ever at Boeing when she
joins the company Dec. 14. At age 44, she also is one of the
Boeing's youngest top executives.
</P>
<P>
   She replaces Boyd Givan, Boeing's longtime chief financial
officer, who resigned under pressure this summer as the company
struggled through production problems that raised Wall Street
concerns about its financial performance and even its leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her task will be to get Boeing's accounting and information
reporting up to modern standards,'' said Peter Aseritis, aerospace
analyst with Cowen &AMP; Co. He said the 62-year-old Givan operated
with a 1950s corporate style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Givan never said a word to anybody,'' Aseritis said. ``Our
hope is that this new person can be very responsive and will share
information and data. That's the way other companies are doing it
and analysts are expecting it be done that way at Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Boeing Chairman Phil Condit praised Hopkins and
pointed to her successful track record at General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   As GM's general auditor in 1995, Condit said, Hopkins introduced
a system that lets line managers better track the costs and risks
of business initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of activity is directly on target with what we are
seeking to accomplish at Boeing,'' Condit said. ``She also
developed and implemented strategies to support extensive
international growth in GM operations and joint ventures throughout
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As vice president of finance and chief financial officer for
General Motors Europe, which is headquartered in Switzerland,
Hopkins helped manage an operation with $26 billion in sales for
the giant auto maker.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow the auto industry said GM's European unit
has been a leader in adopting lean manufacturing processes
pioneered by the Japanese and which Boeing has implemented in its
factories to cut costs and improve efficiencies as the world's
largest airplane maker.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the European unit was the only one of GM's
four major divisions to report increased profits.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins joined General Motors in 1995 as the general auditor.
Before that, she spent 13 years at Unisys Corp, where her final
assignment was vice president and general manager of Worldwide
Information Systems, the systems integration and consulting arm of
Unisys.
</P>
<P>
   From January 1993 to August 1995, Hopkins served as vice
president and corporate controller and chief accounting officer.
Prior to that, she was vice president for business analysis and
played a pivotal role during the company's turnaround. She also
spent two years in engineering and manufacturing operations where
she led the launch of the check imaging program.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Milwaukee, Wis., Hopkins received a bachelor's degree
from Walsh College and also attended the Wharton School of
Business. She got her first financial job at Ford Motor Co. and
also worked at the National Bank of Detroit before joining Unisys
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As Boeing chief financial officer, Hopkins will report to the
``office of the chairman,'' which includes Condit and Boeing
President Harry Stonecipher.
</P>
<P>
   Givan's retirement, although announced in July, was not
effective until Sept. 1. Since then, Stonecipher has been acting
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has never publicly acknowledged that Givan was forced to
take early retirement. But sources in the company say it was
Stonecipher who pushed hard for Givan's exit. The 32-year Boeing
veteran became the first casualty of production problems that saw
Boeing suffer its first financial loss in a half century in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Also losing his job was Ron Woodard, head of the troubled
commercial airplanes unit. He was replaced by Boeing veteran Alan
Mulally, who quickly moved to organize Boeing's Everett, Renton and
Long Beach plants as profit and loss centers.
</P>
<P>
   One conservative accounting practice that Stonecipher wanted
changed, company sources said, was Givan's insistence on writing
off airplane production costs up front, rather than spreading out
those costs with each plane produced. On the next generation 737,
for example, Boeing will have to deliver more than 800 planes
before it shows a profit on paper.
</P>
<P>
   There also were complaints in and outside of Boeing that Givan
did not share critical financial information, and the information
he did share was not that useful. Givan did not operate with ``real
time data,'' Aseritis said. Hopkins must change that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her biggest task will be to take 13 different management
information systems that are now in place at Boeing and get them to
talk with each other so she has real time data,'' Aseritis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one thing Givan did not do very well. He operated
with a 1950s mindset, when you calculated costs after the fact
rather than in real time. Givan could not provide managers at
Boeing with real time data .... Givan kept everything close to the
vest. That's not the modern way.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Boeing has been much more forthcoming with
industry analysts about its future financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a commitment to provide them with additional
information on a quarterly basis,'' said Boeing spokesman Larry
McCracken. ``Once we got through our production problems . . .,
once we saw that we could then make more accurate forecasts, we
began doing that in the second quarter and we will continue to do
that . . . The clear intention of Phil and Harry is to provide a
different level of information.''

METEORS PUT ON A SHOW, AND COMET SWINGS BY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hoping for clear skies, astronomers and amateur
stargazers in many parts of the country trekked to hills and open
fields in the early darkness Monday and planned more excursions
early Tuesday as the Earth began plowing through the tail of a
comet and the most spectacular meteor storm in decades got under
way.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York metropolitan area may miss out on the best of
the show. After cloudy skies Monday night, clearer conditions are
expected Tuesday night, but the peak of the storm will have passed.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict that the storm will peak in Asia Tuesday, and
that skies over much of the United States will be cloudy anyway.
But there were early accounts of fiery meteors over America as the
leading edge of Comet Temple-Tuttle's debris hit the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out for four hours early this morning, and there were
fireballs lighting up the sky quite spectacularly at the rate of
one a minute,'' Robert Lunsford, North American coordinator of the
International Meteor Organization, said Monday in a telephone
interview from his home in San Diego. His organization is a
300-member network that observes meteors from scores of countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lunsford, who observed the sky early Monday from 3,000 feet in
the Laguna Mountains near Descanso, Calif., 50 miles east of San
Diego, said many of the meteors were ``brighter than any of the
stars,'' and had long, luminous tails. One meteor was a ``bright
blue burst that lit up the landscape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar accounts came from other parts of the country. ``We've
had reports of very rich, very bright fireballs from people on the
West Coast and in Hawaii,'' said Alan MacRoberts, an associate
editor of Sky &AMP; Telescope Magazine. He added, ``These are not large
numbers, but a few spectacularly bright meteors.''
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of meteor showers called the Leonids _ because ancient
observers thought the meteors came from the constellation Leo _ has
been known for 1,000 years to occur at this time every year, but
every 33 years or so, Comet Temple-Tuttle, discovered in 1865,
speeds across Earth's orbit and sheds swarms of particles as it
nears the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The particles, most of them no larger than grains of sand, burn
up as they hit the Earth's atmosphere. Leonid meteor showers may
produce thousands of blazing streaks across the sky every hour.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, the last time Temple-Tuttle was around, tens of
thousands of meteors were observed in the peak hours.
</P>
<P>
   For observers in Japan, China, Mongolia and the western rim of
the Pacific, where the meteor storm is expected to peak Tuesday,
there is a chance that this year's display will be equally
spectacular, astronomers say. For that reason, scientists planning
experiments have gone to eastern Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Most astronomers said they expected far fewer meteors per hour
in the United States and Canada _ a few hundred to a few thousand,
perhaps _ because only the leading and trailing edges of the
comet's debris field would be hitting the atmosphere Monday night
and Tuesday night, when darkness permits observation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the weather is expected to limit visibility over much
of the United States. The clearest skies Monday night were in the
Southwest, Texas, the Southern Plains and the middle Mississippi
Valley. Clouds were expected over the rest of the nation, including
the Northeast, except for Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The best viewing Tuesday night is expected to be in the
Southwest, the Southern Plains and the Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys, with some clearing in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the optimum viewing window would be Monday night
and Tuesday night from about midnight or 1 a.m. _ in any time zone,
for maximum darkness _ to about 90 minutes before sunrise.
Observers should seek hillsides or open fields away from lights
that might spoil night vision, and as far as possible from any
urban sky glow. Telescopes and binoculars are useless because
meteors come and go too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Joe Patterson, a member of Columbia University's
astronomy faculty, was planning an excursion with 20 students to
Harriman State Park in Rockland County, N.Y., and he was
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   If predictions for a meteor storm peaking at midafternoon
Tuesday (Eastern standard time) are off by 10 hours or so,
Patterson said, there could be a spectacular show over areas of
North America that are not covered by clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, who has been making nighttime excursions to gaze into
the heavens for 30 years, said he was not surprised by early
accounts of fireballs seen in the West and on Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Earth is colliding virtually head-on with the debris from
the comet, and because it's a head-on collision the meteors tend to
be quite bright,'' he said.

LIVINGSTON PACKS A TEMPER, A BLACK BELT AND A BIPARTISAN APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBBING graf 26 to add wife's name)  (htv) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE and RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hours after his swift emergence last week as the
presumptive new Speaker of the House, Rep. Bob Livingston
telephoned an old friend, former Rep. Jimmy Hayes, for advice. He
did not ask Hayes how best to keep his Republican flock in line, or
for counsel on issues. Instead, he quizzed his fellow Louisiana
Republican about how he could best build a relationship with Rep.
Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Tell me about Dick Gephardt the person,''' recalled
Hayes, a onetime Democrat who is close to both men. ```I want to
know more about this guy.' ``Livingston was saying, `I know he
listens great. I want him to talk more.'''
</P>
<P>
   That Livingston wants to talk at all to Gephardt, who hungers
for his job, underscores the bipartisan, accommodationist approach
of the new leader. The man Livingston will replace, Newt Gingrich,
had considered Gephardt so irrelevant that he rarely spoke to him.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Livingston, both Tulane graduates, are vastly
different. While Gingrich built his career as a rebel, Livingston
has always reached across the aisle. Both are conservatives, but
Gingrich is ideological and Livingston is pragmatic. While Gingrich
has called himself ``a transformational leader,'' Livingston is not
known for his vision, intellect or ego, and until he was elevated
to chairman of the Appropriations Committee, was not considered a
heavyweight in Washington, or back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet there are a lot of people in New Orleans, still, who
wouldn't even recognize him if you showed them Livingston's
picture,'' said Ed Renwick, who heads the Institute of Politics at
Loyola University.
</P>
<P>
   In an era in which Speakers have been defined by belligerent
partisanship _ particularly Gingrich and the Democrat he hounded
from office, Jim Wright _ Livingston represents an older strain of
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   While Wright and Gingrich were tainted by scandal, Livingston
has not been. And while Gingrich had long predicted greatness for
himself, and plotted for years to become speaker, there are no such
stories about Livingston. ``I don't think it ever entered his
head,'' said Fred Carroll, an investment banker and a friend for
more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is perhaps best known on Capitol Hill for his
incendiary outbursts on the House floor and in private meetings (he
cools down quickly). ``He has a huge temper,'' said Rep. W.J.
(Billy) Tauzin, another Louisiana Republican. ``He's going to have
to learn to use it and control it.''
</P>
<P>
   The incoming speaker has a gift for timing, a relentless and
plodding nature and a gangly, even awkward demeanor that has led
many to underestimate him. Even his closest friends say they never
considered him likely to become one of the most powerful men in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who has been there at the right time, time after
time, and he's always taken advantage of it,'' said John Bolles, a
former classmate and close friend for four decades. ``This is not a
terribly complicated guy. This is not a guy with a lot of hidden
agendas. He's got a good, healthy ego, but no delusions of
grandeur.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, 55, who has represented Louisiana's relatively
affluent 1st District since 1977, pursues what he wants with the
same single-mindedness that he brings to his hobbies: playing the
harmonica, doing impersonations and becoming a black belt in Tae
Kwan Do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got that black belt, in the first minute of the test
he broke his big toe on a board but he just kept right on going,''
said Quin Hillyer, an editorial writer at The Mobile (Ala.)
Register, who was the congressman's press secretary. ``You know how
painful that is? He's tough. He's got a very strong will.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston has carried that strong will to Congress. He was
appalled when the Federal Election Commission conducted a random
audit of his first successful campaign. Ever since, he has crusaded
against the agency, slashing staff members and starting
investigations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   With similar zeal, Livingston sought the speakership. Earlier
this year, he announced that he would seek the post whenever
Gingrich stepped aside. But in the wake of the Republicans' net
loss of five House seats on Nov. 3, Livingston turned on the man
who had been his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to meet with us more often and talk about
process,'' Gephardt said of his new sparring partner. But the
Democratic leader, in perhaps an unintended compliment to Gingrich,
said: ``Newt's great strengths were that he had both a vision and
an ideology and a set of issues and thinking that he could express,
at least to some people, in a compelling way _ and that's important
in a leader. You have to be able to express ideas. And I don't know
whether Bob can do that or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Linlithgow Livingston was born in Colorado Springs,
Colo., where his mother's family lived. Eventually, the family
settled in New Orleans, where his father took a job with National
Distillers. The job did not last long, and neither did the
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, when Robert (``It wasn't until he became a politician
that he became Bob,'' Carroll said) was 7 years old, his father
walked out on the family. ``He turned out to be an alcoholic,''
said Livingston's mother, Dorothy Billet, who stayed in New
Orleans, got a divorce and a job at the Avondale Shipyards. She
remarried after her son and daughter grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Billet later learned that her first husband had settled in Spain
and died at 55. ``Of course, Robert was very upset by his father
going away like that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, though, said the young man rarely mentioned it. ``I'm
sure it had a negative impact,'' Bolles said. ``But he never talked
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Billet settled Robert and his younger sister into a modest home
in New Orleans' Uptown neighborhood, a couple of blocks from Tulane
University. One important effect of the departure of Robert's
father was that the family was always strapped. Young Robert helped
out financially.
</P>
<P>
   Always among the youngest and tallest in his class, Robert
Livingston was a shy boy, his mother said. ``I remember when he was
124 pounds and 6 foot 4,'' she said. ``He wanted to be the athletic
type. He really wanted to be. But he was always a year behind in
athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   Billet, an active Episcopalian, received partial scholarships
for her children from the church that allowed them to attend St.
Martins Episcopal School, one of New Orleans' most prestigious
schools. At 14, Livingston worked cleaning up after elephants at
the New Orleans Zoo. For several summers, he earned college money
at the Avondale Shipyards, ending up as a welder's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   After Livingston, like many of his Uptown friends, settled on
Tulane, his life nearly came unstuck. ``What happened is that he
went to college and got in with a group of guys who liked to party,
including me,'' Bolles said. Livingston joined the Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity. Robert's fraternity brothers rechristened him
Doc (as in, ``Dr. Livingstone, I presume'') and many still call him
that.
</P>
<P>
   After only one year at Tulane, Livingston was asked in 1961 to
take a sabbatical from the university, Bolles said, explaining that
school authorities complained that he and his friends partied too
much.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Livingston joined the Navy, serving for two years, and returned
from his military tour a subtly changed man. ``The Navy
straightened him out,'' Bolles said. ``He kept on partying with us,
but he was more able to handle the partying and the classes
together. He had more confidence, was more focused.'' He began to
talk about law school.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Livingston also met and married Bonnie Robichaux, a
Lousisiana State University student. They have three sons and a
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Livingston graduated from Tulane's law school and took
a job at a civil law firm whose partners included David Treen, a
Republican who later was elected governor of Louisiana. ``He was
interested in a political career right from the beginning,'' Treen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Treen said he advised Livingston to establish himself as a
success in some career before running for office. The young man
agreed and, after two years with the firm, asked Treen to help him
get a job as an assistant U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The hard living continued in his early years as a prosecutor,
his friends said, when he would often go out drinking in the French
Quarter to celebrate a victory or unwind. Late one night,
Livingston came home to find that his wife had placed his dinner _
the entire place setting, from water glass to cutlery _ neatly on
the front step, where it was swarming with vermin. Friends said the
incident contributed to his slowing down the fast life.
</P>
<P>
   When a seat opened in the 1st Congressional District in 1976,
Livingston was not the Republican establishment's first choice. But
after one potential candidate developed financial difficulties and
a second declined to switch his party affiliation, the Republicans
approached Livingston, who eagerly agreed to run.
</P>
<P>
   He was defeated by a Democrat who, within months, was
investigated and eventually jailed for campaign finance
irregularities. In a special election in 1977, Livingston,
untainted and fresh in the voters' minds, easily won election to
the seat he has held ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The only other race Livingston lost was when he ran for governor
in 1987. Even then his accommodationist inclinations were apparent.
After a bitter contest in which Livingston and a rival, Tauzin, who
was serving in the House as a Democrat, lost in their parties'
primaries, Livingston took the unheard of step of raising money to
help pay off Tauzin's debt. ``Bob felt it would be the right thing
to do because it was not good for a member of our delegation to be
so preoccupied with debt,'' said Tauzin, who became a Republican
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston had planned to retire from Congress this year to
pursue a career as a lobbyist and make more money. But Gingrich was
among those who convinced him to stay. And Livingston would never
have been in a position to drive Gingrich from office had the
speaker not chosen him over others with more seniority to preside
over federal spending as chairman of the Appropriations Committee
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a tough-minded chairman, battling Democrats who want
to spend more as well as Republicans who want to deliver projects
to their districts. He displayed his bipartisan bonafides _ and
outraged some conservatives _ by keeping several Democrats on the
committee staff who had held their jobs before the Republicans took
over Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Livingston did not waver from traditional Republican goals,
like slashing billions of dollars from the federal budget and
eliminating hundreds of federal programs, while resisting
reductions in military spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call him a social activist,'' said Jimmy Hayes, the
former congressman. ``The only theme that fits Bob is the fiscal
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   As he angled to move up the hierarchy, Livingston established
his own political action committee, dutifully raising money for
colleagues.He also became known for quickly getting to the bottom
line. Rep. Joe Scarborough, a R.-Fla., recalled being dressed down
by the chairman after he opposed a measure to increase spending for
House operations and delivered a speech that was criticized as
being unduly self-righteous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was offended by my speech and basically told me
that I needed to work with the team _ or not expect the team to
work for me,'' Scarborough said. ``I respect somebody who tells me
straight instead of someone smiling, patting me on the back, and
then trying to do me in. With the last group, regrettably, you had
a hard time filtering out what to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich named Livingston to head the committee, they had
struck an implicit bargain: The new chairman would work with the
leadership. But as time wore on, Livingston began to chafe at the
speaker's tight rein.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Gingrich on Nov. 6, Livingston _ in what amounted
to a cry for a return to the tradition of powerful barons presiding
over their committees _ outlined 15 demands, including that he be
given the freedom to ``run the committee as I see fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Gingrich announced his resignation, pushed out by
his once-loyal protege. Now, it will be Livingston's turn to run
the House and, like his predecessor, to try his hand at the
ultimate challenge: building a record of legislative accomplishment
while satisfying a chamber of restive partisans.

COMMUNITY STRUGGLING FOR A ONE-ROOM SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KEITH SCHNEIDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOIS BLANC ISLAND, Mich. _ A giant wind churned up 8-foot swells
in the Straits of Mackinac, which separate this rugged and
beautiful northern Lake Huron island from the mainland. But even as
the storm knocked out power and downed trees across the Midwest,
Lani White and her four students were cozy inside the one-room Bois
Blanc Pines School, the smallest in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Just as teachers and students have done since the Depression,
when a maintenance shed was converted into a
kindergarten-through-eighth-grade school, the three teen-age boys
and a 6-year-old girl began their day by reciting the pledge of
allegiance and ringing the school bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good school,'' said Kathy Craft, who emigrated
from Ohio in 1989 to run the island's only restaurant, and whose
son, Rick Craft, is in eighth grade. ``They get one-on-one
attention. They learn. And they're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pines School is a lone survivor from an era early in this
century when one-room schools were common, serving as civic
institutions that educated children and bound together residents of
rural townships throughout northern Michigan. The trouble is that
this tiny school, which has sent its graduates on to college and to
productive technical and professional careers, may not make it into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   State education policy and geography are combining to slowly
drain the school of money, and students. Michael White, a handyman
who is married to the teacher and serves as the fiscal agent, said
the school could close by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we get some help from the Legislature or the governor,
then next year will be the last,'' said White, whose son, Michael,
is in the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   With its bell tower and red clapboard siding, the Pines School
is a fitting landmark on 21,000-acre Bois Blanc Island (pronounced
``boyce blank''). This is a place, after all, that celebrates its
distance from the mainstream. Lying just 2.5 miles south of
Mackinac Island, its famous and tonier neighbor, Bois Blanc is a
little-known summer destination for hundreds of Midwestern families
who have been coming for decades.
</P>
<P>
   It is also home to 35 or so retirees, and a few adventurous
young families hardy enough to endure isolation, low wages, and
long winters on Lake Huron. For working parents, a life on Bois
Blanc Island is just about the closest thing to the Oregon Trail
that still exists in late 20th-century America.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the paradox of the Pines School situation is not lost here.
Residents are discovering that when it comes to public education,
there is no getting away. Parents who left their roots and took up
new lives framed by forests and maritime vistas are waging the same
cheerless battle to keep their neighborhood school open that
parents in Detroit and Saginaw and Flint have been fighting for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a school, we stand no opportunity to attract young
people,'' said William Westcott, the Bois Blanc Township
supervisor, and a resident since 1989. ``We don't want to become
just a retiree center. We need young people on this island to make
a complete community.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to big-city school financing battles, which often
involve millions of dollars, what is also distinctive about the
struggle here is how little money is involved. Until 1993, most of
school financing in Michigan came from property taxes, and the Bois
Blanc school district paid its operating costs principally by
taxing owners of the 300 or so summer cottages on the island.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, though, Michigan changed the formula by slashing
property taxes, shifting the burden of financing education to a
higher sales tax, and setting a strict new district-by-district
rate for compensating school districts according to the number of
students they have.
</P>
<P>
   The change snared Bois Blanc Island in a financing trap it has
been unable to escape. The one-room school is the centerpiece of a
school district that has five students and costs $75,000 annually
to operate. Four students attend the Pines School at a cost of
$57,000, most of it for Mrs. White's $34,000 salary.
</P>
<P>
   The district also pays $18,000 to educate and pay boarding costs
for a high school student who attends school on the mainland in
Cheboygan, about six miles east across the straits.
</P>
<P>
   The district receives $14,356 in state and local money for each
student, or a total of $71,780. This year's deficit is roughly
$3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been operating this way since 1994,'' White said. ``We
just can't sustain these deficits much longer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   State lawmakers approved a provision this year in the $9.6
billion state education budget bill that guaranteed the Bois Blanc
school district money for six students, even though it has fewer.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. John Engler, a Republican who has just been elected to
his third term, used his line-item authority to veto the provision.
State officials, who declined to make statements on the record,
said privately that Engler did not want to pay for students that
did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The students at the Pines School said they were aware of the
dispute, and a little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Stitt, a 14-year-old in sixth grade, said he liked school
and did not want to move or have to be schooled at home by his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to get out of the house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Miranda Stitt, 6, said, ``I like my teacher.''

FINAL STARR REPORT MAY NOT COME UNTIL CLINTON'S TERM ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBBING penultimate graf)  (htv) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new indictment of Webster Hubbell, the longtime
friend of the Clintons, means that Kenneth Starr will almost
certainly remain in business as independent counsel through the
last months of President Clinton's term, and that a final report
may not be made public until after Clinton leaves the White House,
lawyers involved in the inquiry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before last week, the widespread impression was that Starr was
winding down his four-year inquiry. But the prosecution Friday of
Hubbell for Whitewater-related matters raises new issues that could
result in months of legal pretrial wrangling, a long trial and
possible appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Charles G. Bakaly III, Starr's spokesman, said Monday that it
would be impossible to say when a final report would be completed
and that it cannot be filed with the special court that oversees
independent counsels until the conclusion of the Hubbell cases and
other court action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot predict when it will end,'' Bakaly said. ``Once
matters are filed and go into the judicial arena, the timing is
outside of the control of the prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing raises the prospect of an independent counsel who has
spent years investigating conduct that has its origins in events
that occurred long before the President arrived in Washington, and
whose conclusions will not be known until after the president
leaves office _ and after the expiration of the independent counsel
law itself.
</P>
<P>
   It would also permit Starr, if he so chose, to follow the path
that is being pushed by some Republicans, like Sen. Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania, who have suggested that even if Clinton is not
impeached, he could still be prosecuted after leaving office. Starr
and his staff have never said whether it would be appropriate to
bring charges against the president after his term ends.
</P>
<P>
   Although some details of the Whitewater findings by Starr have
been made public over the years in trials and other court
appearances and papers, his conclusions about the role of the
Clintons and top officials in many aspects of the investigation
remain unknown. Starr is expected to provide some further details
about his inquiry when he appears before the House Judiciary
Committee on Thursday, but federal rules will sharply limit what he
can tell the lawmakers about much of the evidence provided to grand
juries. (There are no such limitations about what he writes in a
final report.)
</P>
<P>
   The sense that Starr was approaching the end of his work came in
part from the independent prosecutor himself. In his impeachment
report involving Monica Lewinsky, Starr told Congress that ``all
phases of the investigation are now nearing completion.'' His
office, Starr said, ``will soon make final decisions about what
steps to take, if any, with respect to the other information it has
gathered.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr had completed his use of grand juries in Arkansas. And he
had shown no signs of bringing any prosecutions arising from his
investigations of the dismissal of the White House travel office or
the improper compilation of hundreds of FBI files by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In court proceedings, Starr's moves did not appear likely to
open vast new areas of inquiry. He had filed a routine appeal of
his defeat in the criminal tax case he had brought against Hubbell.
And he had obtained a new indictment against Susan McDougal, one of
the Clintons' Whitewater partners, on criminal contempt charges
although there was no expectation that she would reverse her years
of refusing to answer grand jurors' questions. That case is
expected to be tried soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the newest criminal indictment against Hubbell brings the
sprawling inquiry back to its Whitewater roots and refers in
considerable detail to the role of Hillary Rodham Clinton, one of
Hubbell's partners in the Rose Law Firm, in a fraudulent land deal.
It may require Hillary Clinton's appearance in the witness box. And
it will take until at least the end of next year before the case
can be concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt from all of our experiences that it takes a
year or more to bring a criminal case,'' said John Bates, a former
deputy to Starr who is now in private practice. And, he and others
said, it could take at least six months for the federal court that
oversees the independent counsel to sort out the legal issues that
surround the public release of a final report.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starr's allies see the protracted nature of the inquiry as a
by-product of two things: the continual expansion of the
independent counsel's charter by the attorney general and the
repeated obfuscation and stonewalling by senior officials in the
Clinton administration. But his detractors say he has moved too
slowly, and that there was no reason why he could not have brought
the new Hubbell case many months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Hubbell stemmed from criminal referrals that
had been made by regulators at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
and the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency that supervised the
bailout of the savings and loan industry.
</P>
<P>
   It charges Hubbell with engaging in a longstanding scheme to
defraud the two agencies by concealing the nature of involvement by
himself, his father-in-law and Hillary Clinton in a land deal that
was later found by regulators to have been fraught with corruption.
Although Hillary Clinton is not accused of any crimes in the
indictment, she is described as having played an important role in
preparing legal papers that investigators say were central to the
fraud. She has said that she does not recall preparing the papers
and that in any event she did not know at the time that the deal
was improper.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been assigned to James Robertson, the same federal
district judge who earlier this year chastised Starr and dismissed
the tax case that he had tried to make against Hubbell.

IN DEFIANCE OF REFORMS, CRIME RISES IN MEXICO CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ At the beginning of this month, the Mexico City
government turned over control of the police to civilian officials
and announced a war on crime. Since then, the Mexico City police
chief announced Monday with great annoyance, the violent-crime rate
has soared 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? The capital's gang chiefs are waging a war of their
own to show who is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who control crime in this city sent out their
flunkies to increase the crime rate in a brutal way, to signal that
they are not willing to accept any systematic control over their
activities,'' the chief, Alejandro Gertz Manero, said at a hastily
summoned news conference where he spoke with the urgency of a field
commander summoning the citizenry to arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organized thugs and their likely accomplices inside our force
have declared war on this society,'' said Gertz, a former
university rector who took over the police force two months ago.
``I told every one of our commanders that the criminals' challenge
is intolerable. We cannot put up with it one minute more.''
</P>
<P>
   Gertz said he told the 54 city precinct commanders that he
expects a clear decline in crime in coming weeks and will fire any
one of them who fails to meet this goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City residents are already so beleaguered by rampant
muggings, break-ins and car thefts that they hardly noticed the
sharp increase in these crimes last week. But police figures from
Nov. 5 to 11 showed that 2,962 violent crimes were reported in the
city, up one-quarter from the week before. In one case, a woman was
mugged and beaten at the main entrance to city police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Gertz enacted reforms more radical than any tried
before. He gave control of the police to civilian officials who
head the city's 16 boroughs. For the first time, Gertz forced all
officers to punch time clocks.
</P>
<P>
   He fired 16 chiefs in high-crime precincts and created local
civilian review boards and citizen hot lines to monitor police
conduct. He also imposed competitive bidding for all contracts to
supply uniforms, motorcycles, helicopters and stoplights.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they believe the combined program brought
tight new monitoring of officers' movements and cut deeply into
criminal bosses' ability to command local police squads.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Interior Minister Francisco Labastida announced
the creation of a new 10,000-troop national police force to take
the place of the notorious ``federales,'' the catch-all word in
Spanish for the federal highway, immigration and customs police.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the old federal police will be subjected to drug and
psychological tests as well as a criminal background check, and
only those who pass will be admitted to the new force.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the current federal police ``absolutely insufficient,''
Labastida said that 94 percent of all violent crimes reported in
Mexico are never solved or prosecuted.

JUSTICES REJECT APPEALS IN 2 CASES INVOLVING CAMPAIGN FINANCING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Ohio, Fla., Ill.) (jw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday sidestepped the issue
of campaign finance, turning down appeals in cases from Ohio and
Arkansas that questioned the constitutionality of limits on
campaign spending and contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The justices made no comment in rejecting the appeals, one of
which had been closely watched as a possible vehicle for the
court's reconsideration of its 1976 precedent, Buckley vs. Valeo.
The court's equation in that landmark case of campaign spending
with free speech has posed an enormous obstacle to controlling the
flow of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   While it is possible to read the court's action on Monday as a
signal that the justices are not interested in addressing a problem
that many people blame them for having created, that is not the
only possible explanation. The court may be waiting to see how a
range of lower courts handle the issue, or the justices may have
concluded that there is no obvious answer that is consistent with
their expansive views of the First Amendment in the context of
campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of one of Monday's cases, City of Cincinnati vs.
Kruse, No. 98-454, was a 1995 city ordinance that placed a cap on
spending in City Council elections of three times a council
member's annual salary, a current limit of $140,000. The U.S.
District Court and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, both in
Cincinnati, declared the limit unconstitutional under Buckley vs.
Valeo.
</P>
<P>
   In appealing to the Supreme Court, the National Voting Rights
Institute, a Boston-based advocacy group working to change election
laws and a group that handled the legal defense of the ordinance,
argued that enough time had passed since the Buckley ruling for the
court to discern the error of its ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ruling forever closing the door to the lessons of
governmental experience with unlimited campaign spending runs
contrary to the constitutional responsibilities of this court,''
the brief said. Attorneys general from 26 states filed a separate
brief asking the justices to take the case.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of the second case was a set of notably low
contribution limits adopted by Arkansas voters in a 1996
referendum, as part of an overhaul of the state's campaign laws
that also included a $50 income tax credit for political
contributions. Contribution limits were reduced from $1,000 to $300
for statewide offices and from $1,000 to $100 for judicial
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the limits
earlier this year as being ``too low to allow meaningful
participation in protected speech and association.'' The appeals
court, which sits in St. Louis, noted that the Supreme Court in
Buckley vs. Valeo had upheld limits of $1,000 on contributions to
federal campaigns. But the 8th Circuit said that the $100 and $300
limits in 1998 were so low as to be different not just in degree
but in kind from the $1,000 limits that were upheld 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The court acted in dozens of other cases Monday, including
these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Car search: The court, accepting an appeal filed by the state
of Florida, agreed to decide whether police need a warrant to seize
and search a car under a state forfeiture law that authorizes
police to take possession of vehicles that have been used to commit
drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Florida vs. White, No. 98-223, the police had
videotaped a car being used to deliver cocaine. Acting under
Florida's Contraband Forfeiture Act, which authorizes the seizure
of a car based on probable cause to believe it has been used to
facilitate illegal drug activity, the police went to the owner's
office, took control of the car in the parking lot, and found crack
cocaine in the ashtray during a search.
</P>
<P>
   The owner objected unsuccessfully in the lower state courts to
the warrantless search and seizure. But the Florida Supreme Court,
in a 5-2 decision earlier this year, ruled that in the absence of
``exigent circumstances'' such as the danger of imminent flight or
destruction of evidence, police need a warrant despite the
forfeiture law's apparent authority to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot accept the government's position that it may
act at anytime, anywhere, and regardless of the existence of
exigent circumstances,'' the state court said, ``to seize a
citizen's property once believed to have been used in illegal
activity, without securing the authorization of a neutral
magistrate.'' The court added: ``Any inconvenience to the
government pales in comparison to the consequences for our justice
system and constitutional order if such abuses are left
unchecked.''
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, Florida told the justices that the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over federal cases
in Florida, had reached the opposite conclusion in a separate case,
making it urgent for the Supreme Court to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prisoner appeal: The court accepted an appeal by the state of
Illinois on whether a state inmate seeking to challenge his
conviction in federal court can present arguments that he failed to
make earlier in a petition for review to the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, inmates seeking federal court review, through a
petition for a writ of habeas corpus, are deemed to have forfeited
aspects of their case that they did not make first to the state
courts. But in this case, reviewing the 22-year-old rape conviction
of an Illinois inmate, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held
that this doctrine requiring ``exhaustion of state remedies''
should not be applied literally in the context of an appeal to the
Illinois Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   That court, like the U.S. Supreme Court and most state high
courts, has discretion over the cases it hears and expects those
seeking review to select and present only their best arguments.
Consequently, it would be unfair and ``would turn federalism on its
head,'' the 7th Circuit said, to penalize an inmate for not having
raised every possible argument.
</P>
<P>
   While the issue in this case, O'Sullivan vs. Boerckel, No.
97-2048, is quite technical, the state's appeal could provide a
window into the court's thinking about habeas corpus, the method by
which state prisoners challenge their convictions and sentences in
federal court. The court, along with Congress, has cut back sharply
on the availability of habeas corpus, with the generally
conservative 7th Circuit indicating in this case that inmates
should retain some ability to navigate through the many procedural
obstacles.

STUDENTS ACCUSED OF PLOTTING MASS SLAYING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Wis. _ They were not considered serious
troublemakers, these five teen-agers. They had middle-class
upbringings in small-town southeastern Wisconsin. The few times
they did attract the attention of the authorities, it was for minor
infractions, ``just regular teen-age stuff,'' a police detective
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, police said that these five boys were plotting to
shoot and kill their high school principal, the assistant
principal, a teacher, a police officer stationed in the school and
as many as 20 students.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, police, tipped to the suspected plot, arrested
the five boys _ two freshman, two sophomores and a junior, all 15
or 16 years old. Three of them appeared in juvenile court Monday
and were ordered held on charges of conspiracy to commit murder.
The other two, who told the police they had backed out of the plan,
were released to their parents, but prosecutors said they might
also face charges.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chilling scheme that seemed to have scant motivation,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazingly, what they said was that these are just kids they
didn't like,'' said Assistant Police Chief Gary Large. ``When we
tried to pressure them further on that, they said, `No, we just
didn't like them.' Why didn't you like them? `It's because they
picked on us, because they made fun of us in the past, and
therefore we've targeted them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Currents of fear and disbelief ran through Burlington, a town of
about 9,200 people some 25 miles southwest of Milwaukee, ringed by
gently rolling dairy and corn farms, where a sign at the start of
Main Street informs visitors that they are entering ``Chocolate
City, U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   But police and school administrators Monday described the plot
as an elaborate plan, one that in some ways seemed eerily similar
to the shootings last year at a middle school in Jonesboro, Ark. In
that case, two boys tripped the school's fire alarm so that their
classmates and teachers would be forced to leave the building, and
then they gunned down four students and a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Mike Wiskes said that the teen-agers, whom he declined
to name, had planned to take rifles, shotguns and handguns that
belonged to the father of one of the boys. At the last minute,
however, that teen-ager backed out of the scheme, leaving the rest
looking for other ways to get weapons, Wiskes said.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Peterson, the assistant principal of Burlington High
School, who was apparently one of the people the teen-agers told
the police they planned to kill, said that the plan called for the
teen-agers to take him hostage at gunpoint and force him to
announce an emergency code over the loudspeaker that would instruct
teachers to keep all students inside their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of one of the teen-agers, who said he had been told
about the plot at a party on Friday night, said the group intended
to force Principal Jose Martinez and other administrators to
provide the class schedules for between 15 and 20 students.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, David Carroll, a 15-year-old sophomore, said the
teen-ager told him, ``We're going to go into the office, get Dr.
Martinez, and then we're going to hold him hostage, and then we're
going to have someone get the schedules for the kids that they
wanted to kill and then we're going to bring them down to the
office and shoot them all.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll also said, as did prosecutors Monday, that the group had
described the plan as a ``suicide mission,'' figuring that they
would get caught and killed or jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he was not sure that his friend was serious about
the plot, but just in case, he told another friend not to go to
school on Monday. Carroll described his friend, a sophomore, as an
intelligent, but somewhat troubled youth who had had some violent
fights with his parents in the past and was about to be sent to a
foster home in another town.
</P>
<P>
   Wiskes said that the plot was hatched on Thursday night, and
that the police received a tip about it on Saturday night.
According to Carroll, the teen-agers told some of their girlfriends
and other students of the plan so that they would not be at school
that day. He said that a girlfriend of one of the teen-agers told
her parents and they called the police.
</P>
<P>
   Wiskes said that two of the teen-agers had been in trouble with
the law before, and were now on juvenile probation, one for
misdemeanor theft and one for misdemeanor disorderly conduct. He
called these violations ``just regular teen-age stuff.'' He added
that ``some of them had family problems, but not all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant district attorney Richard Barta said Monday that his
office might seek to charge the three teen-agers as adults and
might also seek to prosecute the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Wiskes and several students at the school described the
teen-agers, all of whom lived in or just outside of Burlington, as
a loose group of friends who generally stuck to themselves and were
absorbed with punk music. A few of the five were considered
``Goths,'' youngsters who wear black, paint their nails and listen
to the dark, screeching rock music of Marilyn Manson.
</P>
<P>
   Vikki Hatch, a sophomore who said she was a friend of the five,
said they were part of a group known in school as ``the freaks''
and ``the Satan worshipers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiskes said that one of the youths was carrying a copy of ``the
Devil's bible'' when he was arrested, but he and Vikki Hatch both
said the teen-agers were not believed to be heavily into Satanic
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Vikki Hatch and other students said the group was teased by
other cliques, one of them called the ``preps'' and the other known
as the ``hillbillies'' or the ``hicks.''
</P>
<P>
   School administrators planned to meet Tuesday night with
parents. Martinez and School Superintendent Ron Jandura sent
parents a note assuring them that the five teen-agers were either
in jail or suspended, and would not be in school Tuesday.

UNIVERSITY WILL REOPEN CLOCK TOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After being closed 23 years ago because of a
series of suicides, the observation deck of the 307-foot clock
tower at the University of Texas will be reopened to the public,
perhaps by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The university announced last week that it would reopen the
tower, which is better known as the site of a shooting 32 years ago
that left 14 people dead and 31 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The tower, which is part of the university's Main Building, is
one of the tallest structures in Austin. Since the tower was
completed in 1937, nine people have jumped to their deaths from the
observation deck, which was closed in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, 1966, Charles Whitman, a student at the university,
barricaded himself on the observation deck and began shooting
passers-by with a rifle. At the time, the shooting was the United
States' worst mass killing. It lasted 93 minutes, ending with
Whitman's being killed by the police, but its aftereffects have
spanned two generations.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, a former marine who killed his wife and his mother the
night before the tower shootings, has been the subject of a movie,
and many magazine and newspaper articles have been written about
Whitman and the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas offers a course that examines the impact
of Whitman's deeds, and bullet holes made by police officers
returning Whitman's fire can still be seen in the tower's facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tower is a symbol of a premier university and a very
tragic event all at the same time,'' said Gary Lavergne, the author
of a book about the shootings, ``Sniper in the Tower'' (UNT Press,
1997). ``I can't think of another building or structure that has
such a dual meaning to so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavergne, who supports the decision to reopen the tower, said
the 1966 shootings ``introduced us to the modern concept of what is
now called simultaneous mass murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The tower gives a commanding view of the campus and the city of
Austin, and student groups have periodically sought to have the
observation deck reopened. Last Thursday, the university's board of
regents agreed to spend about $500,000 to install iron barriers to
deter suicides and to make the observation deck accessible to
people with disabilities. Renovations are expected to be completed
in time for spring graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, security personnel will accompany visitors to
the observation deck. The university also plans to charge tower
visitors an admission fee of $6 each.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the university president, Larry Faulkner, called
the tower the ``most important symbol of academic aspiration and
achievement in Texas.'' He added that it is time to ``actively use
this icon of higher education in positive ways.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kara Burch, a senior, is eager to see Austin from the tower.
``It's pretty exciting,'' Ms. Burch said. ``There's been a lot of
debate about the tower on campus. Before I graduate, I will be able
to go up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Heard, an Austin resident who was wounded by Whitman in
1966, agrees with the decision to reopen the tower. Heard, an
Associated Press reporter when he was shot, said: ``We've been long
enough without the public being able to go up there. It's an idea
whose time has come.''

INCREASE IN TAXI ACCIDENTS LINKED TO CAR SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN and JOSH BARBANEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As taxi accidents have risen steadily in New York
City over the past decade, the most recognizable image of the
danger has been that of a yellow cab wrecked on a Manhattan
sidewalk, debris strewn about, perhaps a pedestrian pinned against
a light pole. But an analysis of newly released accident data shows
that car services and livery cabs are actually responsible for the
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times analysis of more than 100,000 accidents
reported to the state found that crashes involving livery vehicles
_ which include call-for-pickup car services, corporate ``black
cars,'' some commuter vans and vans for the handicapped _ increased
by 60 percent from 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The number of yellow-cab crashes in the city, the analysis
found, has dropped significantly since 1994 after rising during the
early '90s and is now only slightly above what it was at the start
of the decade. Serious injuries in yellow-cab accidents are down by
more than 20 percent since 1990, even including the rash of
disfiguring facial injuries caused by partitions affixed to the
driver's seat since they became standard equipment in yellow cabs
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The number of livery cars has increased significantly over that
period while the number of medallion cabs is up only slightly. On a
per-cab basis, livery-car accidents were still up 25 percent while
yellow-cab accidents were virtually the same in 1997 as in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis sheds light on an overlooked sector of the
transportation industry that does most of its business in the
boroughs outside Manhattan and that regulators have only recently
begun to take seriously, even though livery cars outnumber yellow
cabs more than three to one.
</P>
<P>
   The diverging trends had been hidden because the State
Department of Motor Vehicles lumps all vehicles for hire together
as ``taxis'' and because the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission
did not track accidents at all from 1990 until it passed a broad
package of new rules in May.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency turned down repeated requests from The Times
for data on individual accidents for eight months, saying that
generating the data would require an extensive computer run beyond
the requirements of the Freedom of Information Law. It finally
released the data last week, but still has not furnished it to the
taxi commission.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the only data available from the state showed
a 40 percent increase in accidents involving all ``taxis'' from
1990 to 1996. This, along with several high-profile yellow-cab
crashes, prompted a spate of news articles, including several in
The Times, and helped spur a crackdown by the city that included a
ticket-writing blitz against yellow cabs and much steeper fines and
insurance requirements for all kinds of taxis.
</P>
<P>
   But the trends are sharply different in various parts of the
city. In Manhattan south of 96th Street, where yellow cabs
predominate, accidents involving all ``taxis'' have increased 17
percent since 1990, although in recent years the numbers have
declined. But outside Manhattan, where yellow cabs are seldom seen
except at the airports, accidents involving all cars classified as
``taxis'' have increased by 53 percent since 1990. ``Taxi''
accidents in Brooklyn have jumped even more dramatically, by 81
percent over the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Experts and officials offered several possible explanations for
the accident pattern. Livery cars, which are only allowed to pick
up riders by prearrangement, have been far less regulated over the
years than yellow cabs, which can cruise for fares, and several
police and taxi commission initiatives during the '90s have applied
only to yellow cabs. And Bruce Schaller, a former regulator for the
taxi commission, has produced a study showing that the economic
boom of the last few years may have done more to increase wages for
yellow cabbies than for livery drivers, leading them, he concluded,
to drive less recklessly.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Pero, the president of the Livery Owners Coalition of New
York, said that much of the increase in livery accidents was due
simply to the increase in livery cars _ to about 41,000 in 1997, up
from about 32,000 in 1990, according to the commission. (There are
12,187 yellow cabs, up 400 since 1990.) But the increase in
accidents has outpaced the growth in the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The accident rate per car for yellow cabs is somewhat higher
than that for liveries, but most yellow cabs are driven round the
clock while most livery cars are driven less than 12 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the analysis was greeted with an
``I-told-you-so'' by yellow-cab executives, who, along with their
biggest insurer, American Transit Insurance Co., asserted for
months as they fought the new rules that yellow-cab accidents were
dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've been unfairly blamed and targeted,'' said Ronald
Sherman, president of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade,
which represents big fleet owners. ``We would hope that the TLC and
the city adjust their enforcement accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chairwoman of the taxi commission, Diane
McGrath-McKechnie, said the agency would not change course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a numbers game for the TLC,'' Ms.
McGrath-McKechnie said. ``This is about public safety. Whether the
numbers go up a little bit or down a little bit, there are still
too many accidents, and we need safe drivers for medallion cabs and
for livery vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   The police department, however, said it would consider cracking
down on livery cars. This spring, when attention was focused on
taxi dangers, a special police department unit that focuses on
yellow cabs stepped up its enforcement sharply; tickets written by
the unit rose 36 percent for the first eight months of this year
over the same period in 1997.

 QuadraMed Takes Turns for the Better, Soon May Be Picture
of  Health  By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The prognosis for QuadraMed looks pretty upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Since trading above $30 a share in July, the Richmond maker of
software for the health care industry saw its shares tumble along
with the rest of the market, scraping bottom at about $15 on
October 16. But like the rest of the pack, QuadraMed shares have
rebounded solidly and are bound to benefit from a spate of breaking
developments.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Friday's sudden resignation of a top executive at
one of QuadraMed's key competitors, HBO (no, not the cable
channel), adds to existing uncertainty at the Atlanta software
concern.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, QuadraMed is going to announce today that it has
cracked Deloitte &AMP; Touche's list of fastest-growing technology
companies. On top of that, a Wall Street analyst is expected later
this week to initiate coverage of the software-maker with a
positive rating.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's consider why confusion surrounding a competitor
might bode well for QuadraMed. HBO's immediate future is about as
clear as summer in the Sunset District. The Atlanta software-maker
is slated to be acquired by McKesson, but the ill-timed departure
of HBO's chief financial officer and co-president, Jay Gilbertson,
casts a dark cloud over a deal that investors already didn't like,
says a New York hedge fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this is a guy who McKesson wanted but not enough to
make him CFO of the combined company,'' the money manager says.
``Wall Street has been skeptical of this deal for sometime, and now
it has even more reason to be leery.''
</P>
<P>
   McKesson, of course, is the giant drug wholesaler that makes its
headquarters on Market Street. Critics of the HBO buyout wonder how
well McKesson's culture will mesh with that of a technology
company.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the short term, Gilbertson's departure injects more
uncertainty into the proposed buyout because top executives usually
stay on board until a transaction is closed. And even if the deal
goes through, skeptics wonder whether HBO will lose some of its
entrepreneurial edge as a division of the much bigger McKesson.
</P>
<P>
   Such doubts should give QuadraMed a marketing edge. Chief
financial officers at hospitals and medical groups that spend big
bucks to invest in information systems want to be able to sleep at
night, knowing that their software vendor will be around for a long
time to come.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, QuadraMed chief executive Jim Durham is quick to
point out to potential customers that HBO is in a limbo-like state
until the deal goes through. HBO ``is sort of existing in the land
of the living dead,'' Durham says.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, QuadraMed's profile should get a lift with today's
release of the Deloitte &AMP; Touche ``Fast 500'' list. QuadraMed will
be ranked 41 of 500 technology companies. The rankings are based on
the company's five-year percentage growth in revenues from 1993-97.
During that period, QuadraMed's revenues have ballooned nearly
8,000 percent to about $113 million. And while QuadraMed has been
on an acquisition binge _ buying about 24 companies during the past
five years _ the software-maker consistently grows organic revenues
(those not including recent acquisitions) at least 30 percent a
year, Durhams says.
</P>
<P>
   The company's growth story isn't falling on deaf ears. Several
Wall Street analysts now follow QuadraMed. A BT Alex. Brown analyst
reinstated the firm's coverage on Friday with a ``buy''
recommendation, and another research analyst is expected to
initiate coverage this week.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, investors don't always heed the all-too-optimistic
preachings of sell-side analysts. But when analysts initiate
coverage of companies, the stocks often get a short-term boost.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, savvy stock-pickers will notice that a hefty 2.4
million of QuadraMed's 19.3 million outstanding shares are being
sold short. And often, such heavy short interest signals that
investors are bearish on the stock. But not always.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of QuadraMed, many of the short-sellers also own
convertible bonds that the company sold last spring. (Convertibles
can be converted into common stock at a predetermined price.)
</P>
<P>
   Many hedge funds will invest in convertibles and partially
offset their positions by shorting the issuer's stock. In theory,
the short position would cover any possible losses on the
convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of QuadraMed's convertible bonds may not be
converted into stock until the company's share price hits $33.25,
interest in shorting the stock is likely to remain high until the
shares rise above that mark.

 NEW YORK: in 1997. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We have had focused enforcement on livery cabs and will
continue to do so,'' said Lt. Stephen Biegel, a police spokesman.
``We'll also review the data and see if a formal unit would be in
order.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said the commission's new rules, most of
which apply equally to yellow and livery cabs, should bring the two
industries into line with each other. And she said she planned to
call for votes at the next commission meeting on Thursday on the
two proposed rules that the commissioners balked at passing in May.
One would require all yellow-cab owners to post a $100,000 bond for
accident victims to collect against. The other would lower the
penalty-point threshold at which drivers lose their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Times analysis found that yellow-cab accidents reported to
the state increased from about 3,850 in 1990 to a peak of about
4,850 in 1994, then decreased to about 3,950 last year. Accidents
involving livery cars, which far outnumber yellow cabs, rose
steadily from about 6,300 in 1990 to about 9,050 in 1994 and 10,150
last year. The analysis used statistical methods to estimate the
distribution of accidents where data was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Serious injuries in livery accidents, including severe cuts,
broken bones, and other internal injuries also increased during the
decade, to about 800 in 1997 from 675 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, serious injuries in yellow cabs dropped
to about 350 in 1997 from about 450 in 1990. The Times analysis
found that in 1994, when the partitions became standard, the number
of yellow-cab accidents in which the most serious injury was to the
face or eye jumped dramatically, to 81 from 52. But those accidents
represent such a small portion of the total _ 2 or 3 percent _ that
the increase was swallowed up by the overall decrease. And by the
end of 1997, yellow-cab accidents in which the most serious injury
was to the face or eye had dropped below the 1990 level of 46, to
36, due at least in part to an aggressive campaign by the taxi
commission to get passengers to wear seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Del Valle, the chairman of the taxi commission from 1991
to 1995, said that until the new rules were passed, most of the
enforcement against livery cabs consisted of making sure the cars
were properly registered and were not cruising for fares. He said
that holders of livery licenses often allowed friends or relatives
to work their cars when they were not using them, whether or not
they had hack licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the recent rules,'' he said, ``there have been no real
rules as to the behavior of for-hire vehicle drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yellow cabs, meanwhile, have been held to a standard that,
whatever its shortcomings, has become more strict over the course
of the decade. In 1990, the commission began a persistent-violator
program for yellow cabs that has resulted in hundreds of
suspensions. In 1995, the police took over enforcement against
yellow cabs from taxi commission inspectors and began writing what
many yellow-cab drivers complained was a blizzard of nuisance
tickets for minor infractions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the commission passed a rule requiring owners to buy
new cabs every four years at most. Some livery drivers, Pero said,
keep their cars on the road for up to 15 years. ``I see cars on the
road in the livery industry that I'd be ashamed to put in my
fleet,'' said Pero, who runs a fleet of 42 car-service and black
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Pero agreed that regulation of liveries had been too lax, but
like many yellow-cab owners, he said that the commission and the
police had gone overboard since the new rules were passed in the
spring, and he said he was worried that it could get much harder
for him to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened in past administrations is that they haven't
corrected the industry,'' he said. ``The TLC hasn't protected the
public until now. But all of a sudden they implement this stuff on
both industries and it becomes chaotic.''

 New Levi's Ads Sport Hipper Jeans for Teens  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. yesterday unveiled its latest advertising and
marketing efforts designed to persuade teenagers to buy its jeans.
</P>
<P>
   New TV spots and outdoor ads feature urban youth wearing a
variety of clothing styles. The tag line, ``What's true,'' reflects
Levi's continuing effort to portray itself as a brand that people
can wear to express their individuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think kids conform at all anymore,'' said Sean Dee,
director of the Levi's brand. ``They want to wear brands that
express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign comes as Levi's prepares for a radical
departure from its focus on denim basics with the launch of trendy
jeans styles and khakis under its core Red Tab label.
</P>
<P>
   The new denim styles, which include flared legs and cargo pants,
will hit store shelves in early February. Khaki styles such as
pedal pushers will be introduced in early April.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco jeans-maker has launched several advertising
campaigns this year and actively marketed itself
through &UR;  &LR; sponsorships with musicians, the World Wide Web and direct
mail. But when potential customers go to stores, they often can't
find styles they want to wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said, `Hey, we like the ads, but get the
basics nailed,' '' said Sean Dee, Levi's brand director.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Dark denim ``hard jeans,'' which Levi's advertised heavily
earlier this year, were a good start, but customers want more
styles to choose from, Dee said.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in Levi's core Red Tab line, which traditionally has
had five pockets, straight legs and been made of denim, is expected
to drag down the company's net sales by 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales of Levi's trendy, teen-oriented Silver Tab and
L2 labels have jumped more than 300 percent, said Dee.
</P>
<P>
   But Red Tabs make up the vast majority of Levi's business. ``We
can talk about the success of Silver Tab, but until we see that
success in our basics line, we're just talking to ourselves,'' said
Dee.
</P>
<P>
   The move from basics to fashion has been a topic of heated
debate within Levi's, said a source close to the company who
declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   While newer employees argued that Levi's should be a style
leader, traditionalists ``just feel that fashion is not part of the
brand character,'' the source said. ``There has been no fashion
product in Red Tab, and that's dumb because that's where the
country is going.''
</P>
<P>
   For Baby Boomers who prefer the existing selection of Levi's,
the company will continue to make standby styles such as 501s.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Priority One is the youth market,'' said Dee. ``When Levi
Strauss has been its strongest was when we were a brand for young
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with its new fashion focus, Levi's is looking for broader
distribution in specialty stores frequented by teens.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, however, have found Levi's a difficult partner this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Factory closings have caused an unusual number of late and
incomplete shipments of key goods. And many merchants are unhappy
about Levi's decision to start selling merchandise over its Web
site  &LR; (www.levi.com). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dee acknowledged that distribution has been a ``challenge'' but
said problems have been ironed out for the holiday selling season.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's latest round of marketing includes, for the first time, a
special line of clothing that will star in a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Danes and other actors will wear ultra-trendy Levi's
clothes in a movie based on the old Mod Squad television series
that will be released next year. Levi's will turn those clothes
into a consumer line and sell them over the Web and in some stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new TV ads and bus-shelter posters feature
teenagers filmed on city streets. The TV spots feature unscripted
conversations with the teens and the tag line ``What's True.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's also is launching a global educational campaign about
AIDS prevention in partnership with MTV, the Joint United Nations
Programme on AIDS and the nonprofit Population Services
International.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you will see for the brand moving forward is a richer
personality,'' said Dee. ``Levi's is broaching the AIDS issue
because the reality is that kids today care about a lot more than
just jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS campaign features a perky cartoon character called
Condom Man. Levi's and MTV also will sponsor ``Safer Sexmobiles''
that will distribute condoms in the United States and developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   All of the ads were created by the San Francisco office of TBWA
Chiat/Day.

 Huge College Tax Break  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Financing a college education will become much easier for many
Californians under a bountiful but scantily publicized, investment
program slated to begin operating next year.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Scholarshare program, created by the California
Legislature and administered by the state government, is like a
nondeductible IRA for college savings, but with more generous
limits.
</P>
<P>
   You probably will be able to contribute far more than the $2,000
annual limit imposed on IRAs. The state hasn't named a figure yet,
but you might be able to put in as much as $100,000 per child _
either up front or in stages.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it won't matter what your income is, as it does
with IRAs: You will be able to contribute the maximum amount
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback of the program is that you won't be able to manage
the money yourself, as you can with an IRA. All the funds will be
pooled and managed by an investment firm to be chosen by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Dithridge, chief administrator of Scholarshare, says the
state is still deciding which investment manager to choose. Student
accounts will be opened at some unspecified time next year.
</P>
<P>
   With Scholarshare, parents, grandparents or any other member of
a prospective college student's family can open and contribute to a
tax-sheltered education account from the moment the child is born.
</P>
<P>
   There is no tax deduction up front, but all dividends, interest
and capital gains will compound free of federal and state income
taxes until the money is withdrawn to pay for the student's
education.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, any investment gains included in the withdrawn
funds will be taxed as ordinary income at the student's tax rate _
presumably a low one.
</P>
<P>
   Although Scholarshare will be limited to students who live in
California, they can use the program to attend a public or private
college in any state.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarshare will transfer funds from the student's account
directly to the college, and the money can be used to cover not
only tuition, but also room and board and other educational
expenses, such as books.
</P>
<P>
   The person who contributes to the account will retain legal
ownership of the money until it is tapped for college expenses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Contributors to Scholarshare will be able to take money out of
an account any time before the child goes to college. They can even
cancel the account at whim and take all the money back, but they
will have to pay taxes on the investment gains as well as a penalty
_ size not yet determined.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the original beneficiary doesn't go to college, the
account can be switched to another member of the family without
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   If there is still money in the account after the student
graduates, it can be transferred to another Scholarshare account to
benefit a sibling or other close relative of the student. Or, the
contributor can cancel the account, take back the remaining money
and pay taxes and a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   If Scholarshare looks appealing to you, you might want to
consider selling some of your current investments that aren't
tax-deferred, so you will have the money ready to contribute when
the program opens for business.
</P>
<P>
   If you currently have an investment that is worth less than you
paid, for example, you might want to sell it and nail down the
capital loss to offset income and reduce your tax bill. Talk it
over with your tax adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature has decreed that Scholarshare funds can be
invested in a broad range of U.S. investment vehicles: stocks,
mutual funds, money-market funds, government debt and corporate
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Experts figure that Scholarshare's manager will adopt a prudent,
middle-of-the-road investment strategy that produces annual returns
of 8 percent to 10 percent over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   That would conflict with the advice of most financial advisers,
who urge parents to invest college funds in aggressive growth
stocks. While Scholarshare's tax-deferred compounding is a
significant advantage, the advantage could be offset by relatively
slow growth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Danville financial planner Richard DelMonte predicts that many
parents will balk at Scholarshare because they can't pick the
investments themselves and because the returns are likely to be
only moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature created Scholarshare early this year in response
to a little-noticed provision in the federal Taxpayer Relief Act of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The act _ best-known for creating the popular Roth IRA _
authorized all the states to set up tax-deferred education
programs, subject to uniform federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The college programs are known as ``529 plans'' _ a reference to
the section of the federal law that created them.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half the states have taken steps to create 529 plans,
but only about a half-dozen have them up and running. Most of the
plans now operating have set a limit of around $100,000 total per
child for all contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, where a 529 plan has been operating since
July, people opening a new account can contribute up to $100,311.
They can do it all at once, or in stages.
</P>
<P>
   Contributors won't have to remove the surplus if investment
gains push the value of the account above the limit, but they will
be forbidden to make additional contributions.
</P>
<P>
   However, the limit will be adjusted each year to take into
account increases in education costs, says Abram Claude, a vice
president of Fidelity Investments, which manages the New Hampshire
program.
</P>
<P>
   Claude says $100,311 represents a simple average of the current
cost of getting a degree at Dartmouth _ one of New Hampshire's most
expensive private colleges _ and at the University of New
Hampshire, the leading public institution.
</P>

Student Aid Commission's Web site at

 There's Something New at Comdex  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost and Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Las Vegas
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Who says there isn't anything new at Comdex?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  On the cavernous, cacophonous show floor, jaded computer
industry types mutter that they've seen it all before. In
Panasonic's massive 14,400-square-foot booth, however, Jukka
Hamalainen, 67, is as animated as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Hamalainen, president of Panasonic's digital television
laboratories in Burlington, N.J., is finally seeing the fruition of
13 years of work, with this month's U.S. debut of HDTV broadcasts
in some cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting a new industry,'' Hamalainen said. ``There is
no precedent. We are trying to guess the marketplace. The
marketplace has tremendous wisdom, but it moves in its own ways.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly an open question whether the public will want
what Hamalainen is offering. Panasonic is showing off a terminal
that will bring high-definition television to a PC. Developed along
with Compaq Computer, the device will cost upwards of $1,000, and
it should reach the public next year.
</P>
<P>
   Will people want to watch television on their computer? With new
HDTV sets costing several thousand dollars, that may be a viable
option, Hamalainen said. ``They may want to start with this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He proudly pointed to the screen, which displayed sharp images
of John Glenn's recent journey to the stars. ``The proof is in the
pudding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Shutting the Gates. &LR;  One of the more surreal moments of
Comdex's opening night came after Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates
delivered his keynote speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gates made a brief appearance at a small party Microsoft put on
for the press in the Las Vegas Hilton, where Elvis Presley's
exclusive eight-year run is honored with a statue to the King at
the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   While at the party, Gates was surrounded by a mob of
journalists, perhaps hoping for some pithy snippet, or maybe a
reprise of a scene at last year's Comdex, when the richest man in
the country boogied down.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gates made a swift exit, and the reporters tried to
follow. When they got to the door, however, Microsoft employees
kept them from following Gates into the casino.
</P>
<P>
   No one could see if he headed for the pricey baccarat rooms or
the $2 blackjack tables.
</P>
<P>
   It was believed to be the first time anyone was physically
barred from entering a casino.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Viva Brazil. &LR;  A consortium of Brazilian software companies set
up shop at Comdex, trying to penetrate the lucrative U.S. market.
The consortium, known as Softex, plans to open an office in San
Francisco early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps this is the most important business in the world
today,'' said Djalma Petit, who heads Softex's center in the state
of Brasilia. ``There's a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to drumming up business, the Brazilians also learn a
few things about the American high-technology business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a war among the hardware companies _ digital cameras,
handheld PCs, flat monitors,'' Petit said. ``They're making heavy
investments to get market share. This kind of thinking impresses us
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Clairvoyance. &LR;  One crowd pleaser being talked about on the
Comdex floor  &LR; Monday  &LR; was ClearType, a product Microsoft is working
on to make typeface seen on a computer screen less fuzzy and more
like type found in a printed book.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft researcher Bill Hill said he has developed software to
fine-tune the pixel resolution of electronic typefaces, making them
three times clearer than what's currently available.
</P>
<P>
   He compared it to someone who is painting the Mona Lisa with a
paint roller being given a brush for the first time. The
development will help electronic bookmakers and become a sight for
sore eyes for everyday computer users.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Boxing the Internet. &LR;  One of the hottest product lines at
Comdex is the ``Internet in a box'' _ software that gives small
businesses and home based businesses everything they need to get on
the Internet to sell their wares, said analyst Frank Dzubeck,
president of Communications Network Architects.
</P>
<P>
   At the show are some 500 vendors showing Net-in-the box
software, which include security firewalls, that you can load into
a PC and turn it into a server, Dzubec said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sell Beanie Babies or whatever you want to do on the
Web,'' Dzubeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Such products will become increasingly important as even small
mom-and-pop grocery stores reach out to customers who will become
used to buying items through the Web, analysts said during a
preshow briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to buy over the Web _ click, click, click _ and
have something delivered to your door, that's very addictive,''
said analyst Cheryl Currid.

 Amazon Expands For the Holidays  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Online bookseller Amazon.com is opening up an Internet boutique,
just in time for the holiday shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, shoppers who go to Amazon.com for the latest
best-seller will have the option of sticking around to buy a
PalmPilot, a digital camera or even a Barbie doll. The Seattle
merchant is expanding _ for the holiday season only _ to offer
toys, games and electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Amazon.com will redesign its site to permanently add
more than 60,000 video titles to its product line.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Analysts said the move could help Amazon _ which hasn't yet
turned a profit _ go into the black sooner. ``It's all about
establishing long-term relationships with Internet shoppers,'' said
Jae Kim, an analyst at Paul Kagan &AMP; Associates in Carmel. Winning
online customers is expensive, but Amazon.com can profit by holding
onto customers and persuading them to buy more on the site, Kim
said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com first moved beyond books in June, when it started
selling music CDs on its site. Within three months of the launch,
music sales topped $14 million, putting Amazon.com ahead of rivals
CDNow and Music Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The wider expansion beginning today had been expected since
August, when Amazon.com made two purchases, Junglee Corp. and
PlanetAll, that it said would help turn it into an Internet
shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Junglee, formerly located in Sunnyvale, makes a database
software program that lets Internet surfers comparison shop.
PlanetAll provides a Web-based address book, calendar and reminder
service to 1.5 million subscribers. At the time, Amazon.com said it
planned to use the technologies to personalize the shopping
experience and to make it possible to buy practically anything at
its site.
</P>
<P>
   But Amazon.com spokesman Bill Curry said yesterday the holiday
store does not use the Junglee or PlanetAll technologies and is not
intended to turn the bookseller into an Internet Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Among items Amazon.com will sell in its gift shop are Dilbert
dolls, Motorola Walkie Talkies, Nintendo video games, Panasonic DVD
players and Sony Walkman stereos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a select list of gifts our customers have told us
they're interested in,'' Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   The online shop will include services such as free batteries and
a gift matcher to help shoppers pick their holiday purchases.

 Books Every Investor Must Have On the Shelf  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I would like to learn as much as possible to
successfully invest in stocks. Could you recommend some books as a
must read? I have already read ``A Random Walk Down Wall Street,''
by Burton Malkiel; ``The Intelligent Investor,'' by Benjamin
Graham; ``Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits,'' by Philip Fisher;
and ``One Up on Wall Street,'' by Peter Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You have made an excellent start! All those books
belong on anyone's list of stock-market classics.
</P>
<P>
   As you must have noticed, not all the market gurus agree on
investment strategy. Malkiel, for example, considers it futile to
try beating the market averages over the long term, while Lynch,
former manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, insists _ many would
say proved _ that it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other must-reads, in no particular order:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Battle for Investment Survival,'' by Gerald M. Loeb, a
leading apostle of in-and-out trading. The book was first published
in the 1930s, before long-term investing became the nearly
universal mantra.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Money Game,'' by ``Adam Smith'' (pseudonym). A hilarious
contemporary account of the frothy 1960s stock market.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Education of a Speculator,'' by Victor Niederhoffer, a
contrarian's account of his career _ and perhaps the most brilliant
work ever written by an investment professional. But beware: He got
wiped out in the futures market last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Reminiscences of a Stock Operator,'' by Edwin Lefevre, a
lightly fictionalized biography of Jesse Livermore, the notorious
speculator and market manipulator of the early 20th century. An
engrossing look at the seamy side.
</P>
<P>
   No-Dividend Stocks
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently bought stock in a company that doesn't pay a
dividend. When do stocks begin paying dividends?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Sometimes never _ but that's not necessarily bad.
</P>
<P>
   A dividend is a portion of the company's net income distributed
to shareholders rather than plowed back into the business. If
companies don't pay dividends, they can use the money instead to
make acquisitions, develop new markets and beef up their
operations. That could lead to stronger earnings and a higher stock
price.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. has never paid a dividend. But shareholders who
bought it 10 years ago at less than 2 percent of its present price
aren't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Wash-Sale Rules
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: What are the rules governing a wash sale? If I sell stock
at a loss, can I buy it again within 30 days?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: You can buy or sell any time you want _ but you should be
aware of the tax consequences. A lot of people stumble into the
wash-sale trap without realizing it, particularly when stocks are
fluctuating wildly, as they have this year.
</P>
<P>
   If you sell a stock at a loss, then buy back the same number of
shares of the same company within 30 days, you temporarily forfeit
the right to claim a tax loss on the sale, says Internal Revenue
Service spokesman Jesse Weller. The sale must be reported on your
tax form, but as a ``wash'' _ no gain, no loss.
</P>
<P>
   You can eventually _ and indirectly _ claim the loss on your
taxes, but not until you sell the shares you bought back. When you
do, you can add the size of the loss from the first sale to the
cost basis of the bought-back shares.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you sell 100 shares of Company XYZ at a $1,000
loss, then buy 100 shares two weeks later. Eventually, you sell the
bought-back shares for a $2,000 gain.
</P>
<P>
   You can't claim a tax loss when you make the first sale. But you
can add the $1,000 loss from the first set of shares to the cost
basis for the second set, reducing your taxable gain on the second
sale to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The wash-sale restriction may also apply if you change the order
of the transactions. You own, say, 100 shares of a stock on which
you show a loss, and you buy 100 more shares, then sell the
original 100 within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem a clever way to claim an immediate capital loss
without a net change in your holdings. But the tax man has ruled
that here too you have made a wash sale. You can't claim the loss
on the first 100 shares until you sell the second 100. Then you
follow the standard procedure, adding the loss on sale No.1 to the
cost basis for sale No.2.
</P>
<P>
   If you sell a stock and then buy back fewer shares than you
sold, the rules are more lenient.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you sell 200 shares at a loss, then buy back 100
shares within 30 days, you can claim the capital loss on 100
shares. The loss on the other 100 will remain in limbo until you
sell the second set of shares.

 How Scholarshare Stacks Up Against UTMA  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Until now, parents saving for college have normally found it
advantageous to put the money in the child's name, in a
tax-sheltered Uniform Transfer to Minors Account.
</P>
<P>
   The new Scholarshare accounts may be better for many parents,
especially those with large amounts of money to set aside.
</P>
<P>
   With UTMA, contributions to the child's account belong
irrevocably to the child, although under California law the parent
can control how the funds are used until the child reaches age 18
(or age 21 if the parent chooses that option when the the account
is opened). The funds can be used for college or other uses that
benefit the child, such as summer camp, orthodontia or travel
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; With Scholarshare, the funds belong to the parent until they
are tapped for college expenses. But they can only be used for
college. Parents can take the money back if the child doesn't go to
college, but if they do so, they must pay taxes on the earnings, as
well as a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   With UTMA, the child may qualify for less or no financial aid
because the account is in the child's name. Federal financial aid
formulas require students to use 35 percent of their assets per
year for college expenses before federal aid kicks in. Parents are
only required to chip in 5.6 percent of their assets.
</P>
<P>
   With Scholarshare, students may qualify for more aid because the
money in the student's account technically belongs to the parent.
However, federal authorities haven't yet ruled whether the money
will be considered the parent's or the child's for financial-aid
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   With UTMA, the first $700 of earnings are tax-free, while the
next $700 are taxed at the child's tax rate. Earnings beyond that
are taxed at the parent's rate until the child reaches age 14.
After that, they are taxed at the child's rate.
</P>
<P>
   With Scholarshare, earnings are allowed to compound free of
federal and state taxes until they are used for college expenses.
Then they are taxed only at the child's tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   Those provisions give Scholarshare an edge over UTMA.
</P>
<P>
   But there are drawbacks to Scholarshare as well.
</P>
<P>
   With Scholarshare, you aren't allowed to manage the assets
yourself. That task will be performed by a professional
money-management firm chosen by the state.
</P>
<P>
   With UTMA, you can manage the assets yourself.

DEMOCRATS ELECT TEXAN TO NO. 3 LEADERSHIP SPOT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Martin Frost of Dallas moved up a notch in the
House Democratic leadership ranks Tuesday after his colleagues
elected him as their conference chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Frost, a moderate who as head of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee helped his party add five new seats in this
year's elections, beat out the more liberal Rep. Rosa DeLauro of
Connecticut for leader of the 211-member conference.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of 108-97 put the Texan in the No. 3 Democratic
leadership spot behind Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri
and Minority Whip David Bonior of Michigan. Both Gephardt and
Bonior were unanimously re-elected to their top posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we'll have (a Texan) in the top
leadership ranks since Jim Wright was speaker,'' said Rep. Gene
Green of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Texans hold high-ranking positions in GOP leadership,
pending the result of elections on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, is running unopposed to
keep his job as the House's top vote counter. House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, R-Irving, is also running for re-election, but he faces
tough challenges from Republican Reps. Jennifer Dunn of Washington
and Steve Largent of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois has also been mentioned as a
possible dark horse candidate for the job, who could satisfy both
conservative and moderate GOP members who want Armey replaced as
the No. 2 House leader.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference following his election, Frost said he ran
for the job of conference chairman ``on the basis that we have to
include everyone _ liberals, moderates and conservatives _ in the
development of policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that it is ``critical'' that the Democrats ``occupy the
political middle as we head into the campaign year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the Republicans, the Democratic leadership elections
were downright dull. Instead of turmoil within the ranks and
behind-the-scenes maneuvering and rumor-mongering, the
Frost-DeLauro contest was more like a lovefest. Neither candidate
spoke ill of the other, and when the balloting was over the
Democrats held a celebratory rally on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our unity now that we believe can give us a leg up on
our Republican counterparts as we head into the next Congress,''
Gephardt told reporters afterward. ``And unlike the House
Republicans, we haven't had to spend a great deal of time engaging
in a post-election postmortem of failed strategies. We haven't
spent time papering over a gaping ideological divide within our
caucus. Unlike the Republicans, we gain strength from our
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   As head of congressional fund-raising and candidate recruitment
efforts, Frost has helped the party regain a total of 14 seats it
lost to the Republicans in the 1994 elections. The Democrats need
to pick up only six seats in 2000 to win back control of Congress.

THEY CALL GATES BET-A-HUNDRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft antitrust trial drones on in Washington. But the
main figure in the case, BILL GATES, the chairman of Microsoft, was
living it up 2,091 miles away, in Las Vegas, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   As a low roller.
</P>
<P>
   Gates played blackjack with $25 chips at the $50-minimum
blackjack table in the Bellagio Hotel on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellagio, the recently opened $1.8 billion hotel, has
private gambling rooms for high rollers (``whales,'' gamblers call
them). But Gates, wearing a rumpled blue shirt and blue slacks,
ambled over to a table in the main part of the casino and put down
roughly $200 worth of chips.
</P>
<P>
   Betting $100 each time, he doubled his holdings in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, Bill, bet it all,'' shouted DARREN WESLEY, a computer
company executive next to whom Gates had sat down. The two had
never met before (and no, Wesley does not work for Microsoft), but
they high-fived whenever Mr. Gates won a hand.
</P>
<P>
   So does Gates gamble a lot?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``I actually like poker better.
Blackjack is mostly luck. Poker, you have to be a skilled player.''
</P>
<P>
   So is he?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Does Gates, whose Microsoft holdings have made him one of
America's richest men, set limits on the money he gambles?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, only time limits,'' he said, gathering roughly $300 in
chips and standing up. He worked his way through the crowd to the
guest elevators.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the casino, Wesley and his wife, RANI, were still
betting. ``He gave me luck,'' Ms. Wesley said. ``The first time I
started winning since I got here was when he sat down.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

<P>
   PHILIP SCATURRO, an investment banker, bid $16,000 at an auction
to benefit the New York City Opera. The prize was an evening at
BROOKE and PETER DUCHIN'S apartment with two Broadway veterans, RON
RIFKIN and DEBRA MONK.
</P>
<P>
   Scaturro invited a dozen from high school (the Class of 1956 at
Millburn High in Millburn, N.J.).
</P>
<P>
   The surprise was supposed to be an appearance by the soprano
RENEE FLEMING, singing Gershwin.
</P>
<P>
   But the real surprise was that Rifkin's wife, IVA, realized that
she, too, had graduated from Millburn in 1956 and that Scaturro's
friends had once been her friends, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe my eyes,'' she said. ``I hadn't seen them
since graduation, but they hadn't changed a bit. It was as if no
time at all had passed.'' &QL;

   Before she received the Dean's Award from the Columbia
University College of Physicians and Surgeons last week, DONNA
SHALALA was introduced as the former president of two colleges, the
recipient of more than a dozen honorary degrees and, for the last
five years, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shalala shook hands with the dean of the faculty of
medicine, DR. HERBERT PADRES, and sat down.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the other person who had received a Dean's Award
told her, ``The introduction didn't include your playing softball
on a team in Cleveland in 1949.''
</P>
<P>
   PAGE MORTON BLACK, who has been the chairwoman of the
Parkinson's Disease Foundation for more than 15 years, asked what
it was like to play in the outfield with GEORGE STEINBRENNER III as
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said he was very gentle,'' Mrs. Black said. ``She said he
was a wonderful coach.'' (The team won a citywide championship that
year.)

AMAZON STRETCHING BEYOND ITS ROOTS IN BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (lb) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online retailer that already dominates Internet
sales of books and, increasingly, music, is about to start offering
a much broader array of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company's first step into general retailing
will be a holiday gift selection starting Tuesday that will feature
consumer electronics, games, toys and other items. Separately, the
company is adding an extensive line of videotapes and DVDs (digital
videodiscs).
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep getting asked by our customers what is the Amazon.com
of this and that type of merchandise,'' said Keith Schorsch, the
general manager of the gift service. ``We would rather be the
Amazon.com of all of the things our customers want to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has been unexpectedly successful in its move into music.
In its first full quarter, it sold $14.4 million worth of music
items, more than N2K or CDNow, the two leading online music stores.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Amazon's lead might help it as it expanded
into other areas, especially because many people are still worried
about the possible risks of buying online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people know someone who has bought from Amazon.com and
had nothing bad happen to them,'' said Vernon Keenan, an analyst
with Keenan Vision in San Francisco. ``They can leverage the trust
in their brand to become a general merchandiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the several hundred items in the new gift store will be
tied to book and music titles. For example, Sony Walkman tape
players will be promoted amid audio books. And the Madeline series
of children's books will be accompanied by toys featuring the
French schoolgirl character.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Amazon's book service, which offers its products at some
of the deepest discounts available anywhere, Amazon will price the
gift items in the midrange of market prices.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than price, Amazon is emphasizing convenience and
information. As with books, customers will be able to post reviews
on the company's site of all the products it sells. And it will
introduce a feature that lets people send a gift to someone by
entering an e-mail address. Amazon will get in touch with the
recipient to find out the shipping address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like people send more e-mail than they do first-class
letters, we think this will expand the market for gift giving
because it is much easier,'' said Jeff Bezos, the company's chief
executive.

 SPORTS COLUMN: A LINE SO THIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Bryan Cox stood in the middle of the Jets'
locker room Monday afternoon, calmer than he had been on Sunday
after the Jets' unexpected loss to the Indianapolis Colts. Still,
the 30-year-old linebacker was perturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated, and angry,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   After that great victory in the rain on Nov. 1 in Kansas City
and the wonderful performance a week later against Buffalo at home,
what does a loss to the lowly Colts say about the Jets?
</P>
<P>
   ``It says we're immature,'' Cox said. ``That's my honest
opinion. As a group, we are immature. We got some people on this
team with learning disabilities: They just don't understand.
Sometimes you get some guys who think they're still on scholarship
and don't understand this is how they feed their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Cox's terse words and coach Bill Parcells' anger on
Sunday and Monday, the Jets' locker room was upbeat Monday. Players
were walking tall and talking in relaxed, easy tones in the
confident manner of a team still in the thick of the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was this easy manner that disturbed Cox, an eighth-year
National Football League veteran and first-year Jet, who knows how
fragile success can be, how thin the line is that separates making
it from not making it. The Jets, who were sitting pretty at 6-3
before Sunday's game with the Colts, are now sitting more
precariously at 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have put ourselves in position in our division to be
coming down to those last games with New England, Buffalo and Miami
sitting 5-0,'' said Cox, referring to the Jets' record in the
American Football Conference East, which now stands at 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday's loss was brutal on us. But the thing that was most
upsetting to me was that a lot of guys yesterday before the game _
and coaches _ recognized the fact that in the locker room we
weren't ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every Jet shares Cox's view of the ship. Aaron Glenn, whose
104-yard return of a missed field-goal attempt for a touchdown
appeared to be a knockout blow for the Jets, said the defeat was a
loss, not a statement from an oracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start getting on a roll, a lot of people expect you
to go out there and win every game,'' Glenn said. ``Sometimes in
this league, things don't go your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Cox and Parcells should arrange a midweek field trip for
the Jets to Giants Stadium. Let the Jets observe the Giants' dismal
locker room; let them see firsthand how fragile success can be, how
dreams so quickly can turn to ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, the Giants were rushing toward an
improbable division title under the first-year coach Jim Fassel.
Fassel booted out Dave Brown and enthusiastically installed the
exuberant Danny Kanell as the Giants' quarterback. With six weeks
left in this season, however, the Giants are a disaster area.
Fassel was forced to re-evaluate Kanell on Sunday as the coach
himself was being scrutinized. Why have there been such dramatic
changes? Cox said the reason was parity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to take a week off,'' he said. ``No one in
this league can afford to take a week off. Anybody can beat anybody
in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like in the past, before free agency, when you knew
San Francisco was going to go 12-4 or 11-5. In this league, you can
see a 4-8 team be an underdog and win by 30 points.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe there's something more insidious than mere parity.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency has had an exciting but unsettling effect on the
ecosystem of the game. Free agency, and the escalating
coach-hopping, affects the normal growth process, in which players
mature and jell, with a sort of growth hormone. Players play and
then leave. Free agents are quick fixes that allow teams to go from
good to bad, bad to good.
</P>
<P>
   At every level the margin for error is narrower.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel makes one seemingly innocuous decision to let Jason
Sehorn run back kickoffs. Just like that, Sehorn is lost for the
year with a knee injury in a preseason game, and the Giants' season
is turned upside down. Now Kanell, the player Fassel thought could
take the Giants to the next level, may be on the bench and Fassel
is on the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' lessons can be compressed into the last six weeks of
the season for the Jets. They have Tennessee coming up on the road
and also have games against division rivals New England, Miami and
Buffalo. The difference between ending up 12-4 and 6-10 rests on
that thin line the Jets keep straddling and the Giants have already
crossed. The thinnest line of all separates the Jets from the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants lost all their illusions a few weeks ago; now their
dreams are crushed as well.
</P>

HUD PLANS INVESTIGATION OF SCOPE OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Acknowledging that it did not know the scope of
housing discrimination around the country, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development announced Monday that it planned to
conduct a nationwide investigation of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the department learned of
discrimination only through anecdote or in complaints to the
agency. The investigation, he said, will be the department's first
formal effort to find out how many people are affected, who and
where they are, and how they are victimized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a good sense of the systemic or institutional
discrimination that exists,'' Cuomo said at a news conference.
``Therefore, this will be the most comprehensive national study
ever taken.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey is being conducted now, Cuomo said, because
department lawyers have had to respond to a steady increase in
housing discrimination complaints in recent years _ about 70 a
month now, or double the number in the first term of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo conceded that department officials did not know whether
this increase reflected a rise in discriminatory practices by
lenders and housing officials or whether other federal initiatives
to fight housing discrimination had emboldened more victims to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   So far as department officials have determined, the number of
fair-housing complaints increased 40 percent, to about 10,500 a
year, from 1990 to 1995 and has held steady since then. The figure
reflects complaints not only to the Federal housing department but
also to state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo described housing discrimination as ``more sophisticated,
less obvious, but more insidious'' than other kinds of bias against
minority groups, whose members are less likely to be homeowners
than are whites. Recent studies by the housing department found
that while home ownership in the United States had reached a record
level, about 67 percent, the rate among whites (72.5 percent) was
much higher than the black and Hispanic rates (45.3 percent and
43.9 percent, respectively).
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't solve this issue, this nation is in trouble
long-term, I'm convinced of it,'' Cuomo said of the disparity.
</P>
<P>
   The department plans to have the survey conducted by an outside
firm, using as many as 5,000 tests involving sets of prospective
white and nonwhite home buyers or renters seeking access to the
same property.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said this process would help the agency discover any
patterns of illegal or unethical behavior _ for instance, whether
banks will qualify a white applicant seeking a mortgage but not a
black applicant with a similar financial background. It is also
expected to show whether apartment applicants are ``steered''
toward one area or another depending on their race or ethnicity,
and whether questionable practices occur more often in cities or in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the secretary said, the survey results will locate
areas of the country where questionable practices are most common.
</P>
<P>
   The department intends to spend $7.5 million for the survey, as
part of its current $40 million fair-housing budget. Cuomo said he
expected to award the project soon, with the results following in
about a year.

MINOT MILLIKEN, 82, TEXTILE COMPANY OFFICER
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Minot K. Milliken, who was treasurer and chief
financial officer of Milliken &AMP; Co., the country's largest
privately owned textile company, died at Columbia Presbyterian
Hospital in New York on Saturday after a three-month illness, his
eldest son, M.K. Milliken, said. He was 82 and lived in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Milliken, who was born in New York City, graduated from
Princeton University in 1937 and worked for 50 years until his
retirement in 1996 at Milliken &AMP; Co., which his grandfather, Seth
Milliken, founded in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   He also served on the boards of National Distillers, Mercantile
Stores, the Irving Bank of New York and Union Pacific Railroad. He
was chairman of the board of the Boys Club of New York for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Milliken was president of the board of his Manhattan
cooperative building, at 19 East 72nd St., when former President
Richard Nixon sought to buy a nine-room penthouse in the building.
Although Nixon's application was at first unofficially approved by
the cooperative's board, many residents objected, complaining that
his presence would attract unwelcome attention. In the end,
Milliken announced that Nixon had withdrawn his application.
</P>
<P>
   Milliken is survived by his wife, Armene L., of New York; five
children, M.K., of Baltimore, Christopher C., of Lake Forest, Ill.,
Alexander F., of Santa Fe, N.M., Seth M., of Salisbury, Conn., and
Daphne Milliken Webbe of Vail, Colo.; 13 grandchildren; and one
great-grandson.

TWO BROKERS ADMIT TAKING INSIDER DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two former brokers pleaded guilty Monday to taking
secret stock information, another victory for New York state
prosecutors in one of the biggest insider-trading cases of recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Breed, a former broker at First United Equities, and
Jennifer D'Antoni, a former Duke &AMP; Co. broker, pleaded guilty to
charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney, Robert
Morgenthau. Breed pleaded guilty to third-degree criminal
possession of stolen property, and Ms. D'Antoni pleaded guilty to a
violation of the state's general business laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both pleas were in connection with the use of confidential
information supplied by Marisa Baridis, a former compliance aide at
the Wall Street firms Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people have now admitted guilt in the case, in which Ms.
Baridis, 30, admitted selling tips on stocks of companies involved
in takeovers. She pleaded guilty late last year to federal charges
of conspiracy and securities fraud and is awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Two other defendants, Mark Nogid and Vincent Napolitano,
continue to fight the charges. Their trial is scheduled to begin on
March 8.
</P>
<P>
   The Baridis case has been a subject of contention between state
and federal prosecutors. Both offices originally brought charges
against Ms. Baridis, but Morgenthau's office backed down because
the dual charges raised concerns about double jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   But the state has continued to prosecute others involved in the
case. Justice Edward McLaughlin of New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan ruled in September that state prosecutors have the
authority to pursue insider-trading cases, an area once considered
the preserve of federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hoping that anyone involved in insider trading will
realize that they are subject to prosecution in the state courts
under the penal law,'' said James Kindler, chief assistant district
attorney.

 SPORTS COLUMN: PHILLIPS' PUBLIC CONFESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We see it all over the television set _ morning, noon
and night _ real people admitting just about every sin and
character flaw, sometimes to the face of the person they harmed, in
the name of healing for the parties involved, to say nothing of
high ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But what was to be gained from Steve Phillips going public about
his extramarital affairs? This question was repeatedly raised
Monday during a news conference at Shea Stadium when the general
manager of the Mets ended his eight-day leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips insisted it had been his idea, and that of his wife, to
admit his mistakes, in view of an expected charge of harassment
from a woman who used to work for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not normally the business of journalists to propose
a cover-up, in this case it seems there could have been some way to
limit the public awareness to admitting the one relationship,
whether consensual or under duress from an executive to an office
worker.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century ago, M. Donald Grant, who ran the Mets,
forced his left fielder, Cleon Jones, to publicly apologize, in
front of his wife, for being caught in a compromising situation. I
don't see the current Wilpon-Doubleday ownership forcing Phillips
into a public confession.
</P>
<P>
   If there is some bigger organizational cover-up, we shall find
out soon enough. If it is the matter of one fallen human trying to
save the marriage he jeopardized, did we really need to know all
this?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was appropriate to do after discussing it with my
wife,'' Phillips said, conceding he had caused ``a significant
wound in my family life.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips had taken the temporary leave of absence just before
the baseball meetings in Florida, and Frank Cashen had temporarily
come out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than make up a story about why I was away, it was
better to tell the truth,'' Phillips added.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that a baseball general manager who
cheated on his wife would necessarily cheat his fellow general
managers, or mislead the owners, or lie to a ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   Last May Phillips seemed legitimately aghast at having assured
Todd Hundley there would be no deal for Mike Piazza, only to be
overruled by ownership. Being a veracious general manager is quite
a different role from being a faithful husband.
</P>
<P>
   My own reaction from watching a stunned Phillips was that in the
first days of tears, rage and grief, he and his wife had agreed
that the truth must come forth, if healing was to even begin.
</P>
<P>
   However, most treatment programs generally advise people not to
make major life decisions for at least a year, as they discover
their new stable personality. This kind of confession might best
have been made in the tense emotional circle of a support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't necessarily thinking of myself,'' Phillips said.
``The pain was going to be more with my wife and my kids. One has
to accept responsibility for the choices you make. I told the
truth. With that come the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips did not discuss his marriage Monday, except in hopeful
terms of trying to heal it, without any guarantees. He merely said
he now has time to go back to work. ``In fact, it was advisable,''
said David Howard, the senior vice president for business and legal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Phillips, his very public leave-taking
demanded a very public return, with more glare, more questions,
even a very public address from somebody else's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of Monday's conference, a man introduced himself
as Dominic Barbara and claimed to represent a client who had been
involved with Phillips. Barbara announced he had been prepared to
read a statement, but claimed he had been so ``impressed'' with
Phillips' demeanor that he was not going to read it. However,
Barbara added, he was still going to litigate against Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara, who has previously represented clients such as Jessica
Hahn and Joey Buttafuoco, then strode out of the conference. Some
people said Phillips even nodded as if to thank Barbara for what
might have sounded like words of praise. Phillips, who put himself
in this public forum, first by his disloyalty to his family, and
later by his purported need to ``tell the truth,'' seemed too numb
to react viscerally to the intrusion from this litigator.
</P>
<P>
   There is no judgment here of any legal issues. As for the
scrutiny of his character, Phillips said, ``There are people who
will make judgments; that is not unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips will not discuss his problem any further. It is time
for him to shore up the Mets in public, and try to save his
marriage in private.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Throughout his illustrious baseball career, which seems to get
better with age, Roger Clemens has become a historian of the game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walk through a section of Clemens' Texas-sized home, and it
might feel like you're taking a tour of the Baseball Hall of Fame,
with an assortment of memorabilia lining the walls and shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a ball that was bought at an auction and has Cy Young's
signature,'' Clemens said. ``He's a big part of my career and my
life now since I'm chasing these awards that have his name on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays righthander added another piece of
hardware to his most prized collection Monday, winning a
major-league-record fifth Cy Young Award. American League voters
representing the Baseball Writers' Association of America left no
doubt about their pick as the league's top pitcher in 1998, making
Clemens a unanimous selection with all 28 first-place votes. Denny
McLain (1968), Ron Guidry (1978) and Clemens (1986) were the only
previous unanimous choices in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Houstonian cruised to his second consecutive AL
Cy Young after claiming his league's pitching triple crown for a
second straight season. Clemens tied for the AL lead in wins at
20-6 and was tops in ERA (2.65) and strikeouts (271). He became
only the fourth pitcher in baseball history to accomplish the feat
in consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Pedro Martinez finished second in balloting with 20
second-place votes and five thirds for 65 points. David Wells of
the world champion Yankees was third with 31 points, and New York
teammate David Cone was fourth with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who won his first three Cy Youngs with Boston in 1986,
1987 and 1991, said he cherishes his fifth selection as much as his
first, which came at age 24 after his third big-league season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember each one,'' said Clemens, who earned a $250,000
bonus with this year's honor. ``When you have a special year, and
somebody votes you this award named for one of the greatest
pitchers and to do something that's never been done is really
special. For it to be unanimous kind of makes it bookends to the
one I won in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this,'' Clemens continued. ``I'm a couple
miles from my high school (Spring Woods) and still in the area I
grew up. I just can't comprehend that I've won five of these things
and been voted the best pitcher five times in my career with all
the great talent I've had to go up against. It's really gratifying
to know that all the work and what I've dedicated my life to do the
last 15 years pays off. The hard work pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had been tied with Steve Carlton and Greg Maddux as the
only four-time Cy Young winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of the day I came home in 1983 and Roger agreed
to have us represent him,'' said Alan Hendricks, one of Clemens'
Houston-based agents. ``I told my wife this guy has the potential
to truly be great. It's been validated. I don't know where on the
list he is among the best pitchers ever, but he's on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was named an All-Star for the seventh time this past
season and became just the 11th pitcher in history to record 3,000
career strikeouts. After starting the season 5-6, he went unbeaten
in his final 22 starts, winning 15 decisions. The 15-win streak,
which began June 3, is the longest since Gaylord Perry won 15
straight for the 1974 Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a pitcher who, after 13 seasons with the Red Sox,
was dismissed in 1996 after management concluded he had reached the
twilight of his career. An almost certain spot in the Hall of Fame
and his Boston snub have served as motivation for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   He anxiously awaited Monday's phone call that officially
informed him of his record fifth award. One day, he hopes to
receive another call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time when I go (to his game room) and look at the
hardware up there, I realize it gets me one step closer to the big
house _ Cooperstown, N.Y., and the Baseball Hall of Fame,'' Clemens
said. ``I think of it all the time when I see guys inducted and
think of it a lot when I see the old stadiums and different numbers
retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he finishes his career in Toronto remains to be seen.
Clemens is under contract through 2000 but has an escape clause and
can demand a trade if the Blue Jays show a lack of willingness to
field a competitive team. Despite his displeasure with the lack of
communication he has encountered with the Toronto front office
since season's end and the Blue Jays' stalled talks with free agent
Jose Canseco, Clemens said he is still committed to helping Toronto
reach the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been talk of Clemens being traded to several
teams, including his hometown Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Toronto) is going to try and rebuild down the road and go
young, I told them I really don't fit in their plans,'' Clemens
said. ``We'll see what happens. It's a lot easier said than done. I
think it would be a lot easier to just go out and get one or two
more big forces. They don't have to be super, super stars, but big
for{}~,yM &LR; %9 our lineup, and we're right there. I think we could
knock on the door with just about anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   With no control over where he'll play in the immediate future,
Clemens spent all of Monday celebrating with his family. As he
concluded a news conference in his private gymnasium, his sons
Koby, Kory, Kacy and Kody, who are the J WgiQ;Sw3

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a gentle night in late September 1976, a dark-haired
17-year-old high school senior from Hillside, N.J., scraped
together $25 to buy a ticket to watch Muhammad Ali successfully
defend his world heavyweight championship against Ken Norton at
Yankee Stadium. This cheapest seat available was so high and far
away, he recalled recently, that ``the two fighters in the ring
looked like ants.''
</P>
<P>
   For David Remnick, the teen-ager in the distant reaches of the
upper deck that night, his journey to see Ali was in equal parts a
young fan's curiosity and moth-to-a-flame lure for a ballyhooed
sporting event, as well as an abiding fascination with Ali, that
seminal figure on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 years later, Remnick gained a significantly closer look
at Ali, visiting him at his farm in Berrien Springs, Mich.: ``I'd
come up to Michigan to see him because I wanted to write about the
way he'd created himself in the early 60s, the way a gangly kid
from Louisville managed to become one of the most electric of
American characters, a molder of his age and a reflection of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick wrote that in the prologue to his new book, ``King of
the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero'' (Random
House).
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Remnick may seem to be an unlikely candidate to
write a biographical study of a sports personality, whether it be
Ali or anyone else. Remnick is, after all, the winner of the
Pulitzer Prize in 1994 for ``Lenin's Tomb,'' his masterly study of
Russia past and present, following a four-year stint as a
correspondent in Moscow for The Washington Post. He was a staff
writer for The New Yorker for six years and distinguished himself
with profiles ranging from Benjamin Netanyahu to Pope John Paul II
to Howard Stern. In July, he was named editor of the magazine, and
he was still three months short of his 40th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   He does not consider his writing on boxing to be such an odd
undertaking, he said, but he understands the perception. At lunch
recently in a midtown restaurant, Remnick, who still looks young
enough to pass for a college student _ graduate student, anyway _
recalled a moment when he was in Las Vegas last year to write about
the Evander Holyfield-Mike Tyson title fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the MGM Grand Hotel and wearing the laminated
identification around my neck that is given to the press, when a
middle-aged couple approached me, and the woman asked what I was
there for,'' he recalled. ``I said, `The fight.' She asked who I
was with. I told her The New Yorker. She looked shocked. `The New
Yorker? Do they cover boxing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick laughed at the thought. ``I just answered her yes,'' he
said, ``I didn't tell her some of my favorite writing in the
magazine was done by A.J. Leibling on boxing. Some people have the
notion that The New Yorker is a genteel hothouse flower. But the
real New Yorker includes Tyson spitting a piece of ear on the ring
canvas. And it always has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best writing,'' Remnick said, ``is invariably done in
terms of dramatic conflict. Whether it's about politics or sports,
it demands conflict. In the realm of sports, the most naked and
clear conflict of all is in the boxing ring. There are no committee
meetings, like huddles in football, no elaborate rules like the
zone defense in basketball. Like it or not, boxing presents two men
in vivid contrast, and somehow over time this has proved to be a
fertile ground for writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes all the way from Homer to Pierce Egan to Joyce Carol
Oates. The literary journalism on Vietnam, for example, is vastly
superior to that on Watergate. Vietnam was a brutal and confused
and divisive conflict, whereas the battlefield in Watergate had to
do with committee rooms and documents and tapes. And while it was
plenty dramatic, there is no literary legacy. Unlike, say, all the
wars we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   For Remnick, the heavyweight champion, considered the toughest
man on earth, from John L. Sullivan to Jack Johnson to Jack Dempsey
to Joe Louis to Muhammad Ali, has always possessed ``an uncanny
symbolic role.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did Ali make himself a great heavyweight champion _
in my view, the greatest, combining the power of a heavyweight with
the quickness and grace of Sugar Ray Robinson _ but he became one
of the most courageous American figures ever,'' he said. ``He was a
self-created American genius, like Davy Crockett, or Duke
Ellington, or Annie Oakley. But he did it in the age of media. And
he showed the courage of his convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ali refused to be inducted into the military, Remnick said,
``he was giving up the thing that meant everything to him, the
heavyweight championship.'' Ali's willingness to be exiled from his
profession for a cause, his conversion to the Black Muslims, his
embrace of and then break with Malcolm X, his emergence as an
Islamic minister, his ``democratic interest'' in women (Remnick's
phrase) to a degree that a friend called Ali ``the pelvic
missionary,'' how he could sometimes be cruel and turn on people,
his becoming a beloved world figure whose surprise lighting of the
Olympic flame in Atlanta in 1996 moved billions watching on
television around the world _ and moved Remnick, too _ showed Ali
to be a complex man, a compelling man.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the thing I wanted to focus in my book on was the 24 hours
of Ali's winning the title in an upset of Sonny Liston,'' Remnick
said, ``and then announcing he was no longer Cassius Clay _ a slave
name, he said _ and he was now Muhammad Ali. It was a momentous
event in our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick added: ``I wanted to write a tight, vivid story. And I
felt this was the one for me.''
</P>
<P>
   No stranger to sportswriting, Remnick's first full-time job in
journalism, not long after graduating from Princeton University,
was as a sportswriter for The Washington Post. He did it for two
years, from 1983 to 1985. He covered the Washington Federals of the
defunct United States Football League, the Washington Bullets of
the NBA, and boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it, and I learned from it,'' he said. ``One of the
first things I did in covering the Bullets was to somehow offend
the star player, Jeff Ruland, who stopped speaking to me for about
three months. So I had to be resourceful in getting stuff from
other players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post sports editor then and now, George Solomon, said that
Remnick ``had more access to Gorbachev and Yeltsin than he did to
Ruland.'' Solomon also remembers that Remnick as a young sports
reporter ``was terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have a guy who can write well, and be a good
reporter, too,'' he said. ``And he worked like a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   On the boxing beat, Remnick grew to respect the skills and
courage of the fighters. ``The foot speed, the concentration, the
endurance, the sheer terror of being in the ring can be
exhausting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever box? I did, a few times as a kid, in a friend's
basement. It is literally a painful memory. I hated getting hit in
the face. But the game, when others do it, still holds a
fascination for me. It's a guilty pleasure, but I wouldn't lose
sleep if it went away.''

</P>
<P>
   At The Washington Post one day, Remnick's attention was drawn to
someone else. In the winter of 1983, he recalled, an attractive
dark-haired woman, then a clerk in the sports department of The New
York Times, walked into George Solomon's office seeking a job as a
sportswriter. When she left, Remnick went into Solomon's office.
</P>
<P>
   ```George,''' Solomon recalled him saying, ```you must hire that
woman.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, David,'' replied Solomon, ``I don't have any openings.
But if you want to date her, that's your business.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were no openings for her at The Post, in time she
was hired in the news department of The New York Times, where she
is now a reporter. Her name is Esther B. Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and a few years after Remnick spotted her at The Post, he
married her.
</P>
<P>
   They now have two fast-growing boys, 8 and 6, and a splendid new
book.

   ROME _ Facing his first real foreign policy test, Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema must decide what to do with a prominent Kurdish
rebel leader who was arrested at the Rome airport on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey wants Italy to extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan,
leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is seeking Kurdish
autonomy in southeastern Turkey. He is viewed in Turkey as a
terrorist. Germany also has a warrant out for his arrest on
homicide charges.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Alema, a former Communist who was appointed prime minister
last month, is under pressure from leftists in his coalition to
offer Ocalan political asylum. In a news conference Monday, D'Alema
recognized the extent of the problem. ``The last thing we wanted
was an awkward and complicated situation like this one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Italian law prohibits extradition of suspects to
countries that have the death penalty. Turkey has capital
punishment, though it says it will soon abolish it. Ocalan is being
tried in absentia there on charges that could bring the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema said a committee in the Interior Ministry would
determine whether Ocalan would qualify for political asylum, which
would be possible if Ocalan's promise to renounce terrorism, issued
Monday, holds up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want someone who organizes terrorism in Italy,''
D'Alema said. ``This is an opportunity to find an exit from a
bloody conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, while members of D'Alema's government met with
Turkish officials who were in Rome for a European ministerial
meeting, thousands of Kurds flooded into Rome to hold a
demonstration and hunger strike in support of Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema's decision was further complicated on Sunday when
Turkish inmates in a prison in Istanbul took an Italian prisoner
hostage, saying they would release him only after Italy extradited
Ocalan. Monday, D'Alema said he would not bow to pressure.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ You can be an artist in New York or a voodoo drummer
from Haiti and when you try to explain why you do what you do, only
the words will be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit give me the drum'' _ or the ability to paint or to
hear ``Slaughter on 10th Avenue'' in the streets of the city when
all anybody else hears is traffic. ``The spirit see in his mind I'm
gonna be good.'' Can't be bothered with a wife or a job because the
drum _ the painting _ the music has to come first.
</P>
<P>
   This is the case with Frisner Augustin, the 50-year-old drummer
who will be honored by City Lore, the nonprofit organization that
will celebrate New York's ``living cultural heritage'' this week.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot read, he cannot write, there are five children by
three women, none of whom live with him. He can perform voodoo
ceremonies, but he rarely does, because he does not want to be
distracted. From the time he was a little boy, in Haiti, in a house
with a dirt floor and without plumbing, he was captive to the
drums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time my mother send me with the bucket to get water, I
play it as soon as I left the house,'' Augustin says, at the Lower
East Side offices of City Lore, his English heavily accented with
Creole. ``One time, we have a plastic bucket _ the tone is very
good to me. My mother beat me because we have only the one
bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   There are cultural heroes who are celebrated in Lincoln Center.
There are cultural heroes who will be celebrated this Thursday
evening when City Lore inducts ``five urban folk heroes'' into its
People's Hall of Fame, at the New York Academy of Music. People
like Sally and Tony Amato, who run the little Amato Opera house, in
Greenwich Village, and Tariq Hamid, who runs Shaheen Sweets, an
Indian and Pakistani confectionery shop in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   It seems safe to say that the Lincoln Center types live better.
Augustin, who also heads La Troupe Makandal dance company,
performed in Washington when the Rolling Stones did their Voodoo
Lounge Tour in 1994, but he says he did not make big money. More
recently, Augustin worked with the director Jonathan Demme on the
soundtrack of the movie ``Beloved.'' Although Augustin did not
reveal his salary, he seemed happier with this arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Demme, certainly, was pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I wanted Frisner was a sheer ego trip,''
Demme says. ``He is a master drummer. When Frisner is featured, a
lot of people just come to groove for the music. They are not
coming for the spiritual dimension, they just love what he does
with drums.''
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual, however, is central to Augustin's music. He grew
up in Port-au-Prince, in a neighborhood called, in Creole, deye
simitye, or ``behind the cemetery.'' His father, who left his
mother when she was three months pregnant, was a carpenter, his
mother a sometime factory worker.
</P>
<P>
   To be one of the poorest kids in the neighborhood in Haiti, as
was Augustin, was to be very poor.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Day, when the children dressed up in their new
clothes and called on their neighbors, the young Frisner hid in bed
with the covers over his head, because he had no new clothes
</P>
<P>
   But it was also clear to Augustin, whose uncle was a drummer,
that he had a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirits give me the drum,'' Augustin says. ``The spirit
sees in his mind I'm gonna be good. My mother don't have money to
pay the rent. Thanks God, thanks my spirit, that give me that
experience to play the drum. I'm 14 or 15, I play the drum on
stage, they give me $20. At that time, $20 is a billion dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Augustin did not have the money to go to school. He also did not
see the point. There were people in his neighborhood who had high
school degrees but still could not find work. Augustin, touring in
Puerto Rico and Acapulco, Mexico, did not feel hampered by
illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe somebody says, `This guy doesn't know how to read, I
will give him what I want,' but I know how to count money,''
Augustin says.
</P>
<P>
   Augustin came to New York in 1972, supporting himself as a
gypsy-cab driver. (How he managed to get a driver's license without
being able to read he prefers not to discuss.) He now makes a
living of sorts, teaching a course on drumming at Hunter College,
performing on stage and playing for voodoo ceremonies. The awkward
subject of animal sacrifice is one Augustin will talk about.
Animals are killed in some ceremonies, Augustin says. Occasionally,
yes, he does feels sorry for the animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the spirit wants it,'' Augustin says.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Wilcken, an ethnomusicologist who has written a book on
voodoo drums that features Augustin and who has accompanied him to
this meeting, tries to bridge the cultural gap: ``In Haiti, most
people grow up with fresh meat,'' Ms. Wilcken says. ``There's not
much refrigeration. They bring an animal home and kill it. People
are used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why now is the music so important to Augustin?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my roots, it's how I grew up,'' he says. ``My goal now is
to leave something for the kids. There are people who speak bad of
Haitian music. They don't appreciate and respect their roots. I
don't know how to read. I don't know how to write. But I know how
to push the drum.''

SETON HALL GROUPS HONOR WHITMAN, OFF CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ At a reception in a private club adjacent to the
Seton Hall University School of Law, Gov. Christie Whitman accepted
a medal of honor Monday night from three student groups that were
forced last week to move the event off campus because of the
governor's support of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Seton Hall Law Review, the Seton Hall Legislative Bureau and
the Seton Hall Women's Law Forum had planned for months to present
Whitman with the sixth annual Sandra Day O'Connor Medal of Honor in
the law school's auditorium. Invitations had already been sent when
officials of the university, a Roman Catholic institution, ordered
it moved.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the award at the Newark Club, Whitman, a
Presbyterian, did not criticize the university, but she made
several references to ``tolerance and inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we are gathered here tonight is an indication
that the students who selected me for this award have the courage
of their convictions and a respect for diversity of thought,'' she
told an audience of more than 150 students and professors. ``For
that, I am both honored and encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing her, state Sen. Robert J. Martin, who is a
professor at the law school, criticized the decision to move the
event, saying that the governor was owed an apology ``for the
awkwardness and the embarrassment that we have caused you.''
</P>
<P>
   Joking about the governor's emergency appendectomy on Friday,
Martin thanked her for attending. ``When they took out your
appendix, they did not take out your guts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement last week, Monsignor Robert Sheeran, president of
the university, said, ``Seton Hall has a clearly stated policy that
no public recognition is given to those espousing positions
contrary to our Catholic mission. That includes those publicly
supporting pro-choice views.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheeran did not attend the reception.

U.S. JUDGE STRIKES DOWN CITY'S PARADE-PERMIT LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge struck down New York City's law
governing permits for parades and rallies Monday, saying it was
unconstitutional because it lacked firm guidelines for when police
must respond to requests for permits.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan ruled
that the city law violated First Amendment guarantees of free
speech because, without safeguards like specific time limits for a
response to applications, the law does not sufficiently restrict
the risk of censorship by city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a case brought by a group called the
Million Marijuana March Organization, which had applied
unsuccessfully for a parade permit early this year to lobby for
decriminalizing marijuana use.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is the third by a federal judge in the last four
months that has faulted the Giuliani administration's handling of
parade permits.
</P>
<P>
   Previous court rulings on such permits took issue with the way
the city had applied the law. Sand's ruling Monday was the first to
declare the law itself unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The latest decision came as New York was honoring Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, with a parade up lower Broadway that was planned and
approved within just a few days last week. Sand, who made no
reference to Monday's event in his 29-page decision, said the
fundamental defect of the city's approach was that, without time
limits, the city had complete control over how quickly it chose to
respond to requests for permits. He said the Police Department
sometimes granted such requests rapidly, while other applicants,
like the marijuana-march organizers, often endured months of
delays.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he was ``particularly troubled'' by extensive
delays in the Police Department's handling of two requests earlier
this year for parades to protest police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``A scheme such as this one, where the Police Department may
routinely grant applications either immediately or only after
extensive delays, is dangerous precisely because it lacks
consistency and predictability,'' Sand wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of standards, whether in the text of the statute
or by the creation of consistent practice,'' the judge continued,
``hinders a reviewing court's ability to determine whether
content-based considerations have infected the permit application
process and results in a danger of censorship that the First
Amendment does not tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   The case involved a request filed last January by Robert
MacDonald, a member of the Million Marijuana March Organization,
for a permit to hold a parade from Washington Square Park up Fifth
Avenue to 96th Street on May 2 of this year. After the Police
Department failed to respond to the permit request for two months,
MacDonald filed his lawsuit on April 1. The city denied the permit
six days later, offering an alternative route, said MacDonald's
lawyer, Richard Wilson. The parade never took place.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, MacDonald argued that the permit law was
unconstitutional because it represented a prior restraint on
speech. Sand ruled in June against two of MacDonald's claims,
saying that the city's law did not put excessive discretion in the
hands of the police commissioner and that it did not restrict free
speech based on the speech's content.
</P>
<P>
   But Sand had reserved decision in June on MacDonald's third
assertion: that the absence of time limits for the Police
Department's response to parade applications risks the indefinite
suspension of permissible speech.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling Monday, the judge analyzed 30 parade requests in
the last two years. He said that in most instances, police gave a
timely response to applications. But he also noted a half-dozen
instances in which groups filed requests months before a planned
event, only to receive a response from police a day or two before
the scheduled parade.
</P>
<P>
   Sand said he was particularly troubled by the Police
Department's handling of two marches to protest police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the Coalition Against Police Brutality was denied
a request to parade on March 30, the day before the planned event,
the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, a group called the October 22nd Coalition
waited more than a month for police to reject its application to
march against police misconduct on Oct. 22. The group filed a
lawsuit, and Judge John Martin Jr. of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan ordered the city to grant the parade permit, saying the
delay in responding to the application was ``unconscionable'' and
gave rise to the inference that the delay was caused by the content
of the group's message.
</P>
<P>
   City officials declined to respond to Monday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a spokeswoman for Police Commissioner Howard
Safir, said, ``We have just received Judge Sand's decision, and
we're reviewing it.''

`MONICA'S STORY' TO BE TOLD ON TV AND IN BOOK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Correcting 3rd graf to make it read: Ms. Lewinsky will not be
paid, etc.)  (htv) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL and LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of angling for a lucrative book deal and a
television forum, Monica Lewinsky has finally signed agreements for
an interview with Barbara Walters of ABC News and for the
publication of a book from St. Martin's Press tentatively titled,
``Monica's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer said Monday that on Friday, she settled on
both British and an American publishers to tell her side of the
scandal that followed her affair with President Clinton, but at a
price that was more modest than the millions once predicted _ a
$600,000 advance plus bonuses for bestseller rankings. The book,
which will be published in February, will be written by Andrew
Morton, the author of a best-selling book about Diana, Princess of
Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's interview with Ms. Walters, for the program
``20/20,'' will most likely be broadcast in February. Ms. Lewinsky
will not be paid for it, Ms. Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said she had met with Ms. Lewinsky twice, both times
within the last couple of weeks. Their agreement, which Ms.
Lewinsky signed Friday, gives Ms. Walters exclusive rights to the
first television interview, and prohibits ABC from selling that
interview outside North America, so that Ms. Lewinsky's
representatives can negotiate other interviews for her in other
countries and grant exclusivity in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer, Richard Hofstetter, said that ``Monica
received offers of more than $5 million and turned them down.'' He
would not identify the companies that had made such offers, but
there were reports that Ms. Lewinsky's representative had gone far
in negotiations with the tabloid show, ``Hard Copy,'' the day-time
talk show host, Oprah Winfrey and News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives said that she had asked for $2 million, but they
were willing to pay less than half that.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said that Lewinsky will reveal a side of herself
that has not been apparent from the reams of grand jury testimony
that has was released by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not silly. She is well-spoken. She is intelligent,''
Ms. Walters said, adding, ``There's a lot not in the record _ what
this year has been like for her, what it felt like when the
president made his statements, her reaction, her views on the
various people involved, the jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear if there are any restrictions on Ms. Lewinsky
that would limit her from speaking out. In an immunity deal she
signed with prosecutors last summer, Ms. Lewinsky agreed that she
would not speak to any news organizations without the consent of
the independent counsel while the inquiry into President Clinton's
actions was proceeding. Recently Ms. Lewinsky, who has faced
mounting legal bills, had renewed her request to the independent
counsel's office for permission to grant interviews. Charles G.
Bakaly III, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, declined to
comment Monday on whether Ms. Lewinsky would be allowed to speak
now or under what conditions.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press, which has paid more for books like ``The
Arthritis Cure,'' reached an agreement with Ms. Lewinsky after a
week-long flurry of negotiations for the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general theme will be how a young woman comes to
Washington, has a relationship with the president and then what she
went through from there, said John Sargent, the chief executive of
St. Martin's Press, who described Ms. Lewinsky as a ``pawn in
Washington power games.''
</P>
<P>
   The project grew out of a torturous and often public search for
a publisher that would pay handsomely for Ms. Lewinsky's story and
ended with a deal at St. Martin's Press. The deal was struck
despite Sargent's public comments ten months earlier that he didn't
think her tale merited a book. ``Do you want to read a whole book
by Monica?'' he asked in February.
</P>
<P>
   At various times, Ms. Lewinsky's asking price for a book varied
from $2 million to $10 million depending on which trial balloon
surfaced in various publications. Judith Regan, the maverick
publisher of Regan Books, had estimated that the title could
command an advance up to $5 million and until recently she was
negotiating a deal that would have included books and television
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the top publishing houses that could afford a
generous advance remained reluctant to sign a book because of fears
that she had nothing left to reveal, particularly after the
publication of the report by the office of the independent counsel
and the events that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The book deal finally came together through the efforts of a
British publisher, Michael O'Mara Books, which sold St. Martin's
Press the rights to publish the book in the United States while
retaining the rights to publish the title in the rest of the world.
The company publishes the books of Morton, whose book about Diana
candidly described her unraveling royal life.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Mara, the publisher, said that initially he was not
interested in publishing a book about Ms. Lewinsky. The idea was
first broached to him by a British television program, which was
seeking to package a television interview along with a book to be
written by a ghost writer that he characterized as a ``nobody.''
After he declined to participate, O'Mara said that Ms. Lewinsky's
attorney, Hofstetter, called him about a week ago to ask him about
the rejection and then the conversation shifted to other potential
authors, such as Morton, who, as it turns out, was interested.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, Morton and O'Mara met Ms. Lewinsky at the
officers of her lawyer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one terrific discussion and we discussed that Monica
Lewinsky as a human being is actually completely a different
person: lively, intelligent, very well-spoken, a typical American
girl. They clicked, very loudly, and they were making progress on
the book before he signed,'' O'Mara said.
</P>
<P>
   Several publishing executives with knowledge of the negotiations
said that O'Mara had approached other publishers to gauge their
interest. Her advance for North American rights, the primary market
for a book by Monica Lewinsky, amounted to more than $600,000
against royalties, a sum that could climb to a million if the books
earns bonuses for making bestseller lists.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Martin's Press, the publisher will be rushing to produce
the book as fast as it can, according to Sargent, who said the book
will essentially be Morton's view of what happened to Ms. Lewinsky.
Morton will be the sole author.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters made it clear that Ms. Lewinsky is not getting any
form of compensation for her appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No money, no other deals,'' said Ms. Walters. ``No Disney
movie, no show on Lifetime, and not for putting out any videos. We
were very meticulous because we knew we'd be scrutinized and we
read all the rumors'' about potential under-the-table compensation
for Ms. Lewinsky, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters said it was her belief that Ms. Lewinsky had spurned
``enormous amounts of money'' from Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is giving her credit for doing this interview out of
desire to maintain her credibility and for turning down millions,
millions from Fox,'' she said.

CLEMENS WINS FIFTH CY YOUNG AMID TALK
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Gordon Edes 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Clemens made history Monday by winning an unprecedented
fifth Cy Young Award as the American League's best pitcher in a
unanimous vote, then made sport of the trade rumors swirling around
him, which include a possible return engagement in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Albert Belle, the slugger who would be king after Mo
Vaughn abdicated, was courted Monday in the Arizona desert by the
New York Yankees, who may be Boston's only competition for Belle's
services but rarely lose anything to the Red Sox. Belle's decision
could come by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Sox general manager Dan Duquette, who is destined to be reminded
of his ``Clemens is in the twilight of his career'' misjudgment
every time the righthander adds another trophy to his mantel, was
not idle Monday, either. Duquette proceeded on two fronts, talking
to the agent for first baseman Rafael Palmeiro, who already has an
offer in hand from the Sox, and pursuing Scott Radinsky, the
lefthanded reliever who spent last season with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox apparently believe they can afford both Belle and
Palmeiro, who hit 43 home runs and drove in 121 runs last season
for the Orioles, the only other team believed to have made an offer
for his services. Palmeiro, 34, probably could be signed for around
$8 million to $9 million a year; the Orioles are believed to have
offered him a three-year contract with an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Dan today,'' agent Jim Bronner said Monday after
acknowledging the Sox offer, ``and we may speak again later.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to earlier published reports, free agent center fielder
Bernie Williams will not visit Boston Tuesday, and as of last
night, no visit had been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, anxiously looking for a puff of white smoke from a
gated mansion in Easton, still were awaiting word from Vaughn, who
has yet to accept the Angels' six-year, $72 million proposal. But
no other formal offer has yet to surface, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim officials have said they will wait, but in the meantime,
they've shifted their immediate focus to lefthander Randy Johnson,
in hopes they can keep him from signing with the team in his
Arizona backyard, the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who collected a $250,000 bonus from the Blue Jays after
winning his second straight Cy Young Award since leaving the Sox as
a free agent, received first-place votes on all 28 ballots cast by
the Baseball Writers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Sox 19-game winner Pedro Martinez finished a distant second and
fell short in his bid to become the first pitcher to win
consecutive Cys in different leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Two Yankees pitchers, David Wells, author of the year's only
perfect game, and David Cone, a 20-game winner, finished third and
fourth, respectively. No other pitchers, including Sox reliever Tom
Gordon, who set a club record with 46 saves while blowing just one
regular-season opportunity, received votes in the balloting. Two
members of the BBWAA in each of the league's 14 cities voted for a
first-, second-, and third-place finisher.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who was unbeaten in his last 15 decisions (spanning 22
starts) to finish 20-6 after beginning the season 5-6, said he
found it ``overwhelming'' to add another Cy Young Award to his
collection. He hoped, he said, that it will help him one day reach
the ``Big House,'' which in common parlance often refers to prison
but in Rogerspeak meant the Hall of Fame in Coopers-town.
</P>
<P>
   He has been less than overwhelmed by the Blue Jays' efforts to
upgrade the team so far this offseason. Last week, he posted his
complaints on his Web site (rocketroger.com), and Monday he said he
was still awaiting word on whether the Blue Jays could afford to be
competitive in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   He is especially irked that the Blue Jays, who have budget
restrictions, had made what he thought was a lowball offer to
outfielder/DH Jose Canseco, who hit 46 home runs last season for
Toronto, third in the league behind Ken Griffey Jr. (56) and Belle
(49). He talked about how much he liked Toronto, and how his first
priority was to bring a winner there, but he also left little doubt
that if the Jays were rebuilding, he'd prefer to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of questions still there,'' he said, alluding
to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Boston? Clemens said he first heard only Monday of
the speculation the Sox were attempting to trade for him, though he
acknowledged hearing similar talk at the trading deadline last
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much is out of my control,'' said Clemens, ignoring the
understanding he has with the Jays that he can request a deal if
they're not a contender, a right he already exercised once, when he
instructed agent Alan Hendricks last summer to ask Toronto to
explore trade options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll sit back and reserve an answer until it looks like it
might happen. It may or may not happen, but I'll reserve comment
until then. It seems so farfetched right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's indisputable that the Sox have discussed such a deal
internally and have let the Blue Jays know they're interested. But
the Blue Jays are looking for impact players in return and it's
debatable whether the Sox could put together a deal that would
work, especially one that would compete against the Yankees,
Indians, and the two Texas teams, the Rangers and Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting closer to home would be nice,'' Clemens said from his
home in Katy, a suburb of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said he believed the Red Sox are ``trying to be
competitive'' and said he enjoyed the ``intensity'' he found in
Boston. Asked point-blank if Vaughn's departure or the fallout from
his own leaving would preclude him from accepting a trade to
Boston, he was less forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' he said. ``I don't know what's been
said. I don't know anyone's feelings except Duquette.''
</P>
<P>
   On Vaughn's leaving, he said: ``They've got their agenda. They
know who they want and don't want. I just hope they don't try to
make Mo look bad like they tried to make me look bad when my
situation arose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who already have signed Jose Offerman and will add at
least one and perhaps two more front-line starters, will have a
number of players (Troy O'Leary, Reggie Jefferson, Jeff Frye) that
they will try to trade, perhaps in a package to obtain a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthander Radinsky, who began last season as the Dodgers'
closer, would make a nice replacement for Greg Swindell, who signed
with Arizona. The Cubs, Yankees, Cardinals, Dodgers, and Orioles
all reportedly have interest, too.

 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
TEMPE, Ariz. _ Football is a team game in which an especially
talented quarterback sometimes can transcend the team and the game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That was the case Sunday when Jake ``The Snake'' Plummer, in his
second season as a pro, almost made up for the fact that the
Arizona Cardinals couldn't run the ball, couldn't block and
couldn't play defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Cardinals couldn't push the Dallas Cowboys out
of sole possession of first place in the NFC East. But it came down
to the last play and a disputed call _ or non-call _ by a referee.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys prevailed 35-28, but the shootout at Sun Devil
Stadium was a signal that after a decade of mediocrity, the
Cardinals are rising. And it also was a signal that the Cowboys,
Snake-bitten for 314 yards in the second half, need immediate
repairs on a ravaged secondary.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were properly respectful of the slippery Plummer,
who brought his team almost all the way out of a 28-0 hole. He had
the Cardinals on the Dallas five-yard line as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's going to be special,'' said Cowboys All-Pro
cornerback Deion Sanders. ``He looked like a young Fran Tarkenton
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Centers, veteran fullback for the Cardinals, said after
Plummer's 465-yard passing display: ``Our quarterback had a
coming-out today and showed the heart we want to exemplify on this
team. He is a great leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals felt Plummer would have pulled off one of the
great comebacks in NFL history if Kevin Smith had been cited for
interference against Rob Moore on the game's final play.
</P>
<P>
   Smith tangled with Moore in the end zone. One official reached
into his hip pocket but then took his hand away without the flag in
it.
</P>
<P>
   There did not appear to be deliberate interference, but
Cardinals coach Vince Tobin argued that ``the way they explain the
rule to me, the defender, if he contacts the receiver, is supposed
to be looking at the ball, and he wasn't doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals linebacker Jamir Miller was even more outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials threw the game,'' he fumed. ``They must be on
the Cowboys' payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Smith fouled, he had another in a long string of
shaky performances. But he is not the only problem in the Dallas
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders suffered a sprained big toe in the second quarter. He
spent most of the game on the sidelines, though even in a hobbled
state he made a critical interception in the second quarter to set
up a Dallas touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Although X-rays revealed no fracture, Sanders was wearing only
one red lizard shoe after the game. He had a large, soft house shoe
on his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   His injury is virtually identical to the one that caused Cowboys
center Clay Shiver to miss Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   With Sanders hurt and capable nickel back (and kickoff returner)
Kevin Mathis out with a broken forearm, the Dallas defense was no
match for Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cowboys won because they shut down Arizona's running
game (32 yards total) and moved the ball consistently themselves
without suffering a sack or a turnover. Emmitt Smith rushed for 118
yards, and Troy Aikman threw for 208, completing 14 of 18 passes,
including 13 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also moved a step closer to locking up a playoff
slot by raising their record to 7-3 _ 6-0 in their division.
</P>
<P>
   Next up on the schedule is Seattle, with venerable quarterback
Warren Moon still shining brightly, to be followed by Minnesota,
which has the best record in the NFC (9-1) and three of the best
receivers in Cris Carter, Jake Reed and the likely Rookie of the
Year, Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how well-balanced the Cowboys may be, if they
can't stop a hot quarterback, they could have trouble looming.

LOTT'S SON MAKING OWN WAY AT UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Where UCLA linebacker Ryan Nece is concerned,
blood is indeed thicker than color _ uniform color.
</P>
<P>
   A redshirt freshman, Nece is thrilled to be a Bruin. His mother,
Cathy Thomas, is thrilled he's a Bruin, and his father, Ronnie
Lott, is thrilled he's a Bruin.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, thrilled. Even this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of people ask me how I could let Ryan go to
UCLA,'' said Lott, the former San Francisco 49ers great who played
for the Trojans. ``I tell them it wasn't by choice. He wasn't
recruited by USC, and going to UCLA was his decision. So I say,
great. It was his choice.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Bruins are, well, thrilled. Nece started his career as a
safety _ just like dad _ then stunned his parents by switching to
linebacker last spring. Using speed, instincts and smarts, he has
become one of UCLA's best players, ranking second in tackles (58),
second in tackles for loss (eight) and second in sacks (four).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing very well,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said.
``(Freshman) Robert Thomas is a talented player and he's having a
hard time getting on the field because Ryan's playing so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nece's choice of college and position differ from the expected
path, from Lott's path, but they aren't surprising. Despite having
a famous father _ ``In high school, people knew me by who my dad
was'' he said _ he's very much his mother's son.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Thomas never married Lott. While he was winning Super
Bowls in San Francisco, she was rearing Ryan in San Bernardino,
instilling her values and faith and giving him her maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Ryan to be his own person, not live in the shadow of
his dad,'' she said. ``It's been hard because people have certain
expectations. But I trusted him to deal with it and he's proven
himself by making good choices.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nece was six, Cathy married Bill Thomas, and the adults
have turned a potentially combustible mix into a seamless support
network with Nece at the core. He does not think of Thomas as a
stepfather but a father, and he's close to Lott, who lives in San
Francisco but visits Nece on Tuesdays when he's in town to tape
``Hardcore Football'' for Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship has progressed through the years,'' Nece
said. ``We're close and getting closer. We've become more like best
friends. We talk to each other more like men.''
</P>
<P>
   The constant in Nece's life, though, is Cathy. She was there
when metal plates were inserted in his head following a car wreck
in 1996. She was there when people he'd never met _ people who
didn't know his last name _ asked about his father. She was there
during the strange recruiting process and she emphasized books over
blitzes. An honor student, Nece plans to attend med school
eventually, with a focus on osteopathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan really is a tribute to Cathy,'' Lott said. ``She had to
decipher all that stuff. While he was going to Super Bowl games,
she was the one saying, `You've got to be a student.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She did a tremendous job and he was also exposed to a lot of
good people, like Joe (Montana) and Jerry (Rice). Seeing those
guys, knowing they weren't jerks and how hard they worked, really
helped him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nece played safety and quarterback at Pacific High and didn't
have a strong allegiance to either UCLA or USC. But Toledo took a
special interest, having recruited and coached Lott at USC, where
he was the secondary coach from 1976-78.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans didn't write or call until they heard Nece had
committed to UCLA, he said, but it wasn't personal. Because of
staff changes, USC didn't recruit the Inland Empire in 1996-97. As
a result, Moreno Valley's Santi Hall, Redlands' Jason Stephens,
Alta Loma's Kenyon Coleman and Nece all signed with UCLA in Feb.
'97.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ryan said, `Hey, USC hasn't recruited me,' I thought it
was strange,'' Lott said. ``But I didn't want to be one of those
fathers who said, `Why aren't you recruiting my son?' So I tried to
stay out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One week before signing day, I called one of their assistants
and said, `Hey, are you guys looking at him?' They said no, so I
left it alone. The next thing I knew, he signed with UCLA, and I
thought that was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Nece's switch from safety to linebacker _ it was UCLA's
suggestion _ was not as well received by either parent, especially
Cathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linebacker was foreign to all of us,'' she said. ``I was
unsure. I second-guessed coach Toledo's decision in the sense that
I didn't know much about it. Once he was comfortable, we were all
fine with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins didn't think Nece had the speed to play safety. He
didn't have the size to play inside linebacker, either, but in
their system he is protected by defensive linemen and given room to
roam. He's rarely matched one-on-one with 300 pounders, and after a
few tips from Lott _ tackling angles, leverage, etc. _ he adjusted
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Nece is his mother's son, but he is his father's football
player. Not in position or reputation or even potential but in
approach: tireless and cerebral. He studies film each Sunday and
eliminates all distractions once he steps on the bus Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from my dad that the game has got to be mental,'' he
said. ``I watched my dad and saw what made him great. I watched all
those guys (the 49ers) when I was young and asked myself what made
them great. It was always their mental state, the way they
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Nece will prepare for USC as he prepared for Washington and
Oregon State, with an added, exhilarating dose of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big game, first because I'm at UCLA and second because
it's the team my dad played for,'' he said, smiling. ``It's good to
have a family rivalry.''

NEW YORK TO GRANT $12 MILLION FOR CANCER STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hoping to recapture the New York region's
pre-eminence as the United States' center of medical and biological
research, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is expected to announce Tuesday
that the city will commit $12 million to a major research study on
cancer that will involve 300,000 residents whose health and
lifestyle will be tracked for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The study, called the New York Cancer Project, is the first
major initiative of a newly created consortium of the region's 25
leading medical schools, hospitals and academic institutes. They
have been longtime rivals but are now eager to take advantage of a
boom in federal grant-giving and to lure the nation's best
scientists to the region.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 15 years, New York state has slipped from its
perch as the top recipient of grants from the National Institutes
of Health, the country's largest and most prestigious source of
biomedical research money. The state is now third, behind
California and Massachusetts. New York City is second among cities,
behind Boston.
</P>
<P>
   New York's turf-conscious medical and academic establishment for
years paid little notice to the decline. But it was jolted into
action when the federal government recently announced that it would
double the NIH research budget during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time,'' Giuliani said, ``the city is providing
seed money that will launch a major cancer research project that
will bring together the unparalleled resources of New York City's
medical community in the fight against cancer.'' Officials said
every member of the consortium would play a role in the cancer
project, with each institution contributing its expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the perfect project to ask for the cooperation and
collaboration of all the institutions, because it's quite clear
that no one institution could accomplish the ambitious goal they
have in place,'' said Dr. Arnold Levine, president of Rockefeller
University, which will work on the identification of new genes that
predispose people to cancer and develop ways to prevent the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer project, which appears to be the largest
population-based study in the nation, is unique among such studies
because of its size and scope, officials said. The study will
include the collection of blood and urine samples, extensive
face-to-face questioning of participants about their health
behavior and an intensive public education campaign about cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds very big to me,'' said Dr. Brenda Edwards, the
associate director for cancer surveillance research at the National
Cancer Institute, which is part of the NIH and sets aside 80
percent of its budget for external grants. ``I would think they are
positioning themselves to be very competitive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The New York cancer study is one of a number of long-term,
population-based studies under way across the country. Others have
recruited a smaller number of people.
</P>
<P>
   A model for the New York project is the Framingham Heart Study,
which has followed the health of more than 5,000 residents in a
middle-class Boston suburb for 50 years, and in doing so, advanced
the nation's knowledge of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   With cancer expected in a few years to overtake heart disease as
the leading cause of death, the New York study will follow
residents to see which ones develop cancer and which ones do not.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the city's richly diverse population, the project is
expected to yield new findings about the genetic and environmental
factors related to various types of cancers and other diseases, and
lead to better methods for early detection and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to look at whatever cancers are most prevalent
in ethnic groups and try to understand why that's the case so we
can ultimately develop treatment,'' said Dr. Maria Mitchell, the
president of the consortium and a former chairwoman of the Health
and Hospitals Corp. board. ``Historically, a lot of research has
been done in more homogeneous groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The project will take place in two stages, with the first phase
seeking to recruit 5,000 healthy New York City residents for an
initial two-year period. The project will then grow to include
300,000 New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The huge volume of information from study participants, whose
ages will range from 35 to 64, will be overseen by the consortium,
which was formed a year and a half ago as Amdec, for Academic
Medicine Development Co.
</P>
<P>
   City officials anticipate that the cancer project will have
substantial economic benefits for the city, generating $500 million
over the life of the 20-year project.
</P>
<P>
   The city's investment of $12 million from the Economic
Development Corp. for a two-year pilot project is likely to lead to
$200 million from the federal government to finance the full term
of the project. In addition, hundreds of millions of dollars in
financing is expected from philanthropic foundations, businesses,
large drug companies and venture capital.

MEDICARE HMO CUTBACKS STRAND THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS

 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Conn., Pa., Minn.)  (lb) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, N.Y. _ A few years back, when they envisioned
their retirement, John and Mary Greenan saw themselves relaxing on
Cape Cod's pristine sands in the summer and viewing Vermont's
glorious foliage in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   With wise investments and their monthly Social Security checks,
the Greenans, of this Westchester County city, were able to indulge
their passion for travel. In addition to Cape Cod and Vermont,
there were trips to Florida, Maryland, Virginia and the Outer Banks
of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But now the trips will be fewer, and the Greenans' dreams for a
retirement spent roaming the country seem out of reach. By year's
end, the couple will spend thousands of dollars a year on a new
insurance policy because their insurer, a Medicare HMO under Oxford
Health Plans, will stop covering them and thousands of other
elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call these the golden years,'' said Mrs. Greenan, 68, a
youthful-looking woman who before her retirement was a registrar
for Mount Vernon Hospital. ``But I don't see it. To me, they're all
tarnished.''
</P>
<P>
   While being forced to switch health insurance can be an
inconvenience to healthy young and middle-aged adults, it can be
even more traumatic and burdensome for the elderly, particularly
the frail elderly, many of whom see several doctors for different
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   So when Oxford announced in October that it was ending its
Medicare health-maintenance organization in 23 counties in New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, the news sent
elderly people scrambling to find alternative coverage.
</P>
<P>
   As of Nov. 2, 26,601 clients had received notices in the mail
that they would be dropped on Dec. 31; subscribers in New York City
will still be covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about having to choose a new doctor, being old on a
limited income, and having multiple illnesses,'' said Jane
Rosenblum, program coordinator of the Health Insurance Information
Counseling and Assistance Program in Rockland County, which helps
older people explore their options.
</P>
<P>
   Some people like the Greenans, who have soured on HMOs, have
decided to spend several thousand dollars more on supplemental
insurance to fill the gaps in traditional Medicare. Others are
searching for health-maintenance organizations that are taking new
clients. Still others will fall back on basic Medicare coverage.
</P>
<P>
   For Allen Martin, 70, who lives in Dobbs Ferry and is insured by
Oxford, there is slim hope that he will find another HMO that will
enroll him. He has renal failure and receives kidney dialysis three
days a week. According to health-insurance specialists,
health-maintenance organizations are not required to accept
kidney-dialysis patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried seven or eight HMOs, but no one will take me,''
said Martin, a retired electronics-store manager. ``It's like
taking a man and throwing him to the wolves. I have no idea how I'm
going to pay for dialysis. It's all I think about: Dec. 31. That
date is coming up. It's very depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Martin's wife, Philomena, 71, has done the bulk of the
shopping for a new health-maintenance organization. ``First I
called Blue Choice and I was told I would be accepted but he
couldn't,'' she said. ``Then I called Physicians Health Care. Both
told me, `We don't cover people with pre-existing renal disease.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are so many people in our position,'' she said.
``But everywhere I go, I get the same thing: We feel sorry for you,
but we can't do anything for him. I feel like we're being put out
to pasture.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more people face similar plights. Dozens of other
health-maintenance organizations, citing similar financial
hardships, are terminating roughly 440,000 Medicare beneficiaries
in the New York region and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say they are losing money on Medicare in part
because government rates or premiums, which used to go up about 8
percent each year, are now capped at a rate of 2 percent per year
for five years by the Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenans had little time to decide what to do about their
health insurance, because soon after they learned that they would
no longer be covered by Oxford, Greenan, 73, a retired
greeting-card company executive, had an emergency angioplasty and
Mrs. Greenan has spent most of her time nursing him. ``I've had no
time to think about it,'' she said a few days after her husband's
surgery. ``Oxford has added stress to the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of joining another health-maintenance organization _ the
Greenans now consider them all shaky _ they signed up with the
American Association of Retired Persons Medigap program, a
supplement to the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program. It
will cost the Greenans $163 more a month than Oxford did and it
will not cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Health Plans, the
co-payment for an office visit in 97 percent of HMO Medicare plans
is $10 or less, and in 82 percent of HMO Medicare plans, the
co-payment is $10 or less for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the Greenans take nine medications each day, and
while those cost them about $100 a month on the Oxford managed-care
plan, they will now cost them about three times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Greenans said, the increased insurance and
medication costs will eat away at their long-planned dream of
traveling in retirement. ``We'll really have to buckle down,''
Greenan said.
</P>
<P>
   When health-maintenance organizations were introduced to elderly
citizens, many customers and advocates for the elderly were leery
of them. They worried that the companies would court only healthy
patients and ignore the very sick, and they warned that if profit
margins shrunk, the companies would drop the Medicare business
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many older people reluctantly made the switch from
traditional Medicare _ in some cases abandoning longtime doctors _
for the promise of new ones who would cost them less. Now these
customers find themselves dreading yet another upheaval in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to make a change,'' Ms. Rosenblum said. ``It's
another decision they have to make. They have enough changes in
their life already with losses _ the loss of friends, relatives,
spouses, even children sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   People being dropped by their Medicare HMOs have three basic
choices. They can enroll in another health-maintenance organization
if one is available in their area and if it has room to take new
clients. Or they can do nothing and be automatically enrolled in
Medicare, the federally financed health-insurance program for
people 65 or over or under 65 and disabled. But Medicare's
traditional fee-for-service program carries a much higher
out-of-pocket cost.
</P>
<P>
   The third option is Medigap, the supplemental insurance that
customers can buy to fill gaps in Medicare coverage. But Medigap
insurance can cost a few thousand dollars a year for the
deductibles, co-insurance payments and other outlays that
traditional Medicare does not cover.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And in any event, there is no guarantee that older people can
obtain Medigap insurance that covers prescription drugs, one of the
biggest medical expenses for elderly people. The average cost per
year for prescription drugs for the elderly is $351, according to
the American Association for Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bolotsky, coordinator of the Health Insurance Information
Counseling and Assistance Program in Westchester, said she was
struck by how little time older citizens have to find a new
insurer. ``You have Thanksgiving in November and Christmas in
December,'' she said, noting the end-of-year deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has come as a shock to them,'' she said. ``They say: `We
have to make all these calls. I asked for an application for
another HMO and I never got it.' The important thing is for them
not to make themselves sick. Stress can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray Ornstein, 68, a retired product manager and an Oxford
Medicare HMO customer who lives in Hartsdale, is looking for a
health-maintenance plan that accepts both his primary-care
physician and his dermatologist (the latter to treat chronic
psoriasis). If his internist, who is considering joining Physicians
Health Plan, does so, Ornstein will be able to keep both doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've investigated eight or 10 HMOs,'' said Ornstein, who
initially found out he was losing his insurance coverage while
watching a television news program. ``I felt annoyed that the
government didn't say we are dealing with a group of people who
have a relationship with their doctors. I'm easy to deal with
medically. But what about the older people who have serious
conditions and have to go to a new primary-care physician and new
specialists?''
</P>
<P>
   While picking new health insurance is difficult for many elderly
people, it can be particularly trying for those who live alone, who
do not have a husband, wife or child to help them navigate the
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, any decision that has to be made is more difficult
when there isn't a family member to talk to about it,'' said Alice
Deak, coordinator of the southwestern Connecticut region's
Connecticut Health Insurance Outreach Information Counseling
Eligibility and Screening program, which helps the elderly make
decisions about health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, health-maintenance organizations say they are
reducing service areas or pulling out of Medicare because of
federal regulatory burdens and because the payment they receive
from the federal government is inadequate to cover services.
``There is a lot of paperwork and a lot of jumping through hoops,''
said Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of
Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pisano said that one Medicare HMO reported that it took 200
people just to complete the application to take part in the
Medicare program. Another Medicare HMO that plans to leave some
communities, Allina Health System of Minnesota, reported that
implementing government regulations cost between $1 million and $2
million per year, she said. In many instances, Ms. Pisano said,
companies are losing money on Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   But Ornstein is skeptical. ``All these executives drawing
tremendous salaries is contributing to it,'' he said, still nervous
about his own uncertain health-care situation. ``I'm worried that
I'll find another HMO and down the road they'll go out, too.''

FOES OF INDONESIA'S PRESIDENT INTERROGATED 
</HEADLINE>
 WORDS-NYT  (rl) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In its first crackdown on political
opponents since taking office six months ago, the government of
President B.J. Habibie is interrogating prominent critics and
banning them from leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
   The targets include two respected former generals who also had
opposed former President Suharto, and Megawati Sukarnoputri, a
sister of one of Habibie's chief political rivals. A police
spokesman said more interrogations would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Government critics said Habibie was betraying his promises of
political openness and was resorting to the tactics of intimidation
employed by his predecessor, Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Together with aggressive actions against student protesters last
week, the interrogations show a rough side to Habibie's government
as it faces its first major crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The interrogations follow huge anti-government demonstrations in
recent days in which at least 16 people, including eight students,
were killed and scores were wounded. It was the worst violence here
since citywide rioting last May helped bring down Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Habibie announced that he had ordered the military
to take firm action against what he called ``subversive
movements.'' The interrogations began soon afterward, with some of
the targets taken from their homes late at night.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Monday, Habibie said, ``With concern, we see how
certain political groups have tried to use the student movement to
topple the legitimate government, obstruct the reform agenda and
damage people's trust in the government.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the president, Dewi Anwar Ibrahim, told
reporters Monday that Habibie's government is genuinely concerned
about subversion by its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Since Habibie took office, succeeding Suharto from his vice
presidential post, critics have challenged his legitimacy to lead
the country. He has thin public support and shares a delicate
balance of power with the military.
</P>
<P>
   A parliament session last week scheduled a new election for next
spring, to be followed by an electoral assembly that would name a
new president. But Habibie's opponents want to remove him
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people summoned for questioning signed a communique
last week calling for Habibie to be replaced by a transitional
government led by a presidium of community leaders, followed
immediately by elections.
</P>
<P>
   Some, but not all, of the student demonstrators supported this
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of solidarity with the military, which has come under
harsh public criticism over the shooting of demonstrators, Habibie
addressed the nation standing side by side with his military chief
and defense minister, Gen. Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
   Adnan Buyung Nasution, a prominent human rights lawyer, said the
government's harsh stance against its critics was likely to
heighten tensions. ``I fear the students will take to the streets
again, even more brutally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the targets of the interrogations, retired Gen. Kemal
Idris, entering the police headquarters Monday, said: ``Whoever
thought the intention of the communique was an act of subversion is
crazy. The purpose of the communique was as a critique of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who have been questioned include Sri Bintang Pamungkas, a
former political prisoner who is close to the student movement;
Lieut. Gen. Ali Sadikan, a former Cabinet minister and Jakarta
governor; Hariadi Dharmawan, head of the alumni association of the
University of Indonesia, and Meilondo Suwondo, a close aide to Ms.
Megawati, the opposition leader. They also include Ms. Megawati's
sister, Sukmawati Sukarnoputri. Both women are daughters of
Sukarno, Indonesia's first president.
</P>
<P>
   The national police chief, Lieut. Gen. Rusmanhadi, said the 11
people questioned would not be held in custody. He said more people
would be interrogated soon. A police spokesman said that those
interrogated would not be allowed to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Education Minister Juwono Sudarsono, a respected political
analyst, said he believed that the protests had been organized by
``radical groups'' who observed and directed the demonstrations
from nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He said these organizers had deliberately placed young students
on the front lines of confrontations, hoping to stir public anger
when they were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
   Public anger has been aroused, and Jakarta was tense and uneasy
Monday as several small student marches wound their way through the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Protests have also broken out elsewhere, with hundreds of
students demonstrating in the central Java city of Jogjakarta and
thousands more occupying the parliament building in the eastern
city of Palu.

   NEW YORK _ Menaces to society rarely declare themselves. The
pilot of the DC-10 to Miami: Is he secretly an alcoholic? The baby
sitter who always shows up on time: Does she neglect her own
children? The young man who scoops ice cream at the corner hangout:
Has he been to a doctor about that rash?
</P>
<P>
   And what of Debbie Wastba, the sweet-looking instructor assigned
to immerse the unsuspecting foreigners of ``The Primary English
Class'' in the rudiments of a new language? She seems harmless
enough at first, a bit flighty and even, perhaps, bumblingly
offensive, referring to the Chinese student as an ``old Oriental''
and practicing her Spanish on a man who is obviously Italian.
</P>
<P>
   But as the evening unfolds in the dingy New York classroom of
Israel Horovitz's black comedy, it becomes clearer that Debbie's
escalating faux pas are the troubled acts of a confused and damaged
woman and the five uncomprehending students the punching bags for
her unfocused anger and misery. Their vulnerability _ and who is an
easier target than a person who can't speak the language? _ is a
mirror on her own helplessness, and one into which she looks with
mounting self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   The canyon-size gaps _ cultural, linguistic, psychological _
between the teacher and her pupils are what Horovitz plays up both
for laughs and pathos in the revival of ``The Primary English
Class,'' which opened on Monday night at the Minetta Lane Theater.
In the original production 22 years ago, the teacher was portrayed
by Diane Keaton, and it's not hard to see why she made a splash in
the role. A bit of dithery Annie Hall-ishness could go a long way
to soften the edges of this toxic character.
</P>
<P>
   For the revival, directed by Gerald Gutierrez, the role of
Debbie has been assumed by Didi Conn, but neither she nor Gutierrez
have provided any real justification for bringing back this
unpleasant play, constructed around a gimmick. The five students _
so new to America that they arrive at the class with their luggage
_ speak only in their own languages, which are comprehensible to no
one else in the room. Thus the Frenchman (Charles Stransky) gabs
away in French to the Italian (Mark Lotito), who converses only in
Italian to the Japanese woman (Nami Hirayanagi), and so on, while
the translation of what they are saying is broadcast over the
theater's sound system.
</P>
<P>
   The device is even more cumbersome than it sounds. The
miscommunication should at the very least inspire an ``I Love
Lucy'' kind of looniness, but the non sequiturs are lame and
lifeless. The exchanges are on the order of: ``Do you speak
English?'' ``I'll say I'm hungry!'' The style of the comedy shifts
awkwardly from absurdist to naturalistic, but never seems to go far
enough in any direction; a sense of extreme frustration with the
missed opportunities is passed from the actors to the audience.
</P>
<P>
   On a technical level, too, the production is miscalculated.
(What these well-dressed Asians and Europeans with their expensive
luggage are doing in a broken-down schoolroom, rather than
enrolling in Berlitz, is certainly never addressed.) Between lines,
the actors must pause for the translations, a constraint that
short-circuits any natural conversational rhythm they might try to
establish. And during her revelatory second-act speech, delivered
as she sits at her desk, Ms. Conn is invisible to at least a third
of the audience, blocked by the backs of the actors seated
downstage.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting actors are a lackluster bunch. In parts as
monochromatic as those of the pupils tortured by Maria Callas in
``Master Class,'' they have been cast for their accents rather than
their comedic skills. The girlish Ms. Conn, in a role that might
seem well suited to the childlike persona she cultivated in movies
like ``Grease'' and ``You Light Up My Life,'' is a cold and
uninteresting presence here, someone you've given up on long before
the playwright has.

WAITING FOR WILLIAMS? YANKEES FOCUS ON BELLE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Bernie Williams' ultimate intent is to re-sign with the
Yankees, he may be running out of time. The Yankees may replace him
in their lineup by week's end, with slugger Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees' general manager Brian Cashman met with Belle and his
agent in Tucson, Ariz., Monday afternoon, and a baseball official
familiar with the negotiations said that Belle hopes to conclude a
deal either with the Yankees or the Boston Red Sox by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' aggressiveness in negotiating with Belle could be
read merely as a feint in their negotiations with the free agent
Williams: The Yankees don't want Williams and his agent, Scott
Boras, to drag out contract talks and simultaneously drive up the
center fielder's asking price. By appearing as if they are serious
about Belle, the Yankees can at least attempt to force Williams to
accelerate his timetable.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees, leery of waiting too long and being left
without a hitter to adequately replace Williams' presence in their
lineup, seem to be wholly serious about Belle. The team has been
engaging in the background checks that are typical before any
player is acquired, and Yankees' manager Joe Torre has told others
in the organization that he would love to have Belle's production
and is confident he would be able to cope with whatever
complications Belle's petulant behavior may create.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, 32, batted .328 with 49 home runs and 152 RBIs for the
Chicago White Sox last season, the seventh consecutive season he
drove in more than 100 runs. His defensive skills as a left fielder
have improved, and he is undoubtedly one of the greatest offensive
players of his era. A right-handed hitter, he would fit in neatly
in the Yankees' cleanup slot, between the left-handed hitters Paul
O'Neill and Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   How he would fit into the harmonious Yankees' clubhouse is
another matter altogether. Belle has a long history of disciplinary
action taken against him, for everything from throwing a baseball
at a fan in the stands to leveling Milwaukee second baseman
Fernando Vina on a tag play, and his contentious relationship with
the news media is well known.
</P>
<P>
   More pertinent to the Yankees will be Belle's ability to exist
with the structure of a team, and as they check around, this is
what they are probably hearing: that Belle is self-absorbed and
sometimes bizarre, that his antics can be a great distraction at
times, but that he shows up ready to play every day, that he is
smart and extremely intense in all his at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of how much Belle wants the Yankees
or the Red Sox to pay him. Executives with other teams have heard
that Belle hopes to be the game's highest-paid player and is asking
for a contract equal to or greater than the one Mike Piazza
recently signed with the Mets (seven years, $91 million); if that
is so, it seems unlikely the Yankees will be willing to bid that
high.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Yankees might be willing to make Belle a
lucrative offer of, say, four years, for $10 million to $14 million
a season. Belle, working within a monthlong contractual window,
must decide by Dec. 2 whether he wants to sign with another team or
resume his current contract with the White Sox, which has three
years and $30 million remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Williams will be making a swing to the East Coast, as well,
meeting with the Red Sox later this week and then, at an
undetermined time, with the Orioles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yankee officials will meet Wednesday with Brian Jordan, a
free-agent outfielder, but Jordan is in the vortex of a bidding war
among Baltimore, Atlanta and the Yankees, and whoever signs him may
have to pay him as an upper-echelon player, for $8 million to $9
million a season.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore may be the front-runner in the financial jousting for
pitcher Todd Stottlemyre, making what one club official said was a
four-year, $26 million offer. At least five other teams are
involved in the bidding for the right-handed Stottlemyre, and the
Yankees, who initially expressed interest, have been informed that
they will need to weigh in soon. The Yankees, too, are among the
teams competing for the services of left-hander Scott Radinsky.
Boston and the Chicago Cubs are also in the running.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who had been wrestling with the status of General
Manager Steve Phillips, postponed their initial offer to B.J.
Surhoff, the veteran outfielder. Baltimore slightly increased its
three-year offer to Surhoff, to $12.75 million from $12 million,
with some of the money to be paid out in deferrals that do not bear
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees completed a minor trade with Minnesota, swapping
minor league infielder Allen Butler for Dan Naulty, a 28-year-old
right-hander with a history of injury. Naulty, who has 97 career
appearances, went 0-2 with a 4.61 ERA for the Twins last season.

OTHER than having more square footage, when Roger Clemens is at
home with his kids, he is no different than any other father who
wants to be a father.
</P>
<P>
   He is devoted.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a backyard playground that would make Richie Rich
wish he could be one of Clemens' K-Kids _ there are waterfalls, an
elaborate pool, a playroom, a workout room, a guest house, an
indoor full-court gym, batting machines, a giant fort and
trampolines _ Clemens simply wants to give his kids what all
fathers should want to give.
</P>
<P>
   Time.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to run to the back yard every day and wrestle around
with his boys _ Koby, Kory, Kacy and Kody, who range in age from 2
to 11.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to talk with his sons about things face-to-face, stay
involved. He wants to toss baseballs to them every day if that's
what they want, or let them beat him in basketball, or just stand
there leaning against a wall like proud fathers do and watch them
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are everything,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to make funny faces and weird noises and be there when
they start asking questions that fathers should answer. He wants
Houston. He wants to be home. He wants to be Dad all the time.
</P>
<P>
   But he realizes he is the Rocket. And the vexing conflict of it
all, the reason it will not be a simple thing getting back home and
into an Astros uniform, was clear Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There was Clemens earning an unprecedented fifth Cy Young Award.
There he was, the barrel-chested warrior, in the middle of a posh
estate in a posh neighborhood, living a dream.
</P>
<P>
   And it was all because he can throw a baseball like few others,
and right now the Toronto Blue Jays are paying him handsomely to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the cameras the business end of his steely stare, the
one that has accounted for more than 3,000 strikeouts and a Hall of
Fame career. He talked about the hunger to win a world championship
that still eats at him and the good things that Toronto has done
for him.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted being thrilled about the Astros' acquisition of Ken
Caminiti and talked about coming home to a Houston team that is
``at the point where it can go for it all.''
</P>
<P>
   But he realized he was standing in the middle of a life that the
Blue Jays helped him afford, asking only for the best of the Rocket
in return. And as tempting as it might be to stomp his feet and
demand a ticket home, that's what Clemens will continue to give
Toronto until the Blue Jays let him down.
</P>
<P>
   Before he chooses to exercise a contract option that would allow
him to demand a trade, likely to Houston, Clemens will give Toronto
a chance to make championship-caliber acquisitions or let him down
by going young, ``where I wouldn't fit into their plans.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Clemens never has been to those who have helped him
become a superstar is unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
   He still keeps close ties to the University of Texas and even
has a shrub sculpted into the form of a longhorn steer near the
entrance of his home. He was a faithful Boston Red Sox star for 13
years before the relationship soured and ``they didn't want me
around anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   And as long as the Blue Jays show the kind of hunger that still
has Clemens waking up early every day for six-mile runs and
weightlifting sessions, he will be true to the team that helped him
to his fifth Cy Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to do what it takes to help (Toronto) get the
players in,'' Clemens said. ``I'm willing to make phone calls. It's
all about winning and competing. With the talent we have, we're
close. That's what will be disheartening about it if they don't do
what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is watching the Astros closely, specifically what
happens with ace free agent Randy Johnson. But most significantly,
Clemens is watching what the Blue Jays do, or do not do, in
negotiations with slugger Jose Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be taking a couple of steps backward if they don't
sign him,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe then Clemens would ask for the trade to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question he wants to be here year-round. He is a
devoted father. You could see it Monday when his K-Kids bounced
into the room and those steely eyes softened.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the live TV shots and calls from friends, Koby and Kory,
the older boys, asked to throw a football around with their dad,
and that is exactly what Clemens did. When Kody, the 2-year-old,
smashed his head into Clemens' leg like a battering ram in the
middle of interviews, Clemens stopped and laughed, ``Hey, kid!''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when his kids tried to douse him with champagne, Clemens
leaned over low, so the little ones could pour the bubbly down his
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes how nice it would be to have these kinds of days all
the time. To be home. The Astros realize how nice it would be to
see the Rocket here, too. But this is not the Astros' decision to
make, and Clemens will not allow it to be his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't lost the desire to do what Toronto has paid me very
well to do,'' Clemens said. ``We need to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Toronto's game to win or lose.

   HANOI, Vietnam _ The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, a conductorless
ensemble from New York, performed before sold-out audiences last
weekend at the newly refurbished Hanoi Opera House. It was the
first American orchestra to play in this country since the Vietnam
War ended in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The concert on Saturday was a high point of the social season in
Hanoi, like opening night at the Met with bottled water instead of
champagne. The opera house, a scaled-down version of the Palais
Garnier in Paris, built by the French colonial administration at
the turn of the century, was splendidly refurbished last year by
the Vietnamese government. Its facade was brilliantly lighted as
the audience arrived turned out in its fanciest Western-style
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling proof of the event's symbolic significance
was the presence of Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, who led the Vietnamese
Army to victories over both France and the U.S.-backed regime in
Saigon. When Giap arrived wearing a faded, humble blue suit of the
Ho Chi Minh era, audience members in the lobby bowed and softly
applauded.
</P>
<P>
   The program comprised selections from Beethoven's ballet, ``The
Creatures of Prometheus''; Haydn's Sinfonia Concertante, Barber's
Adagio for Strings and Prokofiev's ``Classical'' Symphony. The
Barber was well known to the audience from the soundtrack of
``Platoon,'' since Hollywood films about the war are among the most
popular titles on Vietnam's pirated-video market. But Julian Fifer,
the founder and president of Orpheus, said the piece had been
selected before Hanoi was added to the tour itinerary, because of a
perceived need to include an American work that would not be too
challenging for audiences in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps fitting that the first American orchestra to
perform in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, one of the world's
last remaining outposts of communism, should be Orpheus. The
ensemble operates as a collective, its musicians sharing equally in
running its programs.
</P>
<P>
   The players arrived in Hanoi on Thursday, just after Veterans
Day had been celebrated in the United States. It was a particularly
emotional experience for Fifer, who called it ``the realization of
a lifelong dream.''
</P>
<P>
   As an undergraduate at Columbia University in the early 70s,
Fifer was a leading member of the student anti-war movement. Before
organizing Orpheus, in 1972, he formed a group called Music for
Peace, which performed chamber music at the fountain in Lincoln
Center Plaza to raise money for the cause and handed out anti-war
pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orchestra and I are thrilled to be here,'' Fifer said,
``to communicate directly through music making, the best bridge
that can be built and the best statement we can make about our
common humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's concert and one on Sunday were the centerpiece of
Orpheus' eight-country tour of Southeast Asia; today the group was
to perform in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese, ordinarily reserved, welcomed the orchestra
effusively. The demand for tickets was great, so much so, said Bui
Gia Tuong, a cellist who studied with Mstislav Rostropovich at the
Moscow Conservatory, that it would have taken some half-dozen
concerts in the 700-seat opera house to accommodate everyone who
wanted to attend. The tickets cost as much as $30 each, an amount
far out of the reach of most Vietnamese people. The orchestra
therefore invited the students and faculty of the Hanoi National
Conservatory of Music to a rehearsal on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus may be conductorless, but it is far from leaderless: in
theory, each of the 26 members of this musical collective is a
leader, free to critique the other players and help shape the
overall interpretation. As a result, rehearsals sometimes devolve
into musical brawls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we've got this far,'' said David Singer, a
clarinetist who has performed with Orpheus since 1977. ``In
rehearsals, we all have this fantasy that we can say something that
will make a difference. It's crazy. Sometimes it's like the
Knesset, everybody hollering at the same time. We've had chairs
thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hanoi rehearsal on Saturday was a sedate affair by Orpheus
standards, perhaps because of the audience, which nearly filled the
opera house. The session began with a run-through of the Haydn
Sinfonia Concertante in B flat, which sounded ragged to these ears,
but at the end of the first movement, the audience, heedless of
etiquette, burst into excited applause.
</P>
<P>
   As the players thrashed out fine points in the score, the
musicians in attendance raptly witnessed a process that could in no
way have resembled the orthodox rehearsals they were accustomed to
at the conservatory. Four hours later, most of them were still
there for a question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   Some seemed befuddled as to how the orchestra could exist
without an authoritarian artistic leader. But when a young woman
said, ``After hearing you play, I am a little concerned about the
future of conductors,'' laughter and applause rippled through the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus performed the Haydn work with elegance and wit, but the
Beethoven ballet sounded small, because of the hall's dry, distant
acoustics. The audience reacted warmly if a bit tentatively,
seeming not quite sure of itself. Musicians from the conservatory
who were in attendance, however, offered unrestrained praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that they can play together so well without a
conductor,'' said Kim Xuan Hieu, a horn player and first-year
instructor. ``They play like a family.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience responded with increasing enthusiasm as the evening
wore on, rising to a whooping ovation for the first encore, the
Overture to Rossini's ``Barbiere di Siviglia.'' At the end, a slim
young woman dressed in a hot pink ao dai, as the snug-fitting shift
suit that is the national costume of Vietnamese women is called,
went onstage to present a huge bouquet of flowers _ to whom?
</P>
<P>
   She stood at the center of the semicircle, where a podium might
have been but wasn't, flustered and blushing as brightly as her
dress, until Eric Wyrick, the concertmaster, graciously took the
flowers off her hands. As the audience cheered, she bowed low and
beat a hasty retreat.

 &HT;    Convention for Baptists kicks off
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ga. _ After a weekend of evangelizing in this city on
the Chattahoochee River, Georgia Baptists gathered at the Columbus
Civic Center Monday evening to kick off their 177th annual
convention.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,200 registered ``messengers,'' or official attendees,
and their families were scattered throughout the rows of blue seats
for an evening meeting that was more singing, preaching and
greeting than reporting and voting.
</P>
<P>
   That balance changes today, when hundreds more Baptists are
expected for a long day of business. The day's plans include
election of a new state president and a vote on an amendment to the
convention's constitution that will exclude any church deemed too
accommodating of homosexual behavior or charismatic worship.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, approved by the convention's executive committee,
defines such a congregation as one that ``knowingly takes, or has
taken, any action to affirm, approve or endorse homosexual
behavior, or separates itself from historic Baptist tenets through
non-biblical worship practices and theology which encourage members
to speak in tongues, or to participate in the practice of `being
slain, in the spirit,' or to engage in worship practices that are
divisive and disruptive and which exclude them from the scriptural
expression of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic worship practices usually are associated with
Pentecostal churches.
</P>
<P>
   Convention executive director J. Robert White told the executive
committee Monday that the two portions of the amendment will be
voted on separately because of concern expressed by several people
about linking the two issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. J. Gerald Harris, 57, pastor of Eastside Baptist Church
in Marietta, is expected to be elected president of the convention,
representing 1.2 million Baptists in more than 3,300 churches.
Harris headed the committee that drew up the proposed
constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Harris ministered at churches in North Carolina, South Carolina,
Mississippi and at Peachtree Corners Baptist Church in Norcross
before going to Eastside in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The convention follows a weekend of evangelism called ``Cross
Over Columbus,'' during which, officials say, 515 people were
converted to Christianity by 1,700 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing President Frank Cox, pastor of North Metro Baptist
Church in Lawrenceville, said he is praying that the convention
will operate harmoniously.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Baptists don't always have to agree on everything, my
prayer is that we will have a sense when we leave here that God has
done a work.''

NO PENALTY LIKELY IN PARCELLS INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All signs point to a quick resolution, with the
likelihood of no significant disciplinary action, in the National
Football League's investigation of Bill Parcells in the possible
violation of a rule against contacting a player from another team.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, coach of the New York Jets, admits he telephoned
Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe, his former player. But even
though Parcells said he made the call only to thank Bledsoe for
shaking his hand after the teams met Oct. 19, that may have
violated a league memo. The Sept. 1 memo reads, ``In-season
contact, even if it does not constitute tampering, reflects poor
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was launched by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue,
and not the Patriots, a league spokesman said. Tagliabue had read
about the phone call and sent a letter to the Jets last week. Jets'
president Steve Gutman responded. There will most likely be no
additional correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday about his conversation with Bledsoe, Parcells said,
``My reaction is that tampering is interference with somebody with
an employer-employee relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The league has no plans to look into another matter supposedly
involving Parcells, which appears to be erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Dolphins Coach Jimmy Johnson denied that they had
spoken about the health of Patriots wide receiver Terry Glenn.
According to a television report, Parcells learned from Bledsoe
that Glenn would not face the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Monday, ``I have no idea what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' vice president for media relations, Harvey Greene,
said it was the Patriots who told the Dolphins about Glenn's
injury, as league rules require.

RETURN TO LOS ANGELES? NFL HAS OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the Rams and Raiders fled four seasons ago, the Los
Angeles market has been a black hole for the National Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   While St. Louis snared the Rams and Oakland took the Raiders
back, the NFL has expanded to Charlotte, Jacksonville and
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that expansion will yield a 32nd team. It
should. Thirty-one is too odd. If expansion arrives, the name in
the envelope may not be Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The winner could be Houston, whose Oilers left in 1996, and
where a well-regarded bid by Bob McNair could catch the NFL's
fancy. So the league has one city to play off another, and two Los
Angeles bidders to play off each other. The setup could not elate
the league more.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL does not always make the expected decision. When
Baltimore and St. Louis were favorites for expansion in 1993, the
league chose Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   You never know what will happen when the owners meet on Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope among two high-powered Los Angeles groups that
the NFL feels it must return to the country's second-largest TV
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down, the NFL knows it must be in Los Angeles,'' Michael
Ovitz, the former talent agent, said during an interview in
Manhattan last week. ``Los Angeles is the world's 11th-largest
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's Hollywood group _ including Tom Cruise, Kevin Costner,
Shaquille O'Neal and the venture capitalist Ted Forstmann _ wants
to build a 77,000-seat stadium and 1.2 million-square-foot mall in
Carson. If the bid fails, Ovitz will at least have a snazzy cast
for a film.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Roski Jr. is Ovitz's rival. Ovitz is a renowned deal
maker, but he has never owned a sports team or erected a sports
facility. Roski owns the Los Angeles Kings with Philip Anschutz;
together they are building the downtown Staples Center that will
house the Kings, the Lakers and the Clippers. Last week, Roski and
Anschutz exercised an option to buy 25 percent of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   His plan is to gut the innards of the 75-year-old Los Angeles
Coliseum, keep the familiar exterior, and rebuild it into a
67,000-seat stadium with dandy sightlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a defining stadium for the NFL,'' Roski said.
</P>
<P>
   To win hearts and votes, Roski must overcome the owners'
residual distaste for the Coliseum's inner-city neighborhood, which
is part of Exposition Park and adjacent to the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area has changed,'' Roski said. ``Close to $6 billion has
been invested in the area the last four or five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski would also have to sell the Silverton Hotel Casino in Las
Vegas, Nev. Last week, The Los Angeles Times reported that he owned
the casino. NFL rules prohibit casino ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the rule, I'll accept it and live within it,'' Roski
said in a telephone interview yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's plan _ which began as a discussion with the real estate
developer Herbert Glimcher about a mall _ is to create a new
experience, with a Mission-style stadium with bells that would ring
after a home-team touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the owners to see if they want to go back to where
they've been,'' Ovitz said. ``What works in Los Angeles is
something new, fresh and exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men say their sites would be the most central and most
reachable on Sunday afternoons. Ovitz said Carson is 10 minutes
from downtown, 25 from Beverly Hills and 35 from Pasadena. Six
million people live within 20 minutes of Carson, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All major freeways come right to the area,'' Ovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Roski rejected the Carson site for his arena because it is a
landfill that needs a state-approved $35 million cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll take time and money,'' Ovitz said. ``There's no flat
land in L.A. without something dumped on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski said: ``At the Coliseum, we don't have to face an
environmental process. All the infrastructure work is done. We
don't have to buy the land.''
</P>
<P>
   The team will cost Ovitz, Roski or McNair plenty. Thanks to the
$70 million a year that each team will get from CBS, ABC, Fox and
ESPN, the NFL can justify the $530 million that Al Lerner paid for
the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've told us it won't be less than Cleveland,'' said Roski,
who would own at least half the team and stadium.
</P>
<P>
   McNair loaded up for the purchase last week by selling the bulk
of his power company, Cogen Technologies, for $1.1 billion and $350
million in assumed debt.
</P>
<P>
   It may not matter that Los Angeles and Houston fans did not
mourn for their lost teams as Browns fans did. What may matter is
the moneyed enthusiasm of the bidders, who will be happy to force
their cash upon the NFL's owners.

AIDED BY MEDIATOR, UNION AND ABC WILL RESUME TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ABC and its union of 2,200 off-camera workers have
agreed to resume contract negotiations, perhaps as early as this
week, with the help of a federal mediator, officials on both sides
said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-week-old lockout of members of the National Association of
Broadcast Employees and Technicians in New York and four other
cities will remain in effect, however, unless the union agrees to
give the network warning of any future job actions, an ABC
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to return to the table, where discussions broke
off Oct. 5, came after U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman
intervened in the dispute by talking with leaders of the company
and the union.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides still await a ruling by the National Labor
Relations Board over whether ABC's refusal to provide certain
information about a new health-care plan _ information network
officials say they do not have _ constitutes an unfair labor
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Hoover, an ABC spokeswoman, described the resumption of
talks as ``very, very pleasing'' to network executives. ``Obviously
that's what we want to do, is settle the contract,'' Ms. Hoover
said.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Monday, ABC executives sent an e-mail to high-ranking
employees expressing optimism about the news. The union also placed
an upbeat message on its emergency phone line about Herman's
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The network's video editors, engineers, camera operators and
other technical workers spent 19 months working without a contract
before staging a 24-hour strike Nov. 2. ABC responded by refusing
to let them return to work unless they vowed to give notice _ 72
hours for in-studio programs, two weeks for shows on the road _
about additional strikes.
</P>
<P>
   While the dispute over the new health plan was the official
reason for the strike, the two sides also have broad differences
over several other issues. Among the most important is how many
temporary workers should be allowed, and how much control the union
should maintain over new machines.
</P>
<P>
   A Labor Department official said that Herman met last week and
had ``intense'' telephone talks over the weekend with both Robert
Iger, the president of ABC, and Morton Bahr, the president of the
Communication Workers of America, which is the broadcast workers'
parent union. Her goal, the official said, is ``to get the two
sides talking and end this dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Donahue, a spokesman for the union, said Herman's
involvement was ``clearly pivotal'' in the resumption of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view her attention and her time and resources as beneficial
to an effort to end this lockout so that our members can return to
work,'' he said. ``We are willing to explore through the efforts of
the secretary any and all mechanisms by which the company can be
forced to end this illegal lockout.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, a government
agency that helped settle the United Parcel Service strike, will
oversee the new talks. A time and place for resumed negotiations
has not yet been set and an individual mediator has not yet been
selected.

USC HOPES TO MIX WELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Instead of letting them go home during the summer,
USC basketball coach Henry Bibby forced the players to stay in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Their days were spent getting to know each other, lifting
weights and playing pickup games in steamy gyms instead of lounging
on the couch. The payoff, or at least that's what the Trojans hope,
starts coming tonight in the season-opener against San Diego State
at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more camaraderie,'' sophomore forward Greg Lakey said.
``It worked out the best. I kind of liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have gotten along together real well, playing pickup
basketball. We know where we're supposed to be on the court now.''
</P>
<P>
   To go along with those bigger biceps, USC feels like it improved
itself between the ears. Bibby has noticed a change for the better
in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more of a team concept, as opposed to last year where
it was more `I.' Since I've been here, this is the best unit of
bonding on and off the floor,'' Bibby said. ``They have a feeling
for their teammates. That's something we've never had since I've
been here. You're going to start to see that when we get in games.
I've seen an attitude adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Attitude's great, but you still need good athletes. Last year's
problem with depth shouldn't be one this year. Twelve players have
a chance to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have better players than we had last year,'' Bibby
said. ``How far are we ahead? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest addition _ literally _ is 6-foot-9 center/forward
Brain Scalabrine of Enumclaw, Wash. Scalabrine weighs 240 pounds
but wowed spectators last weekend by leading a fast break with a
behind-the-back dribble during an exhibition contest.
</P>
<P>
   Since Scalabrine is a junior-college transfer, he doesn't
realize no one expects USC to be a factor in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletic teams always have a chance to win at the end,''
Scalabrine said. ``That's my goal, to win the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   As funny as that sounds, it's a sentiment the team actually
believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has us picked last, like always,'' Lakey said. ``I
think we'll turn that around this year.''
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for optimism. Besides Scalabrine, USC has
added physical freshman forward Sam Clancy, who weighs 235 pounds;
point guard Quincy Wilder, a former Mr. Washington; promising
6-foot-7 forward David Bluthenthal and 5-foot-10 point guard
Brandon Granville, who was not heavily recruited but will probably
start tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of time until the freshmen meet their
potential,'' Bibby said. ``I don't have a problem starting any of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And USC's returning players gained experience. Lakey is a
sophomore but now has 28 college games on his resume. Sophomore
point guard Kevin Augustine is in the same situation but fell
behind after missing about 10 days because he feltburned out.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Jeff Trepagnier, viewed as a raw but talented player a
year ago, is expected to start at shooting guard or small forward.
And there's the core group of returning scorers in Jarvis Turner,
Adam Spanich, Elias Ayuso.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year makes a difference,'' Bibby said. ``Just the
maturity, being able to accept things we are throwing out to them.
Their approach to the game has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   This being USC, there remain plenty of reasons for doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine, who redshirted at Highline Community College last
season, hasn't played a college basketball game in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting-guard position is suspect, because Ayuso was
inconsistent and Trepagnier shot 20 percent on 3-pointers last
season. The point-guard position is anchored by a freshman
(Granville), a JC transfer (Wilder) and a sophomore (Augustine)
whose college future was in doubt about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Bibby believes those problems will solve themselves. He
likes that he recruited players with winning traditions and
believes it will make a difference. Granville and Bluthenthal won
the Division I state title at Westchester. Clancy led his team to
an Ohio large-schools state title. Wilder led his junior college to
a Northwest JC title.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't teach kids how to win. You can't teach everything,''
Bibby said. ``We've tried to bring in winners.''

`THE RIDE DOWN MOUNT MORGAN': DEVOTED TO HIS WIFE, BUT WHICH ONE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How's this for an idea for a play? A powerful,
charismatic man of 50-some years has a strong, smart helpmeet of a
wife, an adoring daughter and a reputation for social idealism.
Unfortunately, he has these character flaws, too: an ungovernable
sexual appetite, a dangerous love of risk and a tendency to believe
that he exists outside the law. The result: He lands in a
career-shattering sex scandal that is played out in front-page
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   That happens to be the plot of ``The Ride Down Mount Morgan.''
This comic drama by Arthur Miller, which opened at the Joseph Papp
Public Theater on Monday night, has been described by its author as
``a completely political play.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course he said that in 1991, when ``Mount Morgan'' had its
world premiere in London and the Clinton administration was still
to come. Actually, the presidency on Miller's mind just then was
that of Ronald Reagan, who he said had given an ``imprimatur'' to
selfish individualism.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it has taken seven years for this play to arrive
in New York turns out to be lucky, doesn't it? Miller's portrait of
a self-styled, self-sabotaging superman, portrayed here by Patrick
Stewart, now buzzes with a relevance it didn't have even when it
made its U.S. debut at the Williamstown Theater Festival in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching those old windbags on television,
pontificating on sexual morality and appropriate vs. inappropriate
lying in the Clinton White House, you can now see the same themes
explored in a theatrical entertainment rather like those risque
infidelity farces of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's no avoiding the impression that ``Mount Morgan''
smells musty, despite the physical elegance of the director David
Esbjornson's production and compelling performances from Stewart,
the English classical actor best known here for his work on the
``Star Trek'' series, and Frances Conroy.
</P>
<P>
   This tale of a bigamous insurance executive, running scared from
intimations of mortality, brings to mind a host of more vivid works
about the desperation of male menopause (think Saul Bellow or
Philip Roth), with the attendant sense that Miller has really
brought nothing new to the table.
</P>
<P>
   On one level the play is an angry indictment of a culture that
encourages the desire to ``have it all.'' The images most often
evoked to characterize Lyman Felt, the double-dealing businessman
played by Stewart, are those of an insatiable hunger, and Lyman, in
his opening lines, speaks of the American economy as a giant breast
from which to suck.
</P>
<P>
   Lyman's particular appetites have led him to take on two wives,
who live, unaware of each other's existence, in Manhattan and in
upstate New York. There's the proper, WASP-ish Theodora (Ms.
Conroy) to whom he's been married for decades, and the more
recently acquired Leah (Meg Gibson), a gutsy young Jewish
businesswoman of unashamed sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   When Lyman crashes his Porsche driving down the mountain of the
title on a snowy night, both wives visit their injured spouse in
the hospital on what becomes a day of reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of Miller's work, from ``Death of a Salesman'' to last
season's ``Mr. Peters' Connections,'' ``Mount Morgan'' has a
dreamlike aspect, the sense that what is happening takes place
inside its central character's head. At least that's the way it is
set up, as Lyman ponders conflicted past and perilous future in his
sickbed, with John Arnone's fluid set designs and Brian MacDevitt's
lighting evoking the appropriate phantasmal atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But prosaic reality keeps asserting itself. The scene in which
the two wives meet, which Lyman thinks he is only imagining, is
indeed what really happens. As Tom (John Vennema), his lawyer and
longtime friend, observes tartly of the accuracy of Lyman's vision:
``Well, that wouldn't be too difficult. It's all pretty
inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true of the play, too. It all feels inevitable,
predetermined by theatrical convention and the questions of ethics
that have always obsessed Miller but that he usually doesn't state
quite so baldly.
</P>
<P>
   As the evening slides between past and present, much time is
given to the farcical mechanics of maintaining two wives,
``Captain's Paradise'' style, and assorted scenes in which Lyman
considers with alarm the prospect of disappearing ``without a
trace.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has revised ``Mount Morgan'' since its Williamstown
production, wisely eliminating the presence of the ghost of Lyman's
father. It also helps that the playwright has some sympathy for his
capitalist devil. If you gave Lyman a vocal conscience, he wouldn't
be so different from the rueful Quentin, Miller's alter ego in
``After the Fall.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unlike F. Murray Abraham, who played the part in Williamstown as
a reptilian whiner, Stewart exudes a brusque sensuality and
provides lovely facial shadings of ambivalence that undermine his
character's confident assertions.
</P>
<P>
   At other moments, however, there's a quality of impersonation
about the performance, a sense of distance between the actor and
his role. This partly comes from Lyman's being weighted with too
much generic Milleresque history: an Albanian father and a Jewish
mother to embody his dual nature; an earlier, abandoned career as a
poet; an episode of having betrayed a friend to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The stoical, conservative Theodora is even more a compendium of
social cliches. Yet Ms. Conroy magically transmutes these elements
into a deeply affecting portrait of a wounded woman possessed of a
buried, self-aware irony that is dragged to the surface by events.
</P>
<P>
   One wishes that she were better matched in Ms. Gibson, who
performs with a soap-opera-ish self-consciousness that ill suits
her tough, sexy character. Even Ms. Conroy's most obvious comic
moments seem to occur on several levels, and her Theodora holds
onto her dignity, even through a humiliating fantasy sequence and a
scene in which she has lost her skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, in fact, this ``Mount Morgan'' has an elegiac dignity
that its Williamstown incarnation, directed by Scott Elliott,
lacked. Elliott exaggerated the farcical elements in ways that were
particularly unflattering to the production's actresses and seemed
to confirm the theory that Miller has only limited gifts for
creating female characters.
</P>
<P>
   But along with Elizabeth Franz's excellent Linda Loman in the
Broadway-bound revival of ``Death of a Salesman,'' Ms. Conroy's
Theodora suggests that there can indeed be more to Miller women
than meets the eye. It's too bad that you leave ``Mount Morgan''
thinking that Theo deserves not just a better husband but a better
play.

ALL-STAR WEEKEND'S JAM SESSION LATEST VICTIM OF NBA DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The National Basketball Association, while expressing
hope that an All-Star Game could still be played, Monday canceled
Jam Session, its five-day interactive event leading up to the
All-Star weekend's festivities this February in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Jam Session, the most recent casualty of the labor dispute,
was scheduled for Feb. 8-13 at the Pennsylvania Convention Center.
The All-Star Game is still scheduled for Feb. 14. But with no
negotiating sessions between the league and the players' union
planned this week, the chances of beginning the season in December
appear remote.
</P>
<P>
   With a training camp and free-agent signing period needed, the
league had said it would take up to one month after an agreement
was reached for the season to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reason to be hopeful,'' said Russ Granik, the
league's deputy commissioner. ``We're not getting anywhere. We've
told people at our arenas that they can book dates four weeks out.
We're not kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's decision, the league released 300,000 square feet
of convention space it had leased for the Jam Session. More than
90,000 people attended the event at the Javits Center in Manhattan
last February, when the All-Star Game was played at Madison Square
Garden. Between 70,000 and 80,000 were expected to attend the event
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Jam Session requires more lead time than any other All-Star
event,'' Granik said in a statement. ``Since we can't guarantee our
sponsors, licensees, vendors and business partners that there will
be an All-Star weekend, we cannot in good conscience ask them to
make the early, irrevocable expenditures and commitments necessary
for Jam Session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to have an All-Star weekend if at all
possible, and we will try to substitute an event for Jam Session
that has a shorter lead time.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's campaign to persuade players to approve of the
league's proposals is still going strong, according to the union.
While Commissioner David Stern imposed a deadline last week for
team officials discussing the deal with players, a union official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that players have been
called by Stern and other league employees. According to the union
official, Stern has been complaining about his inability to get a
deal with union leadership. Stern could not immediately be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   As for the stalled talks, Granik said: ``I have no explanation.
We thought we were getting somewhere _ what is it _ about three
weeks ago. Things then changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, said he
would call last week but neved did. ``And now we don't have any
plans at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The players want to receive 60 percent of revenues, while owners
have offered a 50-50 share.

BIONDI CALLS IT QUITS AT UNIVERSAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The long-awaited ax has fallen on Universal
Studios chief Frank Biondi Jr. as the mild-mannered executive
became the latest victim of the studio's dismal performance.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi, 53, resigned as chairman and chief executive Monday
after Universal's ``Meet Joe Black'' delivered adequate but not
blockbuster results on its opening weekend. That stretched the
studio's hitless streak to 18 movies since it released ``The Lost
World: Jurassic Park'' in May 1997, an apparently galling
development to parent Seagram Co. since overall box office revenues
have been surging upward at 10 percent annually in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone has to take the fall, and `Meet Joe Black' was
obviously the last straw,'' said analyst Barry Hyman of Ehrenkrantz
King Nussbaum, who has a buy rating on the stock of parent Seagram
Co. ``They're going to have trouble breaking even on it, so I am
not surprised about Biondi. I'm not happy because it means more
confusion, and that doesn't translate to a higher stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   Biondi's departure, after 2{ years in the post, underscores the
uncertainty and turmoil that have hampered Universal since Seagram
bought control in 1995 for $5.7 billion from Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co.
</P>
<P>
   The ouster puts Universal under the direct control of
43-year-old Seagram chief Edgar Bronfman Jr., whose family owns 32
percent of the Montreal-based liquor and entertainment company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgar has clearly decided he wants to run it himself,'' said
Arthur Rockwell, an analyst with Drake &AMP; Co. and a former studio
executive. ``He's trying to show he's smarter than Sumner Redstone
or Rupert Murdoch, and that's an expensive game to play. You can
destroy a lot of lives in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Departures such as Biondi's are common among underperforming
studios, but Seagram's purge of top executives has been especially
bloody. Production chief Mark Platt, marketing chiefs Kathy Jones
and Buffy Shutt and operations czar Howard Weitzman all left last
spring, and there is speculation that Universal Studios president
Ron Meyer and film division chief Casey Silver will be sacked.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's instability has held down the price of Seagram
shares compared with rival stocks. Wall Street was unimpressed with
Biondi's departure, and Seagram's already depressed stock, which
topped $45 in May on optimism over its pending buyout of PolyGram
NV, slid 25 cents to $34.0625.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to sit on the fence for a while,'' said Linda
Bannister, an entertainment analyst with Edward Jones who has a
``hold'' on the stock. ``Edgar may not have as much understanding
of what it takes to run a company as Frank Biondi did. We're not
saying that he's going to fall flat on his face, but we are going
to keep our eye on the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Biondi's resignation had been rumored since last fall, when
Bronfman sold a controlling interest in Universal's cable business
to Barry Diller without first telling Biondi, who built his
reputation by running HBO. Those rumors gained credibility as
Bronfman revamped Seagram into a major entertainment conglomerate
through its $10.4 billion buyout of PolyGram.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the PolyGram acquisition, Biondi was left in no-man's
land,'' said Steve Cesinger, an investment banker with Grief &AMP; Co.
``He really wasn't necessary anymore. I like Edgar's vision and the
fact that he's going to be actively involved in the
decision-making. You like to see the guy with the checkbook do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization leaves Meyer, who built Creative Artists into
a powerhouse Hollywood agency before joining Universal in 1995, as
Universal's top executive. He will be in charge of film, TV and
theme parks and report directly to Bronfman.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram will also create a new operating division for music and
Doug Morris, chairman of Universal Music Group, will now report
directly to Bronfman. Seagram is expected to complete the deal for
PolyGram by the end of the year, making it the world's largest
music company with a 22 percent share of the international market.
Extensive layoffs and consolidation will likely follow.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street investors remain perturbed over an ill-fated deal
that Bronfman engineered in 1995 to sell Seagram's stake in
chemical giant DuPont to finance the deal for Universal. DuPont's
shares have increased substantially since the deal while Seagram's
have languished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgar is going to have to answer to shareholders in 1999 --
that's the year of show and tell,'' Hyman said. ``There's no
turning back now that he's buying PolyGram.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Seagram's major businesses, the movie business is widely
acknowledged as the trickiest with brutal consequences for any
mistakes. As recently as two weeks ago, Universal was thought to be
on the verge of turning around with the best November-December
schedule of any major studio.
</P>
<P>
   Then ``Meet Joe Black'' was hammered by critics for its
three-hour length, slow plot and the casting of Brad Pitt, who has
yet to deliver a major hit. A weekend premiere for the costly
``Babe: Pig in the City'' was canceled late last week because the
family comedy had not been completed. It's still scheduled to open
Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   However, the studio's next two films -- a ``Psycho'' remake and
a Robin Williams drama-comedy, ``Patch Adams'' -- should perform
well. Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, believes ``Joe'' will take in about $75 million
domestically, while ``Psycho'' should top $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think `Patch Adams' will make people forget about everyone
else,'' Bucksbaum said, adding he expects the film to receive
Academy Award nominations for best picture and best actor. He also
said next year's schedule looks solid, led by ``Ed TV,'' a comedy
directed by Ron Howard.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst noted that studios go through slumps. ``People
forget easily. They can't remember how bad things were at Sony
before 1997,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Biondi, it is the second time in three years he has been
forced out of a job. Redstone canned him in early 1996 to become
more active in the day-to-day operations of Viacom.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi was in the middle of a five-year employment contract with
Seagram. In the fiscal year that ended June 30, he received $1
million in salary, a $5 million bonus, $620,000 in other
compensation and options on 200,000 Seagram shares estimated to be
worth about $5 million to $12 million.

 &HT;    Boxing gives Trejo a fighting chance
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ By joining the Army at age 19, Mike Trejo eluded
a lifestyle that surely would have included drugs, alcohol and
brushes with the law.
</P>
<P>
   He was a fighter, but not the type who did his business in a
boxing ring. Trejo said he hung out with ``the wrong crowd'' and
did not learn discipline until he was assigned to Fort Ord, Calif.,
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no telling where I'd be if I hadn't joined the
service,'' Trejo said Monday from his home in San Marcos. ``I'd
probably be out somewhere, smoking dope, having kids left and
right. In the Army I had to change my ways. For the first time I
had to take orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Trejo cleaned up his act and found a better way to use his
fists. He earned a spot on the Fort Ord boxing team and dedicated
himself to the sweet science during his four years in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Now 28, Trejo is prepared to tackle his biggest challenge, a
match that could give him a shot at a world title.
</P>
<P>
   Trejo will fight Mexican Olympian Mariano Gonzalez in a North
American Boxing Federation title bout tonight in San Antonio. He
describes his 22nd professional fight as ``the biggest in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the military, Trejo earned a reputation as a fierce,
hard-punching boxer. He has won 13 of his 21 pro fights by
knockout. His only loss stemmed from cuts to his eyes that hampered
his vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Mike is that he doesn't do just enough to win
fights,'' trainer Martin Ortiz said. ``He wants to win decisively.
He's not satisfied until he has everything right.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory by Trejo would be a major step in his quest to earn a
chance for a world title match, Ortiz said. That would put Trejo on
the same path as his boxing idol, Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Trejo has been working out daily, running the treadmill 50
minutes in the morning and jogging 35 minutes during his lunch
hour. To make ends meet, he works at a grocery store warehouse in
San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember telling people I'd be a world champ, but it was all
talk,'' Trejo said. ``Then I figured out what I needed to do to get
this chance. Maybe I've been lucky, but maybe this was meant to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Trejo's opponent was on the 1996 Olympic team from Mexico. He is
unbeaten in 15 pro bouts.
</P>
<P>

DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IN THE HOUSE ELECTS VETERANS TO 2 TOP POSTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Buoyed by their ballot box victory two weeks ago,
the Democratic caucus held its own elections Monday and promoted
two longtime House Democrats to top leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, head of the House Democratic
campaign committee and a major fund-raiser, won the post of caucus
chairman by 12 votes, replacing Rep. Vic Fazio, a California
veteran who is retiring. Frost, the first Jewish member elected to
a leadership position, defeated Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a
hard-working liberal who is known for her caustic floor speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats re-elected the minority whip, Rep. David E. Bonior of
Michigan, and elected as vice chairman Rep. Robert Menendez of New
Jersey, a chief deputy whip and a member of the Congressional
Hispanic Caucus. Menendez, who led the effort to safeguard Rep.
Loretta Sanchez's contested California election, ran against two
candidates for the position, a member of the Black Caucus, Albert
R. Wynn of Maryland, and a moderate, Calvin Dooley of California.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to Monday's races, the candidates emphasized their
commitment to a ``unified'' party, a theme that Democrats and House
Minority Leader Rep. Dick Gephardt say swept them to several gains
in the Nov. 3 elections. They also spoke about reaching out to the
party's moderate center, which made significant strides in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all talked in our elections today about the importance
Democratic unity has had, both in terms of our success in the
election and in our ability to move our agenda forward with an even
closer minority,'' said Gephardt, who was unopposed in the
leadership elections. ``And it is our unity now that I believe can
give us a leg up on our Republican counterparts as we head into the
next Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's election generated some concern among Democrats who
viewed the defeat of Ms. DeLauro, the only woman running for a
leadership post, as problematic for the party, which promotes its
message of diversity and inclusion. With the departure of Rep.
Barbara B. Kennelly, a Connecticut Democrat who unsuccessfully ran
for governor, no women occupy top Democratic leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   Several women are running for top leadership posts in the
Republican elections on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt sought to dispel concern about the all-male team by
pointing to the number of black, Hispanic and female members in the
House Democratic caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of diversity,'' Gephardt said. ``The
Democratic Party has been the party that has taken on issues for
women, for African-Americans, for Hispanics, for Asians and for
other minority groups in our society.''

SPITZER WIDENS LEAD ON VACCO IN LATEST COUNT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With at least three-quarters of the 250,000 paper
ballots counted in the razor-thin race for state attorney general,
Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic challenger, has pulled nearly 22,000
votes ahead of Dennis C. Vacco, the Republican incumbent, state
election officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the state Board of Elections said that based on those
numbers, it was still too early to declare a winner, and officials
said they were uncertain when the results would be certified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the counting to be completed by the end of the
week,'' said board spokesman Lee Daghlian. ``And after that, I
expect there are going to be lawsuits because there are a large
number of paper ballots that are being challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, only Staten Island and Queens had completed
their tabulation of paper ballots by Monday. Outside of New York
City, nine of the state's 62 counties still had not reported their
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated that between a quarter and a third of the
estimated 250,000 paper ballots were left to be counted. The
election results are scheduled to be certified by the state by Dec.
15, but election officials said that could be delayed by lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Spitzer's campaign said that, based on their count,
the Democratic candidate's lead was virtually insurmountable. They
said the figures obtained from their campaign workers in each
county indicated that about 60,000 paper ballots were left to be
counted. Of those, they said, about half are in New York City,
where Spitzer had enjoyed a substantial lead in the Nov. 3 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it may be premature for Eliot to declare victory, the
question now arises as to whether it's possible for Dennis Vacco to
win,'' said Steven Goldstein, press secretary to Spitzer's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's possible,'' he added, ``and it's also possible that
Ken Starr is a liberal Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, speaking to reporters Monday in Washington after a news
conference about a multistate settlement with the tobacco industry,
said that the figures were far from complete and that he believed
he would ultimately be certified as the victor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident the votes are there, and we're counting them
literally one by one,'' Vacco said in his first public comment
about the race since the election.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco also suggested that there was widespread voter fraud in
New York City that would have heavily benefited his opponent.
``They can't even reconcile in the city the number of people who
signed in to vote with the number of votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Vacco and Spitzer campaigns have representatives in
each of the elections board's offices in the state's counties who
have reviewed the figures with the local officials even before the
tallies are forwarded to the state office in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's figures from the state Board of Elections, Spitzer
was ahead with 2,055,478 votes to Vacco's 2,033,657 votes.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the last previous count, Spitzer had led Vacco by
about 18,000 votes.

UCLA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM GAINING NOTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As she moves down Bruin Walk, Erica Gomez
encounters people she doesn't know but know her. They all tell her
the same thing, ``I'll be at your game (tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez is unaccustomed to the attention because UCLA women's
basketball doesn't usually merit it. This year, however, begins
differently. The Bruins are ranked No. 14 in the nation and have
their home opener tonight at 7 against No. 2 Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   It's not uncommon for coach Kathy Olivier to receive well-wishes
from fellow UCLA coaches, including Bob Toledo and Steve Lavin, and
the football and men's basketball players' are expected to attend
tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier has also noticed an increase in phone calls and messages
from national media, including USA Today and Sports Illustrated,
all wanting to know about the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you're in the top 20, you get a lot of attention,''
Olivier said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is something UCLA has not experienced in quite a while.
The last time the Bruins were nationally ranked for more than a
week was 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The players enjoy the recognition, and despite losing their
season opener 99-82 to No. 11 Notre Dame on Saturday, it hasn't
waned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we're getting more attention from the students,'' Gomez
said. ``People recognize our team is good and it reinforces in us
that, hey, we really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight will put that theory to the test. The Huskies (2-0)
routed two other nationally ranked teams, Duke and Arkansas, by 30
and 36 points, respectively. Sophomore forward Svetlana Abrosimova
leads UConn with 15.5 points and 9.5 rebounds per game. She scored
26 against Duke. Also, watch for freshman forward Swin Cash, who
had 20 points against Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connecticut's deep,'' Olivier said. ``I saw them on TV. To be
honest, they look like they're in March Madness form.''
</P>
<P>
   The game also will tell how much attention the Bruins will get
from the community. UCLA usually attempts to draw in fans with
promotions and giveaways. This time the Bruins hope the game is
enough.

   LONDON _ A leading arms control group is calling on all powers
to de-activate _ or ``de-couple'' in the jargon of Doomsday
planning _ their weapons, to avoid possible massive and hugely
perilous systems failures brought on by the so-called ``Millennium
bug.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report published last Thursday, the British American
Security Information Council (BASIC) bluntly describes the
Pentagon's efforts to meet the fast-approaching deadline as ``a
mess,'' with what it calls ``severe and recurring problems across
the spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, it says, has for its part barely woken up to the year
2000, or Y2K, risk _ even though the general decay of its military
since the demise of the Soviet Union has made the danger even more
acute.
</P>
<P>
   For all the visible work already done to iron out the date
recognition problem, BASIC argues there is no way of knowing if
``embedded'' systems _ i.e. semi-independent
``systems-within-systems'' in the colossal American defense
apparatus _ are being straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   These could allow the YK2 bug to spread, unknown to America's
defense controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Repairing and testing affected systems could see costs ``in the
multibillion dollar category,'' with no guarantee of success. As
the U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said recently,
``Everything is so interconnected, it's very hard to know with any
precision that we've got it fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to BASIC, the biggest YK2 danger is not the ultimate
nightmare of nuclear weapons either launching or exploding because
of faulty computer information. Since it still requires human
authorization for a missile or warhead to be launched, this sort of
catastrophe is ``unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Far more likely, however, is the prospect of a leader, under
pressure from hairtrigger response mechanisms, pressing the nuclear
button on the basis of inaccurate data.
</P>
<P>
   This is the real significance of September's early warning
agreement between Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton in
Moscow, which BASIC would like to see leading to a joint and
independent nuclear warning center independent of the two national
defense bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Such a U.S.-Russian agreement should form the basis of a broader
pact between all nuclear weapons states, declared and undeclared.
Even so, given both sides' desire to keep a first-strike capacity,
the danger of a rogue launch would remain.
</P>
<P>
   Far better, says BASIC, to separate warheads from their delivery
vehicles, and thus dramatically increase the amount of time needed
to launch an attack. &QL;

ARTWORKS FROM READER'S DIGEST COLLECTION SOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reality chilled the enthusiasm on Monday night at
Sotheby's in Manhattan, where 37 works from the Reader's Digest
collection, being sold along with impressionist and modern art from
various owners, kicked off the first session of this week's
four-night auction marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the record-breaking crowds that packed Sotheby's York
Avenue headquarters all weekend to see art by masters including
Modigliani, Cezanne and Picasso, bidding in the jammed auction room
was surprisingly thin, and the mood was somber.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 37 works from the financially troubled Reader's Digest
Corp., 33 were sold, and many just squeaked by their low estimates.
The collection brought $86.5 million, about midway between its $70
million low estimate and its $100 million high.
</P>
<P>
   By far the star of the evening was a 1919 Modigliani portrait of
his wife, Jeanne Hebuterne, showing her perched on a fragile chair
with one hand touching her shoulder, her long auburn hair down.
Expected to sell for $9 million to $12 million, it went to an
unidentified telephone bidder for $15.1 million, a record for the
artist.
</P>
<P>
   What action there was Monday night was played out mostly by
telephone bidders. But there were many moments when even the phones
went dead. Of the 78 works offered, only 52 found buyers, and the
entire evening totaled $123.8 million, below Sotheby's low estimate
of $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very quiet in this room, and I have no idea why,'' said
Diana Brooks, Sotheby's chief executive. ``We were fooled by the
buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, enthusiastic collectors had deluged the auction
house, Sotheby's officials said, giving them confidence that the
sale would exceed expectations. But when the evening came, the
excitement died.
</P>
<P>
   In May, bidders were plentiful, but even for the Reader's Digest
collection each lot attracted only a few interested takers. The
collection was formed by the company's founders, Lila Acheson
Wallace and her husband, DeWitt Wallace, in the 1940s through '60s.
</P>
<P>
   The 76-year-old company has recently been hit by hard times.
Last year it reduced its support to institutions like the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York City Opera. In
September it announced it would cut its staff by several hundred
employees and its dividend by 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare to find one Modigliani of such quality in a sale, but
Reader's Digest had two. The second, also among the top sellers
Monday night, was another portrait of Jeanne Hebuterne. This time
she was posed like an 18th-century Madonna with her hair swept up.
Also carrying an estimate of $9 million to $12 million, it sold to
Nancy Whyte, a private dealer in New York, for $9.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wallace was well known as a nature lover, a trait reflected
in her taste for paintings _ for example, Cezanne's landscape ``A
View of L'Estaque Through the Woods'' (1882-83), showing the small
French village from above, framed by trees. Also estimated at $9
million to $12 million, it sold to an unidentified telephone bidder
for $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another outdoor scene was Monet's ``Lily Pond'' (1917-19), a
more colorful selection than most in the artist's famous waterlily
series. Before the sale, Sotheby's estimated that ``Lily Pond''
would bring $9 million to $12 million; it sold to an unidentified
telephone bidder for $9.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best works in the collection, was ``The Forest: Seven
Figures and a Head'' (1950), a Giacometti group of tall, slender
bronze figures with the bust of a man thought to be the artist's
brother Diego. The rare and beautiful sculpture carried an estimate
of $4 million to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Several telephone bidders tried to buy it, and it finally sold
for $7.4 million _ a record for the artist _ to Simon de Pury, the
former chairman of Sotheby's in Europe, who now runs an art
investment and advisory service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The second part of the evening ran out of steam as the sale
progressed. The problem was that Sotheby's had not edited its
offerings carefully enough. There were simply too many fleshy
Renoirs and too many second-rate Picassos, many being sold by
Japanese financial institutions that had seized them from debtors
and held onto them since the market plunged in the early 1990s.
Buyers continued growing more intelligent, doing their homework and
spending carefully.
</P>
<P>
   One of the evening's real stunners occurred when a breathtaking
polished-bronze head by Brancusi, offered by the Judith Rothschild
Foundation, failed to sell.
</P>
<P>
   There was not a bid in sight for the work, ``The Muse'' (1918),
with its smooth face and unusually textured hair that mimic the
versions in marble. It was estimated at $8 million to $10 million.
Henry Wyndham, chairman of Sotheby's in Europe, who was the
evening's auctioneer, tried to inject some excitement into the
sales room but gave up when no one stirred at $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprising failure was a colorful 1942 Bonnard, ``Still
Life With Bottle,'' from the estate of Wendell Cherry, the founder
and chairman of the Louisville-based health-care company Humana.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry, who died in 1991, amassed a large collection of
impressionist and modern art, which his widow, Dorothy, has slowly
been selling off. In past years, anything that carried Cherry's
name in its provenance would sell well. But the Bonnard, estimated
at $1 million to $1.5 million, had no takers past $950,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought there was more confidence than there was,''
Ms. Whyte said as she was leaving the sale. ``Many of the estimate
were just too high.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Tuesday night's sale of contemporary art at Sotheby's,
``it might well be that it's really lively,'' Ms. Brooks said
optimistically.

   LONDON _ From the rise of television to the development of
Internet publishing, technology has often appeared as a threat to
the newspaper industry because of its potential for siphoning
readers and advertising revenues to new media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Now an upstart U.S. company, PressPoint, hopes to turn that
presumption upside down by launching global printed editions of a
stable of international newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Through an alliance with Xerox Corp. announced Monday,
PressPoint plans to deliver on-demand copies of titles like El
Mundo of Spain, Der Standard of Austria and The Times of London to
business travelers at hotels in major cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Primis, the company's chairman and a former president of
The New York Times Co., called it the newspaper equivalent of
narrowcasting, whereby television broadcasters use the
proliferation of channels afforded by digital technology to aim
programming at smaller and smaller audiences.
</P>
<P>
   While globalization has bolstered the market for a handful of
truly international newspapers, PressPoint intends to use digital
printing technology to open up the global market for many smaller,
regional titles.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is not to publish a global view, but to take local news
around the globe, or as Primis put it in an interview here, ``give
the business traveler something from home.''
</P>
<P>
   George Brock, managing editor of The Times of London, said
PressPoint offered ``an extremely effective way'' of reaching
readers in North America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to spread our international presence,'' said Julio de
Andres, deputy general manager at El Mundo. Currently, the paper
sells only about 5,000 copies a day outside Spain and reaches U.S.
newsstands a day late.
</P>
<P>
   PressPoint's global editions are a cross between a tabloid
newspaper and an office document. The stapled, 32-page publications
are printed by Xerox's worldwide document service on 11-by-17-inch
coated paper with four-color capability.
</P>
<P>
   Each newspaper controls its own layout and editorial content,
which fills half the edition, while PressPoint arranges advertising
for the other half.
</P>
<P>
   PressPoint is a private company with a majority owned by
management and minority stakes held by Sandler Capital, a U.S.
venture fund, and Scitex Corp., an Israel-based maker of digital
printing products that created the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The company is already distributing El Mundo and Der Standard to
hotels in New York and Washington. PressPoint plans to add other
titles in coming months, including The Times, The Miami Herald, the
Polish paper Gazeta Wyborcza, and a daily newspaper version of
Bloomberg News, the screen-based financial news service.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution will be extended steadily, beginning with San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Paris and Hong Kong early next year. By the
end of next year, Primis hopes to have at least a dozen newspaper
titles in a dozen markets and sell about 20,000 copies a day.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said the service could take some time to
work the bugs out of its production system, an issue that
PressPoint appears to acknowledge with its very controlled
expansion into new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Price sensitivity also could be an issue, given that copies will
sell for $3.50 each.
</P>
<P>
   Primis said market research showed no resistance to the price,
however, and the company's initial target market is among four- and
five-star hotels. &QL;
