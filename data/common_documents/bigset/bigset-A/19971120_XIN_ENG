<HEADLINE> Egypt Reshuffles Police Leaderships After Tourist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's newly-appointed
Interior Minister Habib al Adli today made massive changes in the
top posts of his ministry and the police, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle came as part of efforts to beef up the country's
security system after the horrific slaughter of 58 foreign
tourists on Monday in Luxor, about 500 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Adli, after taking the oath Tuesday night, transferred the
Luxor security chief, his assistant and investigation officials in
the Luxor directorate from their posts. The personnel changes
included 17 major generals, a brigadier and three colonels.
</P>
<P>
Three of the former interior minister's assistants have been
transferred in the shake-up.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak appointed Adli after the country's
shock over security laxity that led to Monday's terrorist attack
when six gunmen opened fire on the tourists in front of the
4,500-year-old temple of Hatshepsut.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri today ordered the
closure of Aswan-Abu Simbel road to all tourist buses as part of
new security arrangement to protect tourists against any possible
threat.
</P>
<P>
Tourists wishing to visit Abu Simbel Temple will have to go
there by plane. The temple and thousands of Pharaonic tombs in
Luxor have been the hottest items on the agenda of most foreign
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The massacre, the deadliest attack in five years of Islamic
rebellion, is a blow to Egyptian efforts to encourage tourism
which sustains the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of travelers have fled the country and travel agents
worldwide canceled thousands of bookings of visits to Egypt after
the incident.

<HEADLINE> Central Banks Should Re-Focus Functions: Finnish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Bank of
Finland, Sirkka Hamalainen today stressed the need for central
banks to re-focus their functions in order to meet the current
global economic changes and liberalisation of financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Sirkka hamalainen made the remarks at a graduation ceremony
here at the Macro-Economic and Financial Management Institute of
Eastern and Southern Africa (MEFMI).
</P>
<P>
She said it is inevitable that central banks have to
relinquish some of their responsibilities in view of these
changes.
</P>
<P>
The role of central banks, she said, is shifting from that of
institutions which command and regulate markets to partners
influencing the direction of economies.
</P>
<P>
She said: ''We must be able to accommodate change and learn to
manage it.''
</P>
<P>
''The way to security is to make learning professional skills
are inevitable,permanent responsibilities,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Eight graduates from Lesotho, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and
Malawi underwent specialised training in debt and foreign
exchange reserves management in the institute.
</P>
<P>
The Harare-based MEFMI was formed in 1994 with the main
objective to strengthen the capacity for macro-economic and
financial management by the governments of the member states. It
also aims to develop a pool of regional experts who can be relied
upon to offer their services to member countries and
international agencies.
</P>
<P>
The institute is made up of Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, with Botswana
and Kenya expected to join soon.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Passing Through "Very Difficult Period": PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif said this evening that "the country is passing
through a very difficult period. The situation is very
deplorable."
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media at the Parliament House after postponing
his scheduled address to the nation, Sharif said that every minute
of the five-year term of his government is being wasted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ongoing government-judiciary tussle, the prime
minister said, "We are trying to solve this situation."
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that a case of contempt of the court has been
filed against him. "We want to have the right to appeal against
any decision" by the Supreme Court, he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly and the Senate adopted the amended
contempt law, tending to give protection to the prime minister in
the ongoing case of contempt against him in the apex court.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the bill has now been forwarded to the president
for consent. "If the president gives his consent to the bill, the
situation will be resolved quickly," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
He also said that due to the government-judiciary tussle, the
economic situation is getting worse every day. "We are at the
crossroads. The Parliament is at the crossroads," the prime
minister added.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources this evening, Chief of the Army
Staff General Jahangir Karamat called on Sharif at the Prime
Minister's House and discussed with him the current political
situation in the country with special reference to the relations
between the government and the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Karamat returned home this morning from London, cutting short
his overseas visit in view of the prevailing political situation
in the country. He later had a meeting with President Farooq
Leghari.
</P>
<P>
Details of the meetings among the troika are not immediately

<HEADLINE> Moussa Warns Israel Not to Butt in Iraqi-UN Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has
warned Israel not to thrust itself into the current Iraqi crisis
with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the press today, Moussa said Israel had
better "steer clear of an issue that does not concern it" and that
any Israeli involvement in the matter would only stymie any
forthcoming solution.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the current U.N.-Iraq standoff over arms
inspection. The U.S. is beefing up its military presence in the
Gulf for a possible strike on Baghdad which has expelled American
U.N. officials in charge of scuttling weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
His words came amid fear that the Gulf standoff would develop
into military hostilities between Iraq and Israel, a close
U.S. ally. Iraq opposes the peace treaties between the Arabs and
Israelis and calls for destruction of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that intensive diplomatic efforts were being exerted
to come up with a political solution to defuse the crisis, Moussa
said Egypt is making contacts with all parties concerned to
assist towards such a solution.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the Iraq-U.N. standoff will be taken up during Iraqi
Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz's visit to Egypt whose date will be set
within hours.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, scheduled to meet with Moussa and Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdel Meguid, has reportedly devised a proposal with
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeniv Primakov to avert a military
confrontation with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Aziz's visit to Egypt comes within the context of an Arab tour
including Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco to expound Iraq's
views on the recent tension between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been contacting with Baghdad in a bid to resolve the
crisis as a skeleton crew of inspectors pulled out of Iraq
following the expulsion of the American members.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has sent two messages to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, urging him to comply with the U.N. resolutions and
restraining from military showdown with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspectors pulled out of Baghdad on last Friday as
world leaders tried to resolve the 22-day-old U.N.-Iraq standoff.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Officials Sign Anti-corruption Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Transparency International
Zimbabwe (TIZ), an organization that seeks to expose and help
curb corruption, today committed itself to an integrity pledge to
lead a campaign to instill honesty and accountability in the
society.
</P>
<P>
Participants drawn from a broad spectrum of Zimbabwean society
attended a three-day workshop, organized by TIZ and sponsored by
the European Union. They invited all political leaders, members
of parliament, local government councillors, traditional leaders
and senior public officials to add their own names to the
Zimbabwe integrity pledge.
</P>
<P>
They said corruption in low and high places attacked
development and contributed to unacceptable levels of poverty,
threatening the stability of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Signatories to the pledge will bind themselves to act
honestly, openly and with the utmost integrity in all aspects of
their lives.
</P>
<P>
"We will always put the well-being of the people of Zimbabwe
ahead of our personal interests and will use any opportunities we
may have to fight corruption," says the pledge.
</P>
<P>
Anyone signing the pledge will have to undertake that they
will voluntarily, publicly and regularly make full disclosure of
their assets and other interests and those of their immediate
families, it said.
</P>
<P>
Political parties and electoral candidates are asked to also
develop their own integrity pledges and to publicize them widely.
</P>
<P>
The participants who include representatives of civil society,
parliament, churches, judiciary, academics, government and the
private sector, pledged to combat with courage, dignity and
tolerance what they termed as a culture of fear that was
pervasive in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The participants also called for the reform of the Zimbabwe
constitution to create and support a legal framework conducive to
transparency and accountability.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed
and one wounded when a South African light aircraft crashed into
the sea off Mozambican coast on Tuesday, the South African Civil
Aviation Authorities (CAA) said today.
</P>
<P>
One survivor sustained slight injuries and was flown back to
South Africa where he was admitted to a Johannesburg hospital,
according to a report of the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The nationalities of the passengers were not known.
</P>
<P>
CAA Chief Director, Rennie van Zyl, said the aircraft was
initially trapped under about four meters of water near the town
of Vilanculos.
</P>
<P>
The two-engine aircraft left for the Mozambican capital of
Maputo on Sunday en route to Vilanculos, a southern Mozambican
coastal town.
</P>
<P>
It encountered a heavy thunderstorm at Vilanculos and was
unable to land, van Zyl said.
</P>
<P>
The pilot had had radio contact with air traffic controllers
at Vilanculos shortly before the crash.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if the pilot decided to turn back, or what
happened," van Zyl said.
</P>
<P>
He said the accident was being investigated by the Mozambican
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The CAA hoped to take part in the probe, and an inspector was
expected to arrive at the scene on Thursday, he said.

ISLAMABAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif today urged President Farooq Leghari to sign the
Amended Contempt of Court Bill into law to end the prevailing
political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Earlier the bill is signed, sooner the crisis will come to an
end. The country has not suffered the damage in the last 25 years
as it regrettably has in the last two weeks," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media after chairing the Parliamentary meeting

adversely affected Pakistan in all spheres of life.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is pushing the country to the brink of
destruction," the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
"There is a contempt of court case against me and the decision
can come any time, so it is imperative that the Bill which has
been passed by the two houses of the Parliament be signed, and we
can defend ourselves," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Pakistan is passing through extra-ordinary
situation which calls for an early signing of the bill by the head
of state.

<HEADLINE> UK Orders 6 Harrier Jets to Join Aircraft Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain today stepped up its
military pressure on Iraq by ordering six Harrier jump jets to
join its aircraft carrier Invincible which is due to arrive in the
British colony of Gibraltar later tonight.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary George Robertson said in a statement:
"It is a sensible precautionary measure which will help keep all
our options open."
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein must understand he must fully comply with
United Nations Security Council resolutions and allow UNSCOM
inspectors back into Iraq to carry out their work without
interference," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, Britain put a squadron of RAF Harrier jets
on a 48-hour alert and sent its aircraft carrier Invincible to
Gibralter from the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
However, no decision has been taken yet to deploy the aircraft
carrier in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Although Britain is keeping its military options open, it also
vowed to maintain diplomatic pressure on Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein as Robertson said "we will continue all diplomatic
measures to get Saddam to see sense".
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a
statement that he would hold talks with his U.S., Russian and
French counterparts over the Iraq crisis in Geneva early on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We shall continue our work for a political agreement which
will secure our common objective: the return of the UNSCOM team to
Iraq and full compliance by Iraq with the UN resolutions," Cook
said.

<HEADLINE> Carter: No Allies Support U.S. Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States would
make mistakes if it takes unilateral military action against Iraq
and it would not win any support from its allies for that,former
President Jimmy Carter said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a serious mistake. We would not have the
support from any of our allies if we did that. We would stand
alone if we launched a military attack," Carter told NBC in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president said he believed the crisis, triggered by
Iraq's decision to kick American weapons inspectors out late last
month, could be resolved diplomatically and said world leaders
needed to convince the Iraqi people that U.N. sanctions would be
lifted if Baghdad complied.
</P>
<P>
He praised the role of France and Russia in trying to end the
standoff, saying "I think the United States is doing the right
thing by letting the French and the Russians try to work out some
resolution to this."

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Germany's money supply dropped to
an annualized growth rate of 5.1 percent in October compared with
5.2 percent in September, the German central bank announced today.
</P>
<P>
The latest figure indicated that the M3 money supply, the broad
measure of money circulating in the economy, was still well within
the central bank's target growth range of 3.5 percent to 6.5
percent, as was the case in the past four months.
</P>
<P>
The M3 supply serves as one of the central bank's key indicator
of the country's inflation trends, which could influence its
decisions on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in M3 growth in October reflected a reduction in
bank leadings to the private sector, the German central bank said
today.

PARIS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The French government will use
public research fund to help innovate small enterprises first,
instead of big enterprises, said French Minister of National
Education, Research and Technology Claude Allegre today.
</P>
<P>
"The government is Socialist and realist. We hope to support
the creation of innovating small and medium-sized enterprises,"
said Allegre at the "Bio Avenir"seminar hosted by the
Rhone-Poulenc chemical and pharmaceutical corporation of France.
</P>
<P>
The international seminar was focused on a biological research
program staged over the past five years by the corporation and
several state institutions, which cost Rhone-Poulenc 1.6 billion
francs (270 million U.S. dollars), according to the president of
Rhone-Poulenc, Jean-Rene Fourtou.
</P>
<P>
Allegre said that the government will offer financial support
to young people with doctorate degrees to head innovation projects
in small enterprises, as part of its plan to create 350,000 jobs
for the young people.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that France abandon what he called
"excessive ethic purism" in the field of biological research.
</P>
<P>
"We will not ban the French from researches on trans-genetic
corn, while importing at the same time from the United States
trans-genetic corn," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Publishes New Brochure to Gauge EMU Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Though a fully-functioning
single market is of crucial importance for growth, competitiveness
and employment, one out of four single market measures are found
not yet applied in all the 15 European Union member states.
</P>
<P>
It was pronounced today by the inaugural issue of the European
Union brochure, "Single Market Scoreboard".
</P>
<P>
The brochure, a six-monthly publication, said that the overall
rate of non-implementation of single market measures range from 3
percent in Denmark to 10 percent in Austria.
</P>
<P>
The European Union publishes the brochure to offer a picture of
the current state of the single market and to help gauge the
degree to which member states, the European Union's Council of
Ministers and the European Commission are meeting the targets laid
down in the action plan endorsed at the Amsterdam summit this past
June.
</P>
<P>
The public and businesses need to be kept informed, the
brochure said.
</P>
<P>
One of the strategic target of the action plan is to make the
existing rules more effective.
</P>
<P>
But there is still a long way to go toward the target of having
all agreed-upon single market measures correctly transposed into
national laws among the union member states.
</P>
<P>
As of November 1, the Single Market Scoreboard said, no less
than 359 single market directives have not been implemented by all
member states despite the fact that the common objective of the
European Commission and the member states is to realize the full
potential of the single market in advance of the third stage of
the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
At the Amsterdam summit, the council underlined the crucial
importance of the timely and correct transposition of all agreed
legislation into national laws.
</P>
<P>
Alongside each edition of the scoreboard brochure, the European
Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation union, also
presents a single market survey and sectoral report.

<HEADLINE> New Electronic Wallets to Be Introduced in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- South African bank
giants, Standard Bank and the ABSA Group, launched today an
on-line point of sale payment system, the Maestro debit card.
</P>
<P>
It will be a giant leap forward in a bid to make South Africa
one of the most advanced consumer and financial markets in the
world, senior executives of the New York-based MasterCard
International said.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the Maestro card, the first global debit
product available in South Africa, will bring immediate worldwide
purchasing power to an estimated nine million banks clients, few
of whom have payment alternatives other than cash.
</P>
<P>
The new card features easy access, high degree of safety and
privacy, said Henry Mundt, Executive Vice President of MasterCard
International.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest mass electronic empowerment ever in South
Africa, where only 5.3 percent of the population has access to
credit.
</P>
<P>
The Maestro logo on an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) card
allows a cardholder to make purchases using the funds in their
deposit account.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of debit marks the first phase of a banking
revolution in South Africa, and is part of MasterCards's
longer-term electronic payment strategy for this market, the
executives said.

economic aid to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, Arafat described his meeting with

Palestinian people would enjoy peace and prosperity, because a
better Palestinian state would be a better neighbor to Israel.

<HEADLINE> EU Regrets U.S. No Decision on Payment of UN Arrears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today
strongly deplored the fact that the United States congress had
suspended its Autumn session without adopting any legislation
concerning the payment of its arrears to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union also regretted the fact that the United
States, the largest contributor and also the largest debtor to the
UN, was not signifying any intention to start settling its debts.
</P>
<P>
"It is very worrying that one of the major member states
continues not to fulfil its responsibilities under the UN charter,
which fall within its commitments under international law," said a
European Union statement.
</P>
<P>
The absence of any decision by the U.S. congress on the payment
of arrears came at a time when the UN is making an unprecedented
effort to reform its structures and methods of operation, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the U.S. is continuing not to pay the arrears in
contribution it owes perpetuates the serious financial crisis with
which the UN is struggling and seriously affects the climate of
trust within the organization," it said.
</P>
<P>
The 15 European Union member states combine to contribute 35.4
percent of the UN's regular budget and 37.9 percent of the UN's
peace-keeping operation budgets.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, the statement said, is counting on all UN
member states to honor their obligations in full, unconditionally
and in accordance with the scale of quotas adopted by the UN
General Assembly.

JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Britain
will soon discuss greater economic cooperation and British
support for South Africa's ongoing negotiations for a trade
agreement with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
These topics will top the agenda when South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki meets British Prime Minister Tony Blair in
London next week.
</P>
<P>
"The overall purpose of the visit is the promotion and
consolidation of trade and investment," the South African Press
Association quoted Mbeki's spokesman Thami Ntenteni as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, accompanied by Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin,
will leave for Britain on Monday to have a series of meetings

</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he will hold talks with Blair and Foreign

During the visit, the two sides will sign an exchange control
protocol to complement a 1994 bilateral agreement on the
promotion and protection of trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also hold round-table discussions, presided
over by Blair and Mbeki, aimed at consolidating relations and
looking into areas of cooperation, Ntenteni said.
</P>
<P>
With Britain set to assume the presidency of the EU in January
next year, South Africa will try and muster British support for

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Supports Peaceful Solution of Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus said it believes that
the present crisis in Iraq over U.N. arms inspection should be
solved through diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
The position was stated here today by government spokesman
Manolis Christofides at his daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been escalating in the Gulf since Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein expelled Americans working with U.N. weapons
inspection teams from the country last week.
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus believes all diplomatic means for a peaceful
settlement to the problem should be exhausted," Christofides told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time Iraq should comply with U.N. Security
Council resolutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said the Cypriot government's longstanding
position was and remains that all U.N. member states should
conform with and implement Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that member states must abide by their
obligations as outlined in the U.N. Charter and international
law.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pak Govt-Judiciary Tussle Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Uncertainty rules Pakistan's
National Assembly as the three-month-long government-judiciary
confrontation intensifies.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has postponed his planned televised
address to the nation for the second time in two days.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was scheduled to address the nation at the
National Assembly at 22:00 Tuesday, but it was canceled three
hours before the scheduled time.
</P>
<P>
The planned speech was then rescheduled for 19:15 Wednesday.
However, it was again postponed. No specific date or time has been
announced by the government.
</P>
<P>
The tussle between the executive and the judiciary which began
in mid- August seemed to have ended recently with Prime Minister
Sharif finally accepting all the recommendations of Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court Sajjad Ali Shah pertaining to the elevation
of five judges to the apex court.
</P>
<P>
However, the confrontation is far from over. A case of contempt
of the court was filed against the prime minister in the first
week of November.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif was summoned by the Supreme Court to
appear in person Monday to justify himself as to why a contempt of
court action should not be taken against him.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is Pakistan's first prime minister to be summoned to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Then, the Parliament passed an amendment to the Contempt Act of
1976, adding a provision to file a review petition on a judgment
given in the contempt case.
</P>
<P>
The Bill, which was passed by the National Assembly in the
small hours of Tuesday and was later approved by the Senate, is
actually intended to provide protection to the prime minister and
other members of the Treasury Benches from the ill-effect of a
possible adverse judgment of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The Bill is sent to President Farooq Leghari for consent for
which the president has 30 days to do so.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif urged the president to sign the amended
Bill to end the prevailing political crisis. "Earlier the Bill is
signed, sooner the crisis will come to an end," Sharif told the
media at the Parliamentary Committee Room this evening.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sharif was exempted from personal appearance at the
Supreme Court Tuesday because of the visit by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister was directed by the apex court to
appear in person again today. The proceeding, which lasted for
more than two hours, ended with formal framing of charges against
Sharif and others.
</P>
<P>
In the event of any decision against the prime minister by the
apex court, Sharif will be deemed to be disqualified as a member
of the National Assembly, thereby losing his premiership.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that any reconciliation, if possible, between
the executive and the judiciary may avert the current crisis.
However, this depends entirely on what course of action the
government will adopt.
</P>
<P>
Hectic efforts among the troika -- the president, the prime
minister and the chief of the army staff, are under way in the
federal capital to resolve the crisis.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Seeks Solution to Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Diego Cordovez, special
advisor for Cyprus of U.N. Secretary-General, today conveyed an
oral message to Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides that the
U.N. chief will continue efforts for a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cordovez, who arrived on the island Tuesday night, had a
meeting today with Clerides in the presence of U.N. officials in
Cyprus and Cypriot government officials.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides described the meeting as "cordial." He said Cordovez'
objective is "to talk about the U.N. intention to resume
negotiations right after February's presidential elections."
</P>
<P>
"Kofi Annan's message refers to the secretary-general's
intention to continue his mission of good offices, with the
continuation of the present process, which began at Troutbeck,
has not been interrupted and continues after the elections,"
Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored direct talks between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides took place this Summer in Troutbeck,
New York, and Glion, Switzerland, but failed to produce any
results.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy will to cross to the Turkish-controlled northern
part of Nicosia for meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash. He will have another meeting with Clerides on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After his contacts on the island, Cordovez will fly on to
Athens and Ankara, the two supporters of Cyprus' conflicting
communities.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to talk about the Cyprus issue with
European Union (EU) Commissioner for External Relations, Hans Van
den Broek, in Brussels, and the EU presidency envoy for Cyprus
Kester Heaslip in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over the
northern third in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation
through peace talks, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- With two years to go
before the second UN Transport and Communications Decade for
Africa (UNTACDA II) Program comes to a close, African ministers
will assess the program's impact and devise an action plan for
the period 1998-2007.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here today by the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) said the review of UNTACDA
II will take place at a three-day conference in Cairo, Egypt from
November 24 to 26, 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the conference is organized by ECA
in collaboration with the government of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The release said, as a successor to the first decade program
implemented from 1978-1988, UNTACDA II's objective is to
establish an integrated transport and communications system which
will serve as a base for the physical integration of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the conference of ministers will include the
future of African transport, trade and facilitation, transport
and the environment, financing and private sector participation,
and capacity building.
</P>
<P>
African ministers will be joined by private sector
representatives and financiers, operators, planners, economists
and researchers, from around the world, the release added.
</P>
<P>
The conference of ministers, the standing decision-making
organ of the program, convenes at least every two years, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
It held its last meeting in Addis Ababa in 1995 to consider
the conclusion of the first mid-term evaluation of the program
under the auspices of the ECA, the lead agency, the release said,
adding that consideration led to the adoption of a plan of action
for 1995-1997.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Agrees to Investigate Controversial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today agreed to set up a board of inquiry to
look into last week's party convention, that scrapped the
primaries to elect party candidates for Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who just returned from London this morning, has
been meeting with several top Likud ministers and Knesset members
separately during the day to discuss the turmoil in the party
resulted from the cancellation of the primaries by the party's
central committee in last week's convention.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Silvan Shalom said that Netanyahu
promised him to implement all the recommendations of the
independent board of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Most of Likud ministers called on the prime minister to find a
way to resume the election primaries, which conferred upon them
considerable advantage in the choice of party's candidates for
the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
They also asked Netanyahu to fire Avidor Lieberman, Prime
Minister Office's Director General, who was accused of playing
dirty tricks during the convention. But Netanyahu rejected the
call.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani that
he will meet with opposition Labor leader Ehud Barak next week to
discuss national reconciliation. However, Netanyahu gave no
commitment about forming a national unity government, saying he
first wants to stabilize the Likud.
</P>
<P>
Although Netanyahu agreed to establish the inquiry committee,
the crisis in Likud is far from over. "Until this committee not be
formed and its job not finished, I can not see that there is going to
be quiet days," said Shalom.
</P>
<P>
Some Likud Knesset members said that they will watch closely
the inquiry proceedings. And if the prime minister will not
follow it through, there would be another Likud rebellion against
Netanyahu's leadership.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, 20 Likud majors arrived in Netanyahu's
office in Jerusalem today to show their solidarity with him. They
attacked Netanyahu's critics, saying that the prime minister was
being treated unjustly over the primaries issue.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi also criticized those who are
mobilizing against Netanyahu, describing their efforts as "invalid
and subversive".

<HEADLINE> UK Prison Inspector Urges not to Lock up Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Youngsters under 18 years old
should not be put into jail as prisons were not equipped to handle
teenagers or reform them, British Chief Inspector of Prisons David
Ramsbotham said today.
</P>
<P>
Ramsbotham said in a report that the prisons were not equipped
to deal with the damaged and difficult young people because they
cann't provide the education and care that teenagers need.
</P>
<P>
"Of all parts of the prison system, this is the one that needs
the most attention," he added.
</P>
<P>
As of last July, there were 2,643 teenagers of 15-17 years old
in prison, an 11 percent increase since the start of the year.
Many of the inmates share living accommodation with adults.
</P>
<P>
He suggested to reform the prison system, which include remove
all under 18 from prison and reduce the time under 18 stay in
custody.
</P>
<P>
The chief inspector said he was not going to soften his stance
on young criminals, but if regimes do not address children's
needs, custody can do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Prison Service General Director Richard Tilt
said today plans were being drawn to hold youngsters under 18
separately from other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The new move was a response to the chief inspector's critical
report. But prison officials said the prison system is already
struggling to cope with the record population and a lack of
funding.

<HEADLINE> Market Share Gap Narrows Between Airbus, Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) - The battle for greater world
market share between Airbus and Boeing intensified as the European
Group beat its US rival to land a one billion pounds (1.6 billion
US dollars) deal recently.
</P>
<P>
The reported order for 34 aircraft from Belgian flag-carrier
Sabena will close the gap in this year's fight for market share
between the world's two wide-bodied aircraft makers.
</P>
<P>
The market has traditionally been split two thirds / one third
in the American group's favor though last year Airbus won nearly
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
But at the end of October Airbus had booked orders this year
for 425 aircraft against 469 for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
An Airbus spokesman said on Tuesday: "We are catching up, we
are getting above the 40 percent of 1996, we are getting even
closer to 50/50."

<HEADLINE> UK Ministerial Cars Convert to Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) - The British ministerial and
government cars are to be converted to run on gas, according to an
official announcement here today.
</P>
<P>
The Government has decided to gradually replace its car fleet
with vehicles that will be able to use both gas and petrol.
</P>
<P>
The Government Car Service's (GCS) has been testing and
encouraging the use of gas-fuelled vehicles since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The cost of conversion varies between 750 pounds (1200 US
dollars) to 3000 pounds (4800 US dollars) depending on the vehicle
and which gas is used.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Office said, the costs of conversion will be absorbed
by GCS and recouped over the next three years through reduced
vehicle management costs.
</P>
<P>
GCS cars are replaced every three years. The Agency replaces on
average 20 cars each year. These cars will now gradually be
replaced with vehicles converted to run on gas.
</P>
<P>
Maintenance costs of gas fuelled cars is believed significantly
lower than for petrol fuelled cars.
</P>
<P>
GCS provides cars and drivers to the Prime Minister and other
ministers. It also provides a mail distribution service to the
Government and the wider public.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Duke of Edinburgh Prince
Philip said today the secret of keeping a successful marriage
between him and Queen Elizabeth over the past 50 years was
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
"The main lesson that we have learnt is that tolerance is the
one essential ingredient of any happy marriage," Prince Philip
said at a banquet on the eve of the Queen and the Duke's 50th
wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
It may not be quite so important when things are going well,
but it is absolutely vital when the going gets difficult, he said,
adding: "You can take it from that the Queen has the quality of
tolerance in abundance."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Duke also praised his children, saying "our
children have all done rather well under very difficult and
demanding circumstances and I hope I can be forgiven for feeling
proud of them."
</P>
<P>
Four former prime ministers--Baroness Thatcher, John Major,
Lord Callaghan, and Sir Edward Heath--were among VIP guests at
today's banquet in London.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Queen will give her Golden Wedding speech at a
celebration lunch hosted by Prime Minister Tony Blair.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has underlined the importance of unity between the
country's executive and legislative bodies, the official news
agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the remark in the first joint session of the
cabinet and Majlis (parliament) held Tuesday night, however IRNA
released the report about 24 hours later.
</P>
<P>
In the session, Khatami said that the government, Majlis and
the nation should join hands and move towards institutionalizing
the law throughout the society.
</P>
<P>
Khatami stated that the two executive and legislative branches
all aim to serve the people, so he welcomed constructive
criticisms and guidance from Majlis to help prevent violation of
law in the country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation for the vote of confidence his
cabinet received from the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian President also underlined the importance of
defending the principles of the revolution, saying that "we need
to learn that differences of opinion is not the same as internal
conflict."

However, he stressed it was important to observe the law and
to use logic in the debates.
</P>
<P>
Touching the country's economic situation, Khatami said that

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Asks Yeltsin to Dismiss Chubais </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma on
Wednesday passed a resolution requesting President Boris Yeltsin
to dismiss the First Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Anatoly Chubais, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also invited the president to send a inquiry to
the Prosecutor General "to obtain information relating to
observation of law by other top government officials."
</P>
<P>
The Duma supported Yeltsin in dismissing top federal executives
"who compromised themselves," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution pointed out that "the acute government crisis"
completely undermines the confidence in the government of Russians
driven to poverty.
</P>
<P>
It noted if Chubais, "who blackmails people in government
offices with the threat of financial instability, remains first
deputy prime minister and finance minister, this will demonstrate
the dependence of the president and prime minister and threaten
the prestige of the country."
</P>
<P>
In response to the Duma resolution, presidential press
secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said that the president thinks the
Duma's resolutions "are not legally binding", the Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yastrzhembsky, president Yeltsin supported the
suggestion that the posts of deputy prime minister and minister in
the government should not be combined.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax citing Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin reported
that Yeltsin has no immediate plans to dismiss Chubais as First
Deputy Prime Minister but will most likely fire him as Finance
Minister.
</P>
<P>
It was said that earlier today, Duma Budget Committee chairman
Mikhail Zadornov was offered the post of finance minister and he
may agree to take over the post.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Northeastern Province Declared Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today declared the country's Northeastern Province a flood
disaster zone following persistent heavy rains in the region.
</P>
<P>
The president stated that Marsabit and Moyale districts in
Eastern Province had also been placed in the same category, Kenya
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Moi was speaking to a delegation of women groups from Nairobi
who paid a courtesy call to him at the State House here today.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Kenyan government would continue to
monitor the rain situation in all parts of the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on October 24, the Kenyan government declared the
coastal region of the country a flood disaster zone.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that this time a lot of villages had been
submerged in in the coastal region after the Tana River burst its
banks.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Kenyans face starvation because most of the
affected areas could not be accessed by road and helicopters
could not land because of the floods, Minister in the Office of
the President John Koech was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains have claimed more than 20 lives since
mid-October with most deaths occurring in Central, Northeastern
and Coastal provinces.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's meteorological department forecast that the torrential
rains may extend into next year due to the El Nino phenomenon
which has affected the entire eastern African region, submerging
huge areas of Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia.

<HEADLINE> 1stadd: Leading Ayatollah's Office Attacked in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of demonstrators
today attacked the office of Ayatollah Houssein Ali Montazeri,
former designate successor of Iran's late supreme leader Ayatollah
Rowhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
An informed source said the office of the leading religious
figure in the city of Qom, some 90 kilometers south of Tehran, was
stormed by angry theological instructors and students of the city.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA confirmed the incident in
a dispatch, saying the demonstrators were rallying to condemn
Montazeri's skeptical statement about the legitimacy of the
country's supreme leadership, Velayat-e-Faqih (governance of
Islamic Jurisprudence).
</P>
<P>
IRNA did not give details about Montazeri's statement. But
informed sources here said Montazeri and another prominent
religious figure Ayatollah Azari Qomi stated that the supreme
leader of the country, apparently referring to Ali Khamenei, was a
supervisor to monitor the country's affairs and should not be an
administrator to directly interfere in certain naitonal issues.
</P>
<P>
The remarks aroused sharp criticism and at today's Majlis open
session, one of the Majlis members made public a letter of the
late Iranian leader Ayatollah Rowhollah Khomeini to disgrace
Montazeri as a "simple-minded person who is not suitable to be
involved in political affairs."
</P>
<P>
Religious and political organizations issued strong-worded
statements while theological instructors and students closed their
schools and staged a protest rally to denounce the statements by
Montazeri and Qomi.
</P>
<P>
It said that police was forced to intervene, using tear gas to
disperse the furious protesters in Qom.
</P>
<P>
Several policemen were injured in the scuffle, and the office
and house of the Ayatollah are under protection of the security
forces, it added.
</P>
<P>
Montazeri had been chosen by Khomeini as his heir-designate but
was later disqualified for the job by the late leader before his
death in 1989.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Hunter Militias Attack Junta Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The cease fire in Sierra Leone
under a peace accord seems to be out of the window following
reports of renewed attacks by hunter militias against soldiers of
the military junta over the past days.
</P>
<P>
The hunter militias known as Kamajors loyal to President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah who was outed in the May 25 coup this year, have
intensified pressure on the military junta by fresh attacks in
the southeast region between Tongo and Kenema.
</P>
<P>
Heavy gunfire was heard in the diamond-rich town of Tongo in
the Kenema district last night, the British Broadcasting
Corporation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors have held all the roads leading to Tongo, said
residents fleeing from there to the capital Freetown today.
</P>
<P>
They have warned all the civilians to leave the town by
November 28 before they launch an all-out attack against the
junta forces who have held the town since the coup.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have reportedly fled Tongo and reached
Kenema today.
</P>
<P>
The attacks have been described as a breach of the peace
accord signed last month in Conakry, Guinea, which calls for
cease fire in the country.
</P>
<P>
Aliu Kamara, the junta spokesman, said this afternoon that the
ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council will report the
incidents to the west African peace keeping force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is mandated by the west African countries to monitor
the peace process in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
According to the Conakry peace plan, the junta is to hand over
power to Kabbah in April next year while all people with guns,
including the junta soldiers, the Kamajors and other factions,
will be disarmed beginning from December.

UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today expressed optimism over the ministerial meeting
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the United States, Russia, France and
Britain have decided to hold a crisis meeting on Iraq in Geneva in
early hours of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In today's briefing, UN spokesman Eckhard Fred told reporters
UN chief was looking forward to the meeting, which was expected to
find a political solution to the latest crisis over the weapons
inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Primakov
held talks in Moscow on Tuesday with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz on a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Geneva, Primakov said he would bring a
blueprint for solving the crisis sparked by Iraqi expulsion of the
American arms inspectors on the UN teams.
</P>
<P>
The standoff between the United Nations and Iraq began on
October 29 when Iraqi Government announced its decision to expel
the American weapons inspectors working for the United Nations,
which led to the withdrawal of most of the arms inspectors in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council of the United Nations will meet today on
the possibility of sending back the arms inspectors to Iraq so as
to resume their work as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived here tonight on a previously
unannounced visit to Egypt, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Albright held talks with Foreign Minister Amr Moussa upon her
arrival at the Cairo airport on the latest developments in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key mediator in the Mideast peace process, boycotted a
U.S.-backed Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference to
the disappointment of Albright who attended the inauguration in
Qatar on Sunday despite the absence of most Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Moussa has ruled out an imminent visit by
Albright, who has cut short her visit to India later today and
will fly to Geneva for a pre-dawn meeting Thursday to discuss the
Iraqi-U.N. standoff with the foreign ministers of Russia, France and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The hastily arranged meeting follows efforts by Russia to ease
the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections through high-level
contacts with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Washington has decided to beef up its military presence in the
Gulf for a possible strike against Baghdad as world leaders are
trying to resolve the 22-day-old U.N.-Iraq standoff.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been contacting with Baghdad in a bid to resolve the
crisis as a skeleton crew of inspectors pulled out of Iraq
following Iraq's order on October 29 expelling Americans working
in the U.N. Commission on dismantling its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has sent two messages to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, urging him to comply with the UN resolutions and
restraining from military showdown with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraqi Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, currently visiting Moscow, will meet with Moussa and
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's visit to Egypt comes within the context of an Arab tour
including Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco to expound Iraq's
views on the recent tension between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
He reportedly has devised a proposal with Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeniv Primakov to avert a military confrontation with
the U.S..

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
controversial labor bill, which provides for a maximum 45-hour
working week and other labor privileges, cleared the National
Council of Provinces (NCOP) today.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Conditions of Employment Bill was approved by the
National Assembly on November 6.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the NCOP Labor Committee rejected 20
last-minute amendments introduced by the National Party (NP) to
make the bill more flexible and reduce the powers of labor
Minister Tito Mboweni.
</P>
<P>
The bill was supported by black-based parties like the African
National Congress, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Pan
Africanist Congress, but was opposed by NP, Democratic Party and
Freedom Front.
</P>
<P>
It was also rejected by organized business, which claims it
will lead to major job losses.
</P>
<P>
However, the months-old wrangling is not over as Mboweni has
told the NCOP that parliament would entertain an amendment to the
bill next year before it is promulgated.
</P>
<P>
He said much work has yet to be done. An investigation into
its possible impact on small businesses needed to be finalized
and maternity benefits provided for by the Unemployment Insurance
Fund (UIF) needed to be improved.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department had also to launch changes introduced by
the new legislation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Blames PUK for Tension in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today accused the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), a major party in northern
Iraq, of creating fresh tensions in the region, according to the
Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said at a news
briefing today that it was the PUK that provoked the recent
clashes with its rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian PUK, and KDP, allegedly backed by Turkey and
Iraq, have engaged in continuous battles for the control of
northern Iraq since President Saddam Hussein was rendered
ineffective in the area by the defeat in the 1990 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Their conflicts intensified since mid-October, causing grave
concern in Turkey, the United States and Britain, the three
mediators of the Ankara process designed to settle the northern
Iraq issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Foreign Ministry also warned the PUK office in Ankara
against its cooperation with the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has repeatedly blamed the PUK for close ties with the
PKK, a outlawed militant group fighting against government troops
for autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Local TV and newspaper reports said that the KDP has assisted
Turkish troops in massive military actions against the PUK and PKK.
</P>
<P>
However, Utkan emphasized that Turkey's military operation in
northern Iraq is completely aimed at wiping out the PKK camps
there.

<HEADLINE> Bashir Attacks US In Response To American Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir today condemned the United States' recent decision to
impose economic sanctions on Sudan, describing the U.S. as a thief
plundering and robbing Sudan's wealth.
</P>
<P>
Bashir made the remarks at a government-organized mass rally
here in protest against the U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Washington announced early this month new and extensive
economic sanctions against Sudan for its alleged support for
international terrorism and human rights record. The sanctions
include freezing all Sudanese assets in the U.S. and barring
U.S. investment, bank loans and trade on selected items.
</P>
<P>
Bashir described the latest American decision, which opened the
door to the Sudanese to migrate to the U.S., as a new method of
slavery and to recruit the Sudanese people against their own
country. He said "we shall endeavor to stop this immigration,"
asserting his country will reply to the (U.S.) decision with further
holy war.
</P>
<P>
Bashir also condemned the U.S. for imposing sanctions on Iraq,
Libya and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has adopted several measures in protest
against the U.S. sanctions. It has banned the export of Arabic Gum
to America, boycotted dealings in U.S. dollars in Sudanese banks
and prohibited the activities of U.S. firms on Sudanese
territory. Mass rallies were also organized throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Sudanese government considered the
U.S. decision as a cause of aborting the recent negotiations in
the Kenyan capital Nairobi between the government and the major
rebel group.

<HEADLINE> El Nino to Hit Rice Bowls of 5 Million Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- An estimated five
million people in southern Africa will need food aid over the
next nine months because of drought caused by the El Nino weather
phenomenon, World Food Program (WFP) said here today.
</P>
<P>
WFP executive director Catherine Bertini said southern African
countries had to brace themselves for possibly the worst drought
to hit the region in 100 years.
</P>
<P>
"About 27 million people live in the high risk countries of
Lesotho, Swaziland, Malawi, Madagascar, Tanzania and Zambia. Of
these about five million will be very vulnerable," she told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
She said Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and some parts of
Zimbabwe were likely to be less affected because of their
capacity.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to feed about five million people for nine months,
this would require about 600,000 tons (of food) and at about 300
U.S. Dollars per ton, we would be looking at roughly 200 million
U.S. Dollars."
</P>
<P>
Bertini is in the region to assess individual countries'
preparation for the El Nino, which is brought about by the
warming of ocean temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
She said South Africa plays a crucial role in the relief work.

WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Led by apartment
construction, the U.S. housing starts rose 1.4 percent in October,
the Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth was limited to multifamily homes as a

The department said construction of new homes and apartments

previous month. The September rate initially was estimated to be
1.5 million in the monthly report.
</P>
<P>
Starts during the first 10 months of 1997 totaled 1.3 percent
less than they did during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Home Builders is predicting a

<HEADLINE> APEC Meeting Convenes for Closer Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, CANADA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The annual
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum kicked off here
today with Senior officials sitting down to prepare ground for the
leaders' conference scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials representing 18 economies on the Pacific Rim
gathered in the Vancouver Trade &AMP; Convention Center this morning
for two-day meeting in preparation for the summit, the fifth since
1993.
</P>
<P>
They are discussing ways of promoting free trade and
investment, a target set in Borgor APEC summit. The developed
economies were committed to realizing the goal no later than 2010
and the developing ones no later than 2020.
</P>
<P>
Functioning as a governmental forum since its founding in 1989,
it groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong of
China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese
Taipei, Thailand, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The APEC has made a remarkable progress in terms of free trade
and investment, but it remains stagnant in some other areas, an
Asian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The trade and investment liberalization is almost on track and
progressing, while the developed economies are showing little
interest in promoting technological cooperation, said the official
specialized in the APEC affairs.
</P>
<P>
He described the free trade and investment and economic
technological cooperation as two cornerstones of the APEC, which
makes up 40 percent of the world's total trade.
</P>
<P>
Canada, chairing this annual APEC meeting, had announced that
it would push for closer cooperation in lowering trade barriers,
strengthening infrastructure and sustaining economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials' gathering will be followed by a two-day
ministerial meeting on Friday and Saturday to finalize the agenda
for the leaders' meeting to be held next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are expected to arrive on Saturday or Sunday.
Bilateral meetings will be held on the sideline of the summit.

<HEADLINE> Cross Burned at Afro-American Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Officials are asking for
the public's help in solving a cross burning at the Afro-American
Museum and Cultural Center in Wilberforce, Ohio, of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Museum Curator Floyd Thomas found the partially burned cross
Tuesday near the museum's administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
The four-foot-high wooden cross was painted with a racial
threat, white supremacy slogans, a swastika and the Ku Klux Klan's
initials.
</P>
<P>
Ohio Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. John Born told the Columbus
Dispatch there were no suspects, saying the patrol is
investigating because the cross was burned on state property. The
Ohio Historical Society owns the museum, founded in 1988 by acts
of the Ohio General Assembly and Congress.
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the cross will probably be placed on display after
the patrol ends its investigation.
</P>
<P>
Thomas said, "It's an important part of Afro-American and
American history. This could cause people to look at the
institution and understand what we are doing here."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. space shuttle
Columbia, carrying an multinational crew of six on a 16-day
science mission, today blasted into orbit from the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
The 4.5 million-pound spaceship was launched into a hazy sky at
2:46 p.m. EST (1946 GMT), right on the mark, as the clouds turned
out to be not as thick as forecasters had feared.
</P>
<P>
During the long-time orbit journey, Columbia's astronauts will
release a solar observatory and retrieve it two days later,
conduct a practice spacewalk that was canceled last year because
of a stuck hatch, and grow plants and crystals.
</P>
<P>
It is the eighth and final shuttle launch by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the year and the
24th flight for NASA's oldest shuttle. NASA last flew eight
missions in a single year in 1992.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, NASA's astronaut Winston Scott and Japanese
astronaut Takao Doi will walk into the open cargo bay to test an
extendible crane and other equipment to be used on the future
international space station. A free-flying, ball-shaped robotic
camera will hover over the shoulders of the astronauts, making its
space debut.
</P>
<P>
Among the first astronauts to fly on a U.S. spacecraft were
also a Ukrainian and an Indian-born woman as well as Doi, who will
also be the first Japanese to make a space talk.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma attended the launch, cheering
on Columbia the Ukrainian crewman, Leonid Kadenyuk.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S-based MagneTek, a
multinational manufacturer of integrated electrical products, has
opened its Asia branch in Hong Kong, according to Ronald Hoge, the
company's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
Hoge announced establishment of the branch at today's session
of the '97 International Symposium of Electronic Ballasts
sponsored by the China Green Lights Program.
</P>
<P>
MagneTek hopes to further explore the Asian market by using
China as its sales, R&AMP;D and manufacturing base, according to Hoge.
</P>
<P>
He said the company supports and will be actively involved in
the ongoing China Green Lights Program, a key national energy
conservation project designed to promote the efficient use of
energy and related products.
</P>
<P>
"MagneTek is excited to be a partner in China's endeavors to
increase efficient energy consumption and looks forward to using
its technology to assist the nation in energy conservation
efforts," said Hoge.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to invest in an electronic ballast production
plant in China, said Hoge, noting that ballasts are a key
component of lighting systems.
</P>
<P>
MagneTek and a local company have previously established a
generator production plant in Fuzhou, capital of the coastal
Fujian Province. The joint venture, established at a cost of 10.5
million US dollars, went into operation early this year and has an
annual production capacity of 8,500 generators.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Kwok, president of MagneTek Asia Inc., said the parent
company has fully exhibited its confidence in the Chinese market
by establishing its Asia branch in Hong Kong. MagneTek plans to
invest a total of 20 million US dollars in Asia over the next
three years, with the major portion of funds earmarked for
expanding its production and sales network in China.

<P>
GENEVA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Intensive diplomatic efforts by
the Five U.N. Security Council permanent members seems to have
brought the Iraq weapons inspection crisis back on a peaceful
track.
</P>
<P>
News from the Geneva ministerial meeting of the five permanent
members today indicates that Baghdad has agreed to allow the
U.N. weapons inspectors, including those from the United States,
to resume their normal work in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
If Iraq announces this decision today as it has promised, no
major excuse will be left for those threatening to use force.
</P>
<P>
A carefully-worded joint statement issued at the end of the
meeting urged Iraq to unconditionally accept the return of the
U.N. inspection team in its previous composition.
</P>
<P>
The statement also suggested that the Special Commission of the
U.N. Security Council (UNSCOM) discuss ways to make its work more
effective on the basis of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Although the statement has made no promise to Iraq, it did
offer Iraq with a ladder to climb down without losing face.
</P>

at the meeting, said that all the parties present share the wish
to resolve the dispute through diplomatic channels.

<HEADLINE> EU Citizens to Know More of Their Single Market Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- European Union citizens are
to learn more about their single market rights as the 15-nation
union enters later this month the second stage of its Citizen
First campaign.
</P>
<P>
Single market rights are of great interest to people in buying
goods and services in the single market, traveling in another EU
country and equal rights and opportunities for women and men.
</P>
<P>
Millions of copies of single market rights brochure will be
distributed in 19 different languages while free phone call
services and signpost services will also be provided in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
There is an Internet address dedicated to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
All these are aimed at explaining in detail how citizens can
use and enforce their rights in each EU member state and at
helping people when they have difficulties in knowing how to
exercise their rights.
</P>
<P>
There will also be a major publicity and media campaign in all
the 15 EU member states to advertise the single market rights
initiative and to inform people details of the appropriate points
of contact at European, national and local level.
</P>
<P>
Questions raised by EU citizens are deemed of importance to the
European Commission, the executive agency of the European Union,
in that they give the commissioners a direct feedback about
practical problems which people face when using their rights.
</P>
<P>
A consumer campaign will be waged in Spain, Portugal, Italy,
Greece and Ireland in the meanwhile to publicize EU legislation on
unfair contract terms and reinforcing the role of consumer bodies
in these countries.
</P>
<P>
The Single Market Action Plan endorsed at the Amsterdam summit
in June provides for the establishment of a permanent dialogue
with citizens.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue, a major feedback from a wide range of subject
areas such as employment, health protection, safety at work,
environment and food safety, will not only increase awareness of
EU rights but help sustain the awareness in the long run as well.
</P>
<P>
The provision of better access to the rights information for
business sector is another important commitment of the Single
Market Action Plan.
</P>
<P>
Planning is now underway to design a business signpost service
in the hope of guiding businesses to the correct network or body
to provide them with the information they need on single market
issues.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government Rejects Turkish Cypriot Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
dismissed as "utterly unacceptable" terms put forward by the
Turkish Cypriot leader for participation in accession talks with
the European Union (EU), scheduled for April next year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before a Cabinet meeting today, Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides warned Rauf Denktash that "this kind
of tactics would not bear fruit."
</P>
<P>
Denktash has reportedly said that he would adopt a more
conciliatory stand if his self-styled regime in northern Cyprus is
recognized by the international community as a "sovereign entity"
and if Turkey is included among the candidates for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was recognized only by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Such statements are utterly unacceptable and this type of
policy will not get anywhere," the Cypriot foreign minister
commented.
</P>
<P>
The EU has reaffirmed its March 1995 decision that accession
negotiations with Cyprus will start early next year. Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides asked the Turkish Cypriot side to join
Greek Cypriots to form a delegation as the sole interlocutor in
the EU talks.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has turned down the proposal and warned that the
opening of talks on Cyprus' accession to EU will have adverse
effect on the pursuit of a settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"The illegal Turkish Cypriot regime will not be recognized
under any form, excuse or method. This was made abundantly clear
by the international community," Kasoulides stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council described the Turkish Cypriot regime
as "legally invalid" and called in its resolution 541 (1983) for
its withdrawal, urging all states not to recognize it.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over northern third of the island in the wake of
a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Posts 6.3 Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea, which has been in a
financial turmoil for weeks, reported a 6.3 percent year-on-year
growth in the third quarter on back of robust exports.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korea said in a report, "Major economic indicators
show that the national economy achieved a modest, though not
strong, growth in the third quarter, thanks mainly to a surge in
exports and a slowdown in imports."
</P>
<P>
Citing a drop in inventories and a slowdown in private
consumption, the bank said that the GDP showed a better
performance in the third quarter than in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise exports rose 31.3 percent, while service exports
went up by 18.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the imports of goods and services expanded
by only 5.4 percent, down from 8.4 percent and 7.9 percent in the
previous two quarters.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the export surge to stronger price
competitiveness arising from the depreciation of the country's
currency won.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector grew 8.1 percent in the third quarter,
up from the second quarter's 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted the economy will grow 6-6.3 percent in the
fourth quarter on an annual basis.

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Editorial Urges Further Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- An editorial in tomorrow's
edition of "People's Daily" calls for creating a new situation in
the reform of China's financial system.
</P>
<P>
The highly important national financial conference which ended
in Beijing on Wednesday will have far-reaching significance in
promoting China's reforms and socialist modernization, as well as
in achieving trans-century objectives, according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
Tangible achievements recorded in financial supervision and
services over the past few years have played a major role in
strengthening macroeconomic control, accelerating economic growth
and maintaining social stability.
</P>
<P>
Facts prove that the principles and policies adopted by the
Party Central Committee and State Council are correct and
effective, according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted that a number of problems, including an
incomplete legal system, lax management over finances and
violations of the law and financial disciplines by some financial
institutions continue to exist.
</P>
<P>
"We should pay special attention and promptly introduce
measures to solve related problems," stressed the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the financial conference was to promote the
establishment of a financial system by deepening reform and
enhancing supervision in order to legalize financial activities
and minimize financial risks.
</P>
<P>
China enjoys a relatively good macroeconomic situation, rapid
and sustained economic growth, stable prices, ample grain supplies
and substantial foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
"We should make full use of all favorable conditions to expand
financial reforms and solve financial problems left over from
history," according to the editorial.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Efforts to Control Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China plans to allocate over
180 billion yuan (21.6 billion US dollars) for pollution control
and environmental protection projects by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhehua, director of the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection, said today that efforts will focus on basically
curbing the escalation of environmental pollution and ecological
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Xie made the remarks during the ongoing "97 China
Environmental Forum," the first high-level international forum of
it's kind held in China.
</P>
<P>
He said China will focus on a series of major environmental
projects in accordance with basic state policies and the
requirements of international conventions.
</P>
<P>
The state environmental protection plan calls for China to
basically control the escalation of environmental pollution and
ecological destruction by the end of this century, in addition to
basically changing related conditions by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that massive allocations will flow into 1,600
environmental projects, including controlling water pollution
along the Huaihe, Liaohe and Haihe rivers, as well as lakes such
as Dianchi, Chaohu and Taihu. Funds have also been earmarked for
air pollution control projects, and controlling emissions from
power generation and metallurgical plants, as well as ozone layer
protection projects.
</P>
<P>
Xie stressed that related efforts will be based on the
principle that the enterprises responsible for pollution will be
required to use internal funds to solve related problems.
</P>
<P>
He said local governments will be required to collect funds for
environmental infrastructure projects. The central government will
support related projects by offering loans and introducing foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Xie said China has also used loans from the World Bank, Asian
Development Bank and foreign governments to fund major
environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Environmental Protection announced today that
China will seek foreign cooperation for 70 major environmental
projects. A number of U.S. and Japanese companies attending the
ongoing conference have expressed interest in various projects.

<HEADLINE> Aziz: UNSCOM Can Resume Work in Iraq From Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz
said today the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) entrusted with
ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction can resume its mission
as of now.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference after his talks with Arab League
(AL) Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid at the AL headquarters,
Aziz said Baghdad declares its approval of the return of all
members of the UNSCOM to carry out their task without any
conditions on the represented nationalities.
</P>
<P>
It was decided following the exchanged messages between Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Russia was committed to exerting genuine efforts to
lift the sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990, and (ensuring) the UNSCOM respect of the sovereignty of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is thus giving a chance for a political and diplomatic
solution to lift the Security Council-imposed embargo," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that should the United States continue to
neglect the Iraqi legitimate rights and obstructed correcting the
position of the UNSCOM there will be "another attitude."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. inspection teams in charge of scrapping
Iraqi weapons of mass destruction will return to Baghdad within
hours.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Iraqi National Council accepted a Russian
proposal to allow all the U.N. arms inspectors, including the
Americans, to come back immediately to renew their monitoring of
its weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Russia also agreed that Russia will work for the
lifting of the crippling seven-year-old economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's decision ends the standoff which saw an American
military buildup in the Gulf and Iraqi threats to shoot down any
U.S. U-2 spy planes flying over Iraq's air space on surveillance
missions.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of intensive diplomatic efforts made by
Aziz, Yeltsin and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov over
the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Aziz arrived here today from Russia for a two-day visit, during
which he also is expected to hold talks with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's visit is part of his North African tour of Arab
countries to expound Iraq's views on the crisis between Iraq and
the U.N..

<HEADLINE> Iraq Satisfied With Russia-Brokered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today expressed
satisfaction with the Russian-brokered formula intended to resolve
the Iraq-U.N. crisis by diplomatic means and decided to allow all
the U.N. arms inspectors, including Americans, to return to their
work in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in a statement issued following a joint
meeting of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council and the National
Command of the ruling Baath Party.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that according to the agreement reached
with Russia, the Iraqi leadership decided to invite the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's
mass-destruction weapons, with all its members, to return to Iraq
to their work.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the agreement, Russia will in return work for
the lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq, which ban Iraq from
exporting its oil.
</P>
<P>
The standoff between Iraq and the U.N. lasted about three weeks
after Iraq on October 29 refused to allow the American arms
inspectors working with the UNSCOM to enter the sites the
commission wanted to inspect.
</P>
<P>
The statement affirmed that Iraq has implemented all the
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, including those which
call for eliminating mass-destruction weapons and laboratories
considered by the Americans to have served double purposes or to be
capable of rendering such services.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Iraq stood united and won the support
of Arab countries, governments and peoples. Its attitude, of
compelling the U.S. to resort to diplomatic channels for a
solution to the crisis, met with understanding from wide circles
all over the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement reaffirmed that Iraq moved some factories,
laboratories and production lines from their original localities
with the aim of preventing them from being destroyed by a possible
U.S. military attack on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Currency Plunges 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korean currency fell 10
percent to the daily allowable low for the first time today after
the government announced a package of measures to stablize the
troubled financial market.
</P>
<P>
Today's trading totaled about 100 million U.S. dollars, dealers
said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sharp depreciation of won, the central bank didn't
intervene in the domestic foreign-exchange market. It supplied
dollars only to those who could prove to be in real need.
</P>
<P>
The won, which hit its daily lows for the fourth consecutive
day, has depreciated about 35 percent sine the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed won's fall to strong speculative
forces and high demand for dollars among exporters.
</P>
<P>
Market experts predicted that the foreign exchange instability
would go on for a couple of days more.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, share prices at the Seoul stock exchange dropped
14.18 points to close at 488.41 despite the government's
stabilization measures, dealers said.

<HEADLINE> Bayer Remains Committed to Asia after Currency Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Chemicals and
pharmaceuticals group Bayer remains committed to its expansion
plans in Asia despite the recent currency turmoil in the region.
</P>
<P>
Bayer management board spokesman for Asia Pacific Dieter Becher
 announced here today that the multinational company will spend
2.32 billion U.S. dollars over the next ten years on capital
expenditures and acquisitions in the region, with the aim of
increasing Asia's share in total group sales from 14 percent in
1996 to 25 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"Bayer has no intention to slow down the implementation of its
marketing and investment plans for Asia," he told a media
briefing, expressing strong confidence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Macroeconomic realignments after the currency crisis "will
rather help to strengthen the economic development of the emerging
 economies in Asia," Becher pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The currency woes did not come as a complete surprise to Bayer
and "have only marginally impacted the sales and profit
performance so far", he added.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of 1997, Bayer recorded a sales
increase of 11 percent in Asia-Pacific to 3.25 billion
U.S. dollars, in line with the 13 percent rise across the globe to
 23.95 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turning to China, Becher revealed that Bayer enjoyed a path of
steady growth in the country, with a 12 percent increase in sales
in the first nine months of 1997 and an annual growth of 13
percent over the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
Currently, ten joint ventures have been put into operation in
China while another five are being discussed.
</P>
<P>
A state-of-the-art healthcare plant located in Beijing will
start production in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
So far Bayer has invested 290 million U.S. dollars in China and
 it envisages to inject another 290 million U.S. dollars into the
country by 2010, said Becher.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made on East Timor, Says Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said today after talks with visiting Indonesian
President Soeharto that progress has been made on the East Timor
problem, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that we are making progress, whenever we sit
down and discuss, we open the way for further progress," Mandela
told reporters in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"Our discussions today have been very fruitful."
</P>
<P>
But he did not say whether he had again appealed to Soeharto
for the release of jailed East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo told reporters last
week that Mandela would renew his appeal to Soeharto for Gusmao's
release.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made his first appeal in a letter to Soeharto after
his return from a state visit to Indonesia in July.
</P>
<P>
Mandela refused to go to detail on this issue, saying that he
would first report to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, with whom
he had been in contact three times in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, with a silent Soeharto at his side, appealed to the
media to respect his constitutional right to keep confidential
what he has discussed with the Indonesian leader.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was not acting independently, but was part of
the UN efforts to find a lasting solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former colony of Portugal, was occupied by
Indonesia in 1975 and annexed in the following year as
Indonesia's 27th province.
</P>
<P>
But the UN does not recognize Jakarta's sovereignty over the
territory and still regards Portugal as its legitimate
administrator.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are trying to negotiate an internationally
acceptable solution to the question.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto arrived in South Africa from Namibia this morning for
a three-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the two countries are expected to sign two
accords to boost trade relations.
</P>
<P>
An aviation agreement will facilitate direct air links between
the tow countries, while a trade agreement will provide for a
joint economic commission.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is also reportedly interested in buying South
African armaments, especially the Rooivalk attack helicopter.

<HEADLINE> EU to Aid Tunisia for Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
approved a grant of 50 million ECU (56 million U.S. dollars) to
Tunisia for rural development and natural resource management.
</P>
<P>
The aid is directed to development and management projects in
eight provinces of northern and central Tunisia. It is aimed at
even out regional disparities.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia's agricultural sector employs about one-third of the
working population of the country but contributes only 13.7 percent
to the country's gross domestic product. The income of
agricultural households is well below non-agricultural incomes.
</P>
<P>
The EU aid will boost the incomes of disadvantaged rural
population and improve their living conditions.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has made an accumulated contribution of some
73 million ECU (83 million dollars) to the national rural
development policy in the northern African country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the EU has given financial assistance to Tunisia in
the form of grants and loans totalling 294 million ECU (335 million
dollars) to help the country strengthen its economic transition.

<HEADLINE> Intl. Symposium on Clean Coal Technology Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international
symposium on clean coal technology closed today in Xiamen, a port
in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Some 230 representatives from 16 countries and regions, the
World Bank, and a large number of transnational companies attended
the symposium sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of
Energy, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Energy
Administration of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Participants held in-depth discussions on wide-ranging issues,
including macro development strategies concerning clean coal
technology, coal processing, coal conversion, pollution control
and treatment of waste materials.
</P>
<P>
"Clean coal technology" is a general term referring to all
techniques used to improve efficiency and reduce environmental
pollution in the process of developing and using coal.
</P>
<P>
Coal is one of China's major sources of primary energy, with
annual coal production and consumption accounting for some 75
percent of the nation's total primary energy output and energy
consumption volume.
</P>
<P>
China's recent introduction of clean coal technology
applications has resulted from an overseas research cooperation
project for the direct liquefaction of coal. The construction of
large industrial clean coal demonstration project will be
completed prior to the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the
development of clean coal technology and has placed related
development on its agenda for the next century. The developmental
goals for clean coal technology will be to protect the environment
and promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
A leading group focusing on the development and promotion of
clean coal technology was formed in 1995. The group consists of
representatives from industries, and related efforts are being
carried out under the auspices of the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The "China Clean Coal Technology Agenda for the Ninth
Five-Year-Plan Period (1996-2000) and Development Outlines for the
Year 2010," compiled by experts from various fields, was approved
by the State Council in June 1996. Relevant departments are also
actively drafting their own clean coal technology development
plans.
</P>
<P>
China has established exchange and cooperation ties related to
clean coal technology with related United Nations organizations
and industrialized nations.

for Polish exports destined for China," he said. "We are looking

markets, especially those of China, which were strained at the
beginning of 1990s," Kwasniewski said.
</P>

Victor Fung, chairman of the TDC, delivered a welcome speech at
the luncheon, stressing that Hong Kong regards Poland as a base
toward East Europe. Poland is now Hong Kong's second largest
trading partner in East Europe.

However, in this good economic situation, it is necessary to be
sober-minded about the problems existing in the financial sphere,
which include the inability of the financial system to meet the
needs to cope with economic reform and development under the new
situation, the imperfections in the legal system, weak financial
supervision, and relative confusion in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Solving these problems is the key to the success of reforms and
the maintenance of stability both now and in the future, and a
greater effort must be made in the financial sector to ensure
financial safety, efficiency and stability, with modern
information technology and management.
</P>
<P>
To solve financial problems and promote the reforms and
development of the financial sector, banks must become real banks
in keeping with the requirements of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The supervisory function of the People's Bank of China, or the
central bank, should be intensified, the pace of commercialization
of state-owned commercial banks should be accelerated, and a

<HEADLINE> HK Stocks Slide Amid Fears of Rising Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong share prices slid
further today amid concern that interest rates could be pushed up
again due to the collapse of the South Korean currency.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index, which traces the performance of 33
blue chips, declined 103.68 points, or 1.02 percent, to end the
day at 10,050.68. The market has lost for three consecutive days
about 370 points after rebounding 460 points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Turnover shrank to 7.516 billion HK dollars (one billion US
dollars), less than half of the daily average over the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
The ten-percent plunge of the South Korean won today
intensified the concern that the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the
greenback might be tested again, said securities analysts.
</P>
<P>
The high interest rates, which have not come down yet after the
last round of speculative attack, climbed up again amid the fear.
The primary three-month interbank lending rates ticked up to 12.5
percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Herbert Lau, a researcher of Vickers Ballas Hong Kong, said:
"Interest rates will continue to be the key signal for the market
direction in the next few weeks." He predicted that the market
would be volatile before the end of the year, with the blue-chip
index moving up and down around the 10,000-point level.
</P>
<P>
Shares opened slightly lower today, and dropped to 9980.25
points before the midday close, but finally recovered to cling to
the 10,000-point benchmark.
</P>
<P>
Utilities shares led the decline, shedding 241.85 points or
2.18 percent, followed by property, commerce and industry
counters, H shares and red chips, which all fell modestly. Bank
shares bucked the trend to move up by some 12 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING. November 20 (Xinhua) -- A local regulation passed here
today gives the Beijing People's Congress the right to limit
judicial departments in their handling of legal cases.
</P>
<P>
From next year on, the standing committee of the Beijing
People's Congress will have special committees to look into
appeals, accusations and reports made by citizens or organizations
against judicial organizations and their staff members.
</P>
<P>
"The new regulation is a major step by the municipal government
to perfect the supervisory system and ensure that judicial
departments do their duties in accordance with the law," said Xu
Bingzhong, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Beijing
People's Congress, the city's legislature.
</P>
<P>
"It will put a check on judicial departments and stop abuses of
power, fraudulent practices, and embezzlement," said Liu Changyi,
a legislator.
</P>
<P>
The ruling will take effect January 1 for Beijing's courts,
procuratorates, public security offices, and prisons.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, the standing committee can form a
special investigative committee, ask judicial departments to
report to it on specific cases, examine files, suggest that
judicial departments correct wrongdoings, or reexamine specific
cases.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also has articles to ensure that judicial
departments remain independent of each other, and the Standing
Committee can look into cases that might be wrongly handled, Liu
explained.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 28 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
have similar laws or regulations on judicial supervision.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The new head of Bangkok Asian
Games Organizing Committee (BAGOC) Thursday said the preparartions
for the already troubled Asiad may be behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, who was newly appointed
as the chief of the BAGOC, revealed that he was worried about the
work progress on two stadiums to be used in the 1988 event.
</P>
<P>
He said possible traffic congestion around other venues might
be a big headache.
</P>
<P>
Bhichai said the construction of a baseball venue may be
suspended if loans are not available.
</P>
<P>
Thai sports and political chiefs took a huge sigh of relief
last month after Bangkok passed a vital test in its preparetions
to host the games.
</P>
<P>
The OCA claimed that infrastructure and stadiums were behind
schedule even if Thailand was given seven years to prepare for the
Asiad.
</P>
<P>
Though BAGOC is facing huge difficulties, Bhichai pledged he
would take full control of it and would not make personnel changes.
</P>
<P>
"My whole administration will be based on present economic
policy," he said.

About 43 countries and regions are expected to attend the

TEHRAN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- World soccer governing body
FIFA decided on Wednesday to lift bans on four Iranian players
in order to put Saturday's Iran-Australia World Cup playoff tie
under equal and fair conditions.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said that they made the decision on the grounds that Iran

<P>
According to FIFA's rule, Iran's goalkeeper and captain
Ahmadreza Abedzadeh, striker Khodadad Azizi and two defenders
Ostad Asadli and Mohammad Khakpour would be able to play in
Saturday's first leg match against Australia on their home soil.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Reiterates "One China" Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
reiterated today that the Communist Party of China and Chinese
people will stand firm on the "one China" principle and resolutely
oppose any attempts to split China.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the Sixth National Conference of the All-China
Federation of Taiwan Compatriots which opened today in Beijing,
State Councillor Lou Gan said that Chinese leader Jiang Zemin's
report to the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) clearly outlined the promotion of peaceful
reunification as one of the major tasks facing the CPC and Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
He said the report clearly stipulated that the realization of
China's ultimate reunification is a great historic mission of the
Chinese Communist Party, and reiterated that China will
steadfastly adhere to the principles of "peaceful reunification"
and "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
The report called for formal talks to end hostilities between
the two sides under the principle of "one China", and urged Taiwan
authorities to earnestly table suggestions and proposals,
according to Lou, who also serves as a member of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The report clearly exhibited our confidence and determination
to solve the Taiwan issue and realize the country's ultimate
reunification," said Lou, adding that the report will exert great
influence on promoting peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Lou pointed out that the development of splittist trends in
Taiwan and interference on the part of foreign hostile forces have
seriously impeded the reunification process. "There is still a
difficult task in opposing splittism and Taiwan independence,"
said Lou.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China will act in the spirit of the 15th
Party congress, unswervingly adhere to the "one China" principle
and firmly oppose any activities designed to split China,
including calls for "Taiwan independence", "two Chinas" and "one
China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
"We firmly oppose any interference from foreign forces, and any
attempts to use 'referendums' to alter the fact that Taiwan is an
inseparable part of China", said Lou, adding that "China will
never allow an outside force to change Taiwan's status as an
inseparable part of China."
</P>
<P>
He called for increased economic, cultural and personnel
exchanges, and the timely realization of direct postal, commercial
and transportation links between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that traditionally patriotic Taiwan people
will join hands with us to promote reunification," said Lou.
</P>
<P>
He said the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots is an
important force for developing relations between the two sides and
promoting the cause of peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Lou expressed hope that the new leadership elected during the
current meeting will join in fulfilling the historic mission of
national reunification and making new contributions to the great
cause.

BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China has come out with
interim regulations for fast-growing border tourism.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations, organizations and individuals must

<P>
The regulations also ban public-funded border travel, prohibit
travelers from overstaying or engaging in illegal emigration, and
provide that visa arrangements should be made within localities of
one's registered permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
The document, which is in 16 articles, also clearly defines the
meaning of border tourism and its responsible departments, the
prerequisites for opening a border tourism business, the main
contents of an agreement signed with travel organizations of
neighboring countries, and procedures for opening a border tourism
organization.
</P>
<P>
There are also terms concerning the way a Chinese citizen can
participate in border travel and methods of dealing with
law-breakers.
</P>
<P>
The document was jointly issued by the National Tourism
Administration of China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the
Ministry of Public Security, and the General Administration of
Customs. The purpose of the document is to further open China's
tourism sector to the outside world, enhance the economic
prosperity and social stability in border areas, and improve
management of border tourism, according to a spokesman for the

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Saltwater Lake Shrinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai Lake in northwest
China's Qinghai province is losing 11 cm a year in water level
because of dry weather and biological degradation, according to an
international conference.
</P>
<P>
Drought and serious soil erosion have caused a major decrease
in the flow of the Yellow River, a major source of the lake's
water, causing the lake's water level to drop, according to Liu
Guanghe, vice-governor of Qinghai Province, who is attending the
1997 China Environmental Forum in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The lake, which lies 3,200 meters above sea level in Qinghai
province, is China's largest lake and largest saltwater lake, and
is fed by seven rivers.
</P>
<P>
The lake has an average depth of 19 meters and is over 30
meters at the deepest.
</P>
<P>
Liu explained that Qinghai's forest coverage is only 2.59
percent and 330,000 sq km of land, or 46 percent of the province's
total, suffer from soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
The province has worked out a 15 to 20-year plan to control
soil erosion by planting trees and growing grass and by developing
environmentally friendly agriculture and animal husbandry, as well
as environmental protection in the areas along the lake.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Allows Return of US Arms Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq announced today that it
will allow the U.N. arms inspection teams, including U.S. arms
inspectors, to return to Iraq and resume their work starting today
in accordance with an agreement reached with Russia.
</P>
<P>
This came in a joint statement issued simultaneously in
Baghdad and Moscow today following a visit by Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz to Moscow, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached following exchange of letters
between Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his Russian
counterpart Boris Yeltsin, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will actively contribute -- provided that Iraq will
implement the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions -- to
getting the sanctions imposed on Iraq lifted soon, and will seek
to enhance the effectiveness of the UNSCOM (U.N. Special
Commision) taking in view Iraq's sovereignty and security," said
the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides agreed to continue making contacts with each
other in connection with the agreement they reached," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz met with Yeltsin in Moscow Tuesday and conveyed to him a
message from Saddam Hussein in reply to a previous message sent by
the Russian president.
</P>
<P>
The messages dealt with ways of getting Iraq's current
showdown with the U.N. settled diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
INA also said that a joint meeting of Iraq's Revolutionary
Command Council and the National Command of the ruling Baath
party was in session to discuss the Baghdad-Moscow joint
statement and that a statement would be issued following the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The agency reported that Saadoun Hammadi, Speaker of the
Iraq's National Assembly (Parliament), briefed members of the
assembly this morning on the positive results achieved through
messages exchanged between the Iraqi and Russian leaders as well
as the results achieved by Aziz in lifting the seven-year-old
U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions cannot be lifted unless the U.N. arms inspection
teams verify that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The current U.N.-Iraqi confrontation was caused by Iraqi
expulsion of U.S. arms inspectors in the UNSCOM teams on November
13. Iraq accused the Americans of conducting espionage and
blocking the lifting of the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar lost
more than half a US cent today in a bearish market as a plunging
South Korean won took the center stage.
</P>
<P>
The local unit settled at 68.61 US cents, down from a close
yesterday of 69.35 US cents.
</P>
<P>
Traders said concerns over the financial crisis in Asia and its
likely negative implications for the domestic economy continued.
</P>
<P>
"Every factor that is coming out at the moment is still
negative" for the Australian dollar, Paul Macarounas, a foreign
exchange expert, said.
</P>
<P>
"The Asia problem is not getting any better. The Aussie is
losing its shine as an interest rate currency and certainly as a
commodity based currency," the expert said.
</P>
<P>
Today, the focus was on the South Korean currency market where
trade was again suspended as the won plunged past the lower limit
of the 10 per cent band set around 1012.8 won, falling to an
all-time low of 1,035.5 won against the United States dollar.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is Australia's second largest export destination
and has a strong appetite for commodities, particularly copper and
aluminum.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was weaker against the yen as traders
said Japanese investors looked to cover shorts.
</P>
<P>
The local unit was at 86.89 yen, from yesterday's close of
87.98 yen and at 1.1899 marks from 1.2063 marks previously.

Beijing this afternoon with V.N. Ignatenko, president of Russia's
Itar-Tass news agency, said that China was impressed by President

<P>
Developing a Sino-Russian strategic co-operative partnership

development of the region and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the tendency toward world multipolarization is
accelerating and Russia is playing an important role in
international affairs, and voiced his appreciation for the long
co-operative relations between Itar-Tass and the Xinhua News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the human society has entered the information age
and the news media have a great impact on every aspect of social
life, and state agencies have undertaken important missions. He
said he hopes that Itar-Tass will make new contributions in the
course of Russia's development.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's First Robot to Help in Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The first robotic
surgical assistant in Africa was introduced at a Johannesburg
hospital Wednesday, The Citizen newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Five operations were conducted with the help of the robot
named AESOP (automated endoscopic system operating procedure) at
the Park Lane Clinic in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
It was used to visually inspect the abdomen or chest via a
camera attached to a monitor.
</P>
<P>
The robot, mounted on the theater bed, can be activated
manually and via voice recognition.
</P>
<P>
It understands 23 commands, and responds by moving the camera
(endoscope) to the precise position required by the doctor to
ensure that he maintains a precise visual control of the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
It is calibrated by the surgeon with the specific data
concerning the weight and size of the patient.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Johan van der Wat, a gynecologist and endoscopic surgeon
at the clinic who pioneered the project, said robotic surgery is
the only way for surgery to go in future.
</P>
<P>
He explained that during open case surgery in the past, the
surgeon had to run the camera with his right hand, while
operating with the left hand. Now the surgeon had both hands free
and full control of his eyes.
</P>
<P>
The human assistant who had to hold the camera often had
difficulties in holding it still for a long time during complex
procedures. There were also communication problems between the
doctor and the assistant.
</P>
<P>
Jay Smith, international director of computer motion in the
United States, who is working with gynecologists and
obstetricians at the clinic said with the help of the robot, the
operating time could be reduced by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
"It is used for cardiac surgery such as an artery by-pass, in
gynecologic and general surgery," Smith said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Nigerian agricultural
official has said that Nigeria has attained a high level of food
security in the past two decades and that it can still boast of
being the Food Basket of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Federal Agricultural Coordinating Unit, Salisu
Ingawa, said in Abuja at the weekend that there has never been a
food crisis in Nigeria in the last 20 to 23 years.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's importation of rice does not mean that it could not
produce enough food to feed the population, he said, adding that
Nigeria has been exporting food to neighboring countries such as
Cameroun, Togo and the Niger Republic.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that his organization has mapped out strategies
for attaining greater heights in food production from the next
farming season.
</P>
<P>
Such strategies, he said, involve the strengthening of the
research-input-farmer linkage through state agricultural
development programs with a view to enlightening farmers on
modern and more productive system of farming.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun Boosting Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun's Minister of State
for Agriculture Augustin Kodock has said there is need to carry
out agricultural campaigns since Camerounians have now begun to
realize that agriculture pays, Cameroon Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the declaration during a conference in the
economic capital Douala recently with fertilizer and pesticide
dealers aimed at examining farmers' problems and seeking ways and
means to improve productivity.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the minister of state said it was due
to inadequate guarantees and the underlined means of
reimbursement of loans that banks were dragging their feet to
grant loans to dealers in fertilizers and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that a subvention of CFA 400 million (about 6,800
U.S. Dollars) in form of fertilizers and pesticides was
distributed to the different delegations of agriculture last
year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry does not impose any particular
type of fertilizer on farmers who, he explained, choose their
fertilizers based on the results or easy application.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, neither fertilizers nor pesticides are
imposed on farmers. They choose from a variety of products the
national committee recommends based on their safety to man and
the environment.
</P>
<P>
On the local production of fertilizers, the minister said:
"that is even my greatest desire." He said the farmer is being
educated on the type of fertilizers to apply on what type of soil,
through district representatives of the ministry who serve as
liaison officers between the ministry and even researchers.
</P>
<P>
The minister said there is no urgency in the importation of
pesticides since files have to be studied meticulously or
prudence cannot be compromised with urgency, especially as the
slightest error results in calamity.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Giant Bakun Hydro-Electric Project Taken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
has taken over the deferred Bakun hydro-electric project in
Sarawak, East Malaysia, from the private firm Ekran Bhd effective
today, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced today.
</P>
<P>
Ekran, a major shareholder of Bakun Hydro-Electric Corporation
(BHC), is no longer keen to continue with the project, Anwar who
is also Finance Minister said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
The 13.6 billion ringgit (about 4 billion U.S. dollar) project
in Sarawak's hinterland was awarded to Ekran Bhd, which owns 32
percent of BHC, and was subsequently contracted out to a
consortium ABB-CBPO, comprising Swedish-based Asea Brown Boveri
and a Brazilian group, Companhia Brasileira de Projectos Obras.
</P>
<P>
However, Ekran dropped ABB-CBPO as the main contractor
following contractual disputes a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
The government announced in its 1998 budget that it will defer
the project along with several other big projects in the wake of
the sharp depreciation of the local currency and sharp fall in the
share prices on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange as a result of the
financial turmoil in the region.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that since Ekran had lost interest in the Bakun dam
project due to the government's firm stand to defer it, the
government had no option but to take over some of the components
of the project.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said in view of recent developments, the government would
reschedule the implementation of the project taking into account
the country's future power needs.

<HEADLINE> New Thai Government Presents Policy Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The new Thai government led by
Democrat Party leader Chuan Leekpai presented its policy statement
to the Parliament today, giving priority to tackling the country's
economic woes, particularly the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of confidence of both domestic and
international investors is the most urgent task of Thailand, the
government said in the 44-page statement, which covers the areas
of politics, administration, national security, foreign affairs,
social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The government will step up its effort to stabilize the economy
and solve the problems facing the financial institutions in the
country, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The government will support and develop the financial
institutions which currently remain in operation, while moving to
bail out the cash-trapped 58 finance firms whose operations were
suspended earlier this year, including allowing them to resume
operation after capital increase.
</P>
<P>
The government also reaffirmed its commitment with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), including maintaining its
foreign exchange reserves at a level enough to build up confidence
of investors in the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
On other economic aspects, the statement said that the
government will take measures to draw more foreign investment and
clear barriers for exports and tourism to increase the country's
revenues in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Also, the government will take measures to help local
enterprises, especially those export-oriented enterprises which
are short of funds, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will encourage the private sector
to take over the state-owned enterprises to lessen the state
burden and improve management.
</P>
<P>
On medium- and long-term economic policies, the statement said
that the government will strive to readjust the country's
agricultural and industrial structures, bring in new technology
and foreign funds, develop human resources to lay a solid
foundation for the country's future economic development.
</P>
<P>
On political issues, the government stressed that it will speed
up the implementation of the new Constitution and other by-laws to
push ahead the political reform in the country.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign affairs, the statement said that the Thai
government will stick to the United Nations Charter and those
treaties that Thailand has participated in and enhance its
cooperation with all countries over the world, especially its
neighboring countries in the areas of economy, science and
technology, culture, tourism and human resources development.
</P>
<P>
The statement particularly stressed that Thailand will
strengthen and improve its cooperative ties with other members of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and boost
economic ties with major trade partners under the free-trade
principle.
</P>
<P>
Among the social issues, the statement said that the government
will increase job opportunities to ease the deteriorating
employment situation caused by the economic slowdown in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the national security, the government pledges to
support the modernization of the country's armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Official Meets with Overseas Chinese Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, met here today with members of
the International Society of Chaozhou Natives who are attending a
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Li, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said that
great changes have taken place in recent years in Chaozhou and
Shantou, and that infrastructure development has been inspiring,
thanks to support given by foreign or Chinese nationals of
Chaozhou ancestry.
</P>
<P>
Li said that many traditional Chinese virtues like hard work, a
love of one's hometown, unity, and mutual assistance are all
reflected in the many foreign or Chinese nationals of Chaozhou
ancestry overseas and are the precious spiritual assets of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's modernization drive is doing well but
needs the many overseas Chinese and Foreign and Chinese nationals
of Chaozhou ancestry to continue to contribute their enthusiasm
and strength, and it offers them a large market and more business
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Now that the world's economy is heading for intergration, Li
said, China needs to know more about the world, and vice
versa. Because overseas Chinese are in various fields and
businesses, Li said, he hopes that they will try their best to
offer more information, and become a bridge to the world.
</P>
<P>
Li was accompanied by Xie Fei, a member of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the CPC Guangdong
Provincial Committee, when he visited some infrastructure projects

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Up 11.4 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade
increased by 11.4 percent in October on a three-month moving
average basis, with exports and imports expanding by 9.4 percent
and 13.4 percent respectively, the Singapore Trade Development
Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, the TDB said, non-oil domestic exports rose
by 9.5 percent, marking the fifth consecutive month of positive
growth.
</P>
<P>
The TDB said that the increased was reflected in strong
double-digit growth of key electronic products such as integrated
circuits and Printed Circuit Board Assembled (PCBA). Besides,
domestic exports of non-electronics such as petrochemicals and
magnetic disk media also contributed to the growth.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports expanded by 8.2 percent, with the increase coming
mainly from key electronic products such as integrated circuits
and PCBA, in particular, to Malaysia, Japan and the European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
On a three-month moving average basis, non-oil domestic exports
increased by 10.3 percent to reach 8.4 billion Singapore dollars
(5.25 billion US dollars) in October. Of the total, non-oil
domestic exports to the United States, the EU, and Hong Kong
achieved double-digit growth of 12.3 percent, 10.2 percent and
23.9 percent respectively, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
However, oil domestic exports continued to decline by 5.2
percent due mainly to slower demand of oil from Hong Kong and
Japan, it said.
</P>
<P>
Imports increased by 13.4 percent, amounting to 17.6 billion
Singapore dollars (about 11 billion US dollars) in October.
Increases were reflected in imports of integrated circuits,
computer parts and peripherals, disk drives, semiconductors and
parts, and other electronic products, the TDB said.

<HEADLINE> Two Large Ice Mortar Groups Discovered in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have found
two groups of ice mortars from the Quaternary Period on a stony
ridge near Chifeng City in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The two groups, which are 400 meters apart, contain more than
30 ice mortars at an elevation of 700 meters above sea level.

<HEADLINE> Iran-Libya Sanctions Act Applied only in US: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 20 (Xinhua) -- United States Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Sanctions and Commodities
William Ramsay said here today that the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act
was unilateral and applied only in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Replying to reporters after meeting with Malaysian Foreign
Ministry's Acting Undersecretary for America Division Mohd Arshad
M. Hussain, Ramsay said, "The sanctions apply domestically in the
U.S. and they are not to apply outside."
</P>
<P>
"Well, sanctions could be imposed against Iran if the United
Nations agrees to such sanctions, but I don't know of any," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The intended move by the U.S. to probe Malaysia's national oil
company Petronas' involvement in gas field development in Iran has
met with all-round condemnation in Malaysia with Parliament
passing a motion Thursday to censure the U.S. for attempting to
implement the controversial act in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Petronas, together with France's company Total SA and Russia's
Gazprom, is involved in a 2 billion U.S. dollars gas field
development in Iran, which the U.S. government says faces the risk
of sanctions under the Act passed last year, which provides for
sanctions to be applied against companies which invest more than
20 million dollars a year in the oil and gas sector in both Iran
and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Ramsay made an announcement that his visit here is not to
investigate the gas field venture between Petronas and Iran as
expected, defusing a diplomatic row between Kuala Lumpur and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I was taking this opportunity to explain the Act and
its implementation so that the people understand. I am not here on
an investigatory mission."
</P>
<P>
He said in view of the situation, he would not be visiting
Petronas because he was satisfied with the outcome of his meeting
today with Mohd Arshad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Malaysian Foreign Ministry said in a statement
that during Ramsay's meeting with Malaysian officials led by Mohd
Arshad, it was clarified that the Act also provides the U.S.
president with discretion to waive or delay the imposition of
sanctions under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
It said that during the meeting, Mohd Arshad reiterated
Malaysia's position that the Act did not apply to Malaysia as it
was a U.S. national legislation.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia does not accept this extra-territorial application
and Malaysia holds the view that Petronas, in participating in the
consortium to develop the South Pars Gas Field in Iran, has not
contravened Malaysian laws or any international law or any World
Trade Organization regulations," the statement quoted Mohd Arshad
as saying.
</P>
<P>
It said Mohd Arshad told the meeting that Petronas and other
Malaysian companies would continue to invest abroad wherever
economic opportunities existed, including in Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding the differences between the two countries on
the interpretations regarding the applicability of the stated U.S.
legislation, both sides agreed that the foundations of
Malaysia-U.S. relations remain strong. The two countries share a
long-standing, beneficial and important relationship based on
mutual respect and understanding," the statement said.

</P>
<P>
Failed Hokkaido Takushoku Bank was today' most actively traded
issues.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo market, which has seen steep ups and downs in recent

<HEADLINE> Australia Announces Strategy to Reduce Greenhouse Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard today unveiled a 126 million U.S. dollar strategy that
would help reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emission growth.
</P>
<P>
Howard told the Australian parliament that the strategy, which
aims to improve the country's environment credentials ahead of
next month's climate change summit in Kyoto, Japan, would have a
dramatic impact on Australia's emission levels by 2010 compared
with the 1990 benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
Under the strategy, Australia's greenhouse gas emissions are
expected to rise by 18 percent over the 1990 levels instead of a
previously-projected 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
But Howard stressed that Australia would not agree to an
outcome at the Kyoto conference aimed at setting legally-binding
reduction targets for developed countries beyond the year 2000,
"that burdens us in an unfair manner."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Howard said that he would not sign on any
documents at the meeting if the outcome is unacceptable to
Australia's national interests.
</P>
<P>
The 18-percent increase ceiling has made Australia isolated
from other major developed countries on the greenhouse gas issue,
which have proposed reduction or stabilization targets for
greenhouse gas emissions by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) has made a proposal for greenhouse gas
emissions to be cut by 15 percent from the 1990 levels by 2010 for
developed countries, and Japan promised a 5 percent reduction in
its greenhouse gas emissions. The United States has called for
stabilization of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Robert Hill said that to go below the
18-percent limit would cost Australian jobs and damage sectors
where Australia has a competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
The strategy announced by Howard includes a range of programs
to encourage more efficient energy use, conversion to renewable
energy and revegetation.

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Group in Northeastern China (With Correction in Para 6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale cement
enterprise group, composed of five state-owned enterprises, is
scheduled to formally start business by the end of the year in
northeastern China's Liaoning Province, a traditional center of
heavy industry.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the province has more than 300
cement works, including 38 state-owned large and medium cement
firms, with a total annual output of 18 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the new cement group has a combined designed
capacity of 5 million tons of cement a year, with a total net
assets of 1.78 billion yuan (about 222 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts said the new cement group will be more competitive in
domestic and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Once the group begins operations, its profits are expected to
increase by 100 million yuan (about 12 million US dollars) in
comparison to profits of the original five cement works.
</P>
<P>
The group is expected to produce eight (rpt. eight) million
tons of cement annually and gain more than 5 billion yuan (about
625 million U.S. dollars) in annual sales by the end of 2000,
which would rank first in the country.
</P>
<P>
The group is expected to become the largest cement producer
in the country in 2010.

<HEADLINE> Israel Presents Final-Status Maps to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
has presented the United States with maps outlining Israel's
security and settlement concerns in a final-status arrangement
with the Palestinians, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, who is currently
visiting the U.S., presented the maps to U.S. national security
advisor Sandy Berger during a meeting in the White House
Wednesday, in which "Israel wants to retain several security zones
in the territories in any final-status settlement," the Radio
quoted an Israeli official as saying.
</P>
<P>
No statements were made after the meeting, but the Israeli
official said that Sharon stressed that "among the zones to be
retained by Israel are the Jordan Rift Valley, east-west roads
bisecting the territories and water resources."
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the official added, primarily dealt with the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, but not with how to make the
jump into final-status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Berger did not response immediately to the maps, but told
Sharon that the U.S. is working on its own plans for final-status
arrangements, which will be presented to Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) soon, the official said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton was reportedly not happy with the
Israeli government's hardline policy toward the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and he refused to meet Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the United states, even
though both of them were in Los Angeles the same day earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian Steering Committee met in Jericho, West
Bank Monday, and both sides did not reach agreements on
security-linked issues on projected Gaza airport and seaport, safe
passage between the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the Karni
Industrial Zone located near Gaza.

ANKARA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish military has started
to equip its helicopters with anti-missile systems purchased from
abroad, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
These precautions were taken against possible ground attacks
from the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in southeastern
Turkey and northern Iraq, the paper quoted a senior official from
the Turkish General Staff as saying.
</P>
<P>
The source, who declined to be named, said that Greece, a
traditional rival of Turkey, had reportedly provided the PKK
rebels with anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Two Turkish choppers involved in military operation were shot
down this summer by PKK's surface-to-air missiles. Thirteen
servicemen were killed.
</P>
<P>
These incidents led to grave concern among the military,
which urged the quick equipment of Turkey's helicopters with
anti-missiles systems.
</P>
<P>
"Reports that the PKK has purchased Stinger missiles made it
necessary to provide advanced anti-missile systems to our
military helicopters," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military has been in contact with the United States
and Israel for important deals in this field, defense sources

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Tadiran Electronic
Systems Company has won a military contract to supply command,
control, communication and intelligence systems to the Swiss army,
local daily The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tadiran executives were quoted by the daily as saying that the
contract worth of 120 million U.S. dollars is a milestone in the
European market, as it represents a significant entry into
Switzerland and may arouse interest among other European countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli industry sources, the deal is the largest
ever won by an Israeli private defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
The Tadiran system, called C31, is meant to provide the Swiss
artillery division with real-time battlefield information on the
deployment of friendly and enemy forces.
</P>
<P>
The system comprises several portable computers and military
work stations that incorporate information technology to channel
data via radio or wire, which will improve accuracy and save
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Tadiran Chief Executive Officer Yisrael Zamir said he is
expecting other contracts from Switzerland because the C31 system,
which he claimed to be the most advanced in the world, can be used
for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
The company won the contract through competition with British,
French and German defense firms.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Coalition to Form Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan anti-Taliban
coalition forces have announced to form a "broad-based" national
transition government in Afghnistan in the near future, the
Iranian official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held in Iran's northeastern city of
Mashhad, head of the Afghan Ministry of Religious Guidance,
Endowment and the Hajj Khodadad Erfani said that the new
provisional government would rule only for nine months until a
permanent government was elected by the people.
</P>
<P>
Erfani said that the national government of Afghanistan would
be formed within a month under the presidency of Burhanuddin
Rabbani based on understandings reached among various Afghan
political factions.
</P>
<P>
He said that various government posts have been distributed
among all groups and even the Taliban, which ousted the
government led by president Rabbani in September last year.
</P>
<P>
However, it was not clear whether the Taliban leaders in
Kabul had agreed with the decision made by the anti-Taliban
coalition which was formed after Rabbani's government fled the
country's capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IRNA said, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
Wednesday held a meeting with Rabbani who is currently in Tehran
for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that a broad-based mutual understanding in
Afghanistan would be the only way to end the crisis in that
war-stricken country, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped a speedy restoration of peace and tranquillity in
Afghanistan, saying that Iran's policy was always against the
use of any military solution to the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the crisis, Kharrazi said, Iran had
sincerely put all its efforts in trying to positively influence
the political atmosphere in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran is fully determined to contribute toward the humanitarian
cause to help bring peace in Afghanistan through a tranquil
diffusion of the current crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Rabbani said that the warmongers and their foreign
supporters should change their policy to pave the way for
restoration of peace and tranquility in the war-torn
country.

<HEADLINE> Mining Towns in China Look for Ways To Keep Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Workers at the Daqing Oilfield
in northeast China are using new recovery technology that will
allow them to get petroleum until the year 2010, but China will
eventually have to face the reality of shrinking oil resources.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Daqing are not quite so pessimistic about the
city's future prospects, however, and say that Daqing is fully
capable of maintaining economic prosperity for a longer period of
time by relying on new substitute industries.
</P>
<P>
They explain that Daqing has formed six major industries, and
the electronic sector alone is expected to generate 10 billion
yuan worth of output by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Fuxin, a coal city in Liaoning Province has analogous
problems. It now faces serious urban economic development problems
as a result of the rapid reduction of coal resources, and 70,000
miners face the prospect of joblessness because of a lack of coal.
</P>
<P>
City leaders in Fuxin have said they will work harder to find
new substitute industries in the next 15 years to save the city
from extinction.
</P>
<P>
China is rich in natural resources and 100 cities that depend
on the mining industry have emerged, but there are problems. They
have a single industrial structure, lack of infrastructure, a
deteriorating environment, and growing employment pressures.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that a diverse industrial structure and
developing comprehensive urban functions will be an effective way
of dealing with these problems.
</P>
<P>
Many of these mining towns are aware of their problems and have
started to invest heavily in developing mineral resources and
other sideline businesses.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources official says that
adjusting the industrial structure of mining towns and developing
a diverse economy would be a second revolution, so opening wider
to the outside world and actively attracting more overseas funds
is urgent and is a natural choice.

<HEADLINE> SADC Appeals for Tariff Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) should provide for market
information systems within the national borders in order to
improve marketing and food security in the region by reducing
tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates at the agricultural food marketing
agencies of eastern and southern Africa workshop in Harare
Wednesday, Zimbabwe's grain marketing board managing director
Martin Muchero said there was need for governments to liberalize
the market by reducing tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
He said the complete liberalization of agricultural markets
and sub-regional trade should encourage production on the basis
of comparative advantage and greater integration of the economies
of the region.
</P>
<P>
This would result in producers growing crops in response to
the demands of the market and agro-ecological conditions in their
areas, and not to government pricing policies.
</P>
<P>
There was need to have government policies harmonized and be
consistent with the promotion of free trade and the ultimate goal
should be the removal of all controls, tariffs and non-tariff
barriers on foodstuffs, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the workshop would provide a forum for food marketing
agencies to share information on agricultural production and
marketing issues in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the food and agriculture organization Andrew
Shepherd said that if a market was to function successfully
countries should not consider themselves to be islands.
</P>
<P>
He said attempts by governments to control imports and exports
will increase illegal trade as private traders would have more
maize available with which to exploit price differences between
countries than when most marketing was controlled by boards.
</P>
<P>
Market price mechanism should address most of the food
security concerns of governments, he said, adding the ultimate
target should be the removal of controls, tariffs and non-tariff
barriers on all foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the workshop were drawn from Kenya, Zambia,
Ethiopia, South Africa, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

Heilongjiang Province first introduced an old-age insurance
system for urban and rural areas in the early 1990s. So far, 3.63
million enterprise workers have participated in the system, with
total insurance premiums valued at 16.3 billion yuan (about 1.97
billion U.S. dollars). One million retired workers have received
old-age pensions valued at 14.7 billion yuan (about 1.79 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
At present, the old-age insurance system has been introduced in
85 percent of the province's rural areas, attracting 3.4 million
farmers or 43 percent of the total rural population.
</P>
<P>
Most cities in the province have joined efforts to provide
better services for the elderly, and have worked out regulations
on giving special rights for old people to enjoy free or
preferential treatment when traveling by bus, visiting local
doctors and shopping.
</P>
<P>
Some cities have set up factories to build facilities
especially for retired people.
</P>
<P>
Harbin, capital of the province, has seven such factories,
which have provided more than 50 million yuan (about 6.04 billion
U.S. dollars) in services for the elderly.

<HEADLINE> Israel Plans to Employ More Palestinian Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel has approved a new
plan to employ more Palestinian workers to replace foreign ones
in a bid to buffer the Israeli economy from destabilizing
fluctuations resulting from prolonged closures.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, Palestinian laborers will be given
special status that will allow them to return to their jobs in
Israel even after a closure is imposed, according to Yaacov Or,
coordinator of Israeli government activities in the territories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli employers will be required to undertake to
collect and return the workers from the border crossings and, if
needed, provide the Palestinian workers with sleeping
arrangements, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Israeli employers have increasingly
preferred foreign workers to Palestinians, even if the Arabs work
for lower wages, because closures imposed by Israel for security
reasons make the employers difficult to depend on the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Palestinian territories were closed off for over
100 days. Israel again imposed a total closure on the Palestinian
territories in July 30 this year after suicide bombings in
Jerusalem killed 18 people and wounded 151 others.
</P>
<P>
At its peak in the late 1980s, the Palestinian labor force in
Israel numbered over 100,000. Today, there are about 50,000
Palestinians working legally in Israel, with an estimated 40,000
more sneaking in without permits, according to Labor and Social
Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Foreign workers in Israel currently stand at 150,000 to
200,000, half of whom are illegal laborers.
</P>
<P>
At present, work permits are issued only to married
Palestinian males over 24, who have undergone a check by both
Israeli and Palestinian security authorities.

<HEADLINE> Cervix Cancer Rampant in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian health
officials have warned women to be careful in choosing male
partners so as to escape the attack of cervix cancer.
</P>
<P>
One alarming figure indicated that more than 60 percent of
female patients at Ocean Road Hospital in the capital of Dar es
Salaam have contracted cervix cancer.
</P>
<P>
President of the Tanzania Oncology Women Association (TOWA),
Dr Hulda Lugoe, told reporters yesterday in the city that most of
the affected by the disease were productive women, aged between
25 to 35 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Lugoe, who was briefing reporters Wednesday before the opening
of a two-day workshop of the association, said immoral sexual
behavior was the prime cause of the disease.
</P>
<P>
She said girls aged between 12 and 20 who has many sexual
partners are vulnerable to the disease which has claimed a number
of women's lives in most Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
The TOWA president cautioned girls to be discreet in choosing
male partners.
</P>
<P>
Teenage marriages also exposed girls to greater risk of being
affected by the cancer, she said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that early treatment was vital if the affected
woman is to be cured from the disease. Cervix cancer has four
stages, she said. Patients in the stage one and stage two are
curable while those in the rest stages have to face death.

<HEADLINE> Circumcision Spreads HIV in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Undisinfected knife used in
circumcisions have spread HIV virus in eastern Uganda, The New
Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
Richard Oketch, the medical officer of Kapchorwa District,
eastern Uganda, told local councillors and department heads at a
meeting in the district Tuesday that he received a report saying
some people circumcised in the district have died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Oketch told the officials that other people circumcised by the
same operator in the same year have shown the signs of the
existence of the virus. But he declined to reveal the name of the
infected.
</P>
<P>
"This is confidential, if I mention the place affected, people
might fear and they will not give us the information we want
during our research," he added.
</P>
<P>
A medical team will begin a two-month investigation to prove
the allegation, Oketch said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the spreading of the virus to using one knife in
operations for several people and not washing hands before the
operation.
</P>
<P>
Circumcision is a traditional ceremony for young people
reaching adult age in uganda. But in recent years, more and more
young people refused the operation, especially in urban areas.

<HEADLINE> New Outbreak of Cholera Warned in Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Dar es Salaam City
Commission (DCC) health officials have expressed alarm over the
resurfacing of cholera in the city, which has claimed 192 lives
over the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
The city has announced stern measures to control the epidemic,
including a total ban on open air food vendors.
</P>
<P>
The DCC's Commissioner for Health Dr Job Laiser told reporters
Wednesday that 53 new cases were admitted to various centers in
the city in the past two days bringing the number of city
residents who have contracted the disease to 5,398.
</P>
<P>
Laiser said the government has spent more than 216 million
Shillings (about 350,000 US Dollars) for the affected.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner cautioned residents to observe hygiene,
saying that the killer disease was basically caused by negligence
of health rules.
</P>
<P>
He ordered a complete ban on the sale of food by street
vendors as well as roadside chips, meat and fish rosters, fruit
and juice sellers.
</P>
<P>
Funeral ceremonies where food and drinks are prepared had also
been restricted, while unnecessary gatherings and festivals would
also be discouraged to control the spread of the easily
communicable disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, private hospitals in the city has been cautioned
against admitting cholera patients since there are special
centers isolated for treating any reported cases, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Laiser said due to increased number of new cases, the city
commission has re-opened some of its former emergency centers
which were closed.
</P>
<P>
He said more emergency centers will be opened depending on the
situation.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Good Health: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite all the rumors
about failing health of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Western
and Arab intelligence sources believe Arafat is in good health,
The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the unnamed sources as saying that Arafat only
suffers from exhaustion as a result of overwork and not from
degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reportedly often works up to 20 hours a day and this
has exacerbated the effects of his injuries in the 1992 plane
crash in Libya.
</P>
<P>
"We have looked very carefully at Arafat and we can't find
anything more than he is getting older and works himself to the
bone," a United States congressional staffer with access to
intelligence information was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian National Authority (PNA) source with frequent
access to Arafat agreed to this assessment. "When he is tired,
you find that his lips shake uncontrollably. But when he is
rested, he responds and looks like any other normal person," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Arafat has resisted pleas from his confidants
to rest more and insisted he must maintain control over all
details affecting the PNA. He confirmed that, as a result of
exhaustion, Arafat felt faint and was hospitalized over the past
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, 68, rejected Wednesday the rumors about the
deterioration of his health, saying he was "feeling well and in
good health in spite of all the mass media propaganda against my
health."
</P>
<P>
The rumors about Arafat's health first surfaced late
September when Egyptian officials disclosed that he fainted at
the conference of foreign ministers of Arab League. Some cited
television pictures of Arafat's quivering lower lips and fingers
during public appearances as evidence that he is suffering from
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
In another report, The Jerusalem Post revealed that Arafat's
health was one of the topics discussed by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Jordanian King Hussein when they met in
Britain's Ascot Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The report said King Hussein was particularly concerned about
"the post-Arafat era," implying that the line of succession
within the PNA was unclear and that Arafat's disability or
departure from the political scene would cause instability, if
not dissension and unrest.

<HEADLINE> Wage Increase Rate Down in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The rate of salary increments
has recorded a consistent downward trend since 1995 in Kenya, the
Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The remuneration increase for the coming 12 months may be even
lower, according to a survey by Price Waterhouse.
</P>
<P>
The survey, titled "The Kenya Salary Survey-1997", indicated
that the 1997 increments were lower than projected in the 1996's
survey after having sampled 123 companies in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
Salary rose 13 percent for management staff and 14 percent for
support staff this year, compared with 14 percent for the
managers and 16 percent for the support staff in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 hike was just slightly above the inflation rate of
approximately 12 percent over the same period, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
"On average, the whole remuneration increments are falling.
This is an indication that organizations are growing slower and,
are, therefore, not able to sustain increments above inflation,"
said the survey.
</P>
<P>
The organizations surveyed are classified into 10 groups,
among them the banking and finance sectors ranked as the highest
paying.
</P>
<P>
The hospitals are the lowest paying sectors according to the
survey.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Better Party Ties With S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Godfrey
Miyanda has said that the Zambian ruling Movement for Multi-party
Democracy (MMD) would like to strengthen relations with its South
African counterpart, Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
This good will was expressed here Wednesday by Miyanda while
receiving South African High Commissioner Walter Thabethe.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda said that closer relations between the MMD and the
African National Congress (ANC) can encourage better
understanding between the governments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
While the Zambian government appreciated that Zambia's former
ruling party the United National Independence Party (UNIP) has
closer ties with the ANC, Miyanda stressed, there is no harm in
the South African ruling party fostering a new friendship with
the MMD.
</P>
<P>
He said the MMD respects the traditional friendship that
exists between the UNIP and the ANC and will never insist on its
termination, but hoped that this will not deter relations between
the two governments.
</P>
<P>
The friendship between the ANC and the UNIP, which is led by
former President Kenneth Kaunda and now Zambia's biggest
opposition party, has began since Zambia won its independence and
gave considerable support for the ANC's struggle against the
racial segregation and the domination of the minority white
settlers in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Zambian vice-president also called for
solutions to level the trade imbalance in favor of South Africa
to improve trade relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Zambian has always been complaining that South Africa has
man-made barriers to bar Zambian goods from entering its market
while dumping its own heavily subsidized manufactured goods into
the landlocked country.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the South African diplomat said the South African
government is preparing to address the trade issue between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He assured Miyanda that his country will open up its market to
allow Zambia goods to be exported there.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Power Stations Work Well in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China's two nuclear power
stations at Qinshan and Daya Bay have exceeded international safety
standards in most indices, according to a conference sponsored by
the China Nuclear Society in Changsha, capital of Hunan province.
</P>
<P>
The Qinshan Nuclear Power Station is located in Zhejiang
province and the Daya Bay in Guangdong province, next to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Exposure to radiation by workers is 0.79 units at Qinshan and
0.52 units at Daya Bay. The world average level is 1.51.
</P>
<P>
Qinshan and Daya Bay have greatly eased the energy shortage in
China and provide 6 percent and 20 percent of the electricity in
their provinces, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Daya Bay is expected to be able to provide a steady power
supply for Hong Kong for east 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of its investment, 4 billion US dollars, came
from overseas. Its annual power output has been around 700 million
US dollars, and statistics show that Daya Bay has repaid 40
percent of its overseas loans.
</P>
<P>
Daya Bay also has helped China cut its annual coal consumption
by six million tons, and a French nuclear specialist said that
this may be the station's most important contribution to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
China also imported more than 400 relevant programs and
softwares from overseas and has set up some nuclear power research
institutions such as the Sichuan Nuclear Power Base.
</P>
<P>
Several other nuclear power stations are under construction
along China's east coast, which is energy-deficient, according to
Zheng Qingyun, a senior official with the China National Nuclear
Corp.

<HEADLINE> US, UK Reject Nigeria's Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
expressed concern over its loss of foreign exchange earnings
arising from the failure of its exports to meet the World Trade
Organization (WTO) standards.
</P>
<P>
A total of 79 consignments exported from Nigeria to the United
States were said to have been rejected last year on the ground of
contamination, decomposition and other U.S. Import Act
violations, the Daily Champion reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian exports were also rejected in Britain and other
European countries, and the loss of huge sum of money to the
development was worrisome, the newspaper said, quoting Suleman
Sani, permanent secretary in the Federal Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
"While it may be reasonable to suspect that the exports were
totally ignorant of the relevant regulations, it must be stressed
that such ignorance and lack of knowledge could no longer be
justified," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, some of the rejections may be due to
deliberate ploys by developed countries to suppress competing
export products from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
According to former head of state Muhamadu Buhari, this has
become crucial especially at the present time when the nation is
desperately trying to diversify its sources of foreign exchange
earnings to reduce over-dependence on oil.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM: Sectarianism Blocks Anti-Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri has said that political and sectarian influence on the
country's civil service is blocking the campaign against
corruption and inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
Most top civil service positions are occupied by people with
strong attachment to sectarian politics, who are rarely selected
on the basis of their qualifications, local newspaper Daily Star
today quoted Hariri as saying Wednesday at a meeting entitled
"Corruption and Means of Combating It."
</P>
<P>
He said that public administration has been reunited after
Lebanese civil war ended in 1990, but many of those involved in
sectarian and partisan practices during the war are still
occupying administrative positions.
</P>
<P>
Hariri called on all parties and organizations to give the
existing supervisory bodies political and technical support to
allow them to perform their duties.
</P>
<P>
Administrative modernization or hiring new human resources will
be the solution to the problems, according to Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan of administration modernization, Lebanon will

<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
affirmed that it is ready to extend assistance and promptly
evacuate, if necessary, Filipinos in the Middle East who may be
affected by the U.S.-Iraq conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency today quoted Overseas Workers
Welfare Administration (OWWA) chief Wilhelm Soriano as saying that
the OWWA stands ready to implement together with the Department of
Foreign Affairs and the Department of Labor and Employment a
contingency plan to pull the Filipinos out of the areas around
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the United States are currently engaged in a standoff
over Iraq's expulsion of American experts who are members of the
United Nations arms inspection team in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Soriano, however, said that the situation in the Middle East
has so far remained stable and that "there are no signs of
disturbing developments in the Gulf countries."
</P>
<P>
The Filipinos in the region, he added, "are in fact unperturbed
with the current news on the Iraq-U.S. standoff."
</P>
<P>
The Department of Foreign Affairs said its various diplomatic
posts are closely monitoring developments in the Gulf region and
would act promptly in assisting and evacuating Filipino overseas
workers there should open hostilities become imminent.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government announced today that it would
unconditionally accept the return of U.N. arms inspectors
including the Americans.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Hydro-Electric Power Resources (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- This is the time for China to
exploit its hydro-electric power resources, and a major step was
taken on October 28 when the Yellow River was dammed for the
construction of the Xiaolangdi water control project in Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
six 300,000-kw generators will be installed at Xiaolangdi and
they will generate 5.1 billion kwh of electricity a year
when the project is completed.
</P>
<P>
Then, on November 8, damming of China's longest Yangtze River
for the construction of the multi-purpose dam at the Three Gorges
was completed. The dam will be the biggest of its kind in the
world, and its 26 generators will be able to generate 84.6 billion
kwh of electricity a year, 13 billion kwh more than the
Itaipu power station in South America, presently the world's
largest.
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech, Premier Li Peng called for increasing
hydro-electric power's share of the country's power from
25 percent now to 30 percent by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Chinese Government places greater
importance on developing hydro-electric power resources has
brought opportunities for China's minor rivers like the Lancang in
the southwest.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China's most renowned writers
and economists gathered here today to discuss their
responsibilities in the country's future.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time members from literary and economic
circles of China jointly held a forum on issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
They said economists and writers have different perspectives
when observing the society, but they share responsibility for building
a prosperous China.
</P>
<P>
The writers said economists should pay more attention to ethics
when submitting reform suggestions to the government, while
economists urged writers to go out of their studies and
learn more from the reality.
</P>
<P>
"The dialogue will help build a rational society with good
ethics and economic miracles," said economist Fan Gang.
</P>
<P>
Chinese literature's golden period occurred in the early 1980s
with many masterpieces pushing forward reform and progress, critics
say. But since the late 1980s, serious literature has suffered
because of commercial considerations.
</P>
<P>
Many readers have been lured away from reading good literature
by imported movies and VCDs, and some writers have turned to
popular fiction to make money.

<P>
The apex court passed an interim order this morning, stating
that in case the president assents to the bill, it will stand

The amended law, which provided for an intra-court appeal
before a "larger bench consisting of all the remaining available
judges of the court within the country," has been submitted to
President Farooq Leghari for signing.

<HEADLINE> S. African Emigration Drops in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Fewer people emigrated
from South Africa in July 1997 while more people came in, the
Central Statistics Service (CSS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the month, the number of self-declared emigrants was 636, a
24 percent decline compared with July 1996, CSS said.
</P>
<P>
The number of professionals, semi-professionals and
technicians who reported that they were emigrating was 144 while
the corresponding number who immigrated into South Africa was 60.
</P>
<P>
The gap between emigration and immigration, though still
there, is narrowing.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, the number of immigrants was 412, an
increase of 10 percent compared with July 1996.
</P>
<P>
The leading source countries of immigration in July were
Britain (14 percent), India (8 percent) and Germany (5 percent),
while the leading destinations of emigration were Britain (27
percent), New Zealand (16 percent), the United States (12
percent), Australia (11 percent), Namibia (7 percent) and Canada
(5 percent).
</P>
<P>
The historical trends in the number of immigrants and
self-declared emigrants showed that the number of immigrants has
never again exceeded the number of emigrants ever since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The gap narrowed in the second half of 1994 and again in the
last quarter of 1996. It seemed to be further narrowing this
year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa suffered when at one hand, numerous professionals
flocked from the country and at the other hand, poorly-educated
illegal immigrants, estimated at millions in number, flooded in.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China has published the
world's first Xia-Chinese dictionary, blazing a new trail into the
mystery of the ancient Western Xia Kingdom, according to the
overseas edition of today's "People's Daily."
</P>
<P>
Scholars said the language of the Western Xia is one of the
most difficult in the world. Many mysteries remain about the
regime and its people because only a few people could understand
the language.
</P>
<P>
The language, created by the Dangxiang nationality nearly 1,000
years ago, disappeared along with the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Experts did not rediscover the language until the beginning of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Li Fanwen, a 65-year-old professor who edited the dictionary,
has researched the language in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region since
1960.
</P>
<P>
The dictionary, containing more than 6,000 ancient Western Xia
words, provides readers with explanations in both Chinese and
English.

forest protection, said officials with the Provincial
Forestry Department.
</P>
<P>
The province in southwestern China has planted more than 2.67
hectares of trees, raising the forest coverage rate to 20.35
percent from 9 percent in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion remains a serious problem because of
deforestation, improper land development, mining practices and
road construction, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The province's land area affected by soil erosion has been
estimated at 200,000 square kilometers, accounting for 41 percent
of the province's coverage.
</P>
<P>
To protect forests, the government has revised the rural energy
structure to reduce the burning of wood. To date, 36 of the
province's 117 counties have realized electrification.
</P>
<P>
Plans of the Provincial Forestry Department estimate that
within the next three years the forest coverage rate is expected
to be raised to 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Elderly in Chinese City Receive Special Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Lin Mingbo, 79, said he
admires the 90-year-old people who swim during the winter and do
morning exercises.
</P>
<P>
Shantou, a city in southern China's Guangdong Province, now has
42 elders 100 or older. People over 60 number 380,000, or 9.45
percent of the city's population.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of old people adds color to the
city's spare-time activities, local residents say.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, hundreds of the elderly come to the
city's coastal road for morning exercise, which has become a
famous scene in the city.
</P>
<P>
The elderly use musical instruments donated by various social
groups, and drink free tea and other drinks.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the local government allocates regular subsidies for
the elderly, and they can visit parks and other public facilities
free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Lin said, in Shantou those who do not respect the elders will
be criticized by others. "We now live a comfortable life, and We
are just concerned about our health," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most residents find that sending parents to "Homes for the
Elderly" is inconceivable. They take care of their own parents,
though they are busy with work.
</P>
<P>
To better serve the elderly, Shantou established a working
committee for senior citizens and an elders' fund 10 years ago. At
present, organizations for the elderly have been set up and
the elderly colleges are popular.
</P>
<P>
Local government often organizes various activities to enrich
old people's lives and to boost their morale.

<P>
SHENYANG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, capital city of
northeast China's Liaoning province, the country's traditional
industrial base, has approved 209,000 private enterprises by the
end of August, an increase of 1.2-fold over the figure of 1992.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, the public sector has occupied the absolute
predominance in the city's economy. And the heavy industrial base
of Shenyang owns an integrated industrial system and a group of
state-owned enterprises, said Mu Suixin, mayor of the city.
</P>
<P>
However, the approved private enterprises have involved a total
registered capital of 11.8 billion yuan (1.47 billion US
dollars), 14.7 times more than that of 1992, which show that the
sector has received great progress in the past five years, said Mu.
</P>
<P>
And the city had witnessed a total business volume of 40.8
billion yuan (5.1 billion US dollars) from the service industry by
the end of August.
</P>
<P>
The private enterprises are equal to share the preferential
policies like state-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign joint
ventures, co-operative enterprises and wholely foreign-funded
companies, according to Mu.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Natural Gas Plant Nears Completion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China's largest natural gas
purification plant has been completed and will soon be put into
service in northwestern China's Changqing Gas Field.
</P>
<P>
The Changqing Gas Field has been operating since the first
high-yield gas well was sunk on June 22, 1989. The field is
situated in the Erdos Basin which sits on the juncture of Shaanxi,
Gansu and Shanxi provinces, and Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 gas purification plant, with an annual capacity of
1.8 billion cubic meters of gas, is north of the county seat of
Jingbian in northern Shaanxi Province. The plant is considered a
key gas field exploration.
</P>
<P>
The plant began construction in April, 1996. The first phase
was completed in 14 months with the installation of three sets of
gas purification equipment and completion of necessary support
facilities at a cost of more than 300 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
For the second stage construction, the plant will add two more
sets of gas purification equipment. When the plant is finished, it
will be able to treat three billion cubic meters of gas a year,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
Technology used in the gas purification process was imported
from the Honewell Company of Australia. Indexes of various harmful
particles in the treated gas reportedly are lower than China's
state-set standards.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN November 20 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province has
launched a major effort to tap its agricultural resources and
rapidly develop its rural economy.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang, an important grain production center in the
country, has concentrated its energy to control flooding in the
eastern portion of the province and drought in the western portion.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the province has more than 6.67 million
hectares of farmland, 80 percent of which is medium- and low-yield
fields. Ninety percent of the farmland is distributed in the
plains, giving the province ample potential for further
development of its agricultural resources.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the province transformed 1.46 million hectares of
medium- and low-yield farmland and opened up 280,000 hectares of
wasteland, which increased grain production by six billion
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The province also has increased its reliance on farm machinery,
improved the variety of grains and modernized cultivation
techniques.

<HEADLINE> Polder Reclamation to Draw More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu, a densely populated
province in eastern China, is trying to attract overseas
investment for shore-land development.
</P>
<P>
The province's 953.9-kilometer-long coastline with 650,000
hectares of reclaimable land along the sea makes it a valuable
resource. The province plans to reclaim 66,700 ha. by 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Kaitao, the official in charge of the project,
reclaiming land from the sea is expensive. The transformation of
the projected area requires an investment of two billion yuan (240
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Li said that the construction of one kilometer of sea wall
would cost two million yuan and another 30,000 yuan for each
hectare of shore-land would be required for necessary improvements.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996 when Jiangsu applied for loans from the World Bank,
the province has been seeking joint cooperation with large
overseas investors, such as Shell Oil Co. to develop planting,
breeding and storage on the reclaimed land. So far, the province
has commitments for 10 million U.S. dollars in investment.
</P>
<P>
In another development, many overseas investors have expressed
interest in a multi-functional venture which would integrate the
developments of high-efficiency farming, industry, transportation,
port trade and seashore tourism into one.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Tapping Water, Thermal Power Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A high-voltage power
transmission grid has taken shape in northwestern China thanks to
efforts by Gansu Province in tapping hydro-power and thermal power
resources.
</P>
<P>
The province has built more than 450 hydro-power plants with an
installed generating capacity of 2.3 million kilowatts (kw), which
function as the hub of the northwestern grid, according to the
Gansu Electric Power Administration.
</P>
<P>
Called by some the "small Three Gorges Project," the Daxia
Hydro-power Plant will be joined by the Xiaoxia and Wujin Gorge
plants now under construction for an installed generating capacity
of 700,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
Gansu also has joined with Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to
build the Jishixia Project and with Qinghai Province in
constructing the Heishanxia Project.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has a hydroelectric potential of 11.1 million kw, most
on the Yellow River. From Jishixia to Heishanxia on the river, the
water drop of 820 meters makes it possible to construct ten large-
or medium-size hydro-power plants with an installed generating
capacity of 4.18 million kw.
</P>
<P>
Gansu's Jingyuan Thermal Power Plant is in its second phase
and will join five other thermal power plants with an installed
generating capacity of 2.6 million kw.
</P>
<P>
Among them, with a joint investment of 2.8 billion yuan (about
340 million U.S. dollars), the second phase of Jingyuan Plant has
been funded by Gansu Electric Power Administration and a United
States firm.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, Gansu expects to finish the
Pingliang Thermal Power Plant with an installed generating
capacity of 1.2 million kw. Zhangye Thermal Power Plant, which has
an installed generating capacity of 250,000 kw, is in its first
phase. The province also is revamping the Xigu Thermal Power Plant
and expanding the Lianchen Thermal Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial administration, Gansu is striving
to increase its installed generating capacity by 2.18 million kw
by the end of the century through attracting investment from both
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Also, Gansu will try to meet its ever-increasing demand for
power in the first five years of the next century to achieve the
goal of maintaining stable development in its power industry.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Doctors Treat Mammary Cancer with New Method </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in Shanghai say that
electro-chemotherapy is very effective in treating patients in the
late stages of mammary cancer.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 doctors at Shanghai Dongfang Mastopathy Hospital (SDMH)
began to adopt electro-chemotherapy, which was developed by the
Atomic Energy Research Institute of China.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Yuan Yongxi, together with three other doctors in SDMH,
applied electro-chemotherapy to 30 cancer patients from 26 to 75
years old whose tumors were fist-size or bigger. All had been
diagnosed as unsuitable for surgery.
</P>
<P>
Among the 30 patients treated, 15 are symptom-free and living a
normal life and 10 say they are feeling much better. To doctors'
surprise, all patients' tumors showed a tendency to shrink, some
by half, others by two-thirds and some disappeared. The curative
effects of electro-chemotherapy reached 83 percent.
</P>
<P>
The way that electric-chemotherapy works is to disturb the
surrounding environment of the cancer cells so as to alter them
with direct and pulsating currents, according to the doctors.
</P>
<P>
Three-year clinical experiments have proved
electro-chemotherapy is a safe therapy without side-effects,
doctors said, and is particularly suitable for those suffering
mammary cancer.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has approved
a interest-free credit of 11.35 million U.S. dollars for a project
to revitalize Bangladesh's silk production, a WB press release
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The silk development project will support the government's
decision to deregulate silk production and establish an autonomous
non-profit body called the Bangladesh Silk Foundation, which will
take over some of the commercial responsibilities of the
Bangladesh Silk Board.
</P>
<P>
The project is the first phase of a long-term program to
transform Bangladesh's seri-culture into a technically up-to-date
sector with a reputation for quality in world markets.
</P>
<P>
The newly-created Silk Foundation, with representatives of
small-scale silk producers, NGOs, private financial institutions,
garment manufacturers, and the government on its board, will be in
charge of project implementation, the release stated.
</P>
<P>
The foundation's primary objective is to assist in introducing
improved technology, bringing silk research and extension
activities under majority control of the stake-holders, and it
will also work to improve the investment climate and serve as a
"think-tank" to advise the government on policy options, it added.
</P>
<P>
The project's estimated total cost is about 13 million dollars
of which the government will contribute 1.21 million.
</P>
<P>
When the project is implemented, silkworm rearers' daily
earnings are expected to triple over the project period and
increased employment opportunities are expected in all areas of
silk production.

NEW DELHI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral is expected to hold talks again with Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif when they attend a three-nation economic
summit in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka on November 23, a
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers have already met twice this year in a
bid to improve the two countries' relations and enhance economic
cooperation. They reached some consensus in their meetings on May
12 in Male, the Maldives, and on September 24 in New York.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers and the Bangladeshi prime minister are
scheduled to address the opening session of the economic summit in
Dhaka, which will also be attended by trade and industry
representatives from their countries.
</P>
<P>
The initiative for the three-nation economic summit was
proposed by Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to strengthen
economic cooperation among the three nations.
</P>
<P>
The Indian and Pakistani prime ministers' bilateral talks
during the summit were aimed at speeding the normalization process
between the two countries, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In late March this year, the two countries resumed their
foreign secretary-level talks which were stalled for nearly three
years. The foreign ministers of the two countries also met in
early April this year for the same purpose.

<HEADLINE> India Can Sustain 6-7 Percent Fiscal Deficit: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- India can easily sustain a
fiscal deficit of 6-7 percent if its economy grows at 7 percent of
the GDP annually, a local newspaper "Business Standard" quoted a
senior official as saying today.
</P>
<P>
"There is no sacrosanct number in case of fiscal deficit. All
this talk that 4 percent is the ideal fiscal deficit is bunkum, a
myth," said Arjun Sengupta, member of the Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to him, India's economic fundamentals were "never so
good as today" and it can comfortably grow at 8 percent of the GDP
"if you don't make a mistake."
</P>
<P>
Yet he warned that a crisis could be brewing if nothing was
done to boost exports. "It is unbelievable that our exports have
been allowed to come down to the current rate of 2 percent. It is
perfectly possible that our economy will face a tremendous crisis
in the next weeks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sengupta attributed the poor health of industry to the
overcapacities created in many sectors over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Manipulators Create Havoc in Developing Countries: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today currency traders manipulating
regional currencies are opportunists who took advantage of a flaw
in the economic system and created havoc in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"For that reason, Malaysia has called for transparency in
currency trading ... the present system was without rules and
regulations," Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, said at a
function here.
</P>
<P>
He said that industrialized countries are not keen for
transparency in currency trading because the manipulators and
speculators who caused havoc in regional markets are from the rich
and powerful industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and even
Singapore have been seriously affected by the current allegedly
manipulated financial crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia was not as badly affected as Thailand because
its ruling coalition National Front was strong and Malaysia was
also fortunate for not having to resort to high borrowings and
funding to bail out its economy like Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has committed 1 billion U.S. dollars each to Thailand
and Indonesia to help their economies as well as to ensure there
would not be any contagion effect.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Malaysia would be able to overcome the regional
financial and economic crisis if it was able to manage the economy
well.
</P>
<P>
"We need to remain competitive and strengthen economic
fundamentals," he said, adding this would mean having a high rate
of savings, no wasteful expenditure, generating higher exports,
belt-tightening measures and enhancing productivity.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- About one million Venezuelan
employees of the central and decentralized administrations staged
a one-day strike today.
</P>
<P>
It was in support of municipal workers to whom the government
refused to pay compensatory payments stipulated in a contract
signed by the government.
</P>
<P>
The strike was organized by the Federation of Public Workers
(Fedeunep) because the government gave no response to their
demands. It completely paralyzed public administration offices
and institutions, including ministries, hospitals and public
companies.
</P>
<P>
The Fedeunep Secretary, Carlos Borge, said employees in the
public sector are also protesting against alleged violation of the
worker rights in several institutions of the central,
decentralized and regional administrations.
</P>
<P>
The federation demands workers' participation in ongoing reform
of several institutions of public administration. This had been
established in an April-1996 act that was ratified in a contract
signed between Fedeunep and the Labor Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The worker's leader indicated Tuesday that although the workers
would be on strike only today, it could be extended if the
government did not respond to workers' demands.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Sweden lashed out at Israel
today for the Jewish state's continued establishment of Jewish
settlements in occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank despite mounting
international pressure.
</P>
<P>
In an address delivered at Uppsala University in Stockholm,
Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen said that the establishment of
jewish settlements in those regions was in violation of
international law.
</P>
<P>
"An occupation state has no right to move its residents into
the occupied territories. The Israeli government must cease its
provocative settlement policies," she said.
</P>
<P>
No state is entitled to disregard relevant provisions of
international law, the foreign minister reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
The act of forced occupation of land is unacceptable, she said,
demanding that the Jewish state withdraw from its occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
Hjelm-Wallen said that Sweden will join the European Union in
promoting the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Appealing for building a justified and lasting peace in the
Middle East, she said that the achievement of this target is
necessitated by the establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Hjelm-Wallen said the possibility of a final solution to the
Middle East issues was closely related to the establishment of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
She elaborated on the history and the status quo in Middle East
crisis, and appealed for a break in the deadlock to find some
compromise.

<HEADLINE> Issues Rule China's Economy's Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- China's economic life in the
future will be swayed by six issues, according to the Beijing-based
China Economic Times.
</P>
<P>
First, the increase in redundant workers has replaced inflation
as the biggest problem from a macro-economic standpoint.
</P>
<P>
However, it can be a good news if viewed from another angle: The
country's economic restructuring and workforce streamlining have
enhanced their aggressiveness; inflation has been brought down to
acceptable level, today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Second, the continuing increase of foreign reserves might not
necessarily be good news for China's economy. In a sense, it not
only makes it difficult to offset the operation of the Bank of
China, but also propels the renminbi to continue to appreciate and
cause possible trade friction.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper suggests that the State grant loans in
U.S. dollars to large enterprise groups and foreign trade
enterprises; expand the import of advanced equipment and the
lastest technology; and increase direct investment in foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
Third, the old housing system that requires State units to buy
houses for their employees as welfares encumbers the housing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, to keep China's economic growth at 9-10 percent
annually, it is necessary to increase the margin of investment at
around 15 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, the State should encourage financial capital to merge
with industrial capital. The newspaper suggested the participation
may be more effective if banks convert the creditors' rights they
hold in those promising enterprises into rights to hold shares in
them.
</P>
<P>
Sixth, in the movement to form large enterprise groups, the
market, rather than administrative orders, should be encouraged as
motivating force. However, in some places, local government simply
force better-performing enterprises to annex ailing ones, a move
contrary to the State policy to encourage the big and healthy
enterprises.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's racial advisory board discussed the diversity of college
campuses today.
</P>
<P>
In its third meeting held at the University of Maryland, the
seven-member board heard testimony from school presidents,
academics and others, on how to make diversity work at colleges
and universities.
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman John Hope Franklin said the board did not want
to lose track of the good work under way in diversity programs by
inviting debate over affirmative action -- a formal effort to
provide increased employment and education opportunities for women
and ethnic minorities to overcome past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
University of Maryland President William Kirwan described the
loss of his school's minority scholarship program as "one of the
earliest casualties in a nationwide assault on affirmative action
programs."
</P>
<P>
Franklin did not rule out discussing affirmative action in
later sessions. He announced four more meetings at various
locations.
</P>
<P>
The board also tentatively scheduled a town hall forum in
mid-January in Atlanta. Clinton has scheduled the first meeting
on December 3 in Akron, Ohio.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A great potential exists
for economic cooperation between Mexico and China and the two
countries should expand mutual investment, a senior Mexican
official said today.
</P>
<P>
"We think there is a great potential for our economic relations
with China. We have just learned of the first investments of
Chinese companies in Mexico," Jaime Zabludovsky, under secretary
of Mexico's Commerce and Industrial Development told Xinhua in an
exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
The official said Mexican and Chinese companies are to sign
agreements on investment for the construction of a textile plant
in northwestern Mexico and for agricultural and cattle breeding
projects in southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
However, the under secretary also pointed out that trade
cooperation between Mexico and China is still too small.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the joint projects, Zabludovsky said Chinese
investment in Mexico can also help China enter the markets of the
United States and Canada, partner countries of Mexico in the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
With NAFTA, Mexico has direct access to the markets of the
United States and Canada. Mexico also has free trade agreements
with Costa Rica, Venezuela, Colombia, Bolivia and Chile.
</P>
<P>
"We are currently negotiating with the rest of the hemispheric
markets and we will start negotiating with Europe next year,"
Zabludovsky asserted.
</P>
<P>
As for Mexican businessmen, they were beginning to explore the
Chinese market, the under secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Zabludovsky suggested that both countries make efforts to
increase business contacts between the investors.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo paid an official
visit to China in a bid to promote bilateral cooperation and
figure out a mechanism to enhance commerce and investment between
the two nations.
</P>
<P>
On November 30 to December 3, Chinese President Jiang Zemin is
scheduled to visit Mexico. Zabludovsky said the Mexican
government is looking forward to the visit.

<HEADLINE> Fletcher Challenge to Enter NZ Petrol Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand company
Fletcher Challenge is to open a petrol chain throughout New
Zealand (NZ)'s North Island and plans to sell petrol by next
April.
</P>
<P>
TVNZ today quoted the company as saying that it will compete on
price and services. Initially, Fletcher Challenge will invest 75
million NZ dollars (47 million U.S. dollars) in the project, which
 will eventually cover all parts of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a similar one announced by the Australian oil
company Liberty last month, which said it could sell petrol at a
price 10 NZ cents (6.2 U.S. cents) cheaper a liter than those
pegged by the four New Zealand oil companies of BP, Mobil, Shell
and Caltex.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, Energy Minister Max Bradford expressed his
delight at the entry of new players.
</P>
<P>
"By April next year both Fletcher Challenge and Liberty will be
competing in the petrol retail market, and that will lead to more
choices and cheaper prices for consumers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since becoming energy minister late last year, Bradford has
repeatedly expressed concerns at the expensive petrol prices in
New Zealand, which are among the highest in Western nations. He
blamed the four oil companies for monopolizing the prices.
</P>
<P>
Bradford said the prospects for full competition throughout the
energy industry in New Zealand were looking good, adding that the
government was actively working to achieve the same sort of
competition in electricity.

<HEADLINE> Relatives to Pay Homage to Argentine Soldiers Fallen in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 19 (Xinhua) -- A group of relatives of
Argentine soldiers killed in the Malvinas (Falklands) War left for
the islands today to pay homage to the dead.
</P>
<P>
The group of 15 relatives and a priest will visit the cemetery
of Sarwin in the Southern Atlantic Islands, where were buried 237
Argentine soliders killed in the 1982 war between Argentina and
Britain over the sovereignty of the islands.
</P>
<P>
The visit is the first of its kind sponsored by the country's
Foreign Ministry, which is organizing other two similar trips
scheduled for January and February 1998, according to Cesar
Gonzalez Trejo, president of Argentina's Federation of War
Veterans.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that Argentine Foreign Minister Guido
Di Tella was denied access to the islands by the British governor
of the islands, Richar Ralph, who said "Argentine officials are
not welcome here."
</P>
<P>
Though Argentina lost the war with Britain, it still claims
sovereignty over those islands.
</P>
<P>
Before the departure, the mother of one dead soldier said their
bodies must remain there as "symbols" of Argentina's sovereignty
over those islands.

<HEADLINE> Poland Reducing Foreign Debts by Billions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Poland's foreign debts have
been reduced by 13.9 billion U.S. dollars during the last four
years, the official statistics said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistical materials, Poland's debts have been
reduced from 47.9 billion dollars in 1993 to 34 billion dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say the main reasons for Poland's debt reduction
consist of the following three reasons:
</P>
<P>
Foreign creditors' debt has been cut by five billion dollars
since 1993; the rapid development of Poland's economy has provided
the government with more foreign reserves to pay their debts, and
current foreign reserves have reached 20 billion U.S. dollars; the
stronger U.S. dollar and weaker German mark have also helped
Poland reduce its foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts point out, Poland still has to pay several
billion dollars in annual interests for its current debts.

<HEADLINE> Czech Foreign Debt Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic's foreign
debt has surged to 21.2 billion U.S. dollars, with the per capita
debt jumping from 822 dollars in 1993 to 2,000 dollars now, the
Czech National Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of foreign debt accounted for 43 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) of the country, three percent over the
internationally accepted "alarm" line, a spokesman of the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the increasing debt to economic slowdown,
shortage of capital and a large deficit in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the country's foreign debt was at a
relatively low level because of the Czech government's effective
measures. It stood at 8.5 billion dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign debt soared to 20.4 billion dollars in
1996, over the previous year's 16.5 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> New Thai Labor Minister Vows to Axe Alien Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's new Labor and
Social Welfare Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri has vowed to sack
alien laborers working in Thailand as a measure to ease the
employment situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister has instructed the Employment Department under his
ministry to work out a master plan for the purpose within 100 days
and enable more unemployed Thais to fill the positions, according
to local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Given the current economic situation in Thailand, the layoffs
must be immediately implemented to help those Thais in trouble,
Trairong said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of immigrant workers in Thailand has reached 1
million, exceeding the 600,000 estimated earlier, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the massive layoff plan against
alien workers would help re-employ more than 92,500 Thais who lost
jobs due to the country's ongoing economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government last year introduced a policy to allow
immigrant workers in the country to work legally for a period of
two years to help ease the country's temporary shortage of labor.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most alien workers in Thailand come from Thailand's
neighboring countries, like Myanmar. The new move against foreign
laborers is part of the new Thai government's efforts to re-adjust
its employment policy.
</P>
<P>
The government of Chuan Leekpai, which was sworn in on November
15, currently is also considering radical measures to streamline
its civil service workforce, including freezing staff growth and
transferring central government officials to local agencies.

<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The China National Garments
Corp. and the Chinese National Garment Research and Design Center
have combined into a single company as part of the country's
effort to restructure its state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Kwan's Injury in Toe To Miss Next Week's Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Michelle Kwan, winner of
1996 world figure sakting, injuried her left foot and will miss
next week's Olympic tuneup event in Nagano, a report said
Wednesday from Lake Arrowhead, United States.
</P>
<P>
But She expects to be back in time to compete at the US
championships, the Olympic qualifier, at Philadelphia on January
4-11.
</P>
<P>
Kwan, 17, will wear a cast on her left foot up to two weeks
because of the fracture in the second toe.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said she risked breaking the bone and being out for
three months if she had kept skating without treatment. The injury
happened in August during a traning session in Lake Arrowhead at
her home facility.
</P>
<P>
The injury was aggravated two weeks ago when Kwan won at Skate
Canada. She fell when pain began as she was attempting a
butterfly spin in the free program, Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
Kwan struggled with the injury last month at Skate America in
Detroit, beating reigning US and world champion Tara Lipinski,
Kwan's 15-year-old main rival for the US and Olympic titles.
</P>
<P>
Kwan's US win ended a streak of three major losses to Lipinski.
</P>
<P>
With Kwan sore and Lipinski struggling to score well with her
lutz, China's Lu Chen and European rivals have improved hopes for
Nagano gold.

MADRID, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian international star
striker Romario was heading back to Brazil's club, he said on
Wednesday in an interview with the Antena 3 TV Station.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian, FIFA Footballer of the Year in 1994, moved to
Spanish first division club Valencia at the start of 1996-97
season.
</P>

"If I go back and score goals I'm sure I'll go to the World

"It's easier for me, even for Valencia, to arrive at an
agreement with a Brazilian club, Flamengo if possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
Romario seldom played for Valencia, which is struggling with
11 points (3-2-7) as the fourth from the bottom in the League.
He went to Flamengo on loan, and was sidelined for her
night-clubbing lifestyle which annoyed the Italian coach Claudio
Ranieri.

BUCHAREST, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The harvest of corn in
Romania is expected to reach 12 million tons this year, setting a
record for the past seven years, the Romanian news agency ROMPRES
today quoted the agricultural ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the country has gathered 11.9 million tons of
corn. The harvest of corn last year was 9.6 million tons, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of wheat harvested this year so far has reached 7.13
million tons, 3.97 million tons more than last year. The amount of
sugarbeets harvested has reached 2.65 million tons, 20,000 tons
less than last year.

this year: the temperatures were lower in spring, and it rained
more often in the summer.

TIRANA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Albania's People's Assembly,
the parliament, today passed a bill in a bid to allow governmental
interference in the privately-owned enterprises in special cases.
</P>
<P>
The supplementary provision to the constitution, which was
passed with 190 votes for, four against and two abstention after
heated debate, said that the state has the right to interfere when
a private enterprise's behavior endangers or infringes upon
citizens' interests.
</P>
<P>
The motion was submitted to the parliament by the Albanian
government.
</P>
<P>
Before that, the government was annoyed by the "VEFA" company's
rejection to its decision to send supervisors to the company,
whose illicit fund-raising had led to financial turmoils all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
The company, however, defeated the government in its appeal to
the constitutional court. The court held that the government's
decision violated the constitution while the latter believed that
the court's verdict denied its due rights in social
administration.

cooperation between China and the United States on economic,
trade, science and technology issues has a promising future.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with John Gibbons, assistant to U.S. president
Bill Clinton for science and technology policy, Jiang said the
level of such cooperation is still low in comparison to both
countries' needs for economic growth, and that the potential of
such cooperation is yet to be tapped.

BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The nation's 135 million
employees of township enterprises are expected to be working in
safer conditions thanks to the government's continuous action
against dangerous production, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to Vice-Minister of Agriculture Liu Chengguo, his
ministry and the Ministry of Labour will emphasize safety control
of accident-prone township enterprises as part of the efforts to
ensure the sector's safe production in a three-year campaign.
</P>
<P>
The ministries have targeted township firms in the fields of
mining, fireworks, construction materials and chemical industries,
Liu said at a safe production working conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Local governors will be held responsible for any accident
occurring in rural firms, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Although much progress has been made in the area of on-the-job
safety in the past years, accident-prone production is still a
problem.
</P>
<P>
A recent statistics shows that 917 people died in accidents at
rural firms in the first six months of this year, down 19 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In three years, the special administration of these rural firms
will further cut down accident cases, the vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, more than 23 million township enterprises
in a variety of fields now form the pillar of the rural economy.

VIENNA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- 1996 ski flying world champion
Andreas Goldberger of Austria was on Wednesday free from a
one-year ban and given permission to compete for another country.
</P>
<P>
Goldberger's manager Edi Federer, however, did not disclose
which countries were willing to give Goldberger the licence
required for World Cup events, a news report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said an Austrian court issued the order which will
save Goldberger, twice winner of ski jumping's overall World Cup,
permitting him participating in the November 29-30 World Cup
opener in Lillehammer, Norway.
</P>
<P>
The ban was demanded by the Austrian Ski Federation (OeSV), due
to Goldberger's resignation from the OeSV after it suspended him
from six monthes for having used cocaine and denied him the
liberty of training with his own coach.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with International Ski Federation (FIS) rules, a
national federation is entitled to request a ban when an athlete
chooses to join another federation.
</P>

OeSV president Peter Schroecksnadel said: "We have to accept
the court's decision but we will contest it."

LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa's Yugoslavian
international striker Savo Milosevic has turned down the offer of
struggling Italy's serie A club Napoli, a report said.
</P>
<P>
"I would rather stay here than join a club in Italy who are
struggling," Milosevic was quoted as saying on Wednesday in
Birminghan, England.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I turned down Perugia last season and this is the
same situation.

<P>
"If I ever go to Italy I would want to join a bigger club," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Italian club had set up a meeting with Villa
chairman Doug Ellis negotiating on the transfer.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting was called off for an apparent gap of their
bits and the terms of payment on the striker.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic, former Partizan Belgrade star, moved to Villa in the
1995-96 season with 21 goals in 67 league matches in the last two

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes Precautionary IMF Aid in Case of Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines is considering a "precautionary arrangement with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the country exits from the
IMF's 35 years of supervision.
</P>
<P>
Local press today quoted Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson
as saying that the arrangement was discussed in a very preliminary
manner during the meeting of IMF chief Michel Camdessus with
President Fidel Ramos and other economic officials earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
Access to the new arrangement "depends on the country's needs,
just like what we have now," Singson said, referring to the IMF's
existing Extended Fund Facility for the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The bank governor said such an arrangement is necessary because
of the ongoing currency turmoil in the region.
</P>
<P>
"(But as to) the terms of the program: how long, how much will
be the amount involved -- these things have not yet been
discussed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singson stressed that the arrangement is neither a standby
facility nor an extension of the Extended Fund Facility and is
dependent on the Philippines' graduation from the IMF tutelage by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the new arrangement with the IMF, the country
will "have a program of our own to ensure fiscal and monetary
discipline," he added.

<HEADLINE> Administration Handles Motions from Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal
government has seriously handled proposals from the deputies of
the Beijing People's Congress to promote the government work.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Zhu Zupu, deputy secretary-general of the
municipal government, in his report to the 41st session of the
Standing Committee of the 10th Beijing People's Congress
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Shen Mengpei and the other 178 deputies put forward a motion to
develop public transportation and alleviate traffic congestion in
the capital city. Their motion suggested that priority should be
given to public transportation and special lanes be designated for
public buses.
</P>
<P>
The motion prompted the municipal government to give public
transportation a pivotal position. In June, Beijing's first
special lane for public buses was designated on Chang'an Avenue,
one of the busiest streets in the capital.
</P>
<P>
This is just one of the 1,130 motions the deputies have
proposed to the municipal government this year. And the government
has solved 30 percent of the problems the motions covered, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
The motions involve various aspects of the capital's
development such as the reform of State enterprises, urban
planning, construction and management as well as science and
education.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Coalition Partner Threatened by Funding Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The junior partner of German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition, the Free Democratic
Party (FDP), could be forced to return 12.4 million marks (7.2
million U.S. dollars) it received in state funds in 1996 because
it had failed to follow the application procedures.
</P>
<P>
The FDP received the bad news after a German court ruled
Wednesday evening that the party had received the money wrongly
because it had failed to submit an application for the funds by
the September 30 deadline in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to German press reports, FDP treasurer Hermann Otto
Solms had apparently forgotten to submit the application in time
in 1996. Nevertheless, the party eventually got the money after an
approval by German parliament speaker Rita Suessmuth.
</P>
<P>
Whether the FDP should return the funds would be decided by the
court later.
</P>
<P>
Under German law, political parties are entitled to state funds
in proportion to the number of votes they receive in federal,
regional and European elections.
</P>
<P>
The court's verdict could deal a heavy financial blow to the
FDP, whose votes could be vital for Kohl to win an unprecedented
fifth term in the next German general elections due in September
1998, analysts said.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Blue-chip stocks on Wall
Street rose today, stimulated by an interest rate fall on the U.S.
bond market.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators were mixed, although at the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, the main index plunged 5.3 percent after the Japanese
prime minister said no tax money will be used to support Japan's
troubled banking system.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more funds flew into the U.S. bond market,
pressing interest rates to their lowest level in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 73.92 points to 7,724.74.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where NYSE volume totaled 537.05
million shares as against 520.50 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 6.36 to 944.59, the
NYSE composite index rose 2.72 to 493.90, and the Nasdaq composite
index rose 0.77 to 1,601.21.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.44 to 430.69,
and the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange composite
index fell 3.36 to 667.85.

<P>
U.S. stocks drew some strength from the bond market, where
long-term interest rates continued to flirt with the first move
below 6 percent since January 1996.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices rose today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
fell as low as 6.02 percent before settling near 6.03 percent, its

<HEADLINE> Vancouver Promotes Business at APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The city of Vancouver and
Canada as a whole are taking advantage of the APEC meetings here
to promote business and trade.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the meetings where officials are trying to gain
agreement on free-trade initiatives, efforts are being made here
to enhance the images of Canadian products and businesses.
</P>
<P>
Take for example media kits that every journalist gets on his
or her arrival here. In addition to an APEC booklet and some
information about the city and province, there are pamphlets on
the Vancouver Stock Exchange and others, and even a CD or the
Canadian Exporters Catalogue.
</P>
<P>
If you want to import Canadian products, you are sure to get
enough information of Canadian companies, and that's good for the
sale of Canadian goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Private companies are actively participating in the event, by
contributing either money or services to the event.
</P>
<P>
In return, these companies' logos will be displayed prominently
where major events are unfolded, and information about them will
be disseminated to the media.
</P>
<P>
And the provincial and municipal governments here are trying
their best to capitalize on the week-long event here, which starts
today.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government of British Columbia (B.C.) has set up
a media information center of its own as part of the major
international media center. It provides almost all information
about the province, its economy, investment policies and major
companies.
</P>
<P>
B.C. Premier Glen Clark came and opened the center this morning
amidst the limelight of local and international media.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest immediate impact is going to be 500 million people
around the world watching Vancouver, looking at what we have to
offer," Clark said.
</P>
<P>
"The benefit here is to elevate Vancouver as the gateway to
North America from Asia, and the gateway from North America to
Asia... and elevate B.C. as the Canadian province on the Pacific
Rim," Clark noted.
</P>
<P>
To promote business and trade, the province also set up the
B.C. Business Crossroads Center, a showcase of B.C. businesses and
new technologies.
</P>
<P>
It's nothing strange that B.C. attaches such great importance
to the APEC event, considering the fact that its exports to APEC
member economies top 2.5 million dollars every hour.
</P>
<P>
Having the APEC meeting in Vancouver is "like having 18 of your
best customers pay you a visit," Premier Clark noted.

WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- President Nursultan
Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan said here on Wednesday that his country
may drop plans for a possible pipeline through Iran if the United
States could finance for an alternative by next October.
</P>
<P>
The United States has pressured the Central Asian country in

in favor of a U.S. backed pipeline through Azerbaijan, Georgia
and Turkey to the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
"We'd support the project that can be implemented in the
quickest way," Nazarbayev told reporters at the end of his visit to
the United states. "And if work on that U.S.-proposed line could
in fact start after October 1998, we are willing to cease work on
these other projects and make that our pipeline choice."
</P>
<P>
The United States supports multiple pipelines to get Caspian
Sea oil to the West but opposes routes that involve Iran, which
it tries to isolate by sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Blair Calls on Parties to Name Major Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair today
called on all parties in the country to name their major donors
over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
He told parliament he had proposed that all parties should give
details of donations above 5,000 pounds (8,500 U.S. dollars)
received since the 1992 general election to a committee looking
into party political funding.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that (committee chairman) Sir Patrick Neill be
able to look at all the donations -- both the amounts and the
donors -- that have been made going back to 1992," the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Blair's Labor government has been trying to calm a row over a
million pound (1.7 million dollar) political donation by chief of
Formula One Bernie Ecclestone before the May 1 election which
swept the Labor party to power.
</P>
<P>
But the move came too late to spare one of his ministers a
grilling over why the Labor government had scrapped banning
tobacco sponsorship of Formula One motor racing.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government came under heavy fire from newspapers
and political opponents over the donation and its relaxation of
policy on tobacco advertising.
</P>
<P>
The government acknowledged it had received the 1 million pound
donation but disassociated the donation with the relaxation of
tobacco ban on Formula One. Labor officials also promised to
return the donation very soon.
</P>
<P>
Peter Mandelson, minister in charge of policy presentation,
earlier admitted the government could not be proud of the way it
had handled the row, releasing details of Ecclestone's donation
only slowly and defensively.
</P>
<P>
"The government behaved out of character. We acted against our
own principles -- that honesty is the first principle of good
government," Mandelson told a conference of government
communication managers.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Young Adults in U.S. Expect Better Government Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Most young adults in the
United States don't necessarily want to reduce government's role
but want it to do a better job, according to a poll released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey by pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter was
released at the start of a project by corporations and nonprofit
groups to increase public trust in government.
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey of 505 Americans between the ages of 18
and 34 was conducted on October 29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 percent of respondents said government can help them
achieve their goals in life, compared with the 48 percent who said
government programs and policies are a hindrance.
</P>
<P>
But a large majority, 71 percent, answered that government
could help with better leadership and management, and 60 percent
would prefer improving the government over simply reducing its
size and power.
</P>
<P>
Young people ranked improving education, reforming Social
Security and Medicare to accommodate the retirement of the
baby-boomer generation and maintaining a strong economy as their
top priorities for government.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Nears 5-Year High Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar almost
reached a 5-year high against the Japanese yen today after Japan's
prime minister said the country would not use public funds to
support its banking system.
</P>
<P>
The yen fell sharply and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index
suffered its biggest one-day point drop this year after Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he did not support the use of
public funds to help ailing banks.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's ascent against the yen also was aided by further
economic troubles in South Korea, where the won currency hit a
record low against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The dollar peaked during the day at 127.42 yen -- above a
5-year high of 127.14 reached on April 10, 1992 -- but retreated to
settle in late New York trading at 127.00, up from 126.15 late
Tuesday. The dollar has not finished higher since April 30, when
it hit 127.06.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also moved against the German mark as U.S. blue-chip
stocks rose higher. The U.S. currency was quoted at 1.7318 marks,
up from 1.7294.
</P>
<P>
The new Taiwan dollar also hit a record low against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Annan: TV Power Should Be Partner in Pursuit of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The power of television
should be a partner in pursuit of a better future, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the second United Nations World Television Forum,
Annan said at this event, "we will open channels of closer
collaboration between regions and cultures. In doing so, we will
help to promote greater understanding and tolerance among
nations."
</P>
<P>
Annan said, "We now are living in an interdependent, global
village and facing new realities. We must accept change as an
essential condition of life." The challenge facing mankind today
cut across all borders and they involved all aspects of human
security, but human understanding had not yet grasped them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said issues before the United Nations,
such as the environment, drugs, pandemics, and sustainable
development, were issues carrying no passports. "This is the
message we are trying to send to the world," he said, adding that
the public was still thinking in local terms.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said, "Information has a great democratizing power
waiting to be harnessed to our global struggle for peace and
development." It was ignorance, not knowledge, that made enemies
of men. It was ignorance, not knowledge, that made fighters of
children.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the quantity and quality of available information
was changing dramatically every day, in every country and in every
corner of the world. Citizens were gaining greater access to
information.
</P>
<P>
He said the challenge now was to make information available to
all. For too long, economic inequality had prevented the large
majority of men and women on this planet from taking advantage of
the bounty of knowledge. The United Nations was now working to
develop with television a relationship of openness and mutual
trust.
</P>
<P>
He stressed with the help of television, the world could be
brought alive, and "we can help ensure our young are the first to
benefit from this knowledge, and to make it their partner in the
pursuit of a better future."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Woman Gives Birth to Septuplets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- An Iowa seamstress today
gave birth to four boys and three girls, only the second set of
septuplets ever known to be born alive, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The seven babies were successfully delivered in just six
minutes with the assistance from a medical team of more than 40
specialists. The babies were weighed from two pounds, five ounces
to three pounds, four ounces.
</P>
<P>
The mother was Bobbi McCaughey, 29, of Carlisle. She was in her
31st week of pregnancy. Mrs. McCaughey's due date was mid-January,
but she had been hospitalized since October 15 and the early
delivery was decided Tuesday night because of the number of
babies.
</P>
<P>
It was the first septuplets born in the United States since
May 1985 in Orange, California. In the last set birth, one was
stillborn, three died within 19 days of birth and the remaining
three had medical and developmental problems.
</P>
<P>
There are no known surviving sets of septuplets in the world. A
Saudi Arabian woman gave birth to septuplets in September, but six
died, according to hospital officials there.

<HEADLINE> UK Plans to Pull Some Troops from N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
considering withdrawing several hundred troops from Northern
Ireland in the next few weeks, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
"It is being actively considered at the moment. A decision may
be made by the end of the week," Reuters quoted a military source
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Britain has some 17,000 troops in Northern Ireland and the
source said that the number to be pulled out would probably be
around 500.
</P>
<P>
An uneasy peace has been maintained in the divided province of
Northern Ireland since July when the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
called a ceasefire in its 28-year struggle against British rule.
</P>
<P>
A dozen senior officials of the IRA recently quit the political
wing Sinn Fein in protest against new peace policies aimed at a
political settlement through talks, leaving the truce in danger.
</P>
<P>
Britain says that the IRA's ceasefire is intact, but police
officers were last week put on alert in case of attacks by
republican dissidents.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Iraq Must Comply With UN Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
today that the United States preferred a peaceful solution to the
dispute with Iraq but on the condition that Iraq fully comply with
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the United States would take whatever steps
necessary to end the impasse over the weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to resolve this situation peacefully with our friends
and allies," Clinton said at a bill signing ceremony at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
But "Iraq must comply with the unanimous will of the
international community and let the weapons inspectors resume
their work to prevent Iraq from developing an arsenal of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were made before the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council hold an emergency meeting in Geneva on the
Iraq crisis and were deemed as showing the American staunch
position in defusing the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"That's our top line, that's our bottom line," Clinton said. "I
want to achieve it diplomatically. But we're taking every step to
make sure we are prepared to pursue whatever options are
necessary."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Clinton ordered dispatch of six B-52 bombers and
six F-117 stealth fighters to the Gulf to beef up American
military presence in the region. He also authorized the commander
of U.S. forces in the Gulf to organize an air expeditionary force
with 30 fighters and B-1 bombers.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Open for All Options in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States wants a
peaceful solution to end its standoff with Iraq over arms
inspections but it is open to other options, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said here today.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who cut short her visit to India for an unannounced
visit to Egypt tonight, made the statement after a meeting with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa at the Cairo Airport.
</P>
<P>
She said that the persistent and ultimate aim of Washington
since the crisis started is a resumption of inspections by
U.N. arms experts.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that Iraq should comply with the will of the
international community and must allow the U.N. arms inspectors
back to Baghdad to continue their job.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baghdad must destroy its chemical and biological
weapons that pose a threat the world without any precondition, she
added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspectors pulled out of Iraq following Iraq's order
on October 29 expelling Americans working in the U.N. Commission
on dismantling its weapons of mass destruction. The U.S.,
encouraging a harsher economic sanctions on Baghdad, has threatened
military strikes to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat said she will fly from Cairo to Geneva for a
pre-dawn meeting Thursday with the foreign ministers of Russia,
France and Britain to discuss the Iraqi-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
She will get acquainted with the outcome of the contacts Moscow
held with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and expound the
U.S. measures and stand on the issue sparked off by Iraqi failure
to comply with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The hastily arranged meeting follows efforts by Russia to ease
the crisis over U.N. weapons inspections as Washington has decided
to beef up its military presence in the Gulf for a possible strike
against Baghdad following the 22-day-old U.N.-Iraq standoff.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aziz, currently visiting Moscow, will come to Cairo
to meet with Moussa and Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel
Meguid tomorrow to explain Iraq's views on the recent tension
between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
He reportedly has devised a proposal with Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeniv Primakov to avert a military confrontation with
the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has sent two messages to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, urging him to comply with the U.N.
resolutions and restraining from military showdown with the U.S..

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Adoption Overhaul Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today signed legislation to speed up moving children from foster
care to "permanent and loving homes."
</P>
<P>
The legislation, approved last week by Congress, is considered
to be the most sweeping set of revisions in nearly two decades to
the nation's adoption and foster care system.
</P>
<P>
At a White House ceremony Clinton said, "The new law will help
us to speed children out of foster care into permanent families by
setting meaningful time limits for child welfare decisions, by
clarifying which family situations call for reasonable
reunification efforts and which simply do not."
</P>
<P>
The measure would emphasize the health and safety of children
over the reunification of families, the current priority.
</P>
<P>
It reduces from 18 months to one year the deadline for states
to find a permanent home for a child. It also terminates parental
rights to children who have been in foster homes 15 of the
previous 22 months. Courts will be required to cut off parental
rights almost immediately if there is evidence of abandonment or
severe abuse.
</P>
<P>
At present, children who have been removed from their natural
families and cannot safely return to them typically wait three
years or more to be placed in permanent homes.
</P>
<P>
The new law provides cash bonuses of 4,000 to 6,000 dollars per
child for states that increase adoptions.
</P>
<P>
The number of children in foster care has grown 89 percent
since 1982. But the average number of children adopted from foster
care has held steady at about 20,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
Child welfare advocates generally welcome the legislation but
insist that more action is necessary for the half-million U.S.
children in foster care.

BAGHDAD, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is concerned with the
lastest developments in Russia's effort to find a way out of the

Saddam Hussein presided over a Cabinet meeting to review efforts
in solving the crisis through diplomatic and political means.

The report did not elaborate on the meeting.
</P>

Meanwhile, foreign ministers of Russia, Britain, France and the
United States are headed for an extraordinary meeting in Geneva to
decide whether the Russian plan will work in persuading Saddam to
reverse his decision and steering clear of a military conflict.

Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on how to solve the present weapons
inspection dispute. The result was their proposal to hold an
emergency meeting in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Russia said it had worked out a blueprint for the settlement of
the dispute, which will be presented at the Geneva meeting.

But the United States was cautious about the talks in Geneva
among five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.

Security Council have been met," White House Spokesman Mike
McCurry said.
