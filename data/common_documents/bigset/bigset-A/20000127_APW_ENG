<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply higher today as investors brushed off
a profit warning from Dell Computer and bought a wide range of technology names,
helping the Nasdaq composite to rebound from Wednesday's slump.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 58.32 at 11,091.31.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 9.37 at 1,413.46, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 51.03 at
4,120.94, bouncing back from Wednesday's 97-point decline.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks advanced despite a profit warning from one of the technology sector's
most reliable performers.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell slipped 3/8 to 40. Late Wednesday, the company said it will miss
analysts' profit and sales estimates this quarter due to parts shortages and
slower customer demand. Dell cited Year 2000 computer concerns for the
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, however, Wall Street brokerages including Merrill Lynch and Chase
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist stepped in to defend the company, raising their
recommendations on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Other technology companies posted sharp gains. Conexant, which will be added
to the S&AMP;P 500 after the close of trading Friday, rose 11 15/16 to 86 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Kellogg rose 1 1/8 to 25 15/16 after saying that fourth-quarter profits rose
47 percent from last year as the company cut down on inefficient promotional
efforts. Some investors were troubled, however, by a decline in cereal sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 144.32 million shares, ahead of Wednesday's
early pace.

<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.80 to 524.84.

	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.5 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.8
percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Carnival Re-Enters Norway Bidding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The bidding war over the Norwegian Cruise Lines flared
up again Thursday with industry leader Carnival Cruise Lines saying it was ready
to beat rival Star Cruises' offer, the Norwegian company announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Asia's leading cruise ship company, Star, appeared to have
secured control of the line with just over 50 percent of the shares in Norwegian
Cruise Lines owners, Oslo-based NCL Holding. It bid $4.38 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   But NCL had already agreed with lenders to convert $62 million in debt into
stock in the company, which increased the total number of shares and left Star
owning only about 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Carnival had started the bidding contest by offering $3.75 for each NCL
share but withdrew following Star's December bid.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday the NCL board informed the Oslo Stock Exchange that Carnival was
planning a new offer of $5 per share. The offer will be contingent upon it
acquiring half the shares in NCL, and winning approval by U.S. antitrust
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   That would put the total stock value of NCL at about $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Malaysia-based Star is Asia's largest cruise line. NCL is the world's fourth
largest, with 9 percent of the market. It is based in Miami, although it is
Norwegian-owned.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-based Carnival is the largest, with 36 percent of the world market
through its Carnival, Holland America, Cunard and Seabourn lines.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement to the stock exchange, NCL said it had recommended that its
shareholders refuse Star's offer.
</P>
<P>
	   After Star's bid, major owners in NCL made a play to drive up the price by
getting a Norwegian investor, Christian Sveaas, to buy its shares for $4.62
each. In exchange, he got an option to buy 30 million NCL shares for $4.37 each.
</P>
<P>
	   NCL's board has said its goal is to get the best possible price for the
Norwegian line.
</P>
<P>
	   Trygve Hegnar, a major NCL shareholder, said in an interview with the
Norwegian radio network NRK that he did not exclude the possibility of an even
higher bid for the line.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now that Carnival has said it is willing to buy the company, we can't
exclude others entering the field, or Star raising its bid," he said.

<HEADLINE> Farmland Announces 320 Jobs Cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Farmland Industries will eliminate 320 jobs, or 1.9
percent of its worldwide work force, in an effort to revive its failed merger
with Cenex Harvest States.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's largest farmer-owned agricultural cooperative announced plans
Wednesday for the job cuts, most of them in the Kansas City area, where Farmland
employs about 2,000. It employs 17,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmland has said it needs to cut costs in light of the unsuccessful attempt
to merge with Minneapolis-based Cenex Harvest States -- the second-largest
cooperative.
</P>
<P>
	   The cuts will be made companywide but will come primarily from
administrative ranks, said Farmland spokeswoman Sherlyn Manson. The majority of
the administrative employees are in the Kansas City headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmland and Cenex arev making plans to put another merger proposal before
their members. Two months ago, a plan to combine the cooperatives was narrowly
defeated by Cenex members.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the cooperatives said a combined entity would have annual sales of
about $17 billion and would have achieved an estimated $500 million in savings
over six years.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger would have combined the organizations into United Country Brands,
based in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
	   Each cooperative needs support from two-thirds of its members to merge. In
the Nov. 23 vote, 89 percent of Farmland favored the merger, but support among
Cenex members fell just short, at 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   A Cenex spokesman confirmed it also notified members last week of plans to
submit another proposal, assuming issues of concern to its members could be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the merger cited concerns about Farmland's financial condition
and large merger-related payments to both cooperatives' managers. A week after
the vote, a federal tax court ruled Farmland did not owe $400 million in taxes
related to the sale of a subsidiary 16 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmland this month reported a $26.5 million loss for its first quarter,
compared with a $6.8 million loss in the first quarter a year ago. The loss was
attributed mostly to depressed fertilizer sales in a depressed farm economy.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time it announced its financial results, Farmland said it was
beginning programs that would help it get greater discounts on purchases and
would cut energy costs at various production plants. It also closed four
regional offices, eliminating about 20 jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Manson said consolidation of seven sites into an $80 million headquarters
under construction in Kansas City is also expected to save money.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Edge Down Slightly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages edged down slightly
this week after hitting their highest level since September 1996 the week
before.
</P>
<P>
	   The average interest rate on 30-year mortgages fell to 8.25 percent for the
week ending Jan. 28, down from 8.26 percent last week, according to a weekly
survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's 8.26 percent rate was the highest since Sept. 13, 1996, when
rates on the 30-year mortgage hit 8.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also inched down
this week with an average rate of 7.84 percent this week compared with the
average rate of 7.86 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
	   But on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average
initial rate of 6.65 percent this week, up from 6.56 percent the previous week.
</P>
<P>
	   The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which averaged at or
just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three types of mortgages.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said that mortgage
loan applications for the week ending Jan. 21 decreased 5.8 percent from the
previous week and were down 37.9 percent compared with the same week last year.

manufacturers to their best year since 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at least
three years -- rose 7.1 percent. The performance matched the annual gain
recorded two years ago and followed a 3.6 percent increase in 1998, the Commerce
Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The numbers clearly show that the manufacturing sector is very healthy
right now," said David Huether, an economist with the National Association of
Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said the strong showing for the year and for December largely
reflects the vibrant U.S. economy that is behind the strong demand from American
businesses and consumers for big-ticket manufactured goods, particularly
high-tech and other equipment that allow companies to become more productive.
</P>
<P>
	   "Factory activity remains unquestionably robust," said Merrill Lynch
economist Stan Shipley.
</P>
<P>
	   In another report, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said the
nation's home ownership rate climbed to an all-time annual high of 66.8 percent
in 1999, further evidence of the economy's strength. Plentiful jobs, rising
incomes, stock market gains and low inflation have put Americans in the buying
mood, economists said. In 1998, the rate was 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the bigger-than-expected 4.1 percent increase in durable-goods
orders in December was the best showing since July and boosted orders to a
seasonally adjusted $212.9 billion. Many analysts were forecasting a 0.8 percent
rise. In November, orders rose 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Most economists predict the Federal Reserve will bump up interest rates by a
quarter of a percentage point on Feb. 2 in an effort to slow the sizzling
economy and keep inflation under control. Even though the Fed raised rates three
times last year, the economy continues to grow at a rapid pace that some
economists fear cannot be sustained without later triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   A 16.2 percent jump in orders for transportation equipment, the largest gain
since August 1998, contributed to the big increase in December's overall
durable-goods orders. Transportation equipment, including cars, posted gains
across the board but was led by strong demand for airplanes and aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Taylor, economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said
his industry sold an all-time high of nearly 17 million cars and light trucks in
1999. Sales in 2000 are expected to be slightly lower but still remain at brisk
levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the volatile transportation sector, overall durable-goods orders
grew by 0.7 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment including
semiconductors, circuit boards, telecommunications equipment and home
appliances, rose by 4.6 percent, another factor behind last month's surge in
overall orders. Orders for this sector have been up six of the last seven
months.
</P>
<P>
	   But orders for industrial machinery, including computers and machine tools,
which have been down six of the last eight months, fell 4.2 percent in December.
Also, orders for primary metals, the category that includes steel, dropped 1.5
percent in December. This category has been down four of the last five months.
</P>
<P>
	   American manufacturers have past the worst of a global financial crisis that
struck in late 1997, economists said. The crisis had cut sharply into U.S.
manufacturers' overseas sales and also opened them up to stiffer competition
from cheaper imports. As those foreign economies mend, demand for U.S. goods has
picked up.
</P>
<P>
	   Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good signal of current demand, rose
0.7 percent in December, the seventh increase in the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new
claims for unemployment benefits rose by 1,000 last week to 266,000. Even with
the small gain, claims were left at a level indicating that employers are having
trouble finding scarce workers to fill job openings.
</P>
<P>
	   In another report, the volume of help-wanted advertising in major U.S.
newspapers edged up slightly in December, the Conference Board said. Its Help
Wanted Advertising Index rose to 86 from 85 in November. The index is used as a
gauge of changes in job supply.

<HEADLINE> Media General Earnings Rise 48 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Media General Inc., a newspaper publisher and
television broadcaster serving the Southeast, reported a 48 percent jump in
fourth-quarter earnings Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Media General earned $25.4 million, or 95 cents per share, up from $17.1
million, or 63 cents per share, in the same period last year. The results were
well ahead of analyst expectations of 87 cents per share, as measured by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings did not include a one-time gain of $798.7 million from the sale
of cable operations to Cox Communications or a $1.3 million charge from early
settlement of about $800 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues in the fourth quarter were $212.1 million, slightly lower than
$212.2 million in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Losses in the newsprint division were more than offset by increases in the
publishing division, said J. Stewart Bryan III, chairman and chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
	   "As has been the case all year, the publishing division had a strong
performance in the quarter, despite soft retail advertising revenues," Bryan
said. "Our newsprint business remained under pressure in the quarter as costs
continued to exceed current selling price levels."
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, profits rose 31 percent to $69.9 million, or $2.60 per share,
compared to $53.4 million, or $1.98 per share in 1998. 1999 revenues slipped to
$795.4 million from $816.9 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Media General is an independent, publicly owned communications company with
interests in newspapers, broadcast television, recycled newsprint and
diversified information services primarily in the Southeast.

<HEADLINE> S. African Minibus Drivers Protest  </HEADLINE>
    By SUSANNA LOOF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KYALAMI, South Africa (AP) -- Striking minibus drivers on Thursday protested
the South African government's attempts to regulate their industry, halting
traffic, confronting some non-striking drivers and pulling passengers out of the
16-seat vans used as taxis.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one man was beaten by the protesters in Kyalami, a suburb north of
Johannesburg. But no serious injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators, some armed with clubs and spears, caused traffic jams
that stretched for miles, stranding thousands of commuters. The drivers were
demonstrating against government plans to replace the vans currently in use with
larger minibuses that can seat 18 to 35 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Taxi Drivers' Organization, which staged Thursday's
demonstration, says 41,000 of its 100,000 members would lose their jobs as a
result, because fewer drivers would be needed to haul commuters around in the
bigger vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Karin Pearce, leader of the government's Taxi Recapitalization Project,
denied that, saying at most 20,000 drivers might lose their jobs but that the
project was expected to create more jobs as maintenance needs increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-year phaseout of the vans is to begin in October, Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new buses' design is safer, Pearce said. Each bus is to be equipped with
a tracking system to keep tabs on speeders and to monitor routing.
</P>
<P>
	   During the strike in Kyalami on Thursday, armed police and soldiers kept the
strikers away from an exhibition center where new minibuses were on display. The
striking drivers dispersed a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   South Africa's taxi-van industry has a reputation of unruliness. The vans
are the major means of transportation for poor blacks, and during the apartheid
era, the industry mushroomed into an unregulated system of rival syndicates that
waged violent battles for routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Many passengers also have died in crashes on minibuses that were later found
to be in disrepair.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the government's program, drivers who turn in their current vans to be
scrapped will receive up to one-third of the cost of a new bus, Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators have asked that a senior government official meet with them to
discuss job losses, she said. Transport Minister Dullah Omar has agreed to the
demand, Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want the government to solve our problems," said Bonginkasi Xaba, a
striking minibus driver from the township of Soweto. Xaba said he fears the
changes will leave him jobless. South Africa has a 33 percent unemployment rate.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian State Enacts Islamic Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Thousands of Muslim faithful staged joyous street
marches Thursday in the capital of Nigeria's northern Zamfara state to celebrate
the enactment of Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
	   State governor Ahmed Sani signed two bills Thursday making Zamfara the first
Nigerian state to adopt Islamic law, known as Sharia.
</P>
<P>
	   The bills established Sharia courts and a Sharia penal code, crucial for the
law's functioning. Later Thursday, Islamic judges were expected to be sworn in
as heads of the 24 newly established Sharia courts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything has gone very well and there is a sense of fulfillment among
the Muslim population here. While some are wondering what the implications are,
the overwhelming majority believe it was very justified,'' local journalist Sani
Abdullahi said in a phone call from Gusau, the state capital located about 250
miles north of Abuja.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharia is based on the Koran and the body of Islamic traditions. While it
officially went into effect Thursday, some aspects of Sharia were adopted months
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Women-only taxis have been operating in Zamfara since last year and most
schools now separate boys and girls. Nearly all bars have been closed and almost
every store has been forced to stop selling alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   Zamfara state authorities have repeatedly assured the minority Christian
community that Sharia will only apply to Muslims. But they also have said
schools and public transportation eventually will be completely segregated by
gender.
</P>
<P>
	   Nigeria, a country of 120 million people, is sharply divided along ethnic
and religious lines. Muslims and Christians each make up about 45 percent of
Nigeria's population.
</P>
<P>
	   In Zamfara, though, Christians make up less than 10 percent of the
population and are mostly transplanted southerners of the Yoruba or Ibo ethnic
groups. Christians in the south have generally opposed Sharia.

<HEADLINE> Rome's Homeless Seeking Shelter  </HEADLINE>
   By ELLEN KNICKMEYER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME (AP) -- Stung by the deaths of nine homeless people since the opening
of the Holy Year, Rome and its churches are rushing to find shelter for those
left out in the cold in the restored and gleaming city.
</P>
<P>
	   Some charity workers blame cleanup and construction projects timed to the
Holy Year that have shut off homeless haunts -- particularly the Termini, Rome's
central train station -- as much as they do the chill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is the worst death rate of at least the last 10 years,'' said Mario
Marazitti of the Sant'Egidio community, one of the Roman Catholic groups working
to round up aid. ``The homeless are having more difficulty in finding shelter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Anticipating the Holy Year and its pilgrims and tourists, authorities
concentrated on ``the beauty of Rome ... without a precise choice to meet the
needs of the weakest,'' Marazitti said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have seen the results in these weeks.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, church workers held services a Swiss woman known as Heidi who
was found frozen to death in a doorway a few blocks from St. Peter's.
</P>
<P>
	   Italy has what some aid organizations estimate as 220,000 homeless, normally
protected from the extremes of winter in the balmy center and south.
</P>
<P>
	   However, an unusually sharp cold spell this week brought temperatures below
freezing in Rome and still lower in the north.
</P>
<P>
	   In the northern city of Turin, police checking a public garden where street
people sleep found a frozen body Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The same day, Italy's government announced it was freeing $15 million in
emergency funds for the homeless in Rome and eight other cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Rome leaders outlined an emergency cold plan this week that puts new squads
on the streets to search for people sleeping in the cold. In addition, the city
and church groups are offering dozens of extra beds in shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   The city also has started keeping some subway stations open overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The stations replace shelter lost when police started chasing street people,
prostitutes and drug addicts out of the tunnels and environs of the dilapidated
central train station.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities inaugurate the restored train station on Friday. The reopening
of the Fascist-era building comes in time for the anticipated millions of
Italian and foreign visitors for the Holy Year, the Roman Catholic Church's
celebration of Christianity's third millennium.
</P>
<P>
	   The Holy Year is also bringing more homeless to Rome, some of whom may think
the religious celebrations will make the city an easier place to find aid, said
Monica Scifoni, spokeswoman for the city council's homeless agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The city has planned for two years for what had been an anticipated surge in
homeless, Scifoni said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelter squads are finding that about half the street people forced away
from the Termini or found huddled elsewhere refuse to move into shelters,
Scifoni said. However, they do accept the sleeping bags, blankets and warm food
the squads offer, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rome's homeless long have turned to another kind of charity for support --
neighborhood coffee bars, where kindhearted waiters dispense cappuccino and
sandwiches to the homeless as a matter of routine.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the street people turn out for breakfast wrapped in blankets
against the cold.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are definitely more people this year than others,'' said Francesca
di Giorgio, a barkeeper in Piazza Venezia, this winter keeping two or three
homeless going each day with heated pastries and warm milk.

<HEADLINE> Another Step in Atack on AIDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists at drug giant Merck &AMP; Co. have opened a
long-awaited target in the hunt for new ways to attack the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
	   It will take years of additional work to create a usable medication from the
finding, experts cautioned.
</P>
<P>
	   But Merck's research with an enzyme called integrase gives scientists a
long-awaited new place to aim against HIV, at a time when many researchers are
frustrated in the hunt for novel AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Integrase is an enzyme carried by the AIDS virus that causes a crucial step
in HIV infection: It melds HIV's genetic material with the patient's own DNA
inside their cells, essentially hijacking them. Only when that happens can HIV
begin reproducing at its infamously furious rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists have long known about integrase's crucial function, but attempts
to create drugs to block it so far have failed.
</P>
<P>
	   In Friday's edition of the journal Science, Merck researchers report
uncovering the exact spot in integrase's action that must be blocked for a drug
to work, and the discovery of two chemicals that -- in laboratory tests --
seemed to fight the virus.
</P>
<P>
	   Merck says those chemicals have other drawbacks that prevent them from ever
becoming usable drugs, but the research provides a roadmap in the hunt for
potential "integrase inhibitors" that AIDS experts called exciting.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Postal Blast Kills 11  </HEADLINE>
   By THAMPU VIVEKARASA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VAVUNIYA, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A Sri Lankan official is blaming Tamil rebels
for a parcel bomb that exploded in a post office Thursday, killing at least 11
people and terrifying residents of this northern garrison town.
</P>
<P>
	   The blast occurred late in the morning, injuring more than 73 people in
Vavuniya, a Tamil-dominated town 130 miles north of the capital, Colombo. At
least 25 of the wounded were in serious condition and were transferred to a
military hospital in Anuradhapura, 25 miles south of Vavuniya.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those killed were soldiers who were sending money home from the war
front, the military and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Ministry spokesman Brigadier Palitha Fernando said evidence from the
scene suggested the bomb was sent by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the
group leading a 17-year-old separatist campaign in Sri Lanka, a small island
country off India's southern tip.
</P>
<P>
	   Security was stepped up soon after the explosion, with soldiers frisking
pedestrians and searching vehicles. The town was tense after the blast. Traders
closed shop early and roads were deserted.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the rebels rarely
comment on bombs or terrorist actions the government ascribes to them.
</P>
<P>
	   Sri Lankan soldiers collected their wages Tuesday and, after making
purchases Wednesday, many were sending money to their families at the time of
the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Fernando said the bomb was placed next to a mailbox for letters destined for
foreign countries. It exploded late in the morning when the post office was
busy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a big explosion from a powerful bomb which was hidden in a
packet,'' Fernando said. ``Our first reports say we have lost at least seven
soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Letters, currency notes and clothes were strewn about the single-story post
office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was on my seat when I heard this huge sound,'' the injured postmaster,
Kanathi Pillai, said from his hospital bed. ``I felt heat on my body, and then I
felt blood coming down from my head.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators said the explosion was triggered by remote control.
</P>
<P>
	   Vavuniya is the gateway to the Vanni jungles, which are controlled by the
Tamil Tigers. The rebels threatened to overrun Vavuniya last November, advising
the area's 220,000 residents to evacuate. Sri Lanka troops fought off that
attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's blast came a day after a delegation from Norway concluded
meetings in Sri Lanka in a bid to broker peace talks between the government and
the Tamil Tigers.
</P>
<P>
	   The guerrillas are fighting for a separate homeland. They say Tamils face
discrimination from the Sinhalese, who make up 14 million of the island
country's 18.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   The civil war has claimed more than 61,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Snow Falls in Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Heavy snow piled up in Jerusalem and other hilltop areas in
Israel on Thursday, creating picturesque scenes but closing roads and causing
traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
	   Snowstorms hit Jerusalem only once every several years, and the city does
not have snow removal equipment. City officials advised residents not to drive
their cars.
</P>
<P>
	   As temperatures hovered just below freezing, heavy, wet snow piled up on
streets and highways. Authorities activated road graders and bulldozers in a
struggle to keep the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway open, but cars backed up
for miles.
</P>
<P>
	   A white blanket started forming on top of the mosques, churches and
synagogues in the walled Old City of Jerusalem. Snow also fell in the northern
part of Israel, dressing the biblical city of Safed in white.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy rain fell in parts of the country, flooding some streets and backing
up traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the damage, the storm had a positive side. The Sea of Galilee,
Israel's main source of drinking water, was rising slowly but steadily after
being depleted dangerously because of a drought last year.

<HEADLINE> India Returns Pakistani Bodies  </HEADLINE>
   By BINOO JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) -- After a cold handshake between enemies during a brief
cease-fire, Indian army officers returned to Pakistan the bodies of five
Pakistani soldiers killed in a fierce clash last week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Pakistani army doctor leaned over the wooden coffins to identify the
bodies, wrapped in Pakistani flags, before they were taken away by their
grim-faced comrades, said Indian officers who witnessed the event at a border.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides agreed to hold their fire for two hours before Thursday's
handover and two hours afterwards, said Brigadier Jasbir Singh, the local Indian
commander.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pakistani soldiers were among seven killed along the disputed Kashmir
border Saturday in what India said was an attempt to overtake an Indian border
post in the mountainous frontier region. Two Indian soldiers were killed and 12
Pakistanis wounded. Frightened villagers fled the area in carts, buses and on
horseback.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pakistani army accused Indian soldiers of attacking one of its posts,
and said two soldiers were killed and five were missing.
</P>
<P>
	   The clashes took place about 30 miles northwest of Jammu, the winter capital
of Indian-controlled Kashmir in a stretch along the cease-fire boundary between
the countries. Pakistan calls the area Iftikharabad and India calls it
Pallanwala.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the cease-fire, gunfire rocks the area nearly every day. The clash
on Saturday escalated fighting along the frontier, Singh said.
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir, two-thirds of which is controlled by
India and the rest by Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Euro Sinks To New Low Vs. Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The euro sank to a new low today, falling below 99 U.S. cents
for the first time since it was introduced just over a year ago as the single
currency of 11 European nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was mixed against major currencies in European trading, as was
gold.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro was quoted at 98.98 cents in late European trading, down from
$1.0011 Wednesday. In afternoon trading in New York, the euro sank to 98.85
cents. The previous low occurred during trading Tuesday, at 99.87 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   The Euro first slipped below parity with the dollar on Dec. 3. It's all-time
high of $1.1886 came on Jan. 4, 1999, during its first day of trading. It has
fallen, in part, because of a lack of support from the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said there's room for the euro to fall further before the central
bank feels compelled to either intervene in currency markets by buying euros or
by decisively increasing interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's definitely a good chance the euro is going to stay below parity for
a while," said Richard Kasmin, foreign currency strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin
and Jenrette in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Central Bank holds its regular council meeting next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't see any indication the ECB is going to raise rates any time soon.
So why should the market be convinced the euro should rebound soon? " Kasmin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday, included 104.97
Japanese yen, down from 105.85; 1.6133 Swiss francs, up from 1.6098; 1.4200
Canadian dollars, down from 1.4366.
</P>
<P>
	   The British pound was quoted at $1.6361, down from $1.6396.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading in New York, the dollar bought 104.84 yen and the pound
was worth $1.6375.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the countries participating in the euro are no longer traded
separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro rates, the dollar is worth
1.9750 German marks, up from 1.9533; 6.6245 French francs, up from 6.5511;
2.2255 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2008; 1,955.43 Italian lire, up from 1,933.76.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold closed in London at $285.90 bid per troy ounce, up from $285.10 on
Wednesday. In Zurich the bid price was $285.50 down from $285.62. Gold rose
$2.10 in Hong Kong to $286.85.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver closed in London at $5.32 bid per troy ounce, up from $5.19.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Pakistan on Terrorism  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States warned Pakistan on Thursday that it
could be branded a sponsor of terrorism -- making it ineligible for virtually
all U.S. aid -- if it gave direct support to a terrorist group that operates in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   In issuing the warning the State Department was also sharply critical of the
military-run government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf for requiring judges to take a
loyalty oath.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This move by General Musharraf undermines the integrity and independence
of the judiciary in Pakistan,'' spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, six Supreme Court justices refused to take the oath, which
would shield the military from legal action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gen. Musharraf needs to make clear in a comprehensive fashion how he
intends to return Pakistan to an elected government with a functioning
legislature and an independent judiciary under a democratic constitution,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is expected to decide soon whether he will include
Pakistan in a March trip to India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Clinton and the State Department said there was no
evidence Pakistan supported the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Rubin said at the time the hijackers may have been linked to a
terrorist group that operates in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   The group, known as Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, was placed on the department's
list of terrorist organizations in 1997 when it was called Harkat ul-Ansar.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin also said there has long been concern that agencies of the Pakistani
government provided ``general support'' to a number of groups operating in the
territory disputed by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the U.S. official said ``that is a matter of extreme concern to
us'' and that senior administration officials had taken it up with top Pakistani
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the secretary of state determines that a government has repeatedly
provided support of international terrorism directly, then she would be prepared
to designate that country as a state sponsor of terrorism,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that was not a threat, but rather ``a comment about the realities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and Michael Sheehan, the
coordinator of the department's office to counter terrorism, conveyed U.S.
concerns about terrorism and anti-democratic tendencies in talks last week in
Pakistan, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijacking incident ended with 155 hostages freed in exchange for the
Indian government's release of three members of the group.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven countries listed by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism
are ineligible, under federal law, for virtually all U.S. assistance and for
U.S. support in international lending institutions. They are Syria, Iran, Iraq,
Cuba, Sudan, North Korea and Libya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me be clear,'' Rubin said, ``we are not conducting business as usual
with Pakistan, in light of the October coup there.''

<HEADLINE> Former NYC Correction official to run Nassau jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) - A former top official with the New York City
Department of Correction was nominated Thursday to take over operations at the
beleaguered Nassau County Jail.
<P>
	   Edward Reilly, 52, is being brought in to serve as sheriff at a facility
currently under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department over allegations of
prisoner mistreatment. In the past month, four correction officers have either
pleaded guilty or been convicted in federal court in the January 1999 beating
death of an inmate.
</P>
<P>
	   Numerous lawsuits have also been filed by former inmates claiming they were
attacked by guards. Last March, an officer was found liable in the beating of a
mentally retarded inmate with a frying pan. The Nassau County Legislature also
is conducting hearings into allegations of widespread abuse of overtime at the
East Meadow facility.
</P>
<P>
	   Reilly replaces Joseph Jablonsky, who retired late last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have asked Ed Reilly to review all procedures ... to make certain that
the jail functions efficiently and in the most cost-effective fashion," said
County Executive Thomas Gulotta, who nominated him. He said Reilly "possesses
the necessary experience and credentials that will ensure a professional
corrections environment."
</P>
<P>
	   Reilly is a 26-year veteran of the New York City Department of Correction,
retiring early last year as chief, the highest-ranking uniformed position in the
department. He began his career as a guard on Rikers Island in 1972 and has
served as the executive officer of the department's training academy and as a
member of its hostage negotiations team.
</P>
<P>
	   A resident of Brightwaters, he most recently worked as assistant vice
president for security at Sotheby's North America.
</P>
<P>
	   Reilly, whose nomination still requires the approval of the County
Legislature, said he looks forward to improving the reputation of the jail,
which has a staff of about 1,200 and an inmate population of 1,800.
</P>
<P>
	   "You start by talking about the officers that are inside doing an excellent
job every day," Reilly said. "I think the tarnish then can be removed."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he intends to review all operations at the jail. "The possibility
always exists that people can act inappropriately. ... It's never been tolerated
on my watch and it's not going to be."
</P>
<P>
	   Judy Jacobs, the presiding officer of the County Legislature, said she
expected the confirmation process to begin within a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she was "very impressed that the county executive appears to
recognize the need to nominate a person of unquestionable experience as the new
sheriff. At first glance, it appears that Mr. Reilly possesses these
attributes."

<HEADLINE> Help-Wanted Ads Edge Up in December  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The volume of help-wanted advertising in major U.S.
newspapers edged up in December, the Conference Board said in a report Thursday
that said chances are good that the unemployment rate would soon would fall
below 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The business-financed research organization said its Help-Wanted Advertising
Index rose to 86 in December from 85 in November. It was 87 one year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The index is used as a gauge of changes in job supply. It is watched by
economists as an indicator of labor market conditions to help form estimates of
unemployment rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "Job growth is strong enough to raise serious questions about whether there
are sufficient job applicants," said Ken Goldstein, an economist for the
Conference Board. "The unemployment rate will probably dip below 4 percent
before the snow melts."
</P>
<P>
	   The unemployment rate in December was 4.1 percent, the lowest rate since the
3.9 percent recorded in January 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   From October through December, help-wanted advertising rose in all regions
except for the West South Central region that includes Dallas, Houston, San
Antonio, New Orleans, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, Okla., which fell 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The greatest increases were in the East North Central region, including
Chicago; Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Toledo and Dayton in Ohio; Detroit;
Indianapolis and Gary in Indiana; and Milwaukee, up 7.3 percent; the Pacific
region, including Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento and San
Bernardino in California; and Seattle, up 7.2 percent; and the Mountain region,
including Denver, Phoenix and Salt Lake City, up 4.1 percent.

	   Clinton To Seek $350B Tax Cut
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose a $350 billion
tax-cut package in his final State of the Union address tonight,
urging relief from the marriage penalty and a new program of
retirement savings accounts. The president also will propose big
tax breaks for education, including a tax deduction of up to
$10,000 for college tuition. Another proposal would offer a tax
deduction to encourage philanthropy. Details of his proposals were
released in advance of tonight's address before a joint session of
Congress. Key elements of Clinton's tax package include retirement
savings accounts for low-income families and increasing the
standard deduction for two-income couples to twice that of single
filers.

companies for disappointing Wall Street this week. Coca-Cola shares
tumbled for a second session, losing 3 13/16 to trade at 59 1/4.

	   EToys' Stock Plunges 20 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- EToys Inc.'s shares plunged more than 20 percent
today as investors panicked that the online retailer will continue
losing money and won't start turning a profit soon. The slump on
Wall Street came after the eToys reported that sales soared during
its fiscal third quarter, but its losses widened as it spent
heavily to fend off rival Web toy stores during the holiday season.
The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company lost $62.5 million, or 52
cents a share, compared with a loss of $8.2 million a year earlier.
The results met analysts forecasts, but eToys' stock fell $4.31 1/4 to

all of 1999, orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at
least three years -- rose 7.1 percent. The performance matched the
annual gain recorded two years ago and followed a 3.6 percent
increase in 1998, the Commerce Department said today. In another

<HEADLINE> Merck May Have AIDS Breakthrough  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have become increasingly frustrated in the
hunt for novel ways to attack the AIDS virus, but now they're getting some
encouraging news: Drug giant Merck &AMP; Co. has mapped the way toward a
long-elusive target.
</P>
<P>
	   It will take years of additional research to turn the finding into a usable
medication, experts cautioned.
</P>
<P>
	   But the research gives scientists another -- and long-awaited -- place to
aim at in fighting the HIV virus, important as today's AIDS drugs slowly lose
their edge with few options in sight.
</P>
<P>
	   It's called integrase, an enzyme carried by the AIDS virus that causes a
crucial step in HIV infection: It melds HIV's genetic material with the
patient's own DNA inside their cells, essentially hijacking cells. Only then can
HIV begin reproducing at its infamously furious rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists have long known about integrase's crucial function and tried to
create "integrase inhibiting" drugs to block its effect, much like the popular
AIDS-fighting "protease inhibitors" block the action of a different HIV enzyme
called protease.
</P>
<P>
	   But attempts to create integrase inhibitors have failed so far.
</P>
<P>
	   Merck's advance, reported in Friday's edition of the journal Science, was to
uncover the exact spot in the enzyme's action that must be blocked for an
integrase inhibitor to work.
</P>
<P>
	   Merck researchers screened 250,000 samples in the company's library of
chemicals and found two compounds known as "diketo acids" that hit that spot. In
laboratory tests, the compounds successfully inhibited integrase and fought HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   In an unusual move, Merck executives refused to allow the lead scientist --
Daria Hazuda -- to discuss her discovery with reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   But a Merck spokesman said the compounds described in Science have certain
problems that prevent them from being pursued as drugs, so the company is
hunting better candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Other AIDS researchers welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's opened up a third target, a target everyone knew was out there but ...
that no one's been able to hit," said Cornell University's Dr. Jeffrey Laurence,
senior scientist for the American Foundation for AIDS Research. "It's nice to
know it's doable."
</P>
<P>
	   "They have now developed methodology, which is a critical step in developing
drugs against this target," added Dr. Douglas Richman of the University of
California, San Diego. "It's very exciting."
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors today have two ways to attack HIV: Drugs like AZT and ddI block an
enzyme called reverse transcriptase that is vital to early HIV infection, while
protease inhibitors work at one of the latest stages of HIV replication.
</P>
<P>
	   Combinations of those drugs have helped thousands of patients live longer
and healthier, but they are not a cure, don't help everyone and lose their
effectiveness over time.
</P>
<P>
	   Integrase inhibitors would target HIV infection between the steps those
other drugs hit.
</P>
<P>
	   "What would be ideal ... would be to have drugs targeted at each of the
successive steps of the virus life cycle so if you didn't hit it at one step,
you would get it at subsequent steps," said Dr. Mark Feinberg of Emory
University. The integrase research "is an important step in the right
direction."

    BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- A man's scheme to win money from a casino without
gambling landed him in jail, police said.

<P>
	   Ronald Dean Cherry, 52, phoned the Treasure Bay Casino on Tuesday and
demanded that employees deliver $100,000 to his home within two hours or he
would start shooting people at the casino, police said. He even gave them his

	   Instead, the casino's security force contacted Biloxi police, who went to
Cherry's home.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy Sides Lobby Congress  </HEADLINE>
   By MADELINE BARO DIAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Cuban and American relatives took
custody fight to Congress today, and the nun who was host of the boy's tense
reunion with his grandmothers said she now favors letting him stay.
</P>
<P>
	   Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin told The Associated Press that before Wednesday
night's reunion, her opinion was, ``I would go with the law that the child
should be with the father, but what I saw and felt really frightened me for the
child.''
</P>
<P>
	   She blamed both sides but specifically cited Fidel Castro's government for
trying to manipulate the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   In court papers, meanwhile, the Justice Department argued that the judge
should dismiss the Florida relatives' case either on grounds the court lacks
jurisdiction to review the immigration decision or that Elian's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, lacks standing under federal law to speak for him.
</P>
<P>
	   It said a victory for the Miami relatives would ``ignore accepted
international practice in cases involving a sole surviving parent located in the
United States, where we would expect the foreign country to immediately return
the child to the surviving American parent.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-year-old boy has become the center of a fight between Cuban exiles and
the Communist country after he was found clinging to an inner tube off the
Florida coast Nov. 25. He left Cuba with his mother, who died along with her
boyfriend and nine others when their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service is pressing to have him returned
to Cuba, citing the father's right to custody.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington today, Elian's Cuban grandmothers met with members of Congress
and depicted him as a changed, emotionally drained child who should be sent home
to his father. The boy's Florida relatives pressed their side, urging that
Congress grant emergency U.S. citizenship so that Elian could stay.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department brief filed in U.S. District Court in Miami included
a transcript of the father's interview with INS officials Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My son is suffering,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez told the INS. ``My son needs
me and needs his grandparents, and I need him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez accused the Miami relatives of trying to bribe him with offers of
money, a house and a car if he agreed to go to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I could go there with all my family and would be taken care and could have
a job if I wanted to work, but with the money offered I would not need to do
so,'' Gonzalez said. ``That's when I hung up the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
	   With a backdrop of 200 chanting, flag-waving demonstrators nearby, the
trembling grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, met with the boy
Wednesday night at Sister O'Laughlin's home.
</P>
<P>
	   They brought Elian a photo album filled with pictures of his family and
friends back in Cuba, and the three played with an Etch A Sketch and stuffed
animals.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, one of the grandmothers' cellular phone went off and was
confiscated. It was unclear who was trying to call, but a letter issued
Wednesday by the Cuban Communist Party from the boy's father and grandfather in
Cuba said they would call during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers did not comment as they left the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview broadcast over the Spanish-language Radio Mambi after the
reunion, Elian said: ``Tomorrow they're going to make me an American citizen.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, an editorial in today's Communist daily Granma complained about the
phone confiscation and said a ``counterrevolutionary mafia'' is responsible for
``the monstrous and traitorous kidnapping.'' The government complained that
``the loving and heroic grandmothers'' were treated shabbily, and that the
reunion was repeatedly interrupted and abruptly cut short.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, Sister O'Laughlin said: ``The Cuban government ... has said we
were not nice to the grandmothers, that we had spies. This is just not true.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sister O'Laughlin said that both sides were so mistrustful that she had to
show them there was no chance Elian could be snatched away.
</P>
<P>
	   She showed her visitors that ``windows couldn't be opened, that doors
couldn't be invaded, that helicopters could not land in fake grass, that there
were no disappearing trap doors.''
</P>
<P>
	   She added: ``What I experienced yesterday about tangible fear gives me real
concern about the future of the child, ... and when I look at the real fear I
say he would grow to greater freedom of manhood here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sister O'Laughlin, who is to meet with Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday
afternoon, said she would tell officials in Washington ``the truth as I
experienced it. I don't represent pro-Castro, anti-Castro or INS. I only have
the sense that I felt when I blessed that boy when he was leaving here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the boy's reunion, Reno said today that ``it sounded like it
went as anticipated and gave the grandmothers time with Elian.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott indicated he had no solid
plans for handling legislation to give Elian citizenship, removing the boy from
the jurisdiction of the INS.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton supports the grandmothers' cause, hinting he might veto
citizenship legislation if it passes.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Party Scandal Widens  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- The sum of secret campaign funds involved in the scandal
around Germany's Christian Democrats grew dramatically Thursday, after a state
party branch said it had diverted more than twice as much money than previously
known to Swiss bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The revelation by Roland Koch, governor of Hesse, focused the German
conservatives' scandal even more on the southern state and the money it sent
abroad -- apparently to avoid tougher German party finance laws in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch said at a news conference in Wiesbaden that the party had diverted more
than $9.5 million to Swiss bank accounts in 1983 -- more than twice the roughly
$4 million previously known.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1986 and 1997, Koch said $4.25 million was taken from the secret
accounts -- but where that money is now is not known, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, federal lawmakers decided Thursday that former Chancellor Helmut
Kohl won't be called anytime soon to testify before a parliamentary
investigating committee. The head of the committee even raised the possibility
Kohl may never get to testify about whether secret donations led to influence
peddling in his government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So long as Helmut Kohl isn't ready to reveal the origin of money that went
into secret accounts, we see no reason to hear him,'' Volker Neumann, the Social
Democrat lawmaker who chairs the parliament committee, told Phoenix television.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is quite possible that we will get at the information about who gave
(Kohl) the money from others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl has refused the demands of those within his own party to say who gave
the Christian Democrats up to $1 million in off-the-books money he has admitted
receiving. His pledge to remain silent on the issue has fueled suspicions the
secret donations were to buy favors during his 16 years in power that ended with
his election defeat in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christian Democrats criticized the decision not to call Kohl as one of
the committee's first witnesses, saying it proved the investigation was nothing
more than a partisan witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their aim is obvious -- to misuse the investigating committee as a
tribunal against the Christian Democrats,'' said Andreas Schmidt, the senior
Christian Democrat lawmaker on the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservatives had suggested Kohl and other senior members of his
government be called first to testify, and Kohl himself has demanded to be heard
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the committee approved a schedule of nine witnesses it will
call in the coming months, beginning March 16 with Horst Weyrauch, a former tax
adviser to the Christian Democrats and allegedly the key person overseeing
secret money flowing into the party under Kohl.
</P>
<P>
	   The Greens party, the junior partner in the governing coalition, called on
the Christian Democrats to take the issue into their own hands and move forward
with legal action against Kohl to compel him to reveal the names.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As long as they fail to do that, they hinder the clearing up,'' lawmakers
Hans-Christian Stroebele and Claudia Roth, both members of the investigating
committee, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, the Christian Democrats said they would not take any
legal steps to compel Kohl to name names, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
	   The parliament committee also added to its witness list several people
connected to the Leuna refinery privatization deal that has come under scrutiny
in the probe.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch, the governor of Hesse, said the new money transfers discovered in the
continuing investigation helped explain why so much more money was in the Swiss
bank accounts than previously known. Despite withdrawals that add up to more
than $10 million, there was still $8.5 million in the accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Social Democrat party in Hesse state said the new disclosures showed the
``mafiosi'' structure of the Christian Democrats.

<HEADLINE> State attorney continues grilling witness in land claim damages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -A federal government property appraiser's methods
came under scrutiny again during a second day of cross-examination Thursday as a
state attorney tried to convince jurors a $335 million valuation in the Cayuga
Indian Nation land claim was grossly inflated.
<P>
	   During his four days on the witness stand, Arvel M. Hale has testified that
the 64,015 acres New York illegally acquired from the Cayugas two centuries ago
has a present-day market value of $264.7 million. Additionally, the Cayugas
should receive $70.4 million for the use and occupancy of that land over 204
years, Hale has said.
</P>
<P>
	   Focusing on the data Hale collected from the late 1700s and early 1800s,
Assistant Attorney General David Roberts questioned the sample sizes Hale used
to derive the land's current fair-market value and his use of property outside
the claim area, which is located around the northern shore of Cayuga Lake in
Seneca and Cayuga counties.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale told jurors that more than 60 percent of the property he analyzed was
inside the claim area, although he admitted that some lots he looked at were as
far as 50 miles away.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts also said that Hale's approach did not account for improvements made
to the land to make it more cultivable, or buildings or structures that would
have increased property values.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the first hundred years, I did not consider those things," Hale said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn previously ruled that appraisers were not to
consider any private improvements, buildings or structures when determining the
land's value, although they could consider roads, utilities and other public
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't know one way or the other if any of these properties had
buildings?" Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale admitted he did not, but added that his analysis used only parcels of
20 acres or more because any structures would have minimal impact on the value
of a larger lot.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts also tried to show that Hale's appraisal was bloated because he
added value for infrastructure without deducting acreage for the space the
infrastructure took up.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Roberts turned his questioning to electronic and written
correspondences between Hale and federal attorneys. In those documents, Hale
used the word "summation" and referred to appraising tracts and parcels of land.
McCurn also directed that the claim area be appraised as one single tract.
</P>
<P>
	   "So what you are doing in your analysis is not appraising a single tract but
a summation of existing parcels, correct?" Roberts asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "No," Hale said, repeating that he had appraised the claim area as one
single tract even though the land is divided into nearly 5,700 separate parcels.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts also tried to suggest that Hale had breached accepted professional
standards by allowing the federal government's attorneys to dictate how the
appraisal would be conducted.
</P>
<P>
	   "Isn't it misleading to give an opinion because a lawyer told you?" Roberts
said before the judge could sustain an objection from the federal government's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts said he expected to finish his cross-examination of Hale Thursday or
Friday. Once Roberts is finished, Hale will be questioned again by federal
lawyers and will then likely face another round of queries from Roberts.
</P>
<P>
	   After Hale is finished, the state will begin presenting its witnesses,
including its own appraiser who has said the Cayugas should receive no more than
$46 million as compensation.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Wants Pinochet Med Report  </HEADLINE>
   By MARA D. BELLABY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Lawyers for Belgium said Thursday they need to see the
medical report declaring Gen. Augusto Pinochet unfit to stand trial before they
can decide whether they would contest any decision freeing the former Chilean
dictator.
</P>
<P>
	   High Court Justice Maurice Kay will rule Monday on whether to let Belgium
and six human rights groups challenge a British official's decision to keep the
medical report private.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the latest legal gambit in the more than 15 months of battling to
bring the 84-year-old former dictator to trial in Spain on human rights abuse
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet has been detained in Britain since October 1998, when he was
arrested on a Spanish warrant as he recuperated from back surgery in a London
hospital. Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland all want to extradite Pinochet,
contending some of their citizens were among those allegedly tortured after the
general seized power in Chile in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   But a recent independent medical report concluded that the ailing general
would be unable to participate in his defense. After that Home Secretary Jack
Straw, Britain's highest law enforcement official, said he is inclined to
release Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw has said he wanted to disclose the doctors' findings, but must respect
Pinochet's right to patient confidentiality. Belgium teamed up with six human
rights groups to demand permission to view the medical report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can Belgium say whether it agrees or disagrees?'' lawyer Presiley
Baxendale told the court. ``Belgium has not made up its mind. It has been unable
to do so because it has not been provided with the information.''
</P>
<P>
	   Spain, France and Switzerland have expressed misgivings at not seeing the
report, but are not participating in this latest legal challenge. Straw has said
that he will not issue a final ruling on Pinochet's fate until the challenge is
concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   If Kay grants Belgium and the human rights groups a formal hearing, it
likely would start next week. But if he rejects their arguments, the case
immediately reverts back to Straw.
</P>
<P>
	   In his arguments to Kay, Straw's lawyer, Jonathan Sumption, said his client
acted reasonably when balancing issues of medical confidentiality with the high
public interest in Pinochet's case.
</P>
<P>
	   Sumption said Straw disclosed the names of the four doctors who examined
Pinochet earlier this month, revealed the instructions they were given and
announced the essence of their conclusions that ``Pinochet is mentally unfit to
stand trial.'' Straw also agreed to consider more arguments from all the
involved parties before making a final ruling, Sumption said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet, who remains under house arrest in a rented mansion southwest of
London, has diabetes, wears a pacemaker and suffered two small strokes last
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   An official Chilean government report compiled after Pinochet relinquished
power concluded that 3,197 people either died or disappeared at the hands of his
secret police during his 17-year dictatorship.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed To Cut At Least 2,800 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Defense giant Lockheed Martin Corp. is eliminating at
least 2,800 jobs as it streamlines its troubled Aeronautical and Space
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The plans for a 2 percent reduction in a work force of 140,000 were
announced today and follow a series of disappointments and losses in those
sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said the cuts would generate $200 million in annual savings.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority of those savings will be achieved in the Aeronautical Systems
business, which would be consolidated into a single unit to be called Lockheed
Martin Aeronautics Co., headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and headed by Dain
Hancock, a Lockheed Martin executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the Space Systems business will establish a new Lockheed Martin
Space Systems Co. in Denver that will be led by Albert Smith, another executive
vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   "These actions are the direct result of our continuing drive to improve our
customer focus, flatten our management structure and enhance our financial
performance," said Vance Coffman, chairman and chief executive officer of
Lockheed Martin. "They will result in real savings and ensure greater
flexibility allowing us to successfully adapt to changing market conditions,
maintain the level of program execution our customers expect, while improving
our ability to react to new business opportunities."
</P>
<P>
	   Peter B. Teets, Lockheed's president and chief operating officer stepped
down last year, taking responsibility for disappointing financial results which
led the defense contractor to slash its earnings estimates for this year by more
than half.
</P>
<P>
	   James "Mickey" Blackwell also left as head of aeronautical systems, which
makes the F-16 jet fighter and was the poorest performer last year among
Lockheed's four core businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2,500 job cuts in the aeronautics division will come in approximately
equal measure from the company's three primary sites in Georgia, California and
Texas, the company said. Additional personnel reductions of 2,000 people
previously announced for the Marietta, Ga., facility, bring the total workforce
reduction to 4,500 in that sector.

	   Broader stock indicators were lower, having given up earlier gains. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 18.42 at 1,385.67, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 66.67 at 4,003.24, adding to Wednesday's 97-point decline.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the continued volatility of the market stemmed in part from
worries about the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting on interest rates. Next
week, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates in a bid to keep inflation at
bay as the nation's economy continues to grow at a rapid pace. Higher interest
rates can threaten corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Three separate quarter-point rate increases in 1999 have done little to slow
the economy's torrid growth. Today, the latest sign of unfettered expansion came
from the Commerce Department's report that showed orders to U.S. factories for
big-ticket manufactured goods surged in December.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the government will release the latest figures on the gross
domestic product and on the employment cost index. Analysts said many investors
began pulling money out of the market in advance of those reports, fearing that
they will suggest that sharply higher interest rates are needed to slow the
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a very high level of expectation built into the share prices of
many companies," said Richard Babson, president and chairman of the investment
advisory firm Babson-United Inc. in Watertown, Mass. "Those expectations can't
hold up if rates go up dramatically."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors also punished some companies for disappointing Wall Street this
week. Coca-Cola shares tumbled for a second session, losing 4 1/16 to trade at
59. The company Wednesday announced plans to cut 6,000 jobs, about one-fifth of
its work force.
</P>
<P>
	   Qualcomm, the Nasdaq's best-performing stock in 1999, fell 4 3/8 to 120 1/4.
The company said Wednesday it may see lower demand for its products in the
current quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell fell 2 3/8 to 38. Late Wednesday, the company said it will miss
analysts' profit and sales estimates this quarter due to parts shortages and
slower customer demand. Dell also cited Year 2000 computer concerns for the
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, however, Wall Street brokerages including Merrill Lynch and Chase
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist stepped in to defend the company, raising their
recommendations on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Other technology companies posted solid gains. Conexant, which will be added
to the S&AMP;P 500 after the close of trading Friday, rose 12 9/16 to 86 7/8.
Companies often get at least a short-term boost when they are added to an index,
as mutual fund managers who try to mirror an index's performance buy shares of
the newly added company.

<HEADLINE> Four Ecuadorean Colonels Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuadorean authorities have arrested four colonels and
12 lieutenant colonels and detained hundreds of other officers for their roles
in the uprising that led to President Jamil Mahuad's overthrow, authorities said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Telmo Sandoval, who ascended to armed forces commander in last week's
power shuffle, confirmed the arrests Thursday of colonels Lucio Gutierrez,
Fausto Cobo, Gustavo Lalama and Jorge Brito.
</P>
<P>
	   A Defense Ministry spokesman said 12 lieutenant colonels had also been
arrested and 300 junior officers were being detained in military barracks while
investigations continued. The 300 had not been charged.
</P>
<P>
	   The colonels and lieutenant colonels face between six to eight years in
prison if found guilty of charges ranging from insurrection to insubordination.
Sandoval said they would receive fair trials and assured ``full respect for
their physical safety.''
</P>
<P>
	   Together with hundreds of Indians, the four colonels led an insurrection of
young army officers last week to seize Congress and proclaim a new governing
junta to fight corruption and work to improve the lives of the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   The junta was composed of Gutierrez, Indian leader Antonio Vargas, and a
former Supreme Court president.
</P>
<P>
	   The military high command threw its support to the civilian-military
``Parliament of the People,'' with armed forces chief Gen. Carlos Mendoza taking
Gutierrez's spot on the ruling council.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad was forced to abandon power.
</P>
<P>
	   But the next day, under pressure from Washington and more than 20 regional
commanders who rejected the overthrow of civilian rule, Mendoza disbanded the
junta, turned over his post to Sandoval and ceded power to Vice President
Gustavo Noboa.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Noboa received the presidential sash in a ceremony in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez was arrested on Saturday when the rebellion was put down. The
other attempted coup leaders were taken into custody three days later by
military officials, family members and local newspapers said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Women's Rights Expand  </HEADLINE>
   By SARA EL-KHALILI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A new Egyptian law broadly expanding women's right to
divorce their husbands met immediate criticism Thursday from hardline Muslim
clergymen.
</P>
<P>
	   Women's groups, however, welcomed the legislation passed by Parliament late
Wednesday night as a restoration of their human rights, and the country's top
Muslim theologian said it was in line with Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite strong opposition in male-dominated and overwhelmingly Muslim Egypt,
the law passed the People's Assembly after legislators dropped an article that
would have given wives the right to travel abroad without their husbands'
permission.
</P>
<P>
	   The new legislation makes it much easier for women to obtain a divorce,
though the process remains more difficult for them than it is for men. Islamic
law permits men to divorce their wives anytime and without the approval of a
court or any other authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the old law, women who sought a divorce were left waiting for years
for the papers to come through. Courts would consult a husband whose wife sought
a divorce, and the law placed the burden of proof on women if they claimed they
had been physically or psychologically abused. In addition, divorce carries a
social stigma in Egypt, something that makes many families reluctant to help
their daughters seek divorce.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new law, a woman can ask for a divorce in court. The judge will
give her three months to try to reconcile with her husband, but if she doesn't
change her mind after that time she will be granted an immediate divorce.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Congratulations to women and to Egypt,'' said Hoda Badran, president of
the Alliance of Arab Women. The new law, she said, will make men ``respect the
marital relationship and know that a woman is not a slave.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, under the new law women who divorce their husbands must return
their dowries and relinquish all financial claims, including alimony. Child
support payments are not affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheik Yehya Ismail, a spokesman for a group of mostly radical Muslim
clergymen from Al-Azhar mosque, said the new legislation contradicts Islamic
laws and reduces the sanctity of religious marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The worst thing about the law is that it's called a personal status law.
The relationship between a husband and wife is a legitimate one and not a
personal one,'' Ismail said. He said the law ``threatened the stability of
society.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Sheik Mohammed Sayed Tantawi said he stood by the law. Tantawi is the
Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, the world's premier seat of Sunni Islam learning, and a
frequent target of Ismail's group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The law has been studied by al-Azhar committee of scholars. It doesn't
carry anything that is contradictory to Islam,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore claims more gay New York delegates; poll has vice president  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Seeking to boost his standing among an increasingly
politically active constituency, Al Gore boasted Thursday of having more openly
gay potential convention delegates in New York than Bill Bradley does.
<P>
	   The Gore camp said that while its slate of delegates for the state's March 7
presidential primary included 11 openly gay candidates, slates for the former
senator from New Jersey had just five openly gay people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign later ended up with some egg on its face when state party
officials said the Bradley campaign had reported having seven openly gay
prospective delegates, not five as Gore had claimed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Al Gore campaign continues to distort the facts in an attempt to win
the Democratic primary against Senator Bill Bradley at any cost - even the cost
of the truth," the Bradley campaign said in a statement that accused the Gore
campaign of "lies and distortions."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp noted that the former senator had proposed expanding the
1964 Civil Rights Act to include protections for gays and lesbians, a move Gore
has opposed.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a new statewide poll showed Gore ahead of Bradley among likely
Democratic New York primary voters. On the Republican side, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush had a 2-1 lead over his closest rival, Sen. John McCain, among likely GOP
primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore forces staged a news conference on the steps of City Hall in New
York City to boast about the number of openly gay delegates the vice president
was running in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here, as in so many other areas like hate crimes protections and
anti-discrimination legislation, Vice President Gore has shown a commitment to
lesbian and gay equality that Senator Bradley's record does not reflect," Thomas
Duane, a Manhattan Democrat and the only openly gay member of the state Senate,
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp continued to maintain that Bradley's proposal to replace
Medicaid with subsidies that would allow people to buy health insurance "could
put millions of New Yorkers, especially those living with AIDS, in jeopardy."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp reacted sharply, saying the Bradley health plan would
provide continued benefits for AIDS sufferers.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an outrageous and misleading attack from the Gore campaign,"
Bradley delegate contender Daniel O'Donnell, the openly gay brother of Rosie
O'Donnell, said.
</P>
<P>
	   An ethnicity delegate breakdown supplied by the campaigns to the state party
indicated that 25 percent of the vice president's proposed delegates were black
to 23 percent for Bradley. Hispanics made up 11 percent of Gore's delegate
slates to 9 percent for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   On the polling front, Manhattanville College's poll found Gore leading
Bradley, 48 percent to 34 percent, among likely Democratic primary voters. Among
likely Republican voters, Bush led McCain, 53 percent to 27 percent, with Steve
Forbes trailing at 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   A statewide poll out earlier this month from the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute had Gore at 44 percent to 39 percent for Bradley, a former star with
the New York Knicks basketball team. In that poll, Bush led McCain, 47 percent
to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Manhattanville poll, 43 percent of Democratic voters said they felt
Gore would wind up as the next president while one in three of them said Bush
would be the next to occupy the White House. Among likely Republican primary
voters, 68 percent said Bush would be the next president while just 10 percent
said Gore would win the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattanville College's telephone poll of 507 Democrats and 302 Republicans
was conducted Jan. 20-23. The margin of error for the Democratic sample is plus
or minus 4.5 percentage points and 6 percentage points for the Republican
sample.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court allows lawsuit from golfer injured by a 'mulligan'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Yelling "fore" while playing golf is not only a
courtesy, it may be a legal necessity if you are taking a second shot, known as
a "mulligan," and your golf partners are not aware of it.
<P>
	   Otherwise, you run the risk of a personal injury lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   So said a New Jersey appeals court on Wednesday, departing from standard
sports liability law to conclude that hitting a golf ball without warning is a
recklessly dangerous act.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was brought by a Livingston man, Jeffrey Schick, who was struck in
the face by a golf ball while playing at East Orange Golf Course in 1994. Schick
filed a lawsuit against John Ferolito of Short Hills claiming Ferolito's
mulligan shot was made without proper warning and that Schick could not have
been reasonably expected to foresee the danger.
</P>
<P>
	   This point about foreseeing the danger lies at the heart of court rulings
regarding sports injuries. Generally, if the risk of an injury is foreseeable,
the courts have dismissed lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Ferolito is one of the founders of the AriZona Ice Tea beverage company of
Lake Success, N.Y. Both he and Schick were new to the game of golf when the
accident occurred, according to Ferolito's lawyer, James DeMarzo.
</P>
<P>
	   "He felt terrible. There is no dispute that his ball hit the guy," DeMarzo
said. "But it is a different story when someone tries to sue."
</P>
<P>
	   The primary sports injury case in New Jersey came in 1994 when the state
Supreme Court ruled that a catcher in a softball game who was hurt during a
home-plate collision had no basis to sue because such collisions were a
foreseeable part of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   DeMarzo, who argued the 1994 case, said the key consideration is reckless
behavior, an act which is not only risky but is also entirely outside the
context of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   A clear example is in boxing, where the boxer must expect to be punched by
his opponent but cannot be reasonably expected to foresee a kick. Thus, there is
no basis to sue for any punching injury, but a kick injury might create
liability.
</P>
<P>
	   In his lawsuit, Schick claims he and the others in his foursome, including
Ferolito, had all taken their tee shots on the 16th hole when Schick moved
toward his golf cart to drive up toward the fairway. Schick claims Ferolito then
took a second shot - a mulligan - without telling anybody. The ball veered off
line and struck Schick in the face, breaking bones that required surgery to
repair.
</P>
<P>
	   These facts are in dispute. DeMarzo said Ferolito was not taking a mulligan
at all, and was hitting his first shot. He also said Schick could not have been
surprised. "Obviously he was looking at him. The ball could not hit you in the
face if you were not looking at him," DeMarzo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schick's lawyer, Richard Chisolm, did not return a phone message left at his
office.
</P>
<P>
	   But Wednesday's ruling concerned not the facts of the case, which a jury
must decide, but only a preliminary legal motion on whether the case should have
been accepted in the first place. A trial judge two years ago threw the case
out. Wednesday's ruling by a three-judge appellate panel reversed that decision
and said the case should proceed to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "We conclude that hitting an unannounced and unexpected mulligan from the
tee after all members of the foursome have teed off creates such an
unanticipated risk to the other members of the foursome, from which they cannot
protect themselves, that it cannot be considered an inherent or integral part of
the game," said Judge Leonard Arnold.

<HEADLINE> On eve of his sentencing, Patrick Bennett asks that judge be  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Claiming bias, former Syracuse businessman Patrick R.
Bennett wants the judge in his fraud case removed prior to his sentencing.
<P>
	   Bennett's attorney, Michael Pinnisi, claims that U.S. District Court Judge
John S. Martin showed bias when he suggested that Bennett plea bargain the case
before it went to trial last year. Pinnisi also argues that Martin showed bias
when he harshly rebuked Bennett after his conviction last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinnisi formally asked Martin last week to remove himself from the case.
Bennett was to ask a federal appeals court on Thursday to appoint another judge
to decide if Martin should be removed.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge has told Bennett that he will consider the motion to remove
himself, but that the sentencing will be Friday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett, 47, faces up to 30 years in prison for his role in cheating
thousands of investors out of $512 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin postponed sentencing from December to give Bennett more time to pay
$109 million the court ordered him to forfeit after the conviction. Bennett and
his family say they do not have the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett claims that during a meeting with defense lawyers and prosecutors
before the trial last summer Martin suggested a plea bargain. The judge
recommended that Bennett receive a 10-year sentence as part of the bargaining,
Pinnisi said.
</P>
<P>
	   The suggestion was inappropriate, Pinnisi contends, and Martin should
therefore remove himself from the case. After the trial and verdict, Martin told
Bennett he showed no respect for the law.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly, this trial showed that Patrick R. Bennett is a totally amoral
individual who engaged in any criminal conduct that benefits him," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also is scheduled to sentence three other men - including
Bennett's brother, Michael - who have pleaded guilty to helping Patrick Bennett
cover up the crimes at Bennett Funding Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett was chief financial officer of the family-owned business, which
financed office equipment rentals with money from investors and banks. Over the
course of two trials, juries convicted Bennett of 49 charges of securities
fraud, bank fraud, money laundering, lying and hindering an investigation of his
business. He has been in federal prison since June.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Bennett, 42, was the company's deputy chief executive officer. He
pleaded guilty in 1998 to charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and
perjury. He faces a maximum of 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Former company employees Anthony Menchella and Al Cerimeli pleaded guilty in
1996 to charges they conspired with Bennett to lie to investigators. They were
the first defendants to plead guilty in the case. Each faces a maximum of 10
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC began investigating the Bennett companies in 1993. Prosecutors said
Bennett asked others to lie and backdate documents to hide wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   The scheme collapsed in 1996 when the government brought criminal charges
against Bennett. The Bennett companies owed more than $1 billion and are now in
bankruptcy. Their operations are winding down and a trustee is gathering assets
to pay off 21,000 creditors.

<HEADLINE> Chase Privacy Pact May Prompt Trend  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An agreement by Chase Manhattan Corp. to seek permission
from its account holders before selling their names to outside marketers might
nudge other banks to offer similar privacy protections as a way to attract
customers.
</P>
<P>
	   But most big banks "aren't there yet" and may end up being compelled by
states to tighten their privacy policies, as Chase was, a consumer advocate said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The new settlement agreement between financial titan Chase and New York
state's attorney general "means that Chase can do it. And if Chase can do it,
that means other banks can do it," Frank Torres, legislative counsel for
Consumers Union, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, he added, most big banks remain strongly opposed to the type of
privacy restriction Chase has agreed to abide by -- the requirement that it must
have express written consent from account holders before it can sell or share
their data with outside marketers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, financial institutions are concerned about recent privacy
enforcement actions against banks by several states, as well as an initiative by
some states to enact new privacy laws that are stricter than federal
requirements established by Congress in November.
</P>
<P>
	   "The states are fully engaged," said John Byrne, senior counsel for the
American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Banks around the country are "taking stock of their privacy procedures," he
said. "Some banks will decide on their own to go beyond the mandated procedures
... if that's what their customers want to see."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the settlement accord announced Tuesday by Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer in Albany, N.Y., Chase agreed to stop providing outside marketers with
the credit line and balance information of customers. As many as 22 million
consumers had been affected.
</P>
<P>
	   In agreeing to the settlement, Manhattan-based Chase denied any wrongdoing.
State officials said they hadn't accused the bank of anything illegal, but they
promised to pursue similar enforcement actions against other financial
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Chase agreed not to share any customer data with outside marketers, such as
telemarketers, without customers' express written consent, a practice known as
"opt-in." Even in cases where customers do give their permission, Chase agreed
to provide only their names, addresses and telephone numbers to the marketing
firms, but not any financial data.
</P>
<P>
	   The "opt-in" is stricter than the "opt-out" privacy provision in the new
federal law, which allows banks and other financial institutions to share
customers' data with outside firms unless customers expressly ask them not to do
so.
</P>
<P>
	   The financial services industry had opposed even the "opt-out" requirement.
It won the right in the legislation for banks, securities firms and insurance
companies that are affiliated under the same corporate roof to share customers'
data without an "opt-out" or "opt-in."
</P>
<P>
	   The New York case arose from an investigation by Spitzer's office into
Chase's practices. The bank allegedly had provided customer information to
marketers in violation of its own privacy policy as disclosed to consumers. The
data it shared was said to have included encrypted account numbers and loan
data.
</P>
<P>
	   The marketing firms used the information to phone Chase customers to try
selling them emergency road service plans, discount shopping clubs, legal
services, travel clubs, garden supplies and magazine subscriptions. Chase
received a commission on successful sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The case "really demonstrates the need for legislation that protects
consumers from having their personal, sensitive financial information
distributed outside of the bank," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of
the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope other banks follow (Chase) but I'm not optimistic," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Schmermund, a spokesman for America's Community Bankers, suggested
that privacy policies could be "a very effective tool" for banks to market
themselves to consumers and retain customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything that banks do is based on customer trust," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Byrne said his group "would not want to see banks competing against one
another on the basis of privacy protections."
</P>
<P>
	   It would be "self-defeating" for banks to claim they had stricter privacy
policies than rival institutions, Byrne maintained. Attractive prices and a
variety of services should remain the basis for competition, he said.

<HEADLINE> Wiesel, Germany Mark Holocaust Day  </HEADLINE>
   By COLLEEN BARRY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- In a direct and emotional speech to parliament Thursday,
Nobel Peace laureate Elie Wiesel held Germans accountable for the murder of 6
million Jews -- including his 8-year-old sister.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiesel's words came on a day set aside to remember Holocaust victims, as
Germany dedicated the site of a Holocaust memorial planned as an eternal
reminder of Nazi evils. He emphasized that the Nazis were Germans -- and the
very mention of ``Germans'' once inspired darkest fears.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No nation, no ideology, no system has ever inflicted brutality, suffering
and humiliation on such a scale, on any people, as yours has on mine in such a
short period,'' Wiesel said.
</P>
<P>
	   With German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and other leaders sitting directly
in front of his podium, Wiesel repeatedly used the word ``you'' when he referred
to the perpetrators -- the German people -- who set out to annihilate Europe's
Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know it's difficult for you -- and painful to think in those terms,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The worst crime, he said, were the murders of Jewish children. His own
sister, he told lawmakers, was killed along with his mother at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was 8 years old, and believe me, she had done nothing to harm your
people. Why did she have to die such an atrocious death?''
</P>
<P>
	   However, Wiesel rejected the idea of collective guilt, and praised Germany
for its annual remembrance of Holocaust victims on the anniversary of liberation
55 years ago of the Auschwitz death camp, which he too survived. He also honored
postwar German democracies for ``valiantly and honorably trying to build a new
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has withdrawn from official life amid a
campaign financing scandal, was notably absent from commemorations, despite his
role as one of the Holocaust memorial's most ardent backers.
</P>
<P>
	   Just two blocks from the Reichstag building where Wiesel gave his speech
beneath its new glass dome, officials dedicated the plot for the memorial during
a brief ceremony intended to give impetus to the controversial project.
</P>
<P>
	   The ceremony was symbolic, with the unveiling of signs announcing that the
vacant plot as big as two football fields will be turned into Germany's first
memorial specifically for Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Work is not expected
to begin for another 18 months, and the project will take two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the project's most vocal critics, Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, refused to
attend the ceremony in protest. He has complained the design is too monumental
and the decision to locate the memorial in the heart of Berlin is an invitation
to vandals.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliament president Wolfgang Thierse, however, defended parliament's vote
last summer to approve a design by American architect Peter Eisenman. The
project will be a vast field of 2,700 close-set concrete slabs resembling stones
in a graveyard. Approval was contingent on the addition of a document center,
one of the details that has delayed original plans to break ground this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the right decision to build this memorial. We owe it to the victims
to demonstrate that we have not forgotten the suffering that the Germans caused
them,'' Thierse said. ``We owe it also to ourselves because the process of
coming to terms with 12 years of inhumanity, contempt for humankind and genocide
remain a part of our society.''
</P>
<P>
	   The memorial is just one of the ways Germany has sought to address concerns
that a new generation of Germans are less likely to remain conscious of Nazi
crimes. Former chancellor Kohl's administration inaugurated the national day of
Holocaust remembrance five years ago, and Schroeder's government recently
reached an agreement on a compensation fund for slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
	   But during his speech, Wiesel appealed for even a more potent gesture,
challenging President Johannes Rau to repeat on the floor of parliament his
apology for Nazi atrocities made to Auschwitz survivors in December.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why wouldn't you do it here, in the sprit of this solemn occasion?''
Wiesel asked. ``Why wouldn't the Bundestag let it be known to Germany and its
allies ... that you ask the Jewish people to forgive Germany for what the Third
Reich has done?''
</P>
<P>
	   Wiesel's appeal went unanswered.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fuel costs high in New York but emergency relief doesn't match  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - New York may have the most poor residents eligible for
federal low income fuel assistance. But it's getting a fraction of the money
other states are receiving in emergency grants announced this week by the
Clinton administration.
<P>
	   Some New York officials complained Thursday that the federal money isn't
nearly enough to help the state's poor with the soaring fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki had sought between $35 and $40 million in the emergency
aid. New York received $2.6 million instead.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are dumbfounded by this decision," Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said
Thursday. "It's hard to understand how the administration can say that this
would be any significant help."
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil prices have nearly doubled in some parts of the Northeast
recently.
</P>
<P>
	   A typical New York state family's home heating oil bill was about $360 last
January. This month, it is headed to $680. The price for home heating oil in New
York state rose from an average of 90 cents a gallon to as much as $1.70 a
gallon - mostly in the last two cold weeks, according to government and business
surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   A variety of factors have been blamed for the increase ranging from a brutal
European winter that has sapped U.S. supplies to a frozen Hudson River that has
added time to oil tankers trips.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human
Services, said the amounts of the emergency grants had been based on a formula
taking into account the coldness of the state's temperature and the costliness
of the heating costs. He said while those factors were bad in New York they were
not as bad as they were in other states.
</P>
<P>
	   Maine, for instance, received $10.3 million in aid with 83,478 eligible
low-income households. New York received about one-quarter of that but had more
than 1.4 million households eligible.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 11 states receiving the $44 million in total federal aid, Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut and New Jersey each received more
money than New York. All had far fewer eligible households. Rhode Island,
Pennsylvania, Alaska, Vermont and Delaware received less money than New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Kharfen also explained that New York already receives a hefty annual
allocation of Low Income Heating Assistance Program money, known as LIHEAP. In
the 2000 fiscal year New York received $136.3 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the largest of any state in the nation," Kharfen said.
</P>
<P>
	   That failed to placate New York lawmakers who said they were being
shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   "This administration has bungled the government's response to skyrocketing
fuel oil prices," Rep. John McHugh, R-Watertown, said.
</P>
<P>
	   McHugh and some other lawmakers, including New York's Democratic Sen.
Charles Schumer, are calling on the administration to dip into the nation's
strategic oil reserves to help offset the skyrocketing fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson opposes that but said Thursday he was
delaying the delivery of 5 million barrels of oil to the 580 million barrel
reserve in an attempt to stem oil price increases somewhat.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he is perplexed by the sudden, steep rise in oil prices, and
said the Energy Department has begun more closely monitoring the heating oil
market.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States consumes about 18 million barrels of oil a day, according
to the American Petroleum Institute.

<HEADLINE> Support Uncertain in Cuban Boy Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Support for legislation to impose American citizenship on
Elian Gonzalez appeared uncertain Thursday as relatives of the 6-year-old Cuban
refugee crisscrossed Capitol Hill pressing competing appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   A day after meeting with the Cuban boy in Miami Beach, his grandmothers
continued to lobby against the citizenship bill, insisting Elian be allowed to
return to his father in Cuba -- preferably in their company. They depicted Elian
as emotionally drained and not talkative at their session.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our grandson is a whole different boy. He has changed completely. We have
to save this boy as soon as possible,'' said Mariela Quintana, the paternal
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   But a delegation of the boy's Florida relatives also pressed their case,
urging support for the citizenship bill. ``He doesn't want to go back,'' said
Marisleysis Gonzalez, a cousin of Elian. ``I saw him approach his grandmothers
and had the opportunity to see his face, and it was still the face of fear.''
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers disagreed. ``We told him we wanted to bring him back to
Cuba. He nodded his head yes,'' Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leadership aides in both chambers said the level of support for the bill
seemed to have lessened now that members are back in town after their winter
recess.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department, meanwhile, warned that failure to return Elian to his
father in Cuba -- as the Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled --
might make it hard to get a U.S. child back if the situation were reversed.
</P>
<P>
	   With lawmakers gathering for Thursday's State of the Union address,
congressional leaders exhibited little enthusiasm for seeing the increasingly
acrimonious custody battle exploding into a full-fledged -- and time consuming
-- election-year floor debate.
</P>
<P>
	   On some issues, ``politicians need to step back,'' House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   After a meeting Thursday afternoon of GOP House members, Hastert would only
say ``there's a difference of opinion'' among Republicans about how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert, who is not a sponsor of the citizenship bill but supports it,
declined to predict its fate.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said it would not be rushed to the floor but would follow the usual
legislative course of being heard first by a committee, in this case the
immigration subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the chairman of that panel, has expressed
reservations about the bill. And Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, the senior
Democrat on that panel, is one of its most outspoken foes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am personally appalled. This is not a political matter, this is a family
matter,'' Jackson-Lee said Thursday after she met with the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Some lawmakers were lining up behind a less controversial bill that would
confer permanent residency on Elian rather than full citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Senate, there was strong Democratic opposition to the citizenship
bill and Republicans were divided, with Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a member of
the Foreign Relations Committee, waging a strong battle to keep the measure off
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
	   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a supporter of the bill who once vowed
to rush it to the Senate floor this week, is now undecided about a timetable,
his spokesman, John Czwartacki, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We just don't know right now. There is still a lot of talking going on.
He's taking the temperature of members,'' Czwartacki said. It could still come
up sometime next week, Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the citizenship bill have threatened to use delaying tactics,
including a filibuster, if necessary to block Senate consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, meanwhile, complained that a cell phone had been taken
away from them during Thursday's meeting in Miami Beach even as they were
talking to the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked who took the phone, a spokeswomen for the grandmothers, Rev. Joan
Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, said that nuns came into the
room and told them the cell phone was not permitted under an arrangement made
for ground rules for the meeting. Police officers then took the phone, she said.
She said the grandmothers did not consider that there was a no-phone agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell said that, barring any new developments in the custody case, the
grandmothers would return to Cuba on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Raquel Rodriquez, the maternal grandmother, said that the longer Elian is
forced to remain in Miami, ``the more he is going to suffer.'' Elian ``was very
shy,'' she said. She said they showed Elian a photo album of his family and
neighborhood in Cuba, and that he looked at it closely.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after talking to reporters, Rodriquez felt faint and was given
emergency care by congressional paramedics.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell, the spokeswoman, called the problem an aggravation of a heart
condition and ``just exhaustion,'' and that the event did not appear to be a
serious.

<HEADLINE> Dow Chemical 4Q Earnings Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Chemical Co. on Thursday reported that its
fourth-quarter operating earnings rose 36 percent, handily beating Wall Street
estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income was $267 million, or $1.19 a share, in the October-December
period, up from $144 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special items, fourth-quarter operating income totaled $334
million, or $1.49 a share, up from $245 million, or $1.10 a share, a year
earlier. A survey of analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted
operating income, excluding items, of $1.34 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter sales were $5.2 billion, up 17 percent from $4.44 billion in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In late afternoon, Dow Chemical's shares were trading at $119.06 1/4, down
$2.18 3/4, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow Chemical is buying Union Carbide in a $9.3 billion deal that would
create the world's second-largest chemical business behind DuPont Co. Dow
Chemical already is No. 2 to DuPont in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Stavropoulos, Dow Chemical's president and chief executive, said in a
statement that the company's increased earnings came despite a $480 million
surge in energy costs, which outpaced Dow Chemical's product price increases.
</P>
<P>
	   "Strong volume growth in all of our businesses played a key role, as did our
continuing focus on cost control," Stavropoulos said.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, net income was $1.33 billion, or $5.93 a share, up from
$1.3 billion, or $5.76 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special items, Dow Chemical earned $1.39 billion, or $6.23 per
share, up from $1.37 billion, or $6.07 per share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales totaled $18.93 billion in 1999, up 3 percent from $18.44 billion in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 4.97  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in another volatile session on Wall Street
today as investors looked ahead to next week's Federal Reserve meeting and
anticipated that an interest rate increase will be the first of several this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.97 points to close at 11,028.02. The
modest finish, the second in two days, belied a wild session in which the Dow
rose as much as 130 points and tumbled as much as 116.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also gave up early gains and closed lower.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 5.53 to 1,398.56, and the Nasdaq composite
index fell 30.43 to 4,039.48.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,592 down, 1,465 up and 479 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.114 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.110 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.02 to 517.02.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts could find no single catalyst for the selloff that put the brakes
on the market's latest attempt to rebuild from steep losses in recent session.
The Dow has fallen more than 6 percent from its Jan. 14 closing high of
11,722.98, and the Nasdaq has sliced 5 percent from its closing high of
4,235.40, set just last Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   But market watchers said the continued volatility stems in part from worries
about the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting on interest rates. Next week, the
Fed is expected to raise interest rates in a bid to keep inflation at bay as the
nation's economy continues to grow at a rapid pace. Higher interest rates can
threaten corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Three separate quarter-point rate increases in 1999 have done little to slow
the economy's torrid growth. Today, the latest sign of unfettered expansion came
from the Commerce Department's report that showed orders to U.S. factories for
big-ticket manufactured goods surged in December.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the government will release the latest figures on the gross
domestic product and on the employment cost index. Analysts said many investors
began pulling money out of the market in advance of those reports, fearing that
they will suggest that sharply higher interest rates are needed to slow the
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a very high level of expectation built into the share prices of
many companies," said Richard Babson, president and chairman of the investment
advisory firm Babson-United Inc. in Watertown, Mass. "Those expectations can't
hold up if rates go up dramatically."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors also punished some companies for disappointing Wall Street this
week. Coca-Cola shares tumbled for a second session. The company Wednesday
announced plans to eliminate 6,000 jobs, about one-fifth of its work force.
</P>
<P>
	   Qualcomm, the Nasdaq's best-performing stock in 1999, fell. The company said
Wednesday it may see lower demand for its products in the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell fell. Late Wednesday, the company said it will miss analysts' profit
and sales estimates this quarter due to parts shortages and slower customer
demand. Dell also cited Year 2000 computer concerns for the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, however, Wall Street brokerages including Merrill Lynch and Chase
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist stepped in to defend Dell, raising their recommendations on
the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St.
Louis, said the company's problems are likely to be short-lived and the stock
remains undervalued relative to many leading technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dell has underperformed the market for about eight months, and people
should see this as a buying opportunity," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other technology companies posted solid gains. Conexant, which will be added
to the S&AMP;P 500 after the close of trading Friday, rose sharply. Companies often
get at least a short-term boost when they are added to an index, as mutual fund
managers who try to mirror an index's performance buy shares of the newly added
company.

<HEADLINE> Adams: IRA Disarmament Unlikely Soon  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Warning that the Irish Republican Army is
unlikely to disarm soon, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams asked Protestant
politicians Thursday to be patient and not pull the plug on Northern Ireland's
power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
	   Adams, addressing supporters of his IRA-linked party, said it was extremely
difficult to persuade the outlawed group to disarm in support of the 1998 Good
Friday peace accord, but he ``will continue to try and bring this about.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last month Sinn Fein took up two posts in a new 12-member Cabinet -- long
the central goal of Northern Ireland's accord -- after the Cabinet's senior
Protestant member, Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, persuaded his own
party to drop demands for some IRA disarmament in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble's concession fueled widespread expectations that the IRA would
finally identify its hidden weapons dumps. But while the IRA has begun
negotiations with a Belfast-based disarmament commission, it has made no firm
disarmament promises.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission chairman, Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, is due to present
a progress report Monday to the British and Irish governments. Most observers
don't expect it to confirm the beginning of IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble has promised to resign from the coalition Cabinet unless the IRA
starts disarming by February. He has scheduled a Feb. 12 meeting of his party's
grassroots council to vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the accord anticipated the IRA would fully disarm by May, it had no
startup date. Adams said the Ulster Unionist demands made early gestures by the
IRA even less likely.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The IRA has shown its willingness to enhance the peace process through the
silence of its guns and through its engagement'' with the disarmament
commission, Adams said. ``Is this to be thrown back in their faces?''
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to the deal brokered by American mediator George Mitchell in
November that enabled the Cabinet to be formed, Adams said: ``Decommissioning by
February was never part of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``So there is a need for unionists to be patient and for people to have
faith,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   But one of Trimble's closest colleagues, Dermot Nesbitt, retorted that Sinn
Fein had led the Ulster Unionists to believe that speedy IRA disarmament would
follow the Cabinet's formation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've created the correct political environment, that's beyond doubt,''
said Nesbitt, a senior negotiator during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   In another significant development Thursday, the senior Roman Catholic in
the Cabinet broke with tradition to urge his community to support a reformed
police force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Throughout the history of Northern Ireland, no issue has divided us quite
like policing,'' said Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the pacifist Social
Democratic and Labor Party, Sinn Fein's larger rival for Catholic votes.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mallon said the British government's ambitious plans to reform the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, the province's overwhelmingly Protestant police force, must
have Catholic support to succeed.
</P>
<P>
	   The plans -- commissioned under the peace accord and published last year --
call for the force to be neutrally renamed the Police Service of Northern
Ireland. It also calls for the aggressive recruitment of Catholics, who today
constitute just 8 percent of the force.
</P>
<P>
	   In a challenge to Sinn Fein, Mallon said his party would be among civilians
overseeing the new force and encouraging young Catholics to join.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionally the IRA has tried to kill Catholic police recruits and
harassed their families. The outlawed group called a cease-fire in 1997 but
continues to encourage supporters to shun the force. Sinn Fein recently mounted
protests against Catholics who opened contact with police.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will not allow bullying or intimidation from any quarter to deter us,''
Mallon said.

<HEADLINE> World Economic Forum Opens in Davos  </HEADLINE>
    By GEIR MOULSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- An annual Alpine gathering of the world's
political and corporate elite kicked off Thursday with the hosts cautioning that
free trade must be people-friendly.
</P>
<P>
	   After two years in which the World Economic Forum has been overshadowed by
economic crises in Asia and beyond, "we are not confronted with any overwhelming
crisis," said Klaus Schwab, the organization's president, said at a low-key
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   But relief over global economic improvement was tempered by memories of
violent demonstrations against the World Trade Organization's Seattle meeting in
December, when city was rocked by protesters opposed to the WTO's free-trade
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state of the global economy is excellent," Swiss President Adolf Ogi
told delegates. "There is, however, a downside. This is nothing new, but it is
growing in importance. Massive discontent, sometimes veiled, sometimes not so
veiled, is all around us."
</P>
<P>
	   Preparations for this year's six-day gathering -- featuring 300 politicians
including U.S. President Bill Clinton, 1,200 business leaders and 400 prominent
academics and cultural figures -- have been marked by nervousness at the
prospect of protests by groups opposing globalization and power.
</P>
<P>
	   Although expressing concern at the backlash against "globalization," few of
the political leaders and chief executives here are suggesting any change.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexican ministers came out fighting against the Seattle protesters'
objections to free trade.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that the message that some people wanted to send from Seattle
was the wrong message," Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think really there is no serious substance to this," added the country's
Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria. "There is no other way. It is there -- we
have to live with it, we have to take advantage of it, we have to ride it and
profit from it.
</P>
<P>
	   Swiss authorities have banned a demonstration in Davos Saturday, when
Clinton will pay a quick visit. But organizers have vowed to go ahead anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   Many ordinary people "feel not exactly empowered," Ogi conceded. "Their
feelings have been in evidence in Seattle and, if we are honest with ourselves,
we all know that this is not the last we have heard of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers promise views from both sides, with WTO Director-General Mike
Moore and unionists including John Sweeney, president of the umbrella
organization of U.S. labor, the AFL-CIO, appearing at the forum Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Also scheduled to appear are British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Turkish counterpart Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn, on his way from Washington, D.C.,
promised to "speak to leaders of the technology industry on how to use knowledge
technology in combating poverty."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the technology titans present will be Bill Gates of Microsoft Corp.,
Michael Dell of Dell Computers Corp. and Steve Case of America Online
Inc.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanians Have U.S. Gripe  </HEADLINE>
   By MELISSA EDDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VITINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Lulzim Ukshini says he was hanging out with his
buddies in Sam's Pizzeria when a grenade exploded in a Serb store across town.
He also says the first he heard about the attack was when four U.S. peacekeepers
came looking for him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They started to beat me nonstop, telling me to admit that I did it,'' he
said. ``Then they pulled a knife out and threatened to cut me into pieces.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ukshini's story of mistreatment at the hands of American soldiers is being
echoed by other ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, who tell of beatings, inappropriate
body searches of women and daily harassment by U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations come at a time of heightened concern following the rape and
murder of an 11-year-old ethnic Albanian girl. U.S. Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi,
a weapons squad leader from Fort Bragg, N.C., was charged this month with murder
and indecent acts with a child in connection with her death.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethnic Albanians say the killing is not their only complaint against the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Their allegations have prompted an official Army investigation and threaten
a breakdown in trust between the U.S. peacekeepers and the citizens they were
sent to protect.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials declined to discuss specific allegations because many of the
complaints are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Army acknowledges it has a big problem with community relations in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are serious allegations that we do take seriously,'' Maj. Erik
Gunhus, a public affairs officer at Camp Bondsteel, told The Associated Press.
``We will investigate and if we find they are true, we will act accordingly. We
want to show that no one is above the law.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement issued Sunday, the Army said preliminary findings indicate
several U.S. soldiers may have been involved in misconduct, ``including improper
use of physical force and threats against Kosovar males and inappropriate
physical contact with Kosovar females.'' Gunhus confirmed several soldiers have
been transferred out of Vitina in connection with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Ukshini and other Vitina residents are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wouldn't complain to KFOR because it does no good,'' Ukshini said, using
the acronym for the NATO-led peacekeeping force that entered Kosovo in June
after a 78-day bombing campaign forced a halt to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every time we went to complain, they told us: 'It's not true. Our soldiers
don't behave like that,''' said Ramiz Hasani, 21, whose father, Xhauit, has been
detained by the Americans in the killing of a Macedonian policeman.
</P>
<P>
	   Hasani said American soldiers have entered his father's restaurant several
times in the past two months and harassed customers for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the allegations, Defense Secretary William Cohen said he cannot
comment on specific cases. But he said U.S. and NATO forces are doing police
work in Kosovo only because there are not yet enough civilian police available.
He emphasized the need for more police.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have long stated the position that the United States and our NATO
forces can carry out a military operation quite successfully, but they are not
for the most part -- there are some exceptions -- trained to carry out police
work,'' Cohen said. ``They are not trained for that, they are not competent
really to carry out police work, nor should they be doing it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Daut Xhemajli, president of the Vitina Municipal Board, says relations
between the Americans and ethnic Albanians in this farming town 45 miles
southeast of Pristina have become strained.
</P>
<P>
	   He blames the Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One night they randomly entered a bar and started shouting at the
customers, 'What are you going to burn next?' and 'Who are you going to kill
now?''' he said. ``They were treating all of the customers as criminals.''
</P>
<P>
	   Contributing to the problem, Xhemajli said, is the fact that civilians have
no avenue for lodging official complaints about the soldiers. ``There is no
facility or a civilian institution where citizens could file a complaint against
KFOR,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, many ethnic Albanians say they try to avoid contact with the
Americans. This is particularly true of women, who have complained of body
searches by male soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Zijavere Azizi, 24, said she was walking in the center of town with a friend
several weeks ago when four soldiers stopped the pair and started searching them
without explanation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the men grabbed my arm and another grabbed my friend and pushed him
against the concrete wall,'' she said. ``They took everything out of my pockets
and put their hands in my pockets, all of my pockets.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Normally, I don't allow somebody to touch me all over my body, but I
couldn't do anything,'' she added. Since then, Azizi said she has left her home
only when absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, who heads the U.S. troops in Kosovo, has met with
Vitina leaders to express American concern over the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are seeing more serious efforts ... to cooperate with the citizens,''
said Xhemajli. ``We've been asking for this for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
	   For Ukshini and other Vitina residents, it's a matter of restoring lost
trust.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When they entered (Kosovo), I respected them because I respect that
uniform,'' said Ukshini, a wiry 28-year-old. ``But they behaved in the most
inappropriate way.''

<HEADLINE> Wiesel, Germany Mark Holocaust Day  </HEADLINE>
   By COLLEEN BARRY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- In a direct and emotional speech to parliament Thursday,
Nobel Peace laureate Elie Wiesel held Germans accountable for the murder of 6
million Jews -- including his 8-year-old sister.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiesel evoked personal memories to confront Germans with their history on a
day set aside to remember Holocaust victims. Speaking before Germany dedicated
the site of a Holocaust memorial planned as an eternal reminder of Nazi evils,
he emphasized that the Nazis were Germans -- and the very mention of ``Germans''
once inspired darkest fears.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No nation, no ideology, no system has ever inflicted brutality, suffering
and humiliation on such a scale, on any people, as yours has on mine in such a
short period,'' Wiesel said.
</P>
<P>
	   With German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and other leaders sitting directly
in front of his podium, Wiesel repeatedly used the word ``you'' when he referred
to the perpetrators -- the German people -- who set out to annihilate Europe's
Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know it's difficult for you -- and painful to think in those terms,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The worst crime, he said, were the murders of Jewish children. His own
sister, he told lawmakers, was killed along with his mother at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was 8 years old, and believe me, she had done nothing to harm your
people. Why did she have to die such an atrocious death?''
</P>
<P>
	   However, Wiesel rejected the idea of collective guilt, and praised Germany
for its annual remembrance of Holocaust victims on the anniversary of liberation
55 years ago of the Auschwitz death camp, which he too survived. He also honored
postwar German democracies for ``valiantly and honorably trying to build a new
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has withdrawn from official life amid a
campaign financing scandal, was notably absent from commemorations, despite his
role as one of the Holocaust memorial's most ardent backers.
</P>
<P>
	   Just two blocks from the Reichstag building where Wiesel gave his speech
beneath its new glass dome, officials dedicated the plot for the memorial during
a brief ceremony intended to give impetus to the controversial project.
</P>
<P>
	   The ceremony was symbolic, with the unveiling of signs announcing that the
vacant plot as big as two football fields will be turned into Germany's first
memorial specifically for Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Work is not expected
to begin for another 18 months, and the project will take two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the project's most vocal critics, Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, refused to
attend the ceremony in protest. He has complained the design is too monumental
and the decision to locate the memorial in the heart of Berlin is an invitation
to vandals.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliament president Wolfgang Thierse, however, defended parliament's vote
last summer to approve a design by American architect Peter Eisenman. The
project will be a vast field of 2,700 close-set concrete slabs resembling stones
in a graveyard. Approval was contingent on the addition of a document center,
one of the details that has delayed original plans to break ground this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the right decision to build this memorial. We owe it to the victims
to demonstrate that we have not forgotten the suffering that the Germans caused
them,'' Thierse said. ``We owe it also to ourselves because the process of
coming to terms with 12 years of inhumanity, contempt for humankind and genocide
remain a part of our society.''
</P>
<P>
	   The memorial is just one of the ways Germany has sought to address concerns
that a new generation of Germans are less likely to remain conscious of Nazi
crimes. Former chancellor Kohl's administration inaugurated the national day of
Holocaust remembrance five years ago, and Schroeder's government recently
reached an agreement on a compensation fund for slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
	   But during his speech, Wiesel appealed for even a more potent gesture,
challenging President Johannes Rau to repeat on the floor of parliament his
apology for Nazi atrocities made to Auschwitz survivors in December.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why wouldn't you do it here, in the sprit of this solemn occasion?''
Wiesel asked. ``Why wouldn't the Bundestag let it be known to Germany and its
allies ... that you ask the Jewish people to forgive Germany for what the Third
Reich has done?''
</P>
<P>
	   Wiesel's appeal went unanswered.

	   Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 4.97
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in another volatile session on Wall
Street today as investors looked ahead to next week's Federal
Reserve meeting and anticipated that an interest rate increase will
be the first of several this year. The Dow Jones industrial average
fell 4.97 points to close at 11,028.02. The modest finish, the
second in two days, belied a wild session in which the Dow rose as
much as 130 points and tumbled as much as 116. Broader stock
indicators also gave up early gains and closed lower. The Nasdaq
composite index fell 30.43 to 4,039.48. Analysts could find no
single catalyst for the selloff. But market watchers said the
continued volatility stems in part from worries about the Federal
Reserve's upcoming meeting on interest rates.

	   Clinton To Seek $350B Tax Cut
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose a $350 billion
tax-cut package in his final State of the Union address tonight,
urging relief from the marriage penalty and a new program of
retirement savings accounts. The president also will propose big
tax breaks for education, including a tax deduction of up to
$10,000 for college tuition. Another proposal would offer a tax
deduction to encourage philanthropy. Details of his proposals were
released in advance of tonight's address before a joint session of

savings accounts for low-income families and increasing the
standard deduction for two-income couples to twice that of single
filers.

Wall Street came after the eToys reported that sales soared during
its fiscal third quarter, but its losses widened as it spent
heavily to fend off rival Web toy stores during the holiday season.
The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company lost $62.5 million, or 52

December, helping manufacturers to their best year since 1997. For
all of 1999, orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at
least three years -- rose 7.1 percent. The performance matched the
annual gain recorded two years ago and followed a 3.6 percent
increase in 1998, the Commerce Department said today. In another

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Squabble on Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush gained the endorsement of Jack Kemp,
a favorite of conservatives, on Thursday and said the Republican Party needs a
presidential nominee who can debate the Democrats, ``not mimic them.''
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested that Sen. John McCain's tax proposals are too like President
Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, said he'd devote a projected $1 trillion, 10-year budget
surplus bonus to paying off the national debt by 2013 instead of adding it to
the proposed tax cut that Bush says would be too little to protect against the
spending habits of Washington politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator also said he'd be a better debater against Vice
President Al Gore because ``Bush stands mute on campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's much easier for me to attack Clinton and Gore because I have the high
ground,'' said McCain, who is a strong advocate of campaign finance changes.
</P>
<P>
	   He holds the edge over Bush in polls of likely voters in the New Hampshire
presidential primary next Tuesday. But the Texas governor said he has a good
chance of winning and can withstand losing anyhow. Campaigning in Nashua, Bush
said he hopes New Hampshire Republicans will choose him as a candidate ``who can
win, who can unify the party.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think when the Republicans go into the booths in New Hampshire and
around the country, it's important to nominate somebody who will be able to
debate the Democratic nominee on key issues, not mimic them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said a McCain remark in the Wednesday night debate made his point.
``When he said his tax plan was similar to President Clinton's tax plan, it made
it real clear the difference of opinion on taxes,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   What McCain said was that Clinton had moved toward a plan like his, not the
other way around.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush aides said they were considering producing an ad off that exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning Thursday in Hampton Beach and Newington, McCain rolled his eyes
when told of Bush's comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's spinning like Bill Clinton,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush got a boost during the day when Kemp, the Republicans' 1996 vice
presidential nominee, endorsed him at a campaign event at a Nashua defense
technology plant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush is the one who can inspire the Congress, who can inspire the
nation,'' said Kemp, who endorsed Forbes in 1996 before the publisher dropped
out. He called Forbes a good friend and suggested that perhaps Bush should name
him treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   Kemp, a former New York congressman, is also a former presidential contender
as well as Bob Dole's running mate in the last election.
</P>
<P>
	   As for McCain, the Arizona senator gives few signs that he is very
encouraged by the polls in New Hampshire. But Wednesday night, full of energy
after the debate, he appeared for a moment to be looking beyond the Republican
race. ``We're going to beat Gore like a drum,'' he declared at a post-debate
party in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's town hall meeting Thursday at Yokun's Restaurant was packed. The
crowd spilled out into the halls, and people in the back of the stifling room
stood on chairs to see the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, McCain released a new television ad that will air in New
Hampshire through the primary. In it, McCain promises to return government ``to
whom it belongs, the people.'' The words ``Character,'' ``Courage'' and ``Ready
to Lead'' fade in over footage of McCain at town hall meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   There was more talk about abortion Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Good people can disagree on that issue,'' Bush said. The night before, he
had said in the debate that if he could write a constitutional amendment on
abortion, it would say that the rights of the unborn are protected by law.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes, who finished third to Bush and Forbes in Iowa, challenged McCain
in the debate for saying earlier in the day that it would be a family decision
should his teen-age daughter become pregnant and want an abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, campaigning at a school in Bedford on Thursday, said, ``No pro-life
Republican can support McCain with any kind of confidence. I'll tell you right
now pro-life people who support McCain are throwing away their votes on someone
who will betray us. He does not have this conviction in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Thursday, ``It's a little painful when your family is brought
up.'' But he said a candidate ``can't get angry'' about it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our party's going to have that debate,'' he said. ``As I said, good people
can disagree on that issue.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Capitol Violates Fire Laws  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Branded a firetrap more than a year ago, the U.S. Capitol
complex continues to violate fire safety laws and is jeopardizing the lives of
535 members of Congress, their staffs and thousands of daily visitors,
inspectors concluded Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a stinging rebuke to the Architect of the Capitol who maintains Congress'
buildings, congressional safety inpectors found ``the overall level of fire
safety to be far below that of most other American office buildings of similar
size and age.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hazards are ``not only a violation of federal law governing employee
health and safety, but also a potential threat to human life,'' the inspectors
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The congressional Office of Compliance, which reports on health and safety
violations, cited a lack of fire barriers, inadequate exit signs and exit
capacity, deficient emergency lighting, limited sprinkler coverage and dangerous
storage of flammable and toxic materials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although all of the buildings do not have all of these problems, there is
a regrettable consistency throughout the complex in the lack of proper testing
and maintenance of major electrical systems and of fire safety systems, such as
sprinklers, suppression systems and emergency generators,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Architect of the Capitol Alan M. Hantman responded to the findings by
insisting the ``U.S. Capitol and its associated buildings are a safe work
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is true that life safety systems need improvement. But Capitol Hill is
a safer place today that it was three years ago. It will be safer still in each
successive year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hantman said improvements ``cannot be accomplished overnight'' because of
many factors, ``including inconveniencing congressional operations and
appropriateness for these national treasures.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Office of Compliance enforces the Congressional Accountability Act,
which forces Congress to obey many of the health and safety laws enforced
elsewhere in the country. The office has issued numerous health and safety
citations to the architect.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Milhans, spokesman for the architect, said all the fixes to the fire
safety problems ``are either in the works or we've requested funding for the
fixes.'' He pointed out the architect's office has established a life safety
office and is ``staffing up to do what needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
	   In December 1998, the House inspector general reported the Capitol and five
House office buildings were firetraps that left visitors, members of Congress
and employees with an ``undue risk of loss of life and property.''
</P>
<P>
	   The safety report released Thursday found that fire barriers ``to prevent
the spread of fire, smoke and toxic gases were either totally absent or
inadequate'' in Capitol buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   This danger is ``most severe'' in the main Capitol building and the three
oldest congressional office buildings, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of these four buildings has a single exit stairwell that would be
effectively protected against smoke or toxic gases in the event of fire,'' the
inspectors reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The Capitol and other office buildings all have sprinklers ``in only very
limited areas,'' the study found.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem was compounded by installation of Omega sprinkler heads. Some
14,000 of the 30,000 installed were found to be defective, although the
manufacturer is replacing them under a settlement with the Consumer Product
Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The architect was ``totally lacking or deficient'' in conducting any
maintenance and testing program of the sprinklers, inspectors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said that in the Rayburn House Office Building, built in the
early 1960s, ``none of the eight stairwells ... have doors designed to withstand
the spread of smoke and fire.''
</P>
<P>
	   A number of exits involve revolving doors which ``can impede quick exit,''
they noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit signs are not visible in many locations, the compliance office found,
and some directed people ``away from the nearest exit.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report also found that compressed gas cylinders were improperly stored
in poorly ventilated basement areas in three buildings. While the cylinders were
removed, the report noted that citations were previously issued to the architect
for similar violations.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Ready To Drop the Gloves  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STRATHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bradley, struggling to balance his high-road
campaign themes with a need to overtake Al Gore, said Thursday he'd ``had it''
with his Democratic rival and pushed ahead with a new, more confrontational
style.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls suggesting Gore has been moving ahead just days before the New
Hampshire primary, Bradley indicated the accusations and sharp words he had for
the vice president in their debate on Wednesday were no one-night strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How you run a campaign is how you govern. That was the point I was making
and I waited a long time to make it,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Last night I decided I'd had it and I'm going to call my opponent on what
he's been doing,'' said Bradley. ``Making that point several times struck a
positive chord in a lot of people who had just been waiting essentially for him
to be called out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's camp said Bradley was showing desperation.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley, who accused Gore of campaign dishonesty, said he felt
comfortable and was getting a good response from voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, 76-year-old Sherry Taylor said, ``I think the fact that he showed a
little more vitality last night was good.'' She added, ``I felt better about him
and I was all set to go for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Bond Perry, a Bradley supporter, said he liked the
candidate's higher energy level but ``I didn't like what he did last night.
There was, like, desperation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, addressing employees of a high-tech firm in Manchester on Thursday,
said anew that Bradley was turning the campaign negative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't understand how someone can condemn negative attacks while in the
same breath can make negative attacks,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Bradley's contentions in the debate was that Gore had been
inconsistent on abortion rights, including voting as a member of Congress to
restrict abortion rights. And that idea was brought back to Gore on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   He was appearing on a New Hampshire public radio call-in show when a woman
who identified herself as Sara accused him of lying about his abortion record in
the debate. ``I don't know how I can support your candidacy if you're so
dishonest on national TV,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore replied, ``I have always supported Roe vs. Wade. I have always
supported keeping abortion legal. And it's true, early in my career I voted to
restrict the use of federal funding in some circumstances, but over the years
I've come to the view that federal funding ought to be available.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the tougher rhetoric, Bradley stepped up his schedule
Thursday and there was a new air of urgency surrounding his campaign entourage.
He opened the day at one frigid outdoor rally, collected the endorsement of
environmental activists at another and rotated through a series of town meetings
in a crowded campaign day.
</P>
<P>
	   Along the way, he stopped by grocery and convenience stores for chaotic
handshaking. At one stop he helped shoppers bag groceries. He bought donuts at
another.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pull it off, I'm with you,'' urged 74-year-old Ed Rein at one stop.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With your help I will,'' Bradley responded.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also stopped at Portsmouth High School, where he joined a junior
varsity girls basketball game, shooting baskets with youngsters and tossing up
the tip to open the game. Along with five students, Bradley played a shooting
game with his team winning 11 to 9.
</P>
<P>
	   His shift in campaign approach has been under discussion internally for
days, since Bradley was hammered in Iowa's leadoff caucuses. Surrogates such as
Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey have been battering Gore in public, arguing he's been
distorting Bradley's record, and have been pushing Bradley in private to become
more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
	   The risk for Bradley is to his core appeal as the nontraditional politician
who is above attack politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Even in the midst of the new approach, he said in response to a question
that he had occasionally elbowed other players in basketball but added:
</P>
<P>
	   ``Politics is different. Politics should be something that's higher.
Politics should be something that elevates us.''
</P>
<P>
	   He is also running a new batch of positive television commercials in the
state, including one out Thursday that quotes from a trio of newspaper
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore aides dismissed the tactical shift as the last gasp of a campaign in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's clearly listening to his consultants,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane. ``His music wasn't playing. This undermines the central presence of his
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Numerous polls have shown Gore with at least a slight lead in New Hampshire,
which holds the first primaries of the 2000 election year on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said Gore consistently misrepresents his health plan by arguing that
Bradley would eliminate Medicaid and replace it with $150-a-month vouchers.
Bradley said he's told Gore repeatedly that's not the case. Bradley also said
Gore argues -- wrongly -- that the Bradley health plan would fritter away the
budget surplus.

<HEADLINE> Governor says he'll meet with Pratt bosses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Gov. John G. Rowland said Thursday he wants to
meet with Pratt &AMP; Whitney officials to discuss the jet engine company's latest
plan to cut 1,500 Connecticut jobs and move work out of state.
<P>
	   "It's a legitimate question to ask why these jobs are leaving Connecticut,"
Rowland said after meeting with leaders from the Machinists Union, which
represents Pratt workers. "I really want to flesh out what the reasons are for
reductions and what we can do to keep the jobs here."
</P>
<P>
	   If positions can't be saved, Rowland said he would like workers to be
retrained for other jobs in the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt officials said they're willing to meet with Rowland. The governor said
he may meet with company bosses within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt announced last week that they're cutting 1,700 jobs - 1,500 are which
are in the company's East Hartford, North Haven and Middletown plants. About 200
of those jobs are non-union salaried positions. The remaining cuts will likely
be in Georgia and Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   About 400 of the Connecticut union jobs will be moved overseas, according to
company and union officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The cuts announced last week are in addition to the approximately 3,500 jobs
the company has been eliminating since it started a major restructuring and
consolidation effort in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're willing to work with the company to keep jobs in Connecticut," said
James Parent, a union spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Parent also wants Connecticut's congressional delegation to help.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've worked hard in assuring Pratt &AMP; Whitney gets contracts that make
the company profitable," he said. "Now it's time to step up to the plate and do
what they can to try to save jobs in Connecticut."
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt spokesman Mark Sullivan said a huge drop-off in jet engine sales
during the past three years is the major reason for the downsizing. The company
will deliver less than 600 engines in 2000, compared to 800 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The work going to countries such as Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Israel is a
result of agreements company has with those countries, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
	   "More than half our sales are overseas," Sullivan said. "But before we can
even bid in those countries, it's required that we set these agreements up."
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a United Technologies Co. division, designs, manufactures
and services jet engines, space propulsion systems and industrial gas turbines.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt employs 31,000 people worldwide and about 13,000 in the state of
Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Seton Hall grieves for fire victims at memorial service  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Seton Hall University's president on Thursday
told thousands mourning three students killed in a dormitory fire to turn to God
to get through a period in school history he called "the saddest story of them
all."
<P>
	   Wearing ribbons in the university's blue-and-white colors, holding hands and
singing psalms, the school's students, families and priests remembered the
18-year-old freshmen who died a few months into their college careers.
</P>
<P>
	   Monsignor Robert Sheeran, president of the Roman Catholic university,
repeatedly invoked the names of Frank S. Caltabilota Jr. of West Long Branch,
John Giunta of Vineland and Aaron Karol of Green Brook, who died in the predawn
fire last Wednesday. Sixty-two were injured, including four students who
remained critically burned.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frank and John and Aaron, we will miss you terribly," Sheeran said. "May
our prayers guide you on your journey to the Lord ... and may you enter God's
heavenly Jerusalem where there will be no more darkness or weeping and no more
tears."
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 19 fire in a third-floor lounge at Boland Hall threw the
9,200-student campus into mourning and many raised questions about the
university's fire safety. Five freshmen have dropped out of school because of
the fire and university officials have said they are considering new measures
like sprinklers in all dormitories and enhanced fire drills.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't go through something like this without introspection," Seton Hall
spokeswoman Lisa Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Thursday, some students hoped the service would help them get back to
normal after an emotionally exhausting week.
</P>
<P>
	   "It maybe puts some closure on everything," said Steven Babula, 19, a
freshman from Montville. "From here, we go on."
</P>
<P>
	   Classes resumed Wednesday at the school and all students but those on three
floors of Boland's north side had moved back in.
</P>
<P>
	   At a service attended by U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, congressmen and five
Roman Catholic bishops, Archbishop Theodore McCarrick told mourners they had to
trust in God to make sense of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do not always have the answers," said McCarrick, "but we believe that
our Father in heaven loves us, that he wills only good for us, even when from
time to time he may permit even tragedy in this life so that we may remember
that the real life is the one we will share with him, the one that is eternal,
the one in which there is no pain."
</P>
<P>
	   Sheeran recalled when the freshmen were given blank diaries to record their
college stories upon arrival on campus last fall. Of all the stories in Seton
Hall's history, he said, "this looks like the saddest story of them all."
</P>
<P>
	   Of the victims, Sheeran said, "just as we were getting to know them, they
were snatched away.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want so much to call them back, to tell them what they meant to us, to
tell them how much we love them."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. James M. Cafone, an assistant professor of religious studies,
quoted from Caltabilota's application essay, where he said he would rather be
the basketball player who makes an assist rather than scores because that would
make two people happy.
</P>
<P>
	   He quoted a father of one of the victims as saying at his son's wake, "I
don't blame God for wanting my boy to be with him."
</P>
<P>
	   Another student said at a hospital that 21-year-old Dana Christmas, a
resident assistant with critical burns, taught her how to pray, Cafone said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although some students tearfully embraced after the service, the memorial
was far more subdued than the three funerals Monday for the victims in their
hometowns. Many in the audience remained dry-eyed, staring blankly during
prayers. Other stood, held hands and prayed together.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been in total fear, shock, disbelief, sorrow and numbness," Student
Government Association President Bryan Schroeder said. "At the same time, we
have found relief, hope, friendship and love in this community."

<HEADLINE> Witness in 1973 murder claims police terrorized him into lying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A key witness in a 1973 murder trial testified
Thursday that a police detective used a variety of tactics to terrorize him into
lying on the stand, once by spinning the barrel of his gun as they sat in a jail
cell.
<P>
	   Wayne Wright was one of two teen-age runaways whose testimony helped result
in the convictions of two prostitutes for the murder of Timothy Haworth, 52, a
Philadelphia businessman who was battered and strangled in a Rochester alley on
May 25, 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   At the retrial of John Duval, whose conviction was overturned last spring
after he'd spent 25 years in prison, Wright maintained that chief detective
William Mahoney had beaten him in custody and threatened to charge him with
murder if he didn't testify against Duval.
</P>
<P>
	   On one occasion, a day before he was to appear in court, Wright said the
detective nudged him awake in a jail cell and pulled out his revolver.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was just sitting there spinning the barrel of his revolver" and asking
if "you know what you're going to say" on the stand, Wright recounted.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got up on the stand and regurgitated what they (police) fed into me," he
added during cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval and fellow prostitute Betty Tyson got 25 years to life imprisonment.
In the absence of physical evidence, they were convicted of murder on the basis
of confessions they insist were beaten out of them by Mahoney, and on the
testimony of the two teens.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Joe Curran pointed out that Wright took an oath at trial in which
he "swore to tell the truth." He also denied in his testimony that he'd been
beaten or threatened by police, Curran noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright spent seven months in jail as a material witness. After the trial, he
ran up a string of convictions for prostitution and robbery in California. He
began rebuilding his life here in the mid-1980s and retracted his testimony in
late 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The convictions were overturned a few months later after prosecutors came
upon a buried synopsis of a police interview with the other teen, Jon Jackson,
in which he denied seeing Duval or Tyson with the victim - contrary to what the
teens had testified at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahoney, investigated at least 10 times for allegedly abusing suspects,
resigned in 1980 after he was convicted of fabricating evidence in an unrelated
case. He died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors decided not to retry Tyson - the city gave her $1.2 million in
compensation - but went after Duval again. While Tyson had steadfastly
maintained her innocence, Duval had twice admitted his guilt before a parole
board. He says he lied because he didn't think he would be freed until he
admitted guilt.

<HEADLINE> Leader: Coup Plotters Have No Affect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Defense Minister Raul Salazar assured Venezuelans
the decision to reinstate soldiers who participated in two coups will not affect
military discipline in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
	   The estimated 250 former coup plotters will be taken before a disciplinary
council if they do not ``adjust to the established order of their respective
force,'' Salazar said in comments published Thursday by the El Universal
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers decreed Tuesday the coup participants could rejoin the military at
their previous rank, saying the coup attempts were ``legitimized'' by the
election of President Hugo Chavez a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Dad Makes Accusations  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father told U.S. immigration officials that
his Miami relatives offered him millions of dollars, a house and a car to join
the 6-year-old boy in the United States, according to court papers filed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I could go there with all my family and would be taken care and could have
a job if I wanted to work, but with the money offered I would not need to do
so,'' the father said. ``That's when I hung up the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government filed the papers in response to a lawsuit filed by the
boy's Miami relatives, who are challenging an order that Elian be sent back to
live with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   In its 400-page response, the government argued that the federal courts have
no right to intervene and that allowing Elian to stay would undermine efforts to
get other countries to return abducted American children.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said a victory for the Miami relatives would ``ignore
accepted international practice in cases involving a sole surviving parent
located in the United States, where we would expect the foreign country to
immediately return the child to the surviving American parent.''
</P>
<P>
	   The next hearing in the case is set for the week of March 6.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute over Elian's fate began two months ago, after he was found
clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic. His mother and 10 other people
fleeing Cuba for Florida died after their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's Cuban grandmothers have been in the United States for the past
week to appeal for his return. They had a tearful, tense reunion with the boy in
Florida on Wednesday, and on Thursday they renewed their efforts on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   The court papers reflect some of the dominant themes of the debate: The
families in Cuba and Florida each say the other side is lying and being
manipulated by political forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez, a great-uncle who has temporary custody of the boy in
Miami, told immigration officials that he spoke to Elian's father by telephone
two or three days before the boy was even found. Lazaro Gonzalez said Elian's
father asked him to protect Elian ``by whatever means available'' but eventually
changed his tune and asked for Elian to come back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all think he's under pressure from the government, because of his
change in sentiment, and I'm amazed about this,'' Lazaro Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was interviewed by Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials in Havana on Dec. 13 and 31.
</P>
<P>
	   In those interviews, the boy's father said his relatives in Miami offered
him $2 million, a house and a car if he would join his son in the United States.
He also said a church had offered $4 million to Elian so he would be set for
life. He did not specify which church made the offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Never did we offer him money,'' she said. ``We would never buy our family.
We would never buy anybody because we are the type of family that believes money
can't buy people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Silma Dimmel, the INS official who conducted the interview, said in a
statement that Elian's father ``did not appear at all nervous or intimidated,''
and ``based on his demeanor, I had no reason to believe he was being coerced.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father checked ``No'' on a questionnaire asking him whether he
wanted the boy to stay in the United States, whether he was being coerced and
whether he had ever requested a visa to travel to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the court papers, INS officials asked these questions in
written form in case the room was bugged.
</P>
<P>
	   In his account, Elian's father claims that his ex-wife, Elisabeth Brotons,
took the boy out of Cuba without telling him. After the boy turned up in the
United States, ``at all times I asked that Elian be returned to me,'' his father
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father also complained that the relatives in Miami had interfered
with his attempts to speak with his son on the phone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we call and Elian starts saying, `Grandma I want to be with you' or
`Daddy I want to go with you,' they immediately make him cry, or give him a
candy or start tapping on the lines saying that the lines are getting bad and
hang up the phone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marisleysis Gonzalez told the INS that the boy's father was being pressured.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His tone of voice is different, like people telling him what to say,'' she
said. ``The phone sounds like it's being tapped.''

<HEADLINE> Crude, Heating Oil Prices Fall  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Crude oil futures slipped 2 percent Thursday after Mexico's oil minister
left open the possibility that world producers could decide to increase output
when their current agreement expires in nine weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil prices also backed off from their sizzling rally, falling 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, soybeans soared to four-month highs and orange juice
dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   The recent runup in crude prices is based largely on assumptions the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers will
extend the 11-month-old pact on lowered production levels when it runs out in
March.
</P>
<P>
	   But a final decision won't be made until OPEC's March meeting, and Mexican
Oil Minister Luis Tellez said Thursday it's too early to say what the outcome
will be.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he also said oil
markets have "stabilized" and prices will fall to more normal levels -- a
suggestion, analysts said, that producers could ease their squeeze on supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our diplomatic and coordination efforts with other countries are to
maintain stable markets and prices," Tellez said. "We are not in favor of having
prolonged high prices that would harm the world economy."
</P>
<P>
	   West Texas intermediate crude for March delivery fell 52 cents to $27.32 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil declined on signs that the worst of the tightness in that market
may be over.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasts called for milder weather that should ease demand next week in the
U.S. Northeast, the world's largest heating-oil market, while traders said
shrunken U.S. inventories are about to get a boost with additional imports.
</P>
<P>
	   February heating oil fell .96 cent to 91.17 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   In other energy commodities, February unleaded gasoline fell .84 cent to
74.15 cents a gallon, February natural gas rose 8.7 cents to $2.61 per 1,000
cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   March Brent crude fell 51 cents to $25.62 a barrel on London's International
Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   After declining initially, soybeans rocketed to their highest level since
September on the Chicago Board of Trade on forecasts calling for hot, dry
weather in key growing areas of Brazil and Argentina this weekend and early next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong advances in soymeal and soyoil underpinned the rally, which pulled
grain prices higher as well. March soybeans rose 13 3/4 cents a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures dove more than 2 percent after the
Florida orange crop emerged unharmed from a cold front in the area. Temperatures
dipped into the 30s in several citrus groves but didn't fall low enough to do
real damage.
</P>
<P>
	   March orange juice finished down 1.90 cents at 81.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Governor says he'll meet with Pratt bosses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Gov. John G. Rowland said Thursday he wants to
meet with Pratt &AMP; Whitney officials to discuss the jet engine company's latest
plan to cut 1,500 Connecticut jobs and move work out of state.
<P>
	   "It's a legitimate question to ask why these jobs are leaving Connecticut,"
Rowland said after meeting with leaders from the Machinists Union, which
represents Pratt workers. "I really want to flesh out what the reasons are for
reductions and what we can do to keep the jobs here."
</P>
<P>
	   If positions can't be saved, Rowland said he would like workers to be
retrained for other jobs in the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt officials said they're willing to meet with Rowland. The governor said
he may meet with company bosses within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt announced last week that they're cutting 1,700 jobs - 1,500 are which
are in the company's East Hartford, North Haven and Middletown plants. About 200
of those jobs are non-union salaried positions. The remaining cuts will likely
be in Georgia and Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   About 400 of the Connecticut union jobs will be moved overseas, according to
company and union officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The cuts announced last week are in addition to the approximately 3,500 jobs
the company has been eliminating since it started a major restructuring and
consolidation effort in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're willing to work with the company to keep jobs in Connecticut," said
James Parent, a union spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Parent also wants Connecticut's congressional delegation to help.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've worked hard in assuring Pratt &AMP; Whitney gets contracts that make
the company profitable," he said. "Now it's time to step up to the plate and do
what they can to try to save jobs in Connecticut."
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt spokesman Mark Sullivan said a huge drop-off in jet engine sales
during the past three years is the major reason for the downsizing. The company
will deliver less than 600 engines in 2000, compared to 800 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The work going to countries such as Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Israel is a
result of agreements company has with those countries, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
	   "More than half our sales are overseas," Sullivan said. "But before we can
even bid in those countries, it's required that we set these agreements up."
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a United Technologies Co. division, designs, manufactures
and services jet engines, space propulsion systems and industrial gas turbines.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt employs 31,000 people worldwide and about 13,000 in the state of
Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Elite Group: Don't Forget the Masses  </HEADLINE>
   By GEIR MOULSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- An annual Alpine gathering of the world's
political and corporate elite kicked off Thursday with a people-friendly message
from the Swiss hosts: don't forget the masses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The state of the global economy is excellent,'' Swiss President Adolf Ogi
told delegates at a low-key opening ceremony of the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is, however, a downside,'' he added. ``Massive discontent, sometimes
veiled, sometimes not so veiled, is all around us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Preparations for the six-day gathering -- whose guests include President
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair -- have been marked by nervousness
at the prospect of protests by groups opposing globalization.
</P>
<P>
	   There are fresh memories of violent demonstrations against the World Trade
Organization's meeting in December, where protesters opposed to the WTO's
free-trade philosophy paralyzed downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   Klaus Schwab, president of the WTO, expressed concern at the backlash
against ``globalization.'' Yet few of the political leaders and chief executives
are suggesting a change of course.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not confronted with any overwhelming crisis'' after two years in
which the WTO has been overshadowed by economic crises in Asia and beyond,
Schwab said. ``We feel secure here in Davos.''
</P>
<P>
	   Just in case, though, Swiss authorities have banned a demonstration in Davos
on Saturday, when Clinton will pay a brief visit. Protest organizers have vowed
to go ahead anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   Although security at the conference remains discreet, the Swiss army has
been dispatched for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexican ministers came out fighting against the Seattle protesters'
objections to free trade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that the message that some people wanted to send from Seattle
was the wrong message,'' Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   However many ordinary people ``feel not exactly empowered,'' Ogi conceded.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers promise to air views from top labor as well as business leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology titans attending the conference include Microsoft's Bill
Gates, Michael Dell of Dell Computers and Steve Case, a kingpin of the recent
America Online merger with Time-Warner.

<HEADLINE> Justices No-Show At Clinton Speech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's the Supreme Court's latest unanimous decision -- a
no-show at President Clinton's State of the Union speech Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court officials told the House sergeant of arms earlier in the day
that none of the court's nine members would attend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Justices of the court had planned to attend the State of the Union address
but travel changes and minor illnesses have intervened,'' a brief note said.
``No justices will be in attendance but they do thank you for the invitation.''
</P>
<P>
	   At least some Supreme Court members, wearing their robes, have represented
the federal government's third branch at every State of the Union address in
recent memory except 1986, when President Ronald Reagan's speech was rescheduled
because of the explosion of the Challenger shuttle.
</P>
<P>
	   The absences of Clinton's two appointees to the nation's highest court --
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- are health-related. Court
spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Breyer has the flu and Ginsburg is ``coping with
side-effects of radiation therapy.'' The justice had colon cancer surgery in
September.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Clarence Thomas was in New Orleans following the death Sunday of his
younger brother, Meyers. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was believed to be traveling
Thursday to New York City, where he was scheduled to speak Friday at St. John's
University.
</P>
<P>
	   As of Thursday afternoon, at least three of the court's members -- Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David H.
Souter -- were at work in their offices across the street from the speech's
venue, the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice John Paul Stevens, often at his Florida condo when the court is in
recess, was believed to be at his suburban Washington home, where his wife is
recovering from recent hip surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Inquiries into the whereabouts of Justice Antonin Scalia went unanswered
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was also staying away. By tradition, one
member of the president's cabinet is instructed not to attend in the event of a
catastrophe at the Capitol.

<HEADLINE> Report: Fewer Law Officers Slain  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sixty-one law enforcement officers were murdered on duty
in the United States during 1998, a decline of almost 13 percent from the
previous year, the FBI reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Releasing final figures for 1998, the FBI said nine fewer officers were
slain at work that year than the 70 killed in 1997. The drop is consistent with
a nationwide decline in all types of crime since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Firearms continued to be the most frequent weapon for killing officers.
Handguns accounted for 40 of the murders in 1998, rifles for 17 and a shotgun
for one. The other three were attributed to a vehicle, a blunt instrument and a
bomb.
</P>
<P>
	   Arrest situations produced 16 of the murders: seven officers on drug-related
investigations, six serving arrest warrants and three attempting to prevent
robberies or catch robbers. Sixteen officers were killed while answering
disturbance calls.
</P>
<P>
	   An additional 10 murders were ambushes, nine came while enforcing traffic
laws, six while investigating suspicious persons or circumstances and four while
guarding prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   Southern states had the largest number of murders, 29, followed by Western
states with 14, Midwestern states with 10, Northeastern states with three and
Puerto Rico with five.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-four of the officers were wearing body armor when they died. Six were
slain with their own weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The 61 murders occurred in 55 separate incidents, and arrests have been made
in 51 of them. Five suspects remain at large.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, accidental deaths of officers on duty rose by 16, from 62 in
1997 to 78 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Analysts: Coke Stil Good Investment  </HEADLINE>
    By CHAD ROEDEMEIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- While investor uncertainty continued to hit the stock of
Coca-Cola Co. hard Thursday, some analysts are saying that the company remains a
good choice for people who invest for the long term.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke has suffered through three tough years and Wednesday said it was
eliminating 6,000 jobs -- more than one-fifth of its work force.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke shares fell $3.56 Thursday to $59.50 on the New York Stock Exchange,
putting its loss for the past two days at nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Phil Larkins, who manages money for wealthy clients at Atlanta-based
Legacy South, said none of his clients have called him about getting rid of
their Coke holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given the premier global distribution network they have, and given the fact
that it's the No. 1 recognized brand name in the world, it still has a certain
comfort level for long-term investors," Larkins said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Douglas Lane, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in New York, said
he is encouraging investors to buy Coke stock now -- not only for its long-term
potential, but because he expects Coke to bounce back soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Lane said the job cuts put Coca-Cola back on course after nearly two years
of falling profits and image problems. He expects a more efficient Coca-Cola to
resume its strong growth toward the end of this year and into 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not the time to be looking in the rear-view mirror at Coke," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But there is still some uncertainty at Big Red. Incoming CEO Doug Daft
indicated that long-term growth goals have been too ambitious, and the company
will not give details on its new strategic plan for another six months.
</P>
<P>
	   Without some further clarity from the company, short-term investors are
likely to stay away, analysts said. That could come as early as Friday, when
Coke executives travel to New York for a briefing for analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   The company suffered a string of setbacks during the last 18 months,
including a severe economic downturn in Asian markets, a discrimination lawsuit
filed by a group of minority employees and a costly product recall and two
failed takeover bids in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest job cutback in Coke's 113-year-history, announced Wednesday,
will affect 2,500 positions at the company's Atlanta headquarters, 800 elsewhere
in the United States and 2,700 outside the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The reorganization is aimed at reducing control from Atlanta and giving more
power to managers around the world. Some stock analysts said the job cuts were a
tacit admission by Coke that it had become bloated and overinvested in some
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke estimated that the job cuts will save $300 million a year, but said
earnings would be reduced by $800 million before taxes this year to the cover
costs of the realignment.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Swanson, an analyst for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, said the job cuts
will let the company react more efficiently to changes in the global economy. He
said its stock price will improve as the economy improves in other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their bottom line performance is very tied to the global economy," Swanson
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The move may have been good for investors, but it hit employees hard.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's very low morale and a lot of questions," Coke employee Camille
Martin said Thursday outside the company's gated compound. "There's a lot of
fixing up this company has to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Martin voluntarily turned in her resignation notice two months ago, but
said her co-workers in the accounting department will not find out who loses
their jobs for another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Coca-Cola is one of Atlanta's most prominent companies, the job
cuts should not hurt the booming local economy, said Don Ratajczak, director of
economic forecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "How significant is this layoff to Atlanta's economy? Psychologically, it's
huge; economically, it's small," Ratajczak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola barely sneaks into the top 20 employers in the city, Ratajczak
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last 12 months, Atlanta created 115,000 jobs -- more jobs than all of
New England created in the same time period, Ratajczak said. With an
unemployment rate of only 2.6 percent, the displaced workers from Coke should
have little trouble finding jobs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Seek $350B Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT  AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) --President Clinton proposed a $350 billion tax cut and big
spending increases for schools and health care Thursday as he boasted of
America's unprecedented prosperity and challenged an election-year Congress to
``set great goals for our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Less than a year before leaving office, Clinton was outlining his farewell
agenda in his final State of the Union address before a joint session of
Congress. Many of his proposals were repackaged from earlier years and, in some
cases, resubmitted with spending figures double or triple the original amount.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans ridiculed Clinton's proposals but did not rule out working with
him on such issues as education and health care. ``If we enacted all the new
programs the president has talked about, we'd spend just about the entire
surplus on bigger and more expensive government,'' said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and
social progress with so little internal crisis or so few external threats,'' the
president said. ``Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity -- and
therefore such a profound obligation -- to build the more perfect union of our
founders' dreams.''
</P>
<P>
	   Excerpts of his speech were released in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's tax program includes marriage penalty relief, tax deductions of up
to $2,800 annually per family for college tuition and fees and retirement
savings accounts for low- and moderate-income families. He also proposed steps
to encourage charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by Republicans
and Democrats as both sides battle for control of Congress and the White House.
Smarting from Clinton's veto of their $792 billion tax-cut package last year,
House Republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax breaks and
marriage penalty relief this year. Presidential candidates have their own
proposals, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called
Clinton's tax cuts too limited. ``We think all Americans deserve tax relief, not
just the handful the president picks,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package would cost $350 billion over 10 years. However,
his plan envisions cutting that price tag by $100 billion by closing tax havens,
shelters and loopholes. Congress has previously rejected many of those ideas on
grounds they are tax increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said Theodore Roosevelt, at the dawn of the last century, said it
was crucial for a growing nation to take the long look ahead. ``Tonight, let us
take our long look ahead and set great goals for our nation,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no major foreign policy announcements, although Clinton urged
Congress to give China permanent normal trading relations with the United
States. He also asked for $1.6 billion for Colombia to fight narco-traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   While urging higher spending and targeted tax cuts, Clinton said, ``We must
not forsake the path of fiscal discipline that got us here. We must make these
investments and tax cuts only in the context of a balanced budget that
strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and pays down the national
debt.''
</P>
<P>
	   The booming economy and swelling tax revenues give Clinton and Republicans a
big cushion for any tax reductions or spending increases. Both sides claim they
are dedicated to protecting Social Security and eliminating the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   In the category of unfinished business, Clinton urged an increase in the
minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour, a patients' bill of rights to strengthen
consumers' rights in health insurance programs, tougher gun laws, an overhaul of
campaign finance laws, hate crimes legislation and another installment of his
program to put 50,000 more police on the street, a follow-on to his 100,000 more
cops program.
</P>
<P>
	   He called anew for Medicare to include a prescription drug benefit and to
allow people as young as 55 buy Medicare coverage -- this time with a 25 percent
tax credit to make the cost more manageable. ``In good conscience,'' Clinton
said, ``we cannot let another year pass without extending to all seniors the
lifeline of affordable prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
	   To reinforce his appeal for tighter gun control, Clinton invited Tom Mauser,
father of slain Columbine High School shooting victim Daniel Mauser, as one of
the guests in the VIP box with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   To help developing countries, Clinton proposed $1 billion in tax incentives
for drug makers to develop vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. The
goal is to create a market for new vaccines by providing $1 credit for every $1
spent by certified organizations for vaccines distributed in Africa and other
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
	   A major part of the speech dealt with education, a politically popular
subject that has been a staple of Clinton's agenda throughout his presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   He proposed a $4.5 billion initiative to double spending for after-school
and summer school programs and to expand the Head Start program for needy
children to cover 950,000 kids. The president also called for doubling money to
turn around failing schools and to increase spending by $450 million to hire
more teachers to reduce class size.
</P>
<P>
	   His tax breaks for college would cost $30 billion over 10 years. Another
proposal would expand the earned income tax credit for the working poor by $21
billion. A tax credit for long-term care would cost $27 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   To build momentum for the speech, many of Clinton's proposals were announced
in advance. One of his biggest initiatives was a 10-year, $110 billion proposal
to provide health coverage to the parents of children protected by the state
Children's Health Insurance Program. If approved, it would be the largest
increase in health coverage in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's agenda revives battles with Republicans over Social Security and
Medicare. He said his proposals would extend the life of Social Security to 2050
and Medicare to at least 2025. Clinton would devote nearly $400 billion of the
surplus for Medicare solvency and prescription drugs.

<HEADLINE> Airline Lets Tired Pilots Cancel  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- American Airines recently adopted a policy
allowing pilots who are too tired to fly to beg off a flight without penalty, a
top executive said Thursday at a hearing into a crash that killed 11 people last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The two pilots of the plane that crashed June 1 while trying to land in a
storm in Little Rock had been on duty for more than 13 hours -- just shy of
American's maximum 14-hour day. Pilot Richard Buschmann was killed and co-pilot
Michael Origel was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Greg Feith said the long
day was not unusual for American pilots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have received ... numerous people calling us or providing us letters
that people are flying tired -- that American Airlines pilots are still on the
edge of fatigue and management isn't listening,'' Feith said.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Baker, vice chairman for American's parent company, AMR Corp, said:
``We have said to our pilots in no uncertain terms, `If you feel you are unable
to perform because of fatigue, then you are off the trip at your request with no
recourse from the company.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Baker, who was in charge of American's operations at the time of the crash,
was promoted three weeks ago to a new position created to oversee safety and
security.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the airline plans to revise its policies on approaches and landings
and avoiding thunderstorms. Pilots will also be given more training on
interpreting radar.
</P>
<P>
	   The Air Transport Association in Washington said Thursday it did not know of
fatigue-related policies for individual airlines but did say that pilots, in
general, have been able to beg off flights in case of illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Eleven people were killed and 110 injured when Flight 1420 landed in high
wind and heavy rain, ran off the runway, broke apart and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, American has evaluated itself three times and come up with 85
recommendations for improvements, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have learned some things. We've got some work to do. We will be a
better airline for it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Leader: Coup Plotters Have No Effect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Defense Minister Raul Salazar assured Venezuelans
the decision to reinstate soldiers who participated in two coups will not affect
military discipline in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
	   The estimated 250 former coup plotters will be taken before a disciplinary
council if they do not ``adjust to the established order of their respective
force,'' Salazar said in comments published Thursday by the El Universal
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers decreed Tuesday the coup participants could rejoin the military at
their previous rank, saying the coup attempts were ``legitimized'' by the
election of President Hugo Chavez a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, a former lieutenant colonel, led a failed coup in February against
then President Carlos Andres Perez. A second attempt in November 1992, led by
pro-Chavez factions, also failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez was pardoned in 1994 by Perez' successor.
</P>
<P>
	   Several coup plotters have taken up government posts under Chavez'
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics believe the reinstatements encourage soldiers to take up arms
against their superiors. They say the move could also cause friction among the
majority of troops who remained loyal to the government.

<HEADLINE> R.J. Reynolds Earns Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. -- which
makes Winston, Salem and Camel cigarette brands -- said Thursday its
fourth-quarter loss was narrower than a year ago despite the health care
settlement with states and reduced demand because of higher prices.
</P>
<P>
	   For the October-December period, the company's net loss was $6 million, or 6
cents a share, compared with a loss of $564 million, or $5.19 a share, a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special items such as the settlement charges, earnings from
ongoing operations in the fourth quarter totaled $85 million, or 79 cents a
share, down from $169 million, or $1.55 a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the fourth-quarter figure matched the 79 cents a share expected by
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales totaled $1.98 billion in the quarter, up 29 percent from $1.54 billion
a year earlier. The increase reflected higher selling prices, though volume was
lower, the company said. It said prices were up 82 cents a pack in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's shares rose 6 1/4 cents to $18.56 1/4 in trading at 5:15 p.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said that in addition to rising prices, which lowered cigarette
demand, earnings were affected by its share of the costs of the $206 billion
tobacco settlement that cigarette makers, including Reynolds, agreed to with
states to pay for health care costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1999, the industry began a period of transition resulting from the
settlement agreement with certain states' attorneys general," said R.J. Reynolds
chairman Andrew J. Schindler.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, net income was $2.34 billion, or $21.58 a share, compared
with a loss of $516 million, or $4.74 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said earnings from ongoing operations, excluding special items,
totaled $369 million, or $3.40 a share, down 38 percent from $591 million, or
$5.44 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales were $7.57 billion, up 32 percent from $5.72 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Media General Earnings Rise 48 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Media General Inc., a newspaper publisher and
television broadcaster serving the Southeast, reported a 48 percent jump in
fourth-quarter earnings Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Media General earned $25.4 million, or 95 cents per share, up from $17.1
million, or 63 cents per share, in the same period last year. The results were
well ahead of analyst expectations of 87 cents per share, as measured by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings did not include a one-time gain of $798.7 million from the sale
of cable operations to Cox Communications or a $1.3 million charge from early
settlement of about $800 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues in the fourth quarter were $212.1 million, slightly lower than
$212.2 million in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Losses in the newsprint division were more than offset by increases in the
publishing division, said J. Stewart Bryan III, chairman and chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
	   "As has been the case all year, the publishing division had a strong
performance in the quarter, despite soft retail advertising revenues," Bryan
said. "Our newsprint business remained under pressure in the quarter as costs
continued to exceed current selling price levels."
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, profits rose 31 percent to $69.9 million, or $2.60 per share,
compared to $53.4 million, or $1.98 per share in 1998. 1999 revenues slipped to
$795.4 million from $816.9 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Media General is an independent, publicly owned communications company with
interests in newspapers, broadcast television, recycled newsprint and
diversified information services primarily in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's shares fell 37 1/2 cents to $51.50 in trading in trading at
5:15 p.m. on the American Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Snow Hits Lebanon, Israel  </HEADLINE>
   By RODEINA KENAAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- A storm brought snow, strong winds and heavy rains
to Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East Thursday, causing traffic
accidents, uprooting trees and disrupting communications and power supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   The snowfall blocked most mountain roads and disrupted traffic on the
highway between Beirut and Damascus, Syria. Strong winds lashed Lebanon's
120-mile Mediterranean coast, uprooting telephone and power poles. On the
coastal road between Beirut and Sidon, five people were injured in a traffic
accident, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow and unusually low temperatures were reported in several other countries
in the Middle East on Thursday, but only Egypt reported fatalities due to the
weather. Police there said heavy downpours and fog caused 14 separate traffic
accidents, killing three people and injuring 71.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy snow piled up in Jerusalem and other hilltop areas in Israel, creating
picturesque scenes but closing roads and causing traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
	   Snowstorms hit Jerusalem only once every few years, and the city does not
have snow removal equipment. City officials advised residents not to drive their
cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy rain also fell in parts of Israel, flooding some streets and backing
up traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the damage, the storm had a positive side. The Sea of Galilee,
Israel's main source of drinking water, was rising after being depleted
dangerously because of a drought last year.
</P>
<P>
	   A Lebanese police statement said weather conditions were expected to worsen,
with snowfall forecast for all parts of the country, including the capital of
Beirut, where heavy rains flooded most streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Television and radio stations broadcast hourly updates on road conditions,
and authorities said power supplies will be rationed in some areas due to damage
caused by the storm.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's storm followed unusually heavy rains which caused rivers to flood
in north and south Lebanon, destroying property and crops.
</P>
<P>
	   In the remote northern village of Dinniyeh, lightning struck a mosque and a
school on Thursday, causing extensive damage but no deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   In Syria, snow covered Qasion mountain, which overlooks the capital of
Damascus, for the first time in several years.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jordan, snow covered the capital of Amman, and temperatures dropped to
below freezing after nightfall.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, the capital of Nicosia received a
rare dusting of snow, but heavy snowfall was reported on the central Troodos
mountain range. Strong winds blew across the island.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 4.97  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Thursday in another volatile session on Wall
Street as investors looked ahead to next week's Federal Reserve meeting and
anticipated that an interest rate increase will be the first of several this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 4.97 points to close at 11,028.02.
The modest finish, following a 3.10-point gain on Wednesday, belied a wild
session in which the Dow rose as much as 130 points and tumbled as much as 116.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also gave up early gains and closed lower. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 5.53 to 1,398.56, and the Nasdaq composite index fell
30.35 to 4,039.56. Trading was heavy.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts could find no single catalyst for the selloff that put the brakes
on the market's latest attempt to rebuild from steep losses in recent sessions.
The Dow has fallen 6 percent from its Jan. 14 closing high of 11,722.98, and the
Nasdaq has sliced nearly 5 percent from its closing high of 4,235.40, set just
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   But market watchers said the continued volatility stems in part from worries
about the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting on interest rates. Next week, the
Fed is expected to raise interest rates in a bid to keep inflation at bay as the
nation's economy continues to grow at a rapid pace. Higher interest rates can
threaten corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Three separate quarter-point rate increases in 1999 have done little to slow
the economy's torrid growth. Thursday, the latest sign of unfettered expansion
came from the Commerce Department's report that showed orders to U.S. factories
for big-ticket manufactured goods surged in December.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the government will release the latest figures on the gross
domestic product and on the employment cost index. Analysts said many investors
began pulling money out of the market in advance of those reports, fearing that
they will suggest that sharply higher interest rates are needed to slow the
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a very high level of expectation built into the share prices of
many companies," said Richard Babson, president and chairman of the investment
advisory firm Babson-United Inc. in Watertown, Mass. "Those expectations can't
hold up if rates go up dramatically."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors also punished some companies for disappointing Wall Street this
week. Defense contractor Lockheed Martin fell  5/8 to 19 7/16 after saying
Thursday that it will cut at least 2,800 jobs in an effort to streamline its
troubled aeronautical and space businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola shares tumbled for a second session, losing 3 9/16 to 59 1/2. The
company Wednesday announced plans to eliminate 6,000 jobs, about one-fifth of
its work force.
</P>
<P>
	   Qualcomm, the Nasdaq's best-performing stock in 1999, fell 4 5/8 to 120. The
company said Wednesday it may see lower demand for its products in the current
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Dell fell 2 13/16 to 37 9/16. Late Wednesday, the company said it will miss
analysts' profit and sales estimates this quarter due to parts shortages and
slower customer demand. Dell also cited Year 2000 computer concerns for the
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday, however, Wall Street brokerages including Merrill Lynch and Chase
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist stepped in to defend Dell, raising their recommendations on
the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St.
Louis, said the company's problems are likely to be short-lived and the stock
remains undervalued relative to many leading technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dell has underperformed the market for about eight months, and people
should see this as a buying opportunity," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other technology companies posted solid gains. Conexant, which will be added
to the S&AMP;P 500 after the close of trading Friday, rose 13 1/4 to 87 9/16.
Companies often get at least a short-term boost when they are added to an index,
as mutual fund managers who try to mirror an index's performance buy shares of
the newly added company.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.35 billion shares, nearly even with the
pace of the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.02 to 517.02.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.5 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX
index rose 2.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.0 percent, and France's
CAC-40 closed 0.7 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congress Link Always Tense  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has never had an easy time dealing with
Congress -- even when Democrats ran it -- and he's gotten no signs from
Republican leaders that things are about to change this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, the fact that everybody but Clinton is a candidate in 2000 is feeding a
strange hope at the White House of actually getting something done before he
leaves office. The president even figures the agenda he was articulating
Thursday night stands ``a better than 50-50 chance'' of passage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there's a chance we'll get quite a lot done,'' Clinton said
Wednesday in an interview with PBS host Jim Lehrer. ``We did in '96, we did in
'98. I think we will this year again.''
</P>
<P>
	   To some, Clinton's prediction of last-minute legislative magic seems rather
bold. They say Clinton should stick to ``bite-sized initiatives'' if having a
legacy is important to him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There won't be anything that will be written about in the history books,''
said Marshall Whitman, director of congressional relations for the Heritage
Foundation. ``This president has the worst relationship with a Congress since
Nixon left the White House grounds on the helicopter.''
</P>
<P>
	   But others say Clinton's lame-duck status frees him to be an agent
provocateur for Vice President Al Gore, using legislative proposals to try to
force Republicans into taking positions they must then defend before the voters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The truth is, he has a lot of cards to play,'' said Al From, president of
the Democratic Leadership Council. ``The Republicans have interests too. They
can't go to the voters having just blocked everything Clinton's done.''
</P>
<P>
	   It is an added twist in the saga of Clinton vs. Congress, a story line that,
over seven years, has hit upon nearly every type of conflict available to the
executive and legislative branches of government.
</P>
<P>
	   Consider 1993, when a Congress full of his fellow Democrats sent Clinton's
ambitious health care reform package to a watery grave. Or 1994, when a restive
electorate gave Clinton a Republican majority to contend with in Congress,
forcing him to scrap his liberal-sounding agenda and start over from the middle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A great marching speech. It went left-right, left-right, left-right,''
Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., said of the 1995 State of the Union address -- which
drew slow, begrudging applause and was interrupted by shouts from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Later that same year, though, Clinton emerged victorious from an epic
struggle over balancing the budget that shut down the federal government. The
following year, 1996, Clinton and GOP leaders regarded each other with studied
cool, uncertain of whose programs would play well on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   More than Clinton's legislative agenda hung in the balance when he went
before Congress in January 1998. The president had been accused of having an
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which he denied.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP lawmakers seized upon the Lewinsky matter as grounds for removing
Clinton from office. The president struggled to secure passage of an Asian
financial bailout and failed to get approval for ``fast track'' trade
negotiating authority. Before year's end, Clinton admitted to the affair, and
the House voted to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
	   The impeachment was still playing out last January, when Clinton delivered
his seventh State of the Union address. House members debated whether he should
even be invited to give the speech, since the Senate had yet to vote on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton gave the speech anyway, and Republicans responded with distant,
unenthusiastic reactions. Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and Rep. Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, remained seated and gave him no applause at all.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, Clinton is back as an impeachment survivor, and GOP leaders are
speaking to him in terms that sound friendly -- and ominous.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter Wednesday, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
sought cooperation on a Social Security initiative. ``As we both know, the news
will soon focus on what you have and have not accomplished during your
presidency,'' Archer said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- Canada's intelligence agency said Thursday it had
investigated a man now reportedly in custody in Senegal for involvement in an
alleged terrorist bombing plot in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Another man implicated in the alleged plot, Ahmed Ressam, pleaded innocent
in federal court in Seattle on Thursday to charges of involvement in the alleged
plot.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam, an Algerian, was arrested Dec. 14 for allegedly trying to smuggle
bomb-making components from Canada into the United States. Three other Algerian
nationals and a woman married to an Algerian are in custody, and police in the
United States and Canada are searching for another Algerian.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times reported Thursday that Mohambedou Ould Slahi was arrested
in Senegal at the request of U.S. authorities who suspect him of organizing the
bomb plot. It said no charges have been filed, but that the United States would
seek Slahi's extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Times report, Slahi's brother-in-law is a top lieutenant of
Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden is one of 18 people indicted in the
United States on charges of conspiracy to attack Americans in the 1998 bombings
of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12
Americans. Bin Laden is believed to be in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, a law enforcement official who requested anonymity said
investigators were not sure whether Slahi was a major figure in the bomb plot or
merely a messenger. The official also said U.S. investigators are unsure if
Slahi's brother-in-law is a key Bin Laden aide.
</P>
<P>
	   Slahi was in Canada before going to Senegal, said Dan Lambert, spokesman for
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. Sometime after Ressam's Dec. 14
arrest, Slahi left ``due, in part, to the investigation that was ongoing,''
Lambert said. He declined to provide any details of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   No specific evidence has been released that shows bin Laden was behind the
alleged bombing plot and authorities have not said what the targets might have
been.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior government official in Senegal and an officer at the central police
station in Dakar told The Associated Press Friday they knew nothing of Slahi's
detention.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official in Senegal declined to comment. Another U.S. official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the situation was sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   Little was revealed about Slahi, a citizen of Mauritania, but investigators
told the Times he was in constant contact with a construction company in Sudan
that was owned by bin Laden and was a front for bin Laden's international
organization, al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, Slahi traveled to Montreal, where he worked closely with Mokhtar
Haouri, one of the Algerians charged with helping Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   American officials said there are other emerging links between the bomb plot
and bin Laden. One involves Hamid Aich, an Algerian who lived for three years in
a Vancouver suburb where he shared an apartment with Abdelmajid Dahoumane, the
Times said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dahoumane, accused of being Ressam's accomplice, remains at large.
</P>
<P>
	   Irish police said they arrested Aich on Dec. 21 and seized personal papers
and computer records. They released him the following day, and gave the seized
material to the FBI for analysis, Superintendent John Farrelly said.
</P>
<P>
	   In France, judicial sources said Thursday that a Paris court had opened an
inquiry last week against a person or persons for ``criminal association in
relation to a terrorist operation.'' They did not identify the target of the
investigation, but said it followed the Ressam arrest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   A French anti-terrorism judge went to the United States earlier this month
to lead the inquiry, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> FDA Widens Five-Layer Dip Recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration widened warnings Thursday
that Americans should not purchase or consume a Mexican-style five-layer dip
that appears to have left at least 49 people with food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
	   The dip may be contaminated with shigella, a serious -- and highly
contagious -- type of bacteria that causes bloody diarrhea, cramps, fever,
nausea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
	   The manufacturer recalled the contaminated dip last week, but the FDA said
the illness count has mounted and the dip was sold more widely than previously
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Do not purchase or consume any five-layer dip sold under the following brand
names, the FDA said: Senor Felix's Five-Layered Party Dip, Delicioso 5-Layer
Dip, Trader Joe's Five-Layered Fiesta Dip, or The Carryout Cafe Mexican Fiesta
Party Dip 5 Layer.
</P>
<P>
	   If you have consumed these recalled products and experience shigella
symptoms, seek medical care, the FDA advised.
</P>
<P>
	   Symptoms of shigella infection typically appear one to three days after
ingesting the bacteria. It can be very serious and require antibiotic treatment.
Indeed, five of the 49 cases counted so far have required hospitalization, the
FDA said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shigella is highly contagious, so sufferers who do not carefully wash their
hands can spread the illness to family members.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous consumer alerts did not mention that the product is sold under the
Carryout Cafe brand, and implied the dips were sold in only a few retail chains.
Actually, the dips were sold in numerous stores nationwide, and while most of
the illnesses were reported from California, Oregon and Washington, reports are
trickling in from other areas, the FDA said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The recalled dip was manufactured by Senor Felix's Gourmet Mexican Foods
Inc. of Baldwin Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers who have purchased the recalled dips may return them to the place
of purchase for a refund. Consumers also may call Senor Felix's hot line at
1-800-807-7335.

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Earnings Climb  </HEADLINE>
    By LISA SINGHANIA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Kellogg Co. said Thursday that its earnings rose
in the fourth quarter despite cereal sales that have been weakening because of
America's changing breakfast habits.
</P>
<P>
	   The Battle Creek, Mich., cereal maker said net income totaled $100.9
million, or 25 cents a share, in the October-December period compared with $46.8
million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding a charge for closing part of the company's Battle Creek cereal
plant, earnings for the quarter were $136.7 million, or 34 cents a share,
compared with $93.1 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   That matched the 34 cents estimate by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $1.59 billion, down 0.6 percent from $1.6 billion
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. said the sales figures were disappointing and lowered
its recommendation for the company to "market perform" from "market outperform."
</P>
<P>
	   Kellogg's shares rose 31 1/4 cents to $24.50 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   "Despite the fourth-quarter sales and volume softness, 1999 was a year of
significant progress for Kellogg Co.," said Carlos M. Gutierrez, president and
chief executive officer. "We met our goal of returning to both top-line and
bottom-line growth."
</P>
<P>
	   Kellogg's troubles are not over, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Long the biggest U.S. cereal maker, the company has fallen behind
Minnesota-based General Mills for the first time in decades. Kellogg's market
share of cereal sales for the year ending Jan. 2 was 30.7 percent, compared with
32.2 percent for General Mills, according to Chicago-based Information Resources
Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   To save money, Kellogg has cut jobs and closed some facilities, resulting in
hundreds of millions of dollars in one-time costs.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Kellogg earned $338.3 million, or 83 cents a share, down
from $502.6 million, or $1.23 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding restructuring and other charges, the company earned $606 million,
or $1.50 per share, for 1999 compared with $548.9 million, or $1.35 a share a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales were $6.98 billion, up 3.3 percent from $6.76 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Lilly Profits Rise 20 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eli Lilly's fourth quarter profit rose 20 percent as
decreasing sales for the antidepressant Prozac was offset by stronger demand for
the company's osteoporosis and antipsychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding unusual events, the Indianapolis-based drug firm's operating
income rose to $671.7 million, or 61 cents per share during the quarter, up from
$567.3 million or 51 cents per share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Results matched Wall Street estimates, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Including one-time gains, such as wholesaler stocking due to Y2K concerns,
Lilly earned $786.3 million or 71 cents per share. The earnings per share was
higher due to a lower number of shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 7 percent to $2.82 billion from $2.64 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Prozac sales dropped 13 percent to $645.2 million from $744.5 million in the
year-ago period. Prozac has been the nation's top selling antidepressant for the
past decade. But sales have dropped recently due to new competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Helping offset the decline in Prozac was the antipsychotic drug Zyprexa,
which had sales increase 36 percent to $587.7 million from $432.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Evista, an osteoporosis drug, had sales jump 39 percent to $112.1 million
from $62.8 million in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, excluding one-time events, Lilly's net income rose 16
percent to $2.52 billion, or $2.28 per share, up from $2.1 billion, or $1.87 per
share, in 1998. Sales rose 8 percent to $10.0 billion, up from $9.24 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Lilly rose $1.50 to $64.25 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Rise in Margin Debt Spurs Concerns  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A sharp increase in margin debt, the amount of money
borrowed by individual investors to purchase stocks, has some analysts worried
that the unprecedented levels could exacerbate a market downturn.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a serious subject and it's creating concern because it's really a
measure of investor confidence," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at
Edward Jones, a St. Louis brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you see masses of people doing it at once, it says the crowd thinks
there's very little chance that stocks are going to go down. But we know from
history that stock markets aren't a one-way street," he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is expressing concern about the
level of margin debt, saying Wednesday during testimony before the Senate that
the central bank is studying the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans had borrowed $228.5 billion to buy stock as of Dec. 31, 1999, up
from $141 billion a year earlier -- a 62 percent jump, according to Ned Davis
Research, a Venice, Fla., market data firm. In 1990, the figure stood at around
$35 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Borrowing accelerated rapidly in the last months of 1999, when the
technology-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market was surging upward at an unprecedented
rate, said Sam Burns, a research analyst at Ned Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerns have surfaced over the buying on margin because a significant
market downturn could wipe out hundreds of thousands of debt-ridden investors
and exacerbate a widespread selling panic.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's how the scenario could unfold, Burns said:
</P>
<P>
	   Investors borrow money to buy stock in the hope that the stock will increase
in value.
</P>
<P>
	   The stock purchased on margin is used as collateral against the value of the
loan.
</P>
<P>
	   If the stock goes up, everyone's happy because the investor can use the
profits to pay back the borrowed money plus interest charged by the lender --
usually the investor's broker.
</P>
<P>
	   But if the stock price falls, thus lowering the value of the lender's
collateral, the lender can make what's known as a margin call, which requires
the borrower to put up more cash to ensure that the loan is repaid in full.
</P>
<P>
	   Margin calls are usually covered by selling the stock purchased on margin,
and that's where things get sticky, according to Burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Should U.S. stock markets stumble at some point, hundreds of thousands of
margin investors would likely sell stock into an already falling market to pay
back their margin loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Those margin-related sales would only contribute to a selling panic, Burns
explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Many historians blame the 1929 stock market crash on widespread margin
buying among investors who were then forced to sell stock to pay back their
loans when the market tanked.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve Board, which regulates margin borrowing, currently
requires investors to have at least $2,000 in a trading account to buy on
margin. In addition, investors are limited to purchasing $2 of stock for every
$1 in their account.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Greenspan said the Federal Reserve was reluctant to exercise
its authority to tighten limits on such borrowing, saying that studies have
suggested that a rising level of stock prices is unrelated to liberal margin
requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, which oversees the Nasdaq stock market, are seeking changes that would
increase to $25,000 the minimum amount some active traders need to keep in their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The move is designed to ensure that investors who want to borrow money to
buy stocks have plenty of collateral to pay back their debts.
</P>
<P>
	   But not everyone supports the changes.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Tappan, the co-founder of MTrader.com, an educational online site for
active traders, said margin borrowing has traditionally allowed small investors
an opportunity to take a larger stake in the markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very valuable tool because it provides leverage," Tappan said.
"Without it, you're playing against a stacked deck."
</P>
<P>
	   Small investor advocates frequently complain that the markets are biased in
favor of large, institutional investors such as pension and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Tappan acknowledged that certain investors, such as day traders, accept
tremendous risks when they borrow money to speculate on the markets. Day traders
buy and sell thousands of shares, betting on the movement of the stock to make
money.
</P>
<P>
	   The practice of borrowing money to day trade came under scrutiny last July
when debt-ridden trader Mark Barton killed nine people at two Atlanta brokerage
firms.

<HEADLINE> Group Puts Fake Front on USA Today  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some readers who bought copies of USA Today did
double-takes Thursday after a group of peace activists wrapped some papers in a
fake front page with the masthead: ``USA Decay.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with USA Today said they did not know how many streetside
newspaper boxes had been targeted or how many newspapers were affected, but the
group claimed to have hit boxes in nine cities, including Boston, New York,
Washington, Denver and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization that claimed responsibility calls itself Shiftdough.org. In
a press release, the group described its members as a ``collection of activists
who call for shifting dough out of the Pentagon budget and into human needs,''
such as education, health care and the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   The release gave no information on how to contact the members, and on the
Web site, they acknowledge trying to conceal their identities. The site is
hosted by a Burlington, Vt., company and is registered to Michael Dorfman of
Floro, Norway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I set up the Web site and put together the list of the links. That was my
contribution, but I was not involved at all in this newspaper action,'' Dorfman
said Thursday when contacted by phone. ``Shiftdough is kind a loose affiliation
of activists. I definitely support what it stands for.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Dorfman said he did not know how many people were members of the group,
how many newspaper boxes had been hit, or who was responsible for altering the
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Dubill, executive editor of USA Today, said the newspaper's lawyers were
checking whether the group's action was a violation of any state or federal
laws. He said he learned of the mock pages from readers and employees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're looking into the matter,'' said Dubill, declining to comment
further.
</P>
<P>
	   The fake front page, made to resemble the real thing, probably would not
have fooled anyone for long. One headline read ``Pentagon to Throw Bombs Away,''
and another was ``Defense, Education Departments to Merge.'' The ``Newsline
section'' of the real paper was renamed ``Newslime.''
</P>
<P>
	   The spoof of the newspaper also offered the following travel tip: ``Call
your travel agent to see if your destination country is currently in the process
of being bombed by the USA.''

<HEADLINE> Sara Lee Earnings Rise 5 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sara Lee Corp. reported Wednesday that its quarterly profits
excluding one-time charges rose 5 percent despite continuing weakness in its
food operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Solid sales gains in household and body care, food service distribution and
coffee and tea enabled the company to overcome another poor quarter for foods.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings for the October-December period, the second quarter of Sara Lee's
fiscal year, were $389 million, or 42 cents a share. That compared with $371
million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier, excluding special items including
a charge for a processed-meat recall.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings matched the estimate from analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales were $5.33 billion for the quarter, up less than 1 percent from $5.29
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Sara Lee stock rose 37 1/2 cents, or nearly 2 percent, to $18.43 3/4 in
trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. It had touched its 52-week
low of $18.06 1/4 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the report showed the Chicago-based company -- the world's leader in
packaged meats sales -- is still smarting from the effects of the recall of 15
million pounds of hot dogs and other meats in December 1998. Packaged meats
sales slipped 7 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   At least five lawsuits have been filed against Sara Lee over an outbreak of
food poisoning that killed 15 people and sickened hundreds of others in 1998,
prompting the recalls.
</P>
<P>
	   Sara Lee Foods' showing was further hurt by a 10 percent drop in worldwide
sales of Sara Lee Bakery products, which analysts said results partly from a
mixed track record for new items. Sara Lee is the U.S. leader in frozen baked
goods.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first six months of the fiscal year, net income was $647 million, or
70 cents a share, compared with $660 million, or 69 cents a share, in 1998. The
1998 earnings were 64 cents a share, excluding special items, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first six months of the fiscal year, sales edged up 1.3 percent to
$10.28 billion from $10.15 billion a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> GTE Earnings Up in 4Q  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    IRVING, Texas (AP) -- GTE Corp. said Thursday its earnings rose in the
fourth quarter, helped by the local phone company's new ventures in data goods
and services.
</P>
<P>
	   GTE, which is being acquired by Bell Atlantic Corp., said its net income was
$1.001 billion, or $1.03 a share, in the October-December period, compared with
$855 million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. After excluding the one-time
gain from the sale of the GTE government systems business, fourth-quarter
earnings were $961 million, or 98 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   That matched the 98 cents estimate of analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue was $6.74 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with adjusted
revenue of $5.99 billion a year earlier. Before adjustment for the asset sale,
revenue for the fourth quarter of 1998 was $6.83 billion, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   GTE's shares traded at $68.62 1/2, up 62 1/2 cents, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles R. Lee, GTE's chairman and chief executive, said the company is
successfully changing itself into a full-service telecommunications company with
a focus on Internet and data businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee said the company's new businesses, including data goods and services
such as high-speed Internet access and wireless, grew 42 percent to $2.5 billion
during 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it has 7.1 million wireless customers in the United States,
a gain of nearly 50 percent from a year ago with many added through
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   GTE also completed its private high-speed fiber network during the year,
which Lee said will give the company an edge over data-service competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee added that he is optimistic the Federal Communications Commission will
soon give approval to the GTE-Bell Atlantic merger. Late Thursday, the two
companies filed a proposal with the FCC in an attempt to allay its concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, GTE reported net income of $4.03 billion, or $4.12 a share,
compared with $2.17 billion, or $2.24 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding one-time gains on asset sales and other items, net income was
$3.41 billion, or $3.49 a share, for the year compared with $2.97 billion, or
$3.07 a share in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues were $25.34 billion, up from adjusted revenue of $23.3 billion in
1998. Before adjustment for purchases and sales of divisions, revenue for 1998
was $25.47 billion.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Squabble on Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush gained the endorsement of Jack Kemp,
a favorite of conservatives, on Thursday and said the Republican Party needs a
presidential nominee who can debate the Democrats, ``not mimic them.''
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested that Sen. John McCain's tax proposals are too like President
Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, said he'd devote a projected $1 trillion, 10-year budget
surplus bonus to paying off the national debt by 2013 instead of adding it to
the proposed tax cut that Bush says would be too little to protect against the
spending habits of Washington politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator also said he'd be a better debater against Vice
President Al Gore because ``Bush stands mute on campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's much easier for me to attack Clinton and Gore because I have the high
ground,'' said McCain, who is a strong advocate of campaign finance changes.
</P>
<P>
	   He holds the edge over Bush in polls of likely voters in the New Hampshire
presidential primary next Tuesday. But the Texas governor said he has a good
chance of winning and can withstand losing anyhow. Campaigning in Nashua, Bush
said he hopes New Hampshire Republicans will choose him as a candidate ``who can
win, who can unify the party.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think when the Republicans go into the booths in New Hampshire and
around the country, it's important to nominate somebody who will be able to
debate the Democratic nominee on key issues, not mimic them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jaffrey, Bush stood in the front hall of a white brick colonial home,
built in 1830, and told townspeople he is a man ``on a mission to lift the
spirit of America.'' And to cut its taxes, he said, so that surplus funds won't
be spent ``on a bigger, more intrusive federal government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said a McCain remark in the Wednesday night debate made his point.
``When he said his tax plan was similar to President Clinton's tax plan, it made
it real clear the difference of opinion on taxes,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   What McCain said was that Clinton had moved toward a plan like his, not the
other way around.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush aides said they were considering producing an ad off that exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning Thursday in Hampton Beach and Newington, McCain rolled his eyes
when told of Bush's comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's spinning like Bill Clinton,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush got a boost during the day when Kemp, the Republicans' 1996 vice
presidential nominee, endorsed him at a campaign event at a Nashua defense
technology plant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush is the one who can inspire the Congress, who can inspire the
nation,'' said Kemp, who endorsed Forbes in 1996 before the publisher dropped
out. He called Forbes a good friend and suggested that perhaps Bush should name
him treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   Kemp, a former New York congressman, is also a former presidential contender
as well as Bob Dole's running mate in the last election.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, campaigning at the Puritan Backroom Restaurant in Manchester, said
he was not surprised at the endorsement, even though he and Kemp have worked
together to promote a flat income tax and Bush has failed to endorse one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jack's a very nice fellow,'' he said. ``But he is part of the
establishment, and it's no surprise the establishment would rally around its
own, especially when they realize they've met their match.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for McCain, the Arizona senator gives few signs that he is very
encouraged by the polls in New Hampshire. He leads Bush narrowly in tracking
polls in the state, ahead 40 percent to 35 percent in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup
poll, and 41 percent to 33 percent in a Fox-WMUR-University of New Hampshire
tracking poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The error margin for the two tracking polls taken through Wednesday night
was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   But Wednesday night, full of energy after the debate, McCain appeared for a
moment to be looking beyond the Republican race. ``We're going to beat Gore like
a drum,'' he declared at a post-debate party in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's town hall meeting Thursday at Yoken's Restaurant was packed. The
crowd spilled out into the halls, and people in the back of the stifling room
stood on chairs to see the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, McCain released a new television ad that will air in New
Hampshire through the primary. In it, McCain promises to return government ``to
whom it belongs, the people.'' The words ``Character,'' ``Courage'' and ``Ready
to Lead'' fade in over footage of McCain at town hall meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   There was more talk about abortion Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Good people can disagree on that issue,'' Bush said. The night before, he
had said in the debate that if he could write a constitutional amendment on
abortion, it would say that the rights of the unborn are protected by law.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes, who finished third to Bush and Forbes in Iowa, challenged McCain
in the debate for saying earlier in the day that it would be a family decision
should his teen-age daughter become pregnant and want an abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, campaigning at a school in Bedford on Thursday, said, ``No pro-life
Republican can support McCain with any kind of confidence. I'll tell you right
now pro-life people who support McCain are throwing away their votes on someone
who will betray us. He does not have this conviction in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Thursday, ``It's a little painful when your family is brought
up.'' But he said a candidate ``can't get angry'' about it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our party's going to have that debate,'' he said. ``As I said, good people
can disagree on that issue.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Violence Mars Leader  </HEADLINE>
   By GEOFF SPENCER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- One hundred days after becoming Indonesia's
president, Abdurrahman Wahid on Thursday dismissed rumors of an imminent
military coup, with his country facing internal violence, a mosque bombing and a
student protest.
</P>
<P>
	   The president branded his foes in the military as ``cowards'' and said most
members of the armed forces support him.
</P>
<P>
	   Pushing ahead with reforms to lessen the military's role in politics, Wahid
signed a decree removing four generals from the military so they can continue to
serve as Cabinet ministers. One of the four was security affairs Minister Gen.
Wiranto, who commanded the armed forces under authoritarian ex-President Suharto
and Wahid's predecessor, B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
	   A state-appointed human rights probe has implicated Gen. Wiranto and other
Indonesian commanders in a rampage of killing and destruction in East Timor last
year, investigator Asmara Nababan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid was elected by parliament on Oct. 20 as Indonesia's first democratic
head of state after four decades of authoritarian rule. A Muslim leader who has
long preached religious tolerance, Wahid predicts the country's current outbreak
of violence will end within two months.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite this, at least 65 people were killed during the past three days in
fighting among Christians and Muslims in the eastern Maluku archipelago, local
military commander Brig. Gen. Max Tamale said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The clashes on Bacan, a small island about 1,600 miles northeast of Jakarta,
were the latest outbreaks of violence in a yearlong conflict that has claimed
more than 2,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
	   Many victims died in street battles fought with axes, swords, spears and
homemade guns in the archipelago, which used to be called the Spice Islands.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, a small bomb rocked a mosque in Yogyakarta, on Indonesia's main
island of Java. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   In the northwest province of Aceh, thousands more have been killed in a
separatist war. At least 18 rebels, soldiers and villagers have died this week
despite a peace mission there by Wahid on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, hundreds of students demonstrated for secession in the
neighboring province of Riau on Thursday. Police used tear gas and fired warning
shots to disperse the protest outside a petroleum plant operated by the Caltex
oil company.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid has promised to give restive provinces more autonomy and money, but
has ruled out demands for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a news conference in Jakarta Thursday, Wahid said that along
with reforms to the nation's crippled financial system, his defense of national
unity had been a major achievement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The situation is improving now. We can say that the danger to our
territorial integrity is already passing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Wahid blamed disgruntled members of the military as well
as some fanatical Muslims for fomenting violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid said he would go ahead with a two-week tour of the Middle East, Europe
and Asia starting Friday, despite rumors of a possible coup.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not worried about a very small number of military leaders who
actually do not have followers,'' Wahid said. ``I know this small number and
they are cowards.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the head of the Mormon church on Thursday made an unprecedented
trip to Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rejected
suggestions that the visit signaled any intention by the church to expand in
Indonesia. One official said church President Gordon B. Hinckley had come on
Wahid's personal invitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Hinckley was a guest at a private dinner hosted by Wahid at the state palace
in Jakarta on Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> GOP: Clinton Short on His Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton embraced several Republican priorities
in the $350 billion tax cut outlined Thursday, but GOP leaders say the president
could have already signed many of them into law.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, pointed
out that relief from the so-called ``marriage penalty'' and protecting the
middle class from the alternative minimum tax were part of the $792 billion GOP
tax cut vetoed by Clinton last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Congress fixed these problems last year and we will do so again this year,
and we hope the president won't veto tax relief again,'' said Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's 10-year, $350 billion tax relief plan was to be described later
Thursday in his final State of the Union address to Congress. Details were
provided hours earlier by the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Tax cuts and how to use the huge projected budget surpluses are a hot
political issue this year, particularly for the Republicans. Clinton's plan
gives Vice President Al Gore a tax cut to promote if he wins the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP presidential frontrunner, is pushing a
five-year, $483 billion tax cut, while Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., proposes
cutting taxes by $237 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   One GOP priority embraced by Clinton would partly fix a tax code glitch in
which millions of two-income married couples pay more income taxes than if they
were single. Clinton wants to gradually double the standard income tax deduction
for married people, cutting taxes for more than 9 million couples at a cost of
$45 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans intend to move legislation dealing with the marriage penalty to
the House floor by mid-February, although it is likely to be broader in scope
and also help married people who itemize their tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of Clinton's fiscal 2001 tax relief plan has been released over the
past weeks, including an expansion of the earned income tax credit for the
working poor, fixing the minimum tax so it affects fewer middle-class people,
and credits or deductions for long-term health care, college expenses and people
who need health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   New items unveiled Thursday include:
</P>
<P>
	   --Retirement Savings Accounts for low-income families in which the
government would provide a 2-for-1 match for the first $100 contributed by each
person. Cost:$54 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --A package of tax breaks and incentives to encourage philanthropy,
including allowing non-itemizers to take a tax deduction for charitable giving.
Another measure would be designed to make it easier to donate appreciated assets
like stocks and real property. Cost:$14 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --Increasing the dependent child care credit and extending it to parents who
stay home with their children. Cost:$30 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --A tax credit for pharmaceutical companies that develop new vaccines
against malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS. Cost:$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said the president will use some of the projected surplus to pay for
the tax cuts but is also likely to advocate closing corporate tax loopholes and
shelters -- and possibly other tax increases -- to foot roughly $100 billion of
the cost. Similar proposals in the past have received a cool reception in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill, Republicans said they also intend to push for abolition of
inheritance taxes, economic development credits in poor areas and savings
accounts for college tuition. They also said their tax cuts would be much larger
than the president's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I appreciate President Clinton's $350 billion tax cut proposal, but I
think we can do more,'' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth,
R-Del.

<HEADLINE> With BC-NJ--HMO Bailout-Glance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - An Assembly committee approved a $100 million
package Thursday to reimburse hospitals and doctors who are still owed money
from the bankruptcy of the state's largest HMO last year.
<P>
	   The committee vote got the ball moving on the controversial bailout package
endorsed by Gov. Christie Whitman on Monday in her annual budget address. The
state budget would provide $50 million, and another $50 million would be
assessed against insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the central opponents to the measure, the Association of Health
Plans, representing insurers, said the hearing finally gave them an opportunity
to spotlight the defects of the proposal that has been on the back burner for a
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't lose today," said association president Paul Langevin. "Clearly,
we gained recognition of how many unanswered questions there are and how much
needs to be done before any part of $100 million is spent."
</P>
<P>
	   The Assembly Banking and Insurance Committee approved the measure 5-1.
Whitman was gratified that Democrats were willing to support her proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said the payment was essential to reward hospitals and doctors that
provided care to members of HIP Health Plan of New Jersey despite the risk that
they might not be paid because of the HMO's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would pay bills left behind by HIP, formerly the state's largest
HMO with 165,000 members, which began failing in 1998 and went bankrupt last
spring. Money is also due for unpaid bills left by the bankruptcy of the small
American Preferred Provider Plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Physicians and lobbyists for the state's hospitals said although the amount
of money will not cover all the costs, it reduces the debt. Irv Ratner,
president of the New Jersey Medical Society, which lobbies for doctors, said
$150 million is owed but that his group supports the partial payment.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Lillo of the New Jersey Hospital Association said the payment is
essential as new reports show New Jersey hospitals facing an ever-tougher
financial pinch.
</P>
<P>
	   The Star-Ledger of Newark reported that Saint Peter's University Hospital in
New Brunswick is owed $4.1 million, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in
New Brunswick is owed $7.5 million, and St. Joseph's Medical Center in Paterson
is owed $5.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   But Langevin said the payment sum is at the heart of the problem with the
bill because there has been no reliable accounting of what was owed.

<HEADLINE> Cos. Not Liable for Home Workers  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department announced Thursday that it will
delay finalizing rules aimed at reducing repetitive-motion injuries on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   After business groups and Republican lawmakers complained the process was
being rushed, the agency said it would postpone a Feb. 1 deadline for submission
of written comments on the proposed rules by a month, until March 2.
</P>
<P>
	   The new worker protections would require employers to minimize everyday
physical -- or ergonomic -- stresses of certain jobs that involve activities
such as heavy lifting or computer keyboard work.
</P>
<P>
	   Long promised by the Clinton administration, they have already been delayed
for years as the Republican-controlled Congress, under pressure from business
groups, repeatedly passed legislation requiring more scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration was finally able to release them in November, after the
Senate adjourned for 1999 without acting on the latest hold passed in the House.
Republican lawmakers and business groups immediately demanded extensions of up
to six months in the public comment period that by law must elapse before the
rules can be finalized, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor leaders said they are wary of any further delays which could make
enactment of the regulations impossible before President Clinton's final term
ends. A Republican president elected to replace Clinton next January would be
unlikely to finish the job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want an ergonomics standard issued by the Clinton administration,''
said AFL-CIO director of safety and health, Peg Seminario. ``The issues that are
involved in this aren't anything new.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, Chamber of Commerce vice president for labor policy, Randy Johnson,
said, ``Just because an election's coming up doesn't give (the administration)
an excuse not to give the business community adequate time to comment on an
important rule-making.''

<HEADLINE> Iranian Council Bars Candidates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Some 650 potential candidates have been barred from
competing in next month's legislative elections, a hard-line Iranian council
that screens candidates said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ayatollah Reza Ostadi, spokesman of the Guardians Council, was quoted by
Iranian television as saying that some 600 out of 7,000 hopefuls were
disqualified by the Interior Ministry and electoral supervisory councils, while
50 others were directly rejected by the Council.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reasons for the rejection of most of the candidates,'' Ostadi said,
``were that they did not have the educational qualifications, were not old
enough or had not resigned their posts when they were legally obligated to.''
</P>
<P>
	   The final list of approved candidates for the Feb. 18 elections will be
handed over to the Interior Ministry on Friday. The Council has for the first
time been required to present evidence for rejecting nominees.
</P>
<P>
	   Ostadi said the rejection of the potential candidates was based on
information and documents obtained from official sources. He did not rule out
possible ``errors'' in the process. He said there was no prejudice behind the
rejection of candidates for the Majlis, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This council does not favor any particular faction or individuals. When
the final results are announced, the people will definitely make a fair
judgment,'' Ostadi said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week the Interior Ministry said the Guardians Council had disqualified
402 nominees whose eligibility to run in the Feb. 18 elections had earlier been
approved by the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   The council's decision to overrule the ministry is the result of a
tug-of-war between hard-liners and moderates. The Interior Ministry is
controlled by moderates who support reformist President Mohammad Khatami's
attempts to grant Iranians greater democracy and to ease the social restrictions
imposed by two decades of clerical rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The moderates have accused the Guardians Council of resorting to underhand
tactics to ensure that reformists do not take control of the Majlis, which is
now dominated by hard-liners.

<HEADLINE> Gambling Regulators Ban Kiddie Slots  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGIE WAGNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Elvis is in, ``South Park'' is out, say Nevada gambling
regulators who adopted new rules Thursday to eliminate slot machines geared
toward children.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the rules, any theme associated with a product currently intended for,
marketed to and used by people younger than 21 is off limits.
</P>
<P>
	   It means Vegas gamblers won't see the cartoon stars of ``South Park''
rolling up on the slots. ``Spiderman'' is unlikely, and Pokemon is out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
	   Decades-old cartoon flirt Betty Boop is OK, and game themes like Monopoly
and Wheel of Fortune can stay. Characters already common on slot machines are
also allowed to remain.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate over slot machine figures intensified last year when game
manufacturers introduced slot machines with television show themes such as ``The
Munsters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congressman John McCain said in December that he would ask the Federal Trade
Commission to review the games and he might have his Senate Commerce Committee
hold hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're sending a message that Nevada is perfectly capable of regulating
gambling in the state of Nevada,'' Nevada Gaming Commission Chairman Brian
Sandoval said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sara Beth Brown, general counsel for International Game Technology, the
world's largest slot machine manufacturer, said the industry welcomes the rule.
IGT's new games based on ``The Munsters'' still must be reviewed by regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't cater to those under 21. We don't want to attract them,'' she
said. ``It gives us a more precise standard before spending millions to obtain
rights to a theme.''
</P>
<P>
	   Children are allowed in casinos but no under 21 can be in a gambling
area.

<HEADLINE> John Hancock Launches IPO  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM KIRCHOFER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- John Hancock Financial Services Inc. completed its
long-awaited initial public offering Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange,
making it the first of a wave of big insurance companies to complete an IPO.
</P>
<P>
	   Hancock sold 102 million shares at $17 apiece late Wednesday, raising $1.73
billion. Shares opened Thursday at $17.75, but drifted slightly lower to $17.62
1/2 at 5:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're happy that the culmination of this long trip has come, and we're
looking forward to becoming a successful stock company," said Stephen L. Brown,
the company's chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   He brushed off the lackluster response of some Wall Street insiders who had
earlier expressed concerns about a variety of factors that could affect
Hancock's new stock, including higher interest rates and what some complained
were slow-growing profits and premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   "In talks with a variety of investors, we found people were quite impressed
with the way we improved our earnings over the years and broadened our
products," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   An additional 229.7 million shares were distributed to policy holders, who
had previously owned the company. Most of the money raised will be used to cash
out policy holders who are not eligible for stock or decide they don't want it.
</P>
<P>
	   New York-based Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. plans to go public in March
in what is expected to be the largest-ever IPO -- a $6 billion, 255-million
share deal. Prudential Insurance Co. of Newark-N.J., the nation's largest life
insurer, is also moving ahead with a plan to go public.
</P>
<P>
	   Although insurance stocks have been sluggish of late, Irv DeGraw, research
director of WorldFinanceNet.com, a Sarasota, Fla.-based provider of financial
information, said he didn't think the increasing number of insurance stocks
would glut the market.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had plenty of examples of how a big deal or two doesn't do that," he
said. He also noted that Wall Street underwriters, who buy stock from companies
going public and then sell it themselves, always make sure they have plenty of
buyers before offering a new stock.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the demand isn't out there, the underwriters will back away if they
think it's half-baked," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 138-year-old Hancock is completing a transition from a mutual company --
owned by policy holders -- to a stock company, which is owned by shareholders.
Company officials say they need to go public to raise capital for new
acquisitions in a consolidating financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
	   While some IPOs make wild increases on their first days of trading -- such
as Akamai Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, whose stock shot up 458 percent on its
first day of trading in October -- DeGraw said he expects Hancock to behave like
any large blue-chip corporation, with mild ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
	   But shareholders will have the final word on whether John Hancock is welcome
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   "IPO day for a deal of this size is not representative of much," he said.
"Are the people who got all they wanted today going to hold it or are they going
to start moving it around? If they start moving it, it'll go down."

<HEADLINE> Lee Lawyers Challenges Defense Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Attorneys for a former Los Alamos scientist accused
of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets are trying to overturn a law that
requires them to reveal details of their defense to prosecutors before trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Wen Ho Lee filed a motion Wednesday to have parts of the
Classified Information Procedures Act voided as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   The law's interest in protecting national security ``cannot justify the
burden'' on Lee's rights, his attorneys argued. The defense team said the
prosecution is under no obligation to disclose similar details of its case.
</P>
<P>
	   Criminal defendants generally do not have to reveal details of their defense
to prosecutors before trial. But the 1980 law demands such details. It was
passed to prevent someone accused of spying from disclosing so many secrets that
prosecutors would find the case too damaging to the nation's security interests.
</P>
<P>
	   The law requires Lee's defense attorneys to list and justify any secrets
they expect to use, with the filings made in sealed documents and closed
hearings. They must tell prosecutors what questions they might ask government
witnesses and what Lee might say if he testifies. If challenged, they must
explain why the information is important to their case.
</P>
<P>
	   The law has withstood several such challenges. A spokeswoman for the U.S.
Attorney's office did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, 60, could face life in prison if he is convicted of breaching security
by moving classified material to unsecure computers and computer tapes. The
prosecution has called the data he downloaded the ``crown jewels'' of American
science.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee is being held without bail.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Martin Cutting 2,800 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
    By KATHY GAMBRELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp., a maker of missiles and stealth
fighters, is eliminating at least 2,800 jobs as it streamlines its troubled
aeronautics and space divisions. But analysts said the company will need to do
far more, and its stock fell more than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The plans for a 2 percent reduction in a work force of 140,000 were
announced Thursday and follow a series of disappointments in those sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bethesda, Md.-based company, which is the second-largest defense
business after Boeing Co., said the cuts would save $200 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The layoffs are a step in the right direction, but not enough, said analyst
Joseph Campbell of Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is part of a thousand little things they need to do," Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Ernst of Prudential Securities said Lockheed has systemic problems that
need attention and may not be resolved in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are taking action to reduce costs, but we're looking for more action
to reshape their portfolio. I think it's going to be challenging to get a large
recovery in 2000," Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, fell 62 1/2 cents to $19.43
3/4 a share Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the cuts will take place in the aeronautical systems business, which
would be consolidated into a single unit to be called Lockheed Martin
Aeronautics Co., headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and headed by Dain Hancock,
a Lockheed Martin executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2,500 job cuts in the aeronautics division will be spread about equally
among the company's three primary sites in Georgia, California and Texas, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed previously announced it was cutting 2,000 workers at its Marietta,
Ga., plant, which makes C-130J military-transport planes and F-22 stealth
fighters, bringing the total work force reduction to 4,500 in the aeronautics
sector.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the space systems business will establish a new Lockheed Martin
Space Systems Co. in Denver that will be led by Albert Smith, another executive
vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   "These actions are the direct result of our continuing drive to improve our
customer focus, flatten our management structure and enhance our financial
performance," said Vance Coffman, chairman and chief executive officer of
Lockheed Martin. "They will result in real savings and ensure greater
flexibility allowing us to successfully adapt to changing market conditions,
maintain the level of program execution our customers expect, while improving
our ability to react to new business opportunities."
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Nisbet of JSA Research Inc. said reducing layers of management will
improve communication but that Lockheed will have to do more.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most companies are experiencing weakening revenues. There's been an
increase in appropriations for defense procurement, but it takes a while for
that to trickle through," Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter B. Teets, Lockheed's president and chief operating officer stepped
down last year, taking responsibility for disappointing financial results which
led the defense contractor to slash its earnings estimates for this year by more
than half.
</P>
<P>
	   James "Mickey" Blackwell also left as head of aeronautical systems, which
makes the F-16 jet fighter and was the poorest performer last year among
Lockheed's four core businesses.

<HEADLINE> Envoy: Agreement Soon in Nazi Case  </HEADLINE>
   By KIM GAMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- U.S. envoy Stuart Eizenstat predicted Thursday
that an agreement on distributing payments to survivors of Nazi-era forced and
slave labor would be reached in four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany's Cabinet approved a draft law Wednesday on distributing payments to
survivors of Nazi-era forced and slave labor, but it was not made public and
officials said there was still time to change it to answer criticism by lawyers
and victims' groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Eizenstat said he was optimistic about the next round of negotiations, which
were to begin Monday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope it'll be completed in four to six weeks,'' he said Thursday,
referring to the agreement at a briefing for reporters on the sidelines of the
International Forum on the Holocaust. ``By the end of this year we could begin
processing claims.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed law has come under attack because earlier versions counted
previous compensation against payments victims could receive from the new $5.2
billion fund, which was proposed by German industry facing the pressure of
class-action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany has paid the equivalent of about $60 billion in compensation for
other Nazi crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Eizenstat, who is also U.S. deputy treasury secretary, said the goal was to
provide closure for such cases and if similar lawsuits were filed in the future,
the United States would ``file a rather unique statement that dismissal of the
cases would be in our national interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Victims also have complained the draft would limit compensation to workers
deported to Germany under its 1937 borders, before Adolf Hitler's offensives
into Europe started.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to 2.3 million people, mostly non-Jews from Eastern Europe, stand to
receive payments from the new fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Eizenstat said the bulk of the funds would go to survivors, but insurance
companies and other claimants would get a ``dignified amount.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fund is to be split evenly between industry and government.

<HEADLINE> Euro Hits New Low Vs. Dollar  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro tumbled to a new low against the dollar Thursday,
sinking below the $1 level for the second time in a week, as traders tested to
see how far down they could push the currency.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro sank as low as 98.69 cents during New York trading, its lowest
level yet and well below its previous level of $1.0013 the day before. The euro
recovered somewhat by Thursday afternoon and was trading at 98.86 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro has been drifting lower recently on expectations that U.S. economic
growth would outpace Europe's, but currency traders said that with growth
prospects turning up in Europe that the markets seemed to be testing the euro's
guardians to see how far they would let the currency slip.
</P>
<P>
	   European Central Bank officials have said they would let the markets decide
the euro's level against other currencies. But with the euro dropping against
the dollar this week, speculation has been rising as to how long European
officials will forgo using tools such as currency-buying intervention and
interest rate increases to protect their currency, which came into the world in
early 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the market is a bit disappointed that there doesn't appear to be
any strategy towards the euro among the ECB and what they think are appropriate
levels," said Bob Sinche, a currency strategist at Citigroup. "There's a sense
of things being adrift."
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also rose sharply versus the Swiss franc, which often moves in
tandem with the euro even though Switzerland is not one of the 11 countries
participating in the currency union. The dollar was quoted at 1.6316 Swiss
francs in New York, up sharply from 1.6103 the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.09 Japanese yen, down from
105.73 yen, and 1.4337 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4377. The British pound
rose to $1.6388 from $1.6380.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies participating in the euro are no longer traded separately and are
tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was
worth: 1.9780 German marks, down from 1.9533; 6.6339 French francs, down from
6.5511; and 1,958.20 Italian lire, down from 1,933.76.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Iraq Insepction Head Approved  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan officially appointed
Hans Blix to head the new U.N. weapons inspection team on Thursday, a day after
the Security Council gave its informal approval to the Swede.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Annan said he had received the council's formal approval in
a letter Thursday and that he expected Blix to start his new post as soon as
possible. Blix was traveling in Antarctica but was expected back in Stockholm in
the first week of February.
</P>
<P>
	   The retired chief of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency has a near-thankless
job ahead of him as executive chairmen of the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The new agency, known by its acronym UNMOVIC, was created by the Security
Council in December to replace the first weapons inspection agency for Iraq, the
U.N. Special Commission. The commission pulled out of Iraq ahead of U.S. and
British airstrikes in December 1998 and was barred from returning.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Blix's first tasks will be to create a work program, and then draw up
a list of key remaining questions about Iraq's disarmament that Baghdad must
answer before the council would consider suspending sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   Both are sure to be subject to intense political dispute within the
15-member council, which was deadlocked for a year on creating the arms agency
and then stymied for a month in trying to find someone to head it.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and Britain are sure to demand more from Iraq on the
disarmament list than Baghdad's key allies on the council, Russia China and
France, who have been pressing to have sanctions lifted altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   Blix, a former Swedish foreign minister, was director general of the
International Atomic Energy Agency from 1981 until he retired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The IAEA worked with the Special Commission in ridding Iraq of its weapons
of mass destruction, as called for by U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Iraq said it still had misgivings about the resolution that
created UNMOVIC. ``The matter is more complicated than the issue of Blix or the
naming of a new commission,'' a deputy foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoon, told the
French-sponsored, Arabic-language Radio Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq, however, has generally been more responsive to the IAEA, which was
much less confrontational than the Special Commission in uncovering Iraq's
weapons programs.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Worst of Flu Season Over  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Winter is far from over, but the government reported Thursday
that the worst of the flu season appears to have passed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a possibility that, in some regions of the country, influenza may
not have peaked yet,'' said Dr. Tim Uyeki of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. ``But for the majority of the country, influenza appears to have
peaked.''
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC said it concluded the flu season is waning because fewer people are
testing positive for flu virus and doctors report seeing fewer patients with
flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   At the flu season's peak, the last week of 1999, doctors reported that 6
percent of their patients that week had flu-like symptoms. Two weeks later, it
had dropped to 4 percent.

<HEADLINE> For Hillary Clinton, first State of the Union as candidate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - What a difference a year makes.
<P>
	   Last January, with the Monica Lewinsky scandal still swirling, Hillary
Rodham Clinton watched her husband's State of the Union speech sitting next to
Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, the newly-minted New York Yankees fan is running for the U.S.
Senate from her adopted home state. No longer pitied as the wronged wife, Mrs.
Clinton is raising millions of dollars to take on New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in what is shaping up as one of the nation's marquee political
matchups.
</P>
<P>
	   As her husband delivers his last State of the Union, Mrs. Clinton's
political career is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   She has moved out of the White House and into a newly-purchased home in
Chappaqua. In a sign of just how much things have changed, she commuted to
Washington for her husband's address from fundraisers for her own campaign in
South Florida. Once a Chicago Cubs fan, the Illinois native has now embraced the
Yankees as her American League team.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Clinton's speech was to focus on broad issues, like ambitious plans to
spend more to improve health care and education. They are some of the same
issues Mrs. Clinton will make key in her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the specific initiatives the president was expected to mention - a
plan to make college tuition tax deductible - was first advanced by Sen. Charles
Schumer in his successful bid to oust then-Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998. Mrs.
Clinton is also expected to campaign on that issue as she tries to appeal to
some of the same middle-class suburban voters who helped Schumer get elected.
</P>
<P>
	   If she is successful in her bid for office the first lady will trade in her
coveted front-row seat in the visitors' gallery for a spot on the crowded House
floor. There she will be elbow-to-elbow with some of the same lawmakers who
voted to impeach her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those expected to be sitting with the first lady in the visitors box
Thursday night were the co-captain of the United States World Cup champion
women's soccer team, the father of a student killed in the Columbine High School
shooting and a reformed deadbeat dad.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Offer made for Watervliet Arsenal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WATERVLIET, N.Y. (AP) - Three major defense companies have made an offer
to take over operation of the nation's oldest arsenal from the U.S. Army.
<P>
	   The unsolicited proposal came earlier this month from General Dynamics,
United Defense and British Aerospace, Steven Abney, a spokesman for the U.S.
Army Industrial Operations Command, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Army officials will start negotiations with the companies to determine
whether the proposal has the potential to benefit the arsenal and maintain
critical job skills, Abney said.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Army needing fewer large cannons, which is the arsenal's major
product, the work load there is dwindling. The most recent round of layoffs sent
45 workers out the gate. The arsenal now employs about 670 employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Abney said that if a timely agreement is reached, a contract for howitzer
work that the Navy is looking to award to a United Defense plant in Louisville,
Ky. could be kept in Watervliet.
</P>
<P>
	   The news of the three-company offer and visit was welcomed by a spokesman
for Rep. Michael McNulty, D-Green Island, who has been working with the Army in
a so-far losing effort to save jobs at the arsenal.
</P>
<P>
	   The arsenal had about 4,000 workers in 1989. Because the arsenal isn't
supported with tax dollars, it must survive on what it sells - and Uncle Sam
isn't buying what he used to.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of the guns made there are currently sold to allies. Work orders
there have dropped from $164 million in 1994 to about $86 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The three defense company giants want a long-term contract to run the
Army-owned arsenal in an equal partnership, said Cliff Bushey, vice president
for strategic planning for General Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was "too early to say" what that might mean for arsenal's
workers.

<HEADLINE> American Home Products settles Fen-Phen lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) - American Home Products settled a lawsuit with
the family of a Quincy woman who died after taking the fen-phen drug combination
in an attempt to lose weight for her wedding, the company announced Thursday.
<P>
	   Terms of the deal with relatives of Mary J. Linnen were not released, but
the Madison, N.J.-based company said much of the settlement will be used to fund
a medical research foundation established by the Linnen family.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products' Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division marketed the
"fen" drugs fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, which were combined with
phentermine to make "fen-phen."
</P>
<P>
	   The Linnens' lawsuit against phentermine-maker Fisons Corp. of Collegeville,
Pa., was dropped earlier this month after a judge ruled a medical witness'
conclusions were too speculative.
</P>
<P>
	   The Linnens' wrongful death case was the first filed against American Home
Products in connection with the fen-phen drugs, said their lawyer, Alex
MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost six million Americans took the diet drug combination until it was
banned by the Food and Drug Administration in 1997 after reports that some users
developed serious, and sometimes fatal, heart problems.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement by the company did not address the issue of whether or not
American Home Products admitted any wrongdoing, and Wyeth spokesman Doug Petkus
refused to comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But in their lawsuit in Middlesex Superior Court, Linnen's parents, Thomas
F. and Mary J. Linnen, of Palm Coast, Fla., claimed that an autopsy at
Massachusetts General Hospital determined their daughter died as a result of
"pulmonary hypertension associated with fenfluramine and phentermine therapy for
endogenous obesity."
</P>
<P>
	   In October, American Home Products agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle
thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to
fen-phen. But the settlement only applied to patients with possible heart valve
problems. It did not cover Linnen, who suffered primary pulmonary hypertension,
said Alex Zisson, an industry analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has set aside approximately another $1 billion to deal with
other claims that might arise. Even though the exact terms of the Linnen
settlement weren't known, Zisson said Wall Street had been given no reason to
believe it jeopardized that reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   "They haven't given out a dollar figure, but at this point they've said the
charge will be adequate," Zisson said. "Wall Street at this point just wants all
the fen-phen litigation to go away. Even if American Home has to pay a little
more than the cases deserve, Wall Street would say that's a good deal."
</P>
<P>
	   Even at the time fen-phen was being marketed, primary pulmonary hypertension
was a recognized, although rare, side effect, Zisson said. The Linnens claimed
their daughter wasn't notified of the risk.
</P>
<P>
	   The Linnens and American Home Products settled the lawsuit after it went to
trial. The family claimed Mary Linnen developed PPH after taking fen-phen for 11
days in 1996, although the company disputed at trial that its drug could be
conclusively linked to her condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Linnen died in February 1997. The settlement also covered her doctor,
Abby Landzberg, of Newton.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Linnens' case was the first wrongful death lawsuit filed in
connection with fen-phen, it was not the first settled. In Houston last year,
relatives of 35-year-old Mary Marisa Smith, who claimed fen-phen killed her,
agreed to settle for an undisclosed amount of money three weeks into trial.

<P>
	   Property owners who had planned to irrigate the land to plant apple
orchards, cacao trees and grazing pasture complained that police were not
enforcing their rights. Several landowners admitted to hiring armed thugs to
remove the hundreds of people who had moved onto their property in the past four
days, setting up crude shacks with straw mats and wooden poles.
</P>
<P>
	   President Alberto Fujimori condemned the violence but said police would not
take action to remove the families that had moved onto the 124-acre piece of
land.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An eviction under these conditions with a group of many people in the area
could generate confrontations with grave consequences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the violence in Lima's Villa El Salvador district, four people killed
by gunfire were taken to the Lima morgue, officials said. The district's mayor,
Martin Pumar, told reporters that 40 people had suffered injuries ranging from
cuts and burns to bullet wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Squatter invasions are common in the shantytowns that ring the capital, but
the squatters usually move onto state-owned property.
</P>
<P>
	   Lima's Villa El Salvador district was founded in 1971 by about 200 families
from Lima slums and shantytowns who seized a strip of government-owned land on
the coastal desert eight miles south of the city. The district's size swelled in
the following 20 years as tens of thousands of Andean peasants migrated to Lima
in search of jobs.

<HEADLINE> Prominent fertility doctor goes on trial for insurance fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A prominent doctor who solved the infertility riddle for
hundreds of women stole more than $2 million from insurance companies by lying
about his work, a prosecutor alleged Thursday as a trial opened.
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Christine Chung described Dr. Niels Lauersen as a
Park Avenue specialist in her opening statement in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   "You might not think Park Avenue doctors lie to line their pockets," she
said. "Ripping somebody off. That's what the evidence is going to show these
doctors did. They stole millions of dollars by telling lies year after year
after year."
</P>
<P>
	   Lauersen, an obstetrician and gynecologist, and Dr. Magda Binion, an
anesthesiologist, were on trial on charges of conspiracy, health care fraud and
mail fraud in connection with an alleged 10-year scheme to falsely bill
fertility surgeries that were not covered by insurance as gynecological
surgeries which were.
</P>
<P>
	   Theodore D. Wells, Lauersen's lawyer, portrayed his 63-year-old client as a
hero to patients struggling to have a child.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged that the doctor often did not bill insurance companies for
the expense of matching sperm and eggs in a laboratory before inserting the
combination into women to raise the odds of a successful pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said the doctor was nearly always able to bill the insurance company
accurately for treatment of the underlying physical problems preventing
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is going to be an exciting case," he said. "It's a real case. It's
about my client's life."
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of prosecutors crowded the courtroom along with supporters of
Lauersen, including women he had treated.
</P>
<P>
	   As Wells finished, some supporters applauded, prompting Judge William H.
Pauley to admonish: "This is not a theater. This is not a sports arena. There
will be no applause."
</P>
<P>
	   Lauersen, the author of "It's Your Body," has appeared frequently on
television and in publications as an expert on fertility matters, which make up
about 10 percent of his practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Chung said the conspiracy started in 1987 as Lauersen falsely charged
insurance companies $7,500 at least 500 times, collecting at least $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "He decided he was going to lie and defraud and cheat the insurance
companies," Chung said. "For every patient he had - rich, poor or somewhere in
between - this is what he did."
</P>
<P>
	   She said he alleged on forms that women were bleeding or in pain, requiring
surgical procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was no bleeding. There was no pain. There was no problem. The women
were there because they were trying to have a baby," Chung said.
</P>
<P>
	   The scheme was unearthed by suspicious insurance companies, one of which
checked their files over a seven-year period and found Lauersen led every doctor
in the country in almost every category for which he submitted claims, the
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said former patients would testify, along with a doctor who formerly
worked with Lauersen.
</P>
<P>
	   Chung warned the jury to forget the infertility debate.
</P>
<P>
	   "The case is not about whether fertility procedures are a good or a bad
thing," she said. "They bring joy to a lot of people."
</P>
<P>
	   Wells said prosecutors were relying on "false accusations and distortions of
the truth."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the doctor who will testify against his client was a former drug
addict who stole drugs from Lauersen for his personal use.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyer said his client also was sloppy with paperwork because he was
overworked.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had to use some standard forms and some of his paperwork is screwed up.
But that does not make him a criminal," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Repeatedly, Wells told the jury his client was dealing with "big" insurance
companies as he treated a mix of patients so diverse in income and background
that it could rival the United Nations in makeup.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that his client was outspoken about the failure of insurance
companies to treat women equally.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was no fraud, you will see," he said.

<HEADLINE> FTC Postpones Amoco-BP Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission abruptly postponed a meeting
it had scheduled for Friday, raising new questions about the direction it plans
to take in dealing with the proposed BP Amoco-Arco oil merger.
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioners had been expected to consider the agency's next move on
the deal at Friday's closed session, although FTC officials refused to say
whether the case was even on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   FTC officials gave no reason for postponing the session until Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco's proposed $29 billion acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co., or
Arco as it is commonly known, has been in trouble at the FTC for weeks because
of concern about its impact on retail competition in the West Coast gasoline
market.
</P>
<P>
	   After the two companies notified the FTC on Jan. 15 that they planned to
proceed with the merger with or without agency approval, the discussions shifted
from trying to work out a settlement to the FTC preparing to fight the merger in
the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco executives had expected the FTC to formally decide at this week's
meeting to seek an injunction and try to block the merger in the federal courts.
FTC officials have told some members of Congress that they were prepared for the
case to got on for several months, according one congressional source, who spoke
on condition of not being further identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither FTC officials nor BP Amoco executives would comment Thursday on
whether any progress had been made in trying to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are continuing to have discussions with the FTC,'' said BP Amoco
spokesman Tom Koch, from the company's offices in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Vickie Streitfeld, a spokeswoman for the FTC, said by law she could not
comment on the BP Amoco-Arco case, or even whether it is on the agency's agenda
for Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the FTC staff proposed that the merger not be approved,
according to sources familiar with to the discussions. And FTC Chairman Robert
Pitofsky is believed to have reservations about the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC staff has raised serious concerns that the combining of the two oil
companies, which together control about 70 percent of the oil production in
Alaska's North Slope, would harm competition in California and the Northwest,
areas that rely heavily on Alaska crude.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco and Arco have argued that West Coast prices are dictated by the
global oil market, and not Alaska production.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the two companies have offered a number of concessions. They've
offered to jettison a chunk of their production, and to market about a third of
their remaining oil in long-term contracts. That still would leave the two
companies with about 55 percent of North Slope production.

<HEADLINE> Labor Leader Pleading in Tax Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The former head of the Laborers' International Union of North
America has agreed to plead guilty to evading $100,000 in taxes on expensive
sports cars, federal prosecutors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Arthur A. Coia, 56, of Barrington, R.I., was charged in federal court with
mail fraud in a scheme to evade state and local taxes in Rhode Island on a
succession of Ferraris.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although he spent well over $1 million on Ferrari automobiles, Mr. Coia
repeatedly found ways to shirk his duty to pay his taxes,'' U.S. Attorney Donald
K. Stern said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coia and the government agreed to ask a judge for a sentence of two years
probation, along with $100,000 in restitution to Rhode Island and the town of
Barrington, and a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge George O'Toole is expected to decide whether to accept
the plea agreement at a hearing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Coia retired as general president of the union Jan. 1. The union has more
than 800,000 members, mostly in the construction, environmental cleanup and
maintenance industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Coia, whose telephone number in Barrington is unpublished, could not be
reached for comment Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Bobbitt found guilty of harassment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NORTH TONAWANDA, N.Y. (AP) - John Wayne Bobbitt, who made national
headlines after his then-wife Lorena Bobbitt was charged with cutting off his
penis in 1993, was found guilty of harassment in the second degree in North
Tonawanda City Court Wednesday.
<P>
	   Bobbitt, 32, was arrested Nov. 2, 1999 following an altercation with a
former girlfriend, adult film star Desiree A. Luz, in their North Tonawanda
apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   Bobbitt spent 17 days in Niagara County Jail while he waited to raise the
$50,000 bail, and was released with time served. He is prohibited by the court
to contact or communicate with Ms. Luz in any way.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was innocent," said Bobbitt outside the courthouse. "I wasn't prepared
for the defense and I was innocent."
</P>
<P>
	   Bobbitt was thrust into the national spotlight in 1993 when his wife was
charged with cutting off his penis while he slept. Lorena Bobbitt had argued
she'd been the victim of an abusive husband and was found innocent by reason of
insanity.
</P>
<P>
	   After successful surgery to reattach his penis, Bobbitt made appearances on
the Howard Stern Show and has made a number of adult films. In 1997, Bobbitt
moved to Nevada and worked in a brothel in Carson City, where Luz also worked.
</P>
<P>
	   During that time Bobbitt was accused twice of beating up a topless dancer
who was his fiancDee.
</P>
<P>
	   Since returning to North Tonawanda, Bobbitt has worked as a bartender and
tow truck operator.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Leader Pauses on Gov't  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Faced with an international outcry, Austria's
president decided Thursday to wait until next week before requesting the
formation of a new government that would include the controversial far-right
party of Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider is best known for his statements sympathetic to aspects of the Nazi
regime, and international pressure was mounting Thursday against a coalition
including Haider's Freedom Party. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak telephoned
leaders of France, Germany and Spain to urge them to join in an international
effort to warn Austria of the consequences.
</P>
<P>
	   The Austrian Press Agency said the Belgian government was urging a meeting
of European Union foreign ministers to adopt a ``common position'' against the
far-right sharing power in the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
	   Austrian President Thomas Klestil told reporters he would meet Haider and
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel of the Austrian People's Party, possibly
Monday, to discuss their informal talks on forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil's statement followed a meeting with caretaker Chancellor Viktor
Klima, who reported his failure to win parliamentary support for a minority
government of his Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The president had asked Klima to explore prospects for a minority
administration after the failure of talks on renewing the 13-year coalition
between the Social Democrats and the People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   After that failure, the Austrian president customarily would turn to the
party that placed second in the last elections, held Oct. 3. That would be
Haider's party, which finished about 400 votes ahead of Schuessel's party.
</P>
<P>
	   But Haider's previous statements, as well as his party's longtime skepticism
of the European Union and hostility toward immigration, have made him one of
Europe's most controversial political figures.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1991, Haider praised Adolf Hitler's ``orderly employment policy'' and
four years later lauded veterans of the Waffen SS as ``decent people of good
character.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the October election, Haider's party played on fears that immigrants
and an expanded EU would cost Austrians jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   People's Party leaders have been scrambling to defend their negotiations
with the Freedom Party. During a visit Thursday to the European Council in
Strasbourg, France, Schuessel told reporters that a People's Party-Freedom Party
coalition would remain committed to European values.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Austrian voters are not radical right-wingers,'' Schuessel said,
according to the Austria Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   But in London, Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman indicated the British
leader was concerned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whilst maintaining the position that it's wrong for us to interfere in
other countries' domestic politics, he (Blair) has a deep loathing of far-right
policies,'' said Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell.
</P>
<P>
	   French Premier Lionel Jospin told reporters Thursday in Stockholm, Sweden,
that the prospect of a coalition including ``a rightist extremist party which
had not dealt with its Nazi past is something that is seriously worrying both
the French government and myself.''
</P>
<P>
	   French President Jacques Chirac telephoned Klestil on Thursday to discuss
the political situation in Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicole Fontaine, the conservative president of the European Parliament, said
Haider's party represents an ideology that ``runs counter to the humanist values
which are the foundation of all democratic societies.''
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union ``is founded on the values of respect for human rights
and the rejection of exclusion,'' she said. ``It would be intolerable that a
party that negates these fundamental principles takes power in a member state of
the EU.''

<HEADLINE> N.H. Investigates Sex in County Jail  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE WEBSTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Immigration officials planned to remove more than
200 criminal aliens from a county jail while state and federal authorities
investigate allegations that some guards sexually abused female inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen women were removed Wednesday from the Hillsborough County Jail, the
largest holding facility for criminal aliens in New England.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Marshals planned to
remove 238 men, more than one-third of the jail population, by Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS detainees -- illegal immigrants or permanent residents convicted of
crimes -- are being moved to facilities in other states.
</P>
<P>
	   Treatment of inmates at the facility has been an issue before. Some
detainees staged a hunger strike in August, saying they were denied medical
treatment, were locked in their cells 20 hours a day and were allowed only
half-hour visits.
</P>
<P>
	   The move comes only days after state authorities began investigating the
recent deaths of an inmate and a former inmate.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior Assistant Attorney General Mark Zuckerman said the U.S. Attorney's
Office and the FBI were investigating possible civil rights violations in the
allegations of sexual assault, while his office was looking at possible criminal
violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Sex between an inmate and a corrections officer could result in a rape
charge against the officer, because the officer is duty-bound not to exploit his
position of power, Zuckerman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The corrections officers remain on the job. Zuckerman said it was too soon
to recommend that anyone be suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   Jail Superintendent James O'Mara said he had heard no specifics about the
investigation and had no idea who was under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody who is committed to our custody is treated humanely and safely,
and if someone in my employ has acted wrongly, we all want to get to the bottom
of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Farquharson, director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
Boston office, said the U.S. Attorney in Concord had requested the removal of
all INS detainees because of concern for their safety.
</P>
<P>
	   County officials said the male inmates were being removed because of a
dispute over a delay in INS payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS pays the county $65 per day per detainee, amounting to about $5
million a year, or nearly half the jail's operating budget.

<HEADLINE> Hillary As Candidate At Address  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
	   Last January, the Monica Lewinsky scandal still swirled as Hillary Rodham
Clinton watched her husband's State of the Union speech. Seated next to her was
slugger Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, for whom the first lady rooted while
growing up in suburban Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, she is an ardent New York Yankee fan and owner of a $1.7 million
home north of New York City that will serve as a base for her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is raising millions of dollars to take on New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani in what is shaping up as one of the nation's top political
contests this year.
</P>
<P>
	   As her husband delivers his last State of the Union, Mrs. Clinton's
political career is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   She has moved out of the White House and into the home in Chappaqua, N.Y. In
a sign of just how much things have changed, she commuted to Washington for her
husband's address from fund-raisers for her own campaign in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   The president was focusing in his speech on broad issues such as ambitious
plans to spend more to improve health care and education -- some of the same
issues Mrs. Clinton will make key in her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the specific initiatives the president planned to mention -- making
college tuition tax deductible -- first was advanced by Democratic Rep. Charles
Schumer of New York in his successful bid to oust GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, too, is expected to campaign on that issue as she tries to
appeal to some of the same middle-class suburban voters who helped Schumer get
elected.
</P>
<P>
	   If she is successful in her bid for office the first lady will trade in her
coveted front-row seat in the visitors' gallery for a spot on the crowded House
floor. There she will be elbow-to-elbow with some of the same lawmakers who
voted to impeach her husband.

<HEADLINE> Leader: Coup Plotters Have No Effect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The decision by a constitutional assembly to
reinstate former soldiers who participated in two coup attempts, including one
led by President Hugo Chavez, will not affect military discipline in Venezuela,
the defense minister said.
</P>
<P>
	   The estimated 250 former coup plotters will be taken before a disciplinary
council if they do not ``adjust to the established order of their respective
force,'' Defense Minister Raul Salazar said in comments published Thursday by
the El Universal newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates to the constitutional assembly decreed Tuesday the coup
participants could rejoin the military at their previous rank, saying the coup
attempts were ``legitimized'' by Chavez's election a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, a former lieutenant colonel, led a failed coup in February 1992
against then President Carlos Andres Perez. A second attempt in November 1992,
led by pro-Chavez factions, also failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez was pardoned in 1994 by Perez' successor.
</P>
<P>
	   Several coup plotters have taken up government posts under Chavez'
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics believe the reinstatements encourage soldiers to take up arms
against their superiors. They say the move could also cause friction between the
coup plotters and the majority of troops who remained loyal to the government.

<HEADLINE> On eve of his sentencing, Patrick Bennett asks that judge be  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Former Syracuse businessman Patrick R. Bennett has
failed to remove the judge in his fraud case prior to his sentencing.
<P>
	   Bennett's attorney, Michael Pinnisi, said late Thursday that the judge won't
be removed. Pinnisi had sought the removal because he said U.S. District Court
Judge John S. Martin showed bias when he suggested that Bennett plea bargain the
case before it went to trial last year. Pinnisi also argued that Martin showed
bias when he harshly rebuked Bennett after his conviction last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinnisi formally asked Martin last week to remove himself from the case.
Bennett was to ask a federal appeals court on Thursday to appoint another judge
to decide if Martin should be removed.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge has told Bennett that he will consider the motion to remove
himself, but that the sentencing will be Friday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett, 47, faces up to 30 years in prison for his role in cheating
thousands of investors out of $512 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin postponed sentencing from December to give Bennett more time to pay
$109 million the court ordered him to forfeit after the conviction. Bennett and
his family say they do not have the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett claims that during a meeting with defense lawyers and prosecutors
before the trial last summer Martin suggested a plea bargain. The judge
recommended that Bennett receive a 10-year sentence as part of the bargaining,
Pinnisi said.
</P>
<P>
	   The suggestion was inappropriate, Pinnisi contends, and Martin should
therefore remove himself from the case. After the trial and verdict, Martin told
Bennett he showed no respect for the law.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly, this trial showed that Patrick R. Bennett is a totally amoral
individual who engaged in any criminal conduct that benefits him," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also is scheduled to sentence three other men - including
Bennett's brother, Michael - who have pleaded guilty to helping Patrick Bennett
cover up the crimes at Bennett Funding Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett was chief financial officer of the family-owned business, which
financed office equipment rentals with money from investors and banks. Over the
course of two trials, juries convicted Bennett of 49 charges of securities
fraud, bank fraud, money laundering, lying and hindering an investigation of his
business. He has been in federal prison since June.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Bennett, 42, was the company's deputy chief executive officer. He
pleaded guilty in 1998 to charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and
perjury. He faces a maximum of 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Former company employees Anthony Menchella and Al Cerimeli pleaded guilty in
1996 to charges they conspired with Bennett to lie to investigators. They were
the first defendants to plead guilty in the case. Each faces a maximum of 10
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC began investigating the Bennett companies in 1993. Prosecutors said
Bennett asked others to lie and backdate documents to hide wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   The scheme collapsed in 1996 when the government brought criminal charges
against Bennett. The Bennett companies owed more than $1 billion and are now in
bankruptcy. Their operations are winding down and a trustee is gathering assets
to pay off 21,000 creditors.

<HEADLINE> Study: New Clot-Busting Pill a Dud  </HEADLINE>
    By EMMA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- A new drug many hoped would be a powerful alternative to
aspirin for preventing heart attacks turns out to be no better than the old
standby.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first head-to-head published comparison, the experimental
clot-blocking drug sibrafiban was about the same as aspirin at preventing severe
chest pain, a second heart attack or death.
</P>
<P>
	   Aspirin is standard treatment for people with heart trouble because it helps
stop the formation of blood clots, which can trigger heart attacks. Aspirin
reduces the risk of further heart problems by about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Sibrafiban is one of a new class of medicines called glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
receptor antagonists. These drugs are sometimes called "super aspirin" because
of their supposed potency against clots.
</P>
<P>
	   Injected versions help save lives immediately after heart attacks. New pill
varieties, like sibrafiban, are intended for long-term use.
</P>
<P>
	   "The hope was that it would be far superior, but it turned out to be not
much better," said Dr. Kristin Newby, a Duke University heart specialist who led
the study, published in this week's issue of the British medical journal The
Lancet.
</P>
<P>
	   However, experts say may it may still be possible to improve the new pill's
punch.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is our first result really. We've basically had one shot and now we're
regrouping," said Dr. Christopher Cannon, a cardiologist at Brigham &AMP; Women's
Hospital in Boston, who was not connected with the study but has done similar
research.
</P>
<P>
	   The right formulation and dose regimen could help as many as 12 million
people with heart trouble worldwide, Cannon said. Such pills would most likely
be used in combination with aspirin for the maximum effect.
</P>
<P>
	   "It took 15 years to get cholesterol drugs right," Cannon noted. "And
beta-blockers for congestive heart failure -- 10 or 15 years ago it didn't look
good, but now that we've got the dose right, it works."
</P>
<P>
	   Years of cholesterol buildup on artery walls can suddenly cause a tear.
Blood cells called platelets then activate and move to the wound to form a clot
to stop it bleeding. As the clot becomes larger, it blocks blood flow to the
heart.
</P>
<P>
	   Clots occur when platelets clump together, bound by a protein called
fibrinogen that hooks onto the platelets' surface. Sibrafiban and similar drugs
work by interfering with fibrinogen.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest study was conducted on 9,233 recent heart attack survivors. They
were randomly assigned to three months of aspirin, low-dose sibrafiban or
high-dose sibrafiban. Ten percent in each group died or suffered new heart
attacks or severe chest pain during the followup.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Poll: Gore Closes on Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has closed the gap against George
W. Bush in a potential presidential matchup, says a national poll released
Thursday -- 10 months ahead of the November election.
</P>
<P>
	   The NBC-Wall Street Journal poll also found a majority of Americans happy
with the direction of the country and two-thirds gave President Clinton high job
approval marks, said the poll made public on the day of Clinton's final State of
the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   The national poll showed Republican front-runner Bush at 47 percent and
Democratic front-runner Gore at 44 percent. Gore had trailed the Republican in
head-to-head matchups throughout 1999. The poll of 1,010 American adults taken
Jan. 25-26 had a 3 percentage point error margin, larger for subgroups.
</P>
<P>
	   When Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan was included in the general
election matchup, both Gore and Bush were at 43 percent and Buchanan was at 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Bush led by 50 percent to 39 percent and has maintained an
average double-digit lead over Gore in the poll throughout 1999. Bush had an
8-point lead over former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival, in a head-to-head
matchup.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore's problem in 1999 was consolidating Democrats,'' said Fred Yang, a
partner in one of the firms that conducted the poll, Peter D. Hart Research
Associates. ``As a result of Iowa, he has quickly been able to consolidate his
Democratic support.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore leads Bradley in polling for the New Hampshire primary next Tuesday.
Sen. John McCain and Bush are locked in a tough battle there, with McCain
leading in some polls and tied with Bush in others.
</P>
<P>
	   The differences since December in the poll by Democratic pollster Hart and
Republican pollster Bob Teeter were likely the result of Gore's performance in
the weeks leading up to his victory in the Iowa caucuses Monday night, Yang
said, citing other polling data on Gore in the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is clearly a good poll for Gore, but it's not a bad poll for Bush.
His numbers still hold up very well,'' said Yang, noting the public still has a
positive view of Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Teeter said the poll indicated you've got ``a country that is happy,
affluent and thinks things are going pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Bush remains very popular with the public and he saw the closing of
the gap as natural as the race takes shape.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't tell if Gore is getting a blip because he's been in the public a
lot and beaten Bradley and we'll see that go back down,'' Teeter said, noting
that Bush still had a 14-point lead among independent voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore led Bradley 64 percent to 22 percent, compared with a 54 percent-to-32
percent Gore lead in the December poll. Bush led McCain nationally, 63 percent
to 15 percent, in the new poll, about the same margin as in December.
</P>
<P>
	   When Americans were asked whether they wanted a presidential candidate whose
views were more liberal, more conservative or the same as Clinton's, 50 percent
said about the same, 37 percent said more conservative and 8 percent said more
liberal.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term bond prices rose sharply for a second day
Thursday while shorter-term Treasuries fell amid growing expectations the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week to slow the economy and
fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year note climbed 21/32 point, or $6.56 1/4 per $1,000
in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.52
percent, down from 6.57 percent at the same time on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 5/32 to 9/32 point, while
intermediate maturities fell 7/32 to 5/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
	   That pushed the 5-year Treasury yield to 6.65 percent and the 10-year
Treasury yield 6.69 percent -- extending an unusual divergence with the long
bond that suggests an expected slowdown in the economy. The 30-year Treasury
usually has a higher yield than the 5- or 10-year Treasurys to compensate for
inflationary risks.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerns about inflation continued to mount Thursday after the government
reported that orders for big-ticket machinery and other durable goods jumped 4.1
percent in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists, who were forecasting a 0.8 percent rise, predict the Fed will
bump up interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Feb. 2. Even though
the Fed raised rates three times last year, the economy continues to grow at a
rapid pace that some economists fear cannot be sustained without later
triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Thursday, yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.59
percent as the discount rose 0.02 percentage point from Wednesday to 5.43
percent. Six-month yields were 5.78 percent, as the discount rose 0.02
percentage point to 5.54 percent. One-year yields were 6.14 percent as the
discount rose 0.07 percentage point to 5.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.62 1/2 percent from Wednesday's 5.56 1/4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index for municipal bonds rose 1/32 to 91 9/32 point. The
yield was 6.31 percent, unchanged from late Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Dad: I Spurned Payoffs  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father told U.S. immigration officials that
his Miami relatives offered him millions of dollars, a house and a car to join
the 6-year-old boy in the United States, according to court papers filed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I could go there with all my family and would be taken care and could have
a job if I wanted to work, but with the money offered I would not need to do
so,'' the father said. ``That's when I hung up the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government filed the papers in response to a lawsuit filed by the
boy's Miami relatives, who are challenging an order that Elian be sent back to
live with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   In its 400-page response, the government argued that the federal courts have
no right to intervene and that allowing Elian to stay could ``seriously
prejudice the ability of the U.S. government to help parents in the United
States recover their children taken to foreign countries.''
</P>
<P>
	   The next hearing in the case is set for the week of March 6, although the
judge in the case could issue a ruling sooner.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute over Elian's fate began two months ago, after he was found
clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic. His mother and 10 other people
fleeing Cuba for Florida died after their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's Cuban grandmothers have been in the United States for the past
week to appeal for his return. They had a tearful, tense reunion with the boy in
Florida on Wednesday, and on Thursday they renewed their efforts on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   The court papers reflect some of the dominant themes of the debate: The
families in Cuba and Florida each say the other side is lying and being
manipulated by political forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez, a great-uncle who has temporary custody of the boy in
Miami, told immigration officials that he spoke to Elian's father by telephone
two or three days before the boy was even found. Lazaro Gonzalez said Elian's
father asked him to protect Elian ``by whatever means available'' but eventually
changed his tune and asked for Elian to come back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all think he's under pressure from the government, because of his
change in sentiment, and I'm amazed about this,'' Lazaro Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was interviewed by Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials in Havana on Dec. 13 and 31.
</P>
<P>
	   In those interviews, the boy's father said his relatives in Miami offered
him $2 million, a house and a car if he would join his son in the United States.
He also said a church had offered $4 million to Elian so he would be set for
life. He did not specify which church made the offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Never did we offer him money,'' she said. ``We would never buy our family.
We would never buy anybody because we are the type of family that believes money
can't buy people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Silma Dimmel, the INS official who conducted the interview, said in a
statement that Elian's father ``did not appear at all nervous or intimidated,''
and ``based on his demeanor, I had no reason to believe he was being coerced.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father checked ``No'' on a questionnaire asking him whether he
wanted the boy to stay in the United States, whether he was being coerced and
whether he had ever requested a visa to travel to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the court papers, INS officials asked these questions in
written form in case the room was bugged.
</P>
<P>
	   In his account, Elian's father claims that his ex-wife, Elisabeth Brotons,
took the boy out of Cuba without telling him. After the boy turned up in the
United States, ``at all times I asked that Elian be returned to me,'' his father
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father also complained that the relatives in Miami had interfered
with his attempts to speak with his son on the phone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we call and Elian starts saying, `Grandma I want to be with you' or
`Daddy I want to go with you,' they immediately make him cry, or give him a
candy or start tapping on the lines saying that the lines are getting bad and
hang up the phone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marisleysis Gonzalez told the INS that the boy's father was being pressured
by the communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His tone of voice is different, like people telling him what to say,'' she
said. ``The phone sounds like it's being tapped.''
</P>
<P>
	   The father told reporters in Cuba on Thursday that he was furious with the
way the grandmothers were treated during their reunion with the child. Gonzalez
complained that the grandmothers' cellular phones were confiscated, making it
impossible for him to speak with his boy out of the presence of the Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I felt very indignant,'' Gonzalez said. ``They just ruined everything.''

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic, GTE Seek Merger OK  </HEADLINE>
    By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bell Atlantic and GTE Corp. proposed a series of steps
Thursday to ease regulatory concerns about their merger, which would create the
nation's largest local phone company.
</P>
<P>
	   In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, the two companies
tried to address the thorniest issues associated with the deal, originally
valued at $52 billion, and offered to spend $500 million to compete with local
phone companies outside of their traditional calling regions.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies formally proposed spinning off GTE's Internet assets into a
separate public corporation, an idea that they had floated earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Those assets consist of GTE's Internet backbone of massive data pipelines
that criss-cross the country carrying computer traffic. For regulatory purposes,
this constitutes long-distance service, which Bell companies are not allowed to
offer within their local calling boundaries without receiving FCC approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic in December secured FCC permission to offer long-distance in
New York state only, but it could take years before it gets the ability to
provide long-distance throughout its local calling region of 13 states and the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, GTE's Internet assets would be transferred into a new
public corporation that would be 90 percent owned and controlled by public
shareholders. The merged Bell AtlanticGTE would have a 10 percent voting and
economic interest in the company.
</P>
<P>
	   But the combined company would have the option to increase its ownership to
80 percent within five years from the closing of the merger, giving it time to
win the needed regulatory approval to own the Internet backbone.
</P>
<P>
	   GTE also would stop providing regular long-distance calling service in
states that are within the Bell Atlantic region -- aside from New York -- as
required by law.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a cue from the long list of conditions that SBC and Ameritech agreed
to when those two companies combined in the fall, Bell Atlantic and GTE made
commitments to extend their reach outside of the calling area they now serve.
</P>
<P>
	   The businesses said they would spend $500 million within three years of
closing the merger to compete with local companies in regions beyond their
current territory, providing rival telephone services or Internet connections to
customers in other Bell regions.
</P>
<P>
	   They also pledged to establish a separate affiliate for providing Internet
services; roll out data connections to rural and low-income areas; and set up
enforcement plans to make sure they follow through on merger commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the plan laid out by the companies could go a long way in
persuading regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will resolve the last major hurdle," said Rex G. Mitchell, an analyst
with Banc of America Securities in San Francisco. He said the FCC may be open to
the Internet spin-off plan -- and the possibility of the two companies regaining
a majority share of those assets in five years -- because that market is
currently dominated by the three long-distance companies.

<P>
	   Reader's Digest continued to bounce back from several years of weak
performance, earning $96.8 million, or 90 cents per share, in the second
quarter. That's up from $86.5 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts had forecast earnings of 68 cents a share.

	   Ending 138 years as a policyholder-owned company, John Hancock made its

<P>
	   BCE Inc. plans to spin off its 37 percent stake in Nortel Networks, worth
about $50 billion. Nortel, whose revenues grew 26 percent to $21 billion last
year, is one of the top producers of fiber-optic gear that can speed up the
"backbone" networks that make up the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, which is the midst of a restructuring effort designed to boost
profits, said results in its first quarter are likely to miss estimates.
Callaway said it expects to earn about 12 cents per share, while analysts had
anticipated profits of 27 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson Stephens analyst Daniel T. Niles raised his revenue and profit
outlook for SanDisk and said its shares should reach $125 within the near term.
SanDisk, a data storage company, said Wednesday that its fourth-quarter results
easily exceeded Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   The company narrowed its losses in the most recent quarter, to 29 cents per
share from $1.60 a year earlier. Virata, a semiconductor maker, said it expects
revenue in the next quarter, its fiscal fourth, to be double that of the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The company narrowed its losses in the most recent quarter, to $1.06 per
share from $3.78 per share in the fourth quarter of 1998. Daleen, a maker of
billing software, attributed the drop in its share price to a pessimistic
research note from a Jefferies &AMP; Co. analyst.

airport, some 20 miles east of Torremolinos. But once he realized he was been
pursued, Lindgen-Hornett sped off, driving on the wrong side of the road for
much of the way to Torremolinos, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
	   Once in Torremolinos, the man rammed a police vehicle, a shootout began and
he was killed, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the national news agency Efe cited Torremolinos police chief Jose
Cabrera as saying police had fired a bullet into one of the wheels of the man's
car to prevent him getting away but when he attempted to drive off they fired
again and hit him in the chest.
</P>
<P>
	   A British Foreign Office spokesman said earlier that the office would have
no comment until the man's next of kin were informed.

<HEADLINE> AHP Settles Another Fen-Phen Suit  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM KIRCHOFER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The family of a 30-year-old Massachusetts woman
whose death was blamed on the fen-phen diet drug combination settled a lawsuit
against drug maker American Home Products, the company announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Terms of the deal with relatives of Mary J. Linnen were kept secret, but the
company said much of it will be used to fund a research foundation established
by the family to aid in treating the rare lung disease that killed her, primary
pulmonary hypertension.
</P>
<P>
	   Linnen, of Quincy, Mass., had taken the diet drug combination for 24 days in
1996 in an attempt to lose weight for her wedding. She was diagnosed with the
debilitating disease that November and died the following February, after
suffering partial blindness, the state court suit said.
</P>
<P>
	   Linnen's parents, Thomas F. and Mary J. Linnen, of Palm Coast, Fla., said in
the suit that an autopsy determined their daughter died as a result of
"pulmonary hypertension associated with" the fen-phen therapy
</P>
<P>
	   After her diagnosis, "she lived each day feeling and believing that she had
been given a death sentence," the suit said.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement by the company Thursday did not address the issue of whether or
not American Home Products admitted any wrongdoing, and Wyeth spokesman Doug
Petkus refused to comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home Products' Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division marketed the
"fen" in the drug combination, fenfluramine, which was paired with phentermine
to make "fen-phen." Wyeth-Ayerst also made a related diet drug, dexfenfluramine,
which went under the brand name Redux.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost six million Americans took the drugs until they were banned by the
Food and Drug Administration in 1997 after reports that some users developed
serious, and sometimes fatal, heart problems. Phentermine is still on the
market.
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1999, American Home Products agreed to pay $3.75 billion to
settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems
due to fen-phen. But the settlement only applied to patients with possible heart
valve problems. It did not cover Linnen's disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has set aside approximately another $1 billion to deal with
other claims that might arise. Even though the exact terms of the Linnen
settlement weren't known, Alex Zisson, an industry analyst with Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist, said Wall Street had been given no reason to believe it jeopardized that
reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   "They haven't given out a dollar figure, but at this point they've said the
charge will be adequate," Zisson said. "Wall Street at this point just wants all
the fen-phen litigation to go away. Even if American Home has to pay a little
more than the cases deserve, Wall Street would say that's a good deal."
</P>
<P>
	   American Home, which is fighting with competitor Pfizer, over American's
planned merger with another drug maker, Warner-Lambert, saw its shares fall
$1.12 1/2 Thursday to $43.37 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The Linnens' suit was the first wrongful death case filed against American
Home Products in connection with the fen-phen drugs, said their lawyer, Alex
MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not the first death case settled.
</P>
<P>
	   In Houston last year, relatives of 35-year-old Mary Marisa Smith, who
claimed fen-phen killed her, agreed to settle for an undisclosed amount of money
three weeks into trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Settlements of suits in other states and major jury verdicts against
American Home have recently raised questions about whether enough fen-phen users
will accept the national settlement. American Home can reject the preliminary
deal if too many patients opt out of it and pursue their own lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Even at the time fen-phen was being marketed, primary pulmonary hypertension
was a recognized, although rare, side effect, Zisson said. The Linnens claimed
their daughter wasn't notified of the risk.
</P>
<P>
	   The Linnens and American Home Products settled the suit after it went to
trial. During the trial the company disputed that its drug could be conclusively
linked to her condition.

<HEADLINE> Burger King To Run Recall Ads  </HEADLINE>
    By REX W. HUPPKE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Burger King plans to run commercials nationally next
week to publicize its recall of Pokemon balls given away with its kid's meals
after a 4-month-old Indianapolis boy suffocated in his crib on one of the toys.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami-based restaurant chain disclosed the advertising plans Thursday as
the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued its second nationwide alert in a
month about the dangers posed by the "Poke Balls."
</P>
<P>
	   More than 25 million of the toys were handed out with Burger King children's
meals late last year. The packaging contained no warnings and described them as
"safety tested and recommended for all ages."
</P>
<P>
	   Zachary Jones is the second infant to suffocate on one of the toys, hollow
red-and-white plastic spheres about the size of a tennis ball that open into two
halves.
</P>
<P>
	   Zachary suffocated Tuesday after half of toy's ball-shaped container lodged
over his mouth and nose.
</P>
<P>
	   The plastic balls were also blamed for the suffocation death of a
13-month-old California girl on in December.
</P>
<P>
	   One half of the plastic ball can fit over a small child's nose and mouth,
forming a suction cup and cutting off air flow.
</P>
<P>
	   Burger King said from its headquarters in Miami said that it will start
running 15-second television advertisements on Tuesday warning parents about the
toys. The ads will run for one week on all major networks and more than 20 cable
outlets, spokeswoman Kim Miller said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Considering our time constraint, it was the most effective way to reach the
maximum number of consumers and to be sure they hear the message repeatedly,"
Miller said. "It's the best thing for our customers."
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's consumer alert says parents should "immediately take the balls
away from children under the age of 3. They should discard the ball or return
both halves of the ball and the clip to a Burger King restaurant for a free
order of fries."
</P>
<P>
	   The Pokemon toys were safety tested only for choking, not for suffocation.
Burger King spokesman Charles Nicolas said it's not an industry practice to test
for suffocation.
</P>
<P>
	   Safety commission spokesman Russ Rader said the fast food company has been
cooperating with the safety commission in trying to get the word out about the
recall.	   When the recall was first announced Dec. 27, Burger King placed an ad
in USA Today, posted signs in its restaurants and sent out notices to 56,000
pediatricians. It had also put the recall announcement on its tray liners,
carryout bags and french fry bags.
</P>
<P>
	   Rader said the company has been posting notices on Pokemon Web sites and
notifying people who frequent Pokemon chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   Zachary's family members said they weren't aware of the recall.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard to believe that you go get the kids something to eat and you
bring home a lethal toy," said Michael Jones, Zachary's grandfather.

<HEADLINE> Judge throws McCain back off the eight contested presidential  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A judge on Thursday threw Sen. John McCain out of
the Republican presidential primary in eight of New York's congressional
districts, one day after two Democratic election officials helped him stay on
those ballots.
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Cannizzaro overturned the state Board of
Elections' decision to allow McCain to compete in those eight districts despite
challenges from state Republicans, most of whom support GOP front-runner George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In the challenged districts, the Arizona senator did not have the number of
signatures on his presidential petitions that New York state law required him to
have to qualify for the primary. However, McCain supporters argued that since he
was a valid national presidential primary contender, the signature requirement
should not apply to him.
</P>
<P>
	   New York election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane.
But Cannizzaro disagreed, calling the signature requirements "reasonable."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not the prerogative of any single candidate to interpose his or her
own judgment in place of that of the state Legislature in this regard," the
judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from party members to
qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31
congressional districts in which they wish to compete. In effect, there are 31
separate GOP primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters had challenged McCain in 16 of those districts. Cannizzaro's
decision leaves McCain off the ballot in a fourth of the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Buley, a state Republican Committee lawyer working in support of Bush,
cheered the decision. "We're pleased and think it was the proper decision," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign lawyer Henry Berger said they had not yet decided whether
to appeal. McCain on Friday planned to ask a federal judge in Brooklyn to place
him on the ballot in all 31 of New York's congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are disappointed," Berger said. "But I'm going to see what happens in
federal court tomorrow and then make a decision whether to appeal."
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   In an ironic twist, it was the Democrats who helped McCain stay on the
ballot in those eight districts. The two Republican members of the state Board
of Elections had voted on Wednesday to uphold the challenges to McCain's
petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   But the board's two Democrats abstained, thus depriving the Bush camp of the
third vote it needed to have the petitions invalidated for a lack of signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no clear indication Thursday when the ballot for New York's March
7 primary would be finalized. The state board had hoped to finalize the ballot
by Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Cannizzaro's decision is merely the latest salvo in the ongoing battle over
New York's March 7 presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Mega-developer Donald Trump has won a battle to compete for Independence
Party backing and Steve Forbes has lost his spot on the GOP ballot in three Long
Island congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   But the battles now head to the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   In retaliation for the Long Island challenges to his petitions, Forbes has
gone into state court in an attempt to get Bush knocked off the GOP ballot in
six New York City districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-Trump forces trying to grab control of New York's arm of the Reform
Party, known as the Independence Party, have sued to get him off their ballot
completely.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump is not an announced presidential candidate. Nonetheless, he is
considering running for the Reform Party's presidential nomination and his New
York supporters are seeking to run delegate slates for him in the March 7
primary.	   But the Independence Party's Democracy Coalition, led by leftist
activist Lenora Fulani, have been trying to have Trump's delegate slates thrown
off the ballot, claiming insufficient signatures from party members on his
petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   While Fulani is backing conservative Pat Buchanan's bid for the Reform
Party's nomination, her faction is running delegate slates for the New York
primary that are uncommitted to any candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   The state chairman of the Independence Party, Jack Essenberg, is backing
Trump. Fulani is attempting to have Essenberg removed as state party chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Board of Elections refused to throw Trump off the ballot and an
appeal of decision by the Fulani forces is to be heard Friday in a state court
in Albany.

<HEADLINE> Chase Privacy Pact May Prompt Trend  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An agreement by Chase Manhattan Corp. to seek permission
from its account holders before selling their names to outside marketers might
nudge other banks to offer similar privacy protections as a way to attract
customers.
</P>
<P>
	   But most big banks "aren't there yet" and may end up being compelled by
states to tighten their privacy policies, as Chase was, a consumer advocate said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The new settlement agreement between financial titan Chase and New York
state's attorney general "means that Chase can do it. And if Chase can do it,
that means other banks can do it," Frank Torres, legislative counsel for
Consumers Union, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, he added, most big banks remain strongly opposed to the type of
privacy restriction Chase has agreed to abide by -- the requirement that it must
have express written consent from account holders before it can sell or share
their data with outside marketers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, financial institutions are concerned about recent privacy
enforcement actions against banks by several states, as well as an initiative by
some states to enact new privacy laws that are stricter than federal
requirements established by Congress in November.
</P>
<P>
	   "The states are fully engaged," said John Byrne, senior counsel for the
American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Banks around the country are "taking stock of their privacy procedures," he
said. "Some banks will decide on their own to go beyond the mandated procedures
... if that's what their customers want to see."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the settlement accord announced Tuesday by Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer in Albany, N.Y., Chase agreed to stop providing outside marketers with
the credit line and balance information of customers. As many as 22 million
consumers had been affected. Chase, the nation's third-largest bank holding
company, has some $370 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
	   In agreeing to the settlement, Manhattan-based Chase denied any wrongdoing.
State officials said they hadn't accused the bank of anything illegal, but they
promised to pursue similar enforcement actions against other financial
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Chase agreed not to share any customer data with outside marketers, such as
telemarketers, without customers' express written consent, a practice known as
"opt-in." Even in cases where customers do give their permission, Chase agreed
to provide only their names, addresses and telephone numbers to the marketing
firms, but not any financial data.
</P>
<P>
	   The "opt-in" is stricter than the "opt-out" privacy provision in the new
federal law, which allows banks and other financial institutions to share
customers' data with outside firms unless customers expressly ask them not to do
so.
</P>
<P>
	   The financial services industry had opposed even the "opt-out" requirement.
It won the right in the legislation for banks, securities firms and insurance
companies that are affiliated under the same corporate roof to share customers'
data without an "opt-out" or "opt-in."
</P>
<P>
	   The New York case arose from an investigation by Spitzer's office into
Chase's practices. The bank allegedly had provided customer information to
marketers in violation of its own privacy policy as disclosed to consumers. The
data it shared was said to have included encrypted account numbers and loan
data.
</P>
<P>
	   The marketing firms used the information to phone Chase customers to try
selling them emergency road service plans, discount shopping clubs, legal
services, travel clubs, garden supplies and magazine subscriptions. Chase
received a commission on successful sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The case "really demonstrates the need for legislation that protects
consumers from having their personal, sensitive financial information
distributed outside of the bank," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of
the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope other banks follow (Chase) but I'm not optimistic," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Schmermund, a spokesman for America's Community Bankers, suggested
that privacy policies could be "a very effective tool" for banks to market
themselves to consumers and retain customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything that banks do is based on customer trust," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Byrne said his group "would not want to see banks competing against one
another on the basis of privacy protections."
</P>
<P>
	   It would be "self-defeating" for banks to claim they had stricter privacy
policies than rival institutions, Byrne maintained. Attractive prices and a
variety of services should remain the basis for competition, he said.

<HEADLINE> Rise in Margin Debt Spurs Concerns  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A sharp increase in margin debt, the amount of money
borrowed by individual investors to purchase stocks, has some analysts worried
that the unprecedented levels could exacerbate a market downturn.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a serious subject and it's creating concern because it's really a
measure of investor confidence," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at
Edward Jones, a St. Louis brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you see masses of people doing it at once, it says the crowd thinks
there's very little chance that stocks are going to go down. But we know from
history that stock markets aren't a one-way street," he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is expressing concern about the
level of margin debt, saying Wednesday during testimony before the Senate that
the central bank is studying the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans had borrowed $228.5 billion to buy stock as of Dec. 31, 1999, up
from $141 billion a year earlier -- a 62 percent jump, according to Ned Davis
Research, a Venice, Fla., market data firm. In 1990, the figure stood at around
$35 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Borrowing accelerated rapidly in the last months of 1999, when the
technology-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market was surging upward at an unprecedented
rate, said Sam Burns, a research analyst at Ned Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerns have surfaced over the buying on margin because a significant
market downturn could wipe out hundreds of thousands of debt-ridden investors
and exacerbate a widespread selling panic.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's how the scenario could unfold, Burns said:
</P>
<P>
	   Investors borrow money to buy stock in the hope that the stock will increase
in value.
</P>
<P>
	   The stock purchased on margin is used as collateral against the value of the
loan.
</P>
<P>
	   If the stock goes up, everyone's happy because the investor can use the
profits to pay back the borrowed money plus interest charged by the lender --
usually the investor's broker.
</P>
<P>
	   But if the stock price falls, thus lowering the value of the lender's
collateral, the lender can make what's known as a margin call, which requires
the borrower to put up more cash to ensure that the loan is repaid in full.
</P>
<P>
	   Margin calls are usually covered by selling the stock purchased on margin,
and that's where things get sticky, according to Burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Should U.S. stock markets stumble at some point, hundreds of thousands of
margin investors would likely sell stock into an already falling market to pay
back their margin loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Those margin-related sales would only contribute to a selling panic, Burns
explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Many historians blame the 1929 stock market crash on widespread margin
buying among investors who were then forced to sell stock to pay back their
loans when the market tanked.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve Board, which regulates margin borrowing, currently
requires investors to have at least $2,000 in a trading account to buy on
margin. In addition, investors are limited to purchasing $2 of stock for every
$1 in their account.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Greenspan said the Federal Reserve was reluctant to exercise
its authority to tighten limits on such borrowing, saying that studies have
suggested that a rising level of stock prices is unrelated to liberal margin
requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, which oversees the Nasdaq stock market, are seeking changes that would
increase to $25,000 the minimum amount some active traders need to keep in their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The move is designed to ensure that investors who want to borrow money to
buy stocks have plenty of collateral to pay back their debts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commissions is also discussing the issue with
the Fed, the NYSE and the NASD, said spokesman Chris Ullman, "to get their
perspectives on what is the actual margin situation."
</P>
<P>
	   But not everyone thinks changes are necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Tappan, the co-founder of MTrader.com, an educational online site for
active traders, said margin borrowing has traditionally allowed small investors
an opportunity to take a larger stake in the markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very valuable tool because it provides leverage," Tappan said.
"Without it, you're playing against a stacked deck."
</P>
<P>
	   Small investor advocates frequently complain that the markets are biased in
favor of large, institutional investors such as pension and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Tappan acknowledged that certain investors, such as day traders, accept
tremendous risks when they borrow money to speculate on the markets. Day traders
buy and sell thousands of shares, betting on the movement of the stock to make
money.
</P>
<P>
	   The practice of borrowing money to day trade came under scrutiny last July
when debt-ridden trader Mark Barton killed nine people at two Atlanta brokerage
firms.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Vows To Confront Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STRATHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bradley, struggling to balance his high-road
campaign themes with a need to overtake Al Gore, said Thursday he'd ``had it''
with his Democratic rival and pushed ahead with a new, more confrontational
style.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls suggesting Gore has been moving ahead just days before the New
Hampshire primary, Bradley indicated the accusations and sharp words he had for
the vice president in their debate on Wednesday were no one-night strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How you run a campaign is how you govern. That was the point I was making
and I waited a long time to make it,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Last night I decided I'd had it and I'm going to call my opponent on what
he's been doing,'' said Bradley. ``Making that point several times struck a
positive chord in a lot of people who had just been waiting essentially for him
to be called out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's camp said Bradley was showing desperation.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley, who accused Gore of campaign dishonesty, said he felt
comfortable and was getting a good response from voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, 76-year-old Sherry Taylor said, ``I think the fact that he showed a
little more vitality last night was good.'' She added, ``I felt better about him
and I was all set to go for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Bond Perry, a Bradley supporter, said he liked the
candidate's higher energy level but ``I didn't like what he did last night.
There was, like, desperation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, addressing employees of a high-tech firm in Manchester on Thursday,
said anew that Bradley was turning the campaign negative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't understand how someone can condemn negative attacks while in the
same breath can make negative attacks,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Bradley's contentions in the debate was that Gore had been
inconsistent on abortion rights, including voting as a member of Congress to
restrict abortion rights. And that idea was brought back to Gore on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   He was appearing on a New Hampshire public radio call-in show when a woman
who identified herself as Sara accused him of lying about his abortion record in
the debate. ``I don't know how I can support your candidacy if you're so
dishonest on national TV,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore replied, ``I have always supported Roe vs. Wade. I have always
supported keeping abortion legal. And it's true, early in my career I voted to
restrict the use of federal funding in some circumstances, but over the years
I've come to the view that federal funding ought to be available.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the tougher rhetoric, Bradley stepped up his schedule
Thursday and there was a new air of urgency surrounding his campaign entourage.
He opened the day at one frigid outdoor rally, collected the endorsement of
environmental activists at another and rotated through a series of town meetings
in a crowded campaign day.
</P>
<P>
	   Along the way, he stopped by grocery and convenience stores for chaotic
handshaking. At one stop he helped shoppers bag groceries. He bought donuts at
another.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pull it off, I'm with you,'' urged 74-year-old Ed Rein at one stop.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With your help I will,'' Bradley responded.
</P>
<P>
	   His shift in approach had been under discussion internally for days, since
Bradley was hammered in Iowa's leadoff caucuses. Surrogates such as Nebraska
Sen. Bob Kerrey have been battering Gore in public, arguing he's been distorting
Bradley's record, and have been pushing Bradley in private to become more
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
	   The risk for Bradley is to his core appeal as the nontraditional politician
who is above attack politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Even in the midst of the new approach, he said in response to a question
that he had occasionally elbowed other players in basketball but added:
</P>
<P>
	   ``Politics is different. Politics should be something that's higher.
Politics should be something that elevates us.''
</P>
<P>
	   He is also running a new batch of positive television commercials in the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore aides dismissed the shift as the last gasp of a campaign in trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's clearly listening to his consultants,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane. ``His music wasn't playing. This undermines the central presence of his
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Numerous polls have shown Gore moving ahead of Bradley, by several points to
as much as a dozen in New Hampshire, which holds the first primaries of the 2000
election year on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said Gore consistently misrepresents his health plan by arguing that
Bradley would eliminate Medicaid and replace it with $150-a-month vouchers.
Bradley said he's told Gore repeatedly that's not the case. Bradley also said
Gore argues -- wrongly -- that the Bradley health plan would fritter away the
budget surplus.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Hill Wary on Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As relatives competing for custody of 6-year-old Cuban
refugee Elian Gonzalez crisscrossed Capitol Hill Thursday, support dwindled for
a bill to make the boy an American citizen. On some issues, ``politicians just
have to step aside,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
	   After a meeting of GOP House members, Hastert, R-Ill., would only say
``there's a difference of opinion'' among Republicans about how to proceed.
Hastert has supported the legislation but declined to predict its fate.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Senate, there was strong Democratic opposition to the citizenship
bill and Republicans were divided. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a member of the
Foreign Relations Committee, waged a strong battle to keep the measure off the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
	   A day after meeting with the Cuban boy in Miami Beach, his grandmothers
continued to lobby against the citizenship bill, insisting Elian be allowed to
return to his father in Cuba -- preferably in their company. They depicted Elian
as emotionally drained and not talkative at their visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our grandson is a whole different boy. He has changed completely. We have
to save this boy as soon as possible,'' said Mariela Quintana, the paternal
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   They sought an audience with President Clinton before a planned return to
Cuba on Saturday but said they had heard nothing from the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, a delegation of the boy's Florida relatives urged support
for the citizenship bill. ``He doesn't want to go back,'' said Marisleysis
Gonzalez, a cousin of Elian. ``I saw him approach his grandmothers and had the
opportunity to see his face, and it was still the face of fear.''
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers disagreed. ``We told him we wanted to bring him back to
Cuba. He nodded his head yes,'' Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leadership aides in both chambers said the level of support for the bill
seemed to have lessened now that members are back in town after their winter
recess.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Thursday, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., a leading congressional
proponent of returning Elian to Cuba, claimed the Capitol Hill efforts this week
by the grandmothers had helped to build congressional opposition to the
citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler gave attorneys for Elian's
great-uncle the extra time they asked for to fight the U.S. government's efforts
to return the boy to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbara Lagoa, a member of the legal team representing the great-uncle,
asked the judge for extra time to respond to the government's motions, saying
attorneys needed to review portions of the government's declarations.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoeveler gave the Florida relatives until Feb. 24 to respond to the
government's motion to dismiss their challenge, and gave the government until
March 2 to file their response. The judge said he would begin hearing arguments
on the motion to dismiss the week of March 6.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department, meanwhile, warned that failure to return Elian to his
father in Cuba -- as the Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled --
might make it hard to get a U.S. child back if the situation were reversed.
</P>
<P>
	   With lawmakers gathering for Thursday's State of the Union address,
congressional leaders exhibited little enthusiasm for seeing the increasingly
acrimonious custody battle exploding into a full-fledged -- and time consuming
-- election-year floor debate.
</P>
<P>
	   In declining to prediction outcome of the measure, Hastert said it would not
be rushed to the floor but would follow the usual legislative course of being
heard first by a committee, in this case the immigration subcommittee of the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the chairman of that subcommittee, has expressed
reservations about the bill. And Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, the senior
Democrat on that panel, is one of its most outspoken foes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am personally appalled. This is not a political matter, this is a family
matter,'' Jackson-Lee said Thursday after she met with the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Some lawmakers were lining up behind a less controversial bill that would
confer permanent residency on Elian rather than full citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a supporter of the bill who once
pledged to rush it to the Senate floor this week, is now undecided about a
timetable, his spokesman, John Czwartacki, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents of the citizenship bill have threatened to use delaying tactics,
including a filibuster, if necessary to block Senate consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, Rev. Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches
said that barring any new developments in the custody case, the grandmothers
would return to Cuba on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Raquel Rodriquez, the maternal grandmother, said the longer Elian is forced
to remain in Miami, ``the more he is going to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after talking to reporters, Rodriquez felt faint and was given
emergency care by congressional paramedics.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell said the problem an aggravation of a heart condition and ``just
exhaustion,'' and that the event did not appear to be a serious.

<HEADLINE> On eve of his sentencing, Patrick Bennett asks that judge be  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Former Syracuse businessman Patrick R. Bennett has
failed to get a new judge to sentence him in his fraud case despite his claims
of bias.
<P>
	   Bennett's attorney, Michael Pinnisi, said late Thursday that U.S. District
Court Judge John S. Martin will handle the sentencing as planned. Pinnisi had
sought to have the judge remove himself because the defense lawyer felt the
judge was biased. Pinnisi argued that the judge shouldn't have suggested that
Bennett plea bargain the case before it went to trial last year. Pinnisi also
argued that Martin showed bias when he harshly rebuked Bennett after his
conviction last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinnisi formally asked Martin last week to remove himself from the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge had told Bennett that he would consider the motion to remove
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett, 47, faces up to 30 years in prison for his role in cheating
thousands of investors out of $512 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin postponed sentencing from December to give Bennett more time to pay
$109 million the court ordered him to forfeit after the conviction. Bennett and
his family say they do not have the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett claims that during a meeting with defense lawyers and prosecutors
before the trial last summer Martin suggested a plea bargain. The judge
recommended that Bennett receive a 10-year sentence as part of the bargaining,
Pinnisi said.
</P>
<P>
	   The suggestion was inappropriate, Pinnisi contended, and Martin should have
removed himself from the case. After the trial and verdict, Martin told Bennett
he showed no respect for the law.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly, this trial showed that Patrick R. Bennett is a totally amoral
individual who engaged in any criminal conduct that benefits him," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also is scheduled to sentence three other men - including
Bennett's brother, Michael - who have pleaded guilty to helping Patrick Bennett
cover up the crimes at Bennett Funding Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett was chief financial officer of the family-owned business, which
financed office equipment rentals with money from investors and banks. Over the
course of two trials, juries convicted Bennett of 49 charges of securities
fraud, bank fraud, money laundering, lying and hindering an investigation of his
business. He has been in federal prison since June.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Bennett, 42, was the company's deputy chief executive officer. He
pleaded guilty in 1998 to charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and
perjury. He faces a maximum of 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Former company employees Anthony Menchella and Al Cerimeli pleaded guilty in
1996 to charges they conspired with Bennett to lie to investigators. They were
the first defendants to plead guilty in the case. Each faces a maximum of 10
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC began investigating the Bennett companies in 1993. Prosecutors said
Bennett asked others to lie and backdate documents to hide wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   The scheme collapsed in 1996 when the government brought criminal charges
against Bennett. The Bennett companies owed more than $1 billion and are now in
bankruptcy. Their operations are winding down and a trustee is gathering assets
to pay off 21,000 creditors.

<HEADLINE> Gore claims more gay New York delegates; poll has vice president  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Seeking to boost his standing among an increasingly
politically active constituency, Al Gore boasted Thursday of having more openly
gay potential convention delegates in New York than Bill Bradley does.
<P>
	   The Gore camp said that while its slate of delegates for the state's March 7
presidential primary included 11 openly gay candidates, slates for the former
senator from New Jersey had just five openly gay people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign later ended up with some egg on its face when state party
officials said the Bradley campaign had reported having seven openly gay
prospective delegates, not five as Gore had claimed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Al Gore campaign continues to distort the facts in an attempt to win
the Democratic primary against Senator Bill Bradley at any cost - even the cost
of the truth," the Bradley campaign said in a statement that accused the Gore
campaign of "lies and distortions."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp noted that the former senator had proposed expanding the
1964 Civil Rights Act to include protections for gays and lesbians, a move Gore
has opposed.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Gore's New York campaign team, conceded the
mistake in the number of openly gay delegates Bradley had. Ragone said the error
was the result of incorrect information given the Gore campaign by the state
party.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a new statewide poll showed Gore ahead of Bradley among likely
Democratic New York primary voters. On the Republican side, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush had a 2-1 lead over his closest rival, Sen. John McCain, among likely GOP
primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore forces staged a news conference on the steps of City Hall in New
York City to boast about the number of openly gay delegates the vice president
was running in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here, as in so many other areas like hate crimes protections and
anti-discrimination legislation, Vice President Gore has shown a commitment to
lesbian and gay equality that Senator Bradley's record does not reflect," Thomas
Duane, a Manhattan Democrat and the only openly gay member of the state Senate,
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp continued to maintain that Bradley's proposal to replace
Medicaid with subsidies that would allow people to buy health insurance "could
put millions of New Yorkers, especially those living with AIDS, in jeopardy."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp reacted sharply, saying the Bradley health plan would
provide continued benefits for AIDS sufferers.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an outrageous and misleading attack from the Gore campaign,"
Bradley delegate contender Daniel O'Donnell, the openly gay brother of Rosie
O'Donnell, said.
</P>
<P>
	   An ethnicity delegate breakdown supplied by the campaigns to the state party
indicated that 25 percent of the vice president's proposed delegates were black
to 23 percent for Bradley. Hispanics made up 11 percent of Gore's delegate
slates to 9 percent for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   On the polling front, Manhattanville College's poll found Gore leading
Bradley, 48 percent to 34 percent, among likely Democratic primary voters. Among
likely Republican voters, Bush led McCain, 53 percent to 27 percent, with Steve
Forbes trailing at 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   A statewide poll out earlier this month from the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute had Gore at 44 percent to 39 percent for Bradley, a former star with
the New York Knicks basketball team. In that poll, Bush led McCain, 47 percent
to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Manhattanville poll, 43 percent of Democratic voters said they felt
Gore would wind up as the next president while one in three of them said Bush
would be the next to occupy the White House. Among likely Republican primary
voters, 68 percent said Bush would be the next president while just 10 percent
said Gore would win the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattanville College's telephone poll of 507 Democrats and 302 Republicans
was conducted Jan. 20-23. The margin of error for the Democratic sample is plus
or minus 4.5 percentage points and 6 percentage points for the Republican
sample.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Seek $350B Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) --President Clinton proposed a $350 billion tax cut and big
spending increases for schools and health care Thursday in his final State of
the Union address as he boasted of America's unprecedented prosperity and
challenged an election-year Congress to ``set great goals for our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president also was to propose a gun-licensing plan that would require
congressional action, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   With less than a year left in his presidency, Clinton was outlining his
farewell agenda in his final State of the Union address before a joint session
of Congress. Many of his proposals were repackaged from earlier years and, in
some cases, resubmitted with spending figures double or triple the original
amount.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans ridiculed Clinton's proposals but did not rule out working with
him on such issues as education and health care. ``If we enacted all the new
programs the president has talked about, we'd spend just about the entire
surplus on bigger and more expensive government,'' said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and
social progress with so little internal crisis or so few external threats,'' the
president said. ``Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity -- and
therefore such a profound obligation -- to build the more perfect union of our
founders' dreams.''
</P>
<P>
	   Excerpts of his speech were released in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's tax program includes marriage penalty relief, tax deductions of up
to $2,800 annually per family for college tuition and fees and retirement
savings accounts for low- and moderate-income families. He also proposed steps
to encourage charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by Republicans
and Democrats as both sides battle for control of Congress and the White House.
Smarting from Clinton's veto of their $792 billion tax-cut package last year,
House Republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax breaks and
marriage penalty relief this year. Presidential candidates have their own
proposals, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called
Clinton's tax cuts too limited. ``We think all Americans deserve tax relief, not
just the handful the president picks,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package would cost $350 billion over 10 years. However,
his plan envisions cutting that price tag by $100 billion by closing tax havens,
shelters and loopholes. Congress has previously rejected many of those ideas on
grounds they are tax increases.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no major foreign policy announcements, although Clinton urged
Congress to give China permanent normal trading relations with the United
States. He also asked for $1.6 billion for Colombia to fight narco-traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   While urging higher spending and targeted tax cuts, Clinton said, ``We must
not forsake the path of fiscal discipline that got us here. We must make these
investments and tax cuts only in the context of a balanced budget that
strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and pays down the national
debt.''
</P>
<P>
	   The booming economy and swelling tax revenues give Clinton and Republicans a
big purse for any tax reductions or spending increases. Both sides claim they
are dedicated to protecting Social Security and eliminating the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   In the category of unfinished business, Clinton urged an increase in the
minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour, a patients' bill of rights to strengthen
consumers' rights in health insurance programs, tougher gun laws, an overhaul of
campaign finance laws, hate crimes legislation and another installment of his
program to put more police on the street.
</P>
<P>
	   He called anew for Medicare to include a prescription drug benefit and to
let people as young as 55 buy Medicare coverage -- this time with a 25 percent
tax credit to make the cost more manageable. ``In good conscience,'' Clinton
said, ``we cannot let another year pass without extending to all seniors the
lifeline of affordable prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
	   To reinforce his appeal for tighter gun control, Clinton invited Tom Mauser,
father of slain Columbine High School shooting victim Daniel Mauser, as one of
the guests in the VIP box with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   To help developing countries, Clinton proposed $1 billion in tax incentives
for drug makers to develop vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. The
goal is to create a market for new vaccines by providing $1 credit for every $1
spent for vaccines distributed in Africa and other poor countries.
</P>
<P>
	   A major part of the speech dealt with education, a politically popular
subject that has been a staple of Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   He proposed a $4.5 billion initiative to double spending for after-school
and summer school programs and to expand the Head Start program for needy
children to cover 950,000 kids. The president also called for doubling money to
turn around failing schools and to increase spending by $450 million to hire
more teachers to reduce class size.
</P>
<P>
	   His tax breaks for college would cost $30 billion over 10 years. Another
proposal would expand the earned income tax credit for the working poor by $21
billion. A tax credit for long-term care would cost $27 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   To build momentum for the speech, many of Clinton's proposals were announced
in advance. One of his biggest initiatives was a 10-year, $110 billion proposal
to provide health coverage to the parents of children protected by the state
Children's Health Insurance Program. If approved, it would be the largest
increase in health coverage in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's agenda revives battles with Republicans over Social Security and
Medicare. He said his proposals would extend the life of Social Security to 2050
and Medicare to at least 2025. Clinton would devote nearly $400 billion of the
surplus for Medicare solvency and prescription drugs.

<HEADLINE> Major Proposals in State of Union  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A look at major proposals in President Clinton's State of the Union address:
</P>
<P>
	   TAX CUT:
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton asked Congress to approve a tax cut that would total $350 billion
over 10 years. The cost would be $250 billion if Congress also approves a series
of measures to close tax loopholes and shelters, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan would set up retirement savings accounts for low-income families,
with the government offering a 2-for-1 match for the first $100 contributed by
each person. The White House said this would help 76 million people at a cost of
$54 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton added a proposal to provide a 50 percent tax credit to encourage
small businesses to set up and contribute to pension funds for employees. This
provision would cost $17 billion over 10 years, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton proposed reducing the ``marriage penalty'' for two-earner couples
by increasing their standard income tax deduction by more than $2,000, with
smaller increases in the deductions that can be claimed by single-earner married
couples and by single filers. The White House said these changes would benefit
42 million families at a cost of $45 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton proposed tax relief to help families pay for child care, including
incentives to businesses to provide child care for employees. The White House
said the package would benefit more than 8 million families at a cost of $30
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   --To encourage philanthropy, Clinton proposed a general deduction for
charitable giving that would apply even to people who do not itemize their
income taxes. He also proposed making it easier for people to donate assets such
as appreciated stock. The proposals would cost an estimated $14 billion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton also wants a $30 billion tax credit to defray college expenses; a
$21 billion plan to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit; a $27 billion credit
package to help pay for long-term health care; a $12 billion expansion of health
care tax credits; a $24.8 billion tax credit package to modernize schools; a $9
billion package to encourage investment in low-income areas and a $33 billion
proposal to correct problems with the Alternative Minimum Tax, which
unintentionally hurt the middle class.
</P>
<P>
	   EDUCATION and SCHOOLS:
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton proposed a $1 billion expansion in Head Start, an early childhood
tutoring program credited with improving school performance among low-income
children. The money would add about 950,000 children to the program, The White
House said. Clinton also proposed a $600 million fund to improve child care
quality and early childhood education for children under age 5.
</P>
<P>
	   --The president proposed a $1 billion grant package to improve teacher
quality, including a $50 million grant fund to offer better pay to teachers in
low-income school districts and a $50 million program to reward schools that
increase their ranks of certified and teachers.
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton wants $250 million -- double last year's amount -- to increase
school accountability, turn around failing schools or close those that cannot be
fixed. Clinton also wants $450 million to provide bonuses to schools that make
dramatic improvements in student performance.
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton proposed a $450 million increase in an existing program to reduce
class sizes by hiring 100,000 new teachers. The new money would pay for 49,000
new teachers and raise the total for this program to $1.75 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton renewed a proposal to provide $24.8 billion in tax credit bonds to
modernize up to 6,000 schools. This proposal would cost $3.7 billion over five
years.
</P>
<P>
	   --The White House wants a new $1.3 billion emergency fund for school
renovation, which the administration claims would support projects costing
nearly $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   HEALTH CARE:
</P>
<P>
	   --The president asked Congress to return to the ``patients' rights''
legislation left unfinished last year. The bill would guarantee access to
specialists and emergency rooms, and the right to challenge the decisions of
health plan administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton proposed a 10-year, $110 billion program to lower costs of health
insurance and make quality insurance easier to obtain. The plan would allow
coverage for at least 5 million people who now have no health insurance, and
expand the insurance options for millions of other people.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan includes a $76 billion program to expand insurance to moderately
poor families, notably to the parents of children who may already be eligible
for separate insurance under the State Children's Health Insurance Program.
Clinton proposed spending $5.5 billion over 10 years to speed up enrollment of
uninsured children in that program. The White House said the money would cover
an additional 400,000 children whose family incomes are too high to be eligible
for the federal medicaid program but too low to afford private insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton proposed expanding health insurance options for people who now
find it difficult to get coverage, such as the elderly, people between jobs and
those leaving welfare for work. The proposal would cost $28.7 billion over 10
years and help about 600,000 uninsured adults.
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton also proposed beefing up programs that provide health care
directly to the uninsured, including added funding for local health centers that
serve millions of low-income and uninsured people. This package would cost about
$100 million next year and $1 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   HOUSING VOUCHERS:
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton proposed adding $690 million next year to the federal budget for
housing vouchers for moderately poor families. The money would help the working
poor move to suburban areas where jobs are more plentiful, and also help 32,000
households that are moving from welfare to work, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   CRIME and VIOLENCE:
</P>
<P>
	   --The White House proposed an $875 million increase, to $8.8 billion, in
next year's budget for programs throughout the government aimed at reducing
youth violence and making young people healthier and safer.
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton proposed $280 million for what the White House calls the largest
national gun enforcement program ever. The money would help hire 500 new Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and inspectors and 1,000 new federal,
state and local gun prosecutors. It would also go toward setting up a national
ballistics tracing network.
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton also promised generally to fund the expansion and testing of
so-called smart gun technologies that ensure only a gun's owner can fire it, and
to pass gun control measures that stalled last year, such as requiring trigger
locks on new guns.
</P>
<P>
	   TRADE:
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton pressed his case for normalizing trade relations with China as a
step toward China's inclusion in the World Trade Organization. The White House
wants Congress to approve the new trade status early this year.
</P>
<P>
	   MINIMUM WAGE:
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton proposed increasing the minimum wage by $1 per hour, which the
White House said would help 11.4 million people. The extra money translates to
$2,000 annually for a 40-hour work week.
</P>
<P>
	   EQUAL PAY:
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton proposed spending $27 million next year to help close the pay gap
for women workers. This is $12 million more than the government is spending this
year, and would go toward training programs for women and their employers and a
public relations campaign on wage issues.
</P>
<P>
	   COLOMBIA:
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton proposed spending $1.6 billion over two years to help fight drug
trafficking and develop the economy in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY:
</P>
<P>
	   --Clinton wants an additional $1 billion for biomedical research at the
National Institutes of Health, and $675 million more for the National Science
Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Russians Battle in Chechen Capital  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALKHAN-KALA, Russia (AP) -- Chechen snipers in high-rise buildings and
trenches fired at Russian troops trying to advance on the center of Grozny on
Thursday, while Russian bombs and rockets blanketed the capital in thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
	   International pressure was building on Russia to stop the war, with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan saying in Moscow that he wants the conflict to end
as soon as possible. The Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly called for
Russia to open cease-fire talks and to halt attacks on civilians, but rejected
proposals to suspend Russia from the group.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials, however, said that neither the military's aims nor its
tactics would change.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A concrete combat task has been set for the troops and they will fulfill
it, regardless of how certain countries outside Russia feel about it,''
presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians have been struggling to seize Grozny for one month and have
concentrated for the past week on Minutka Square. Taking the square would give
federal forces leverage to push rebels out of the city's center.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops had advanced to within about 250 yards of the square and were
moving in on the city center from the north and west, the ITAR-Tass news agency
quoted Lt. Gen. Gennady Trosehv, a top commander in the region, as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the week, Russian troops had been about 400 yards from the
square. Troshev's claim could not be independently verified.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev claimed the operation to take Grozny
``is approaching a breakthrough,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Notwithstanding the losses among the storming groups in Grozny, the
fighters' losses are far higher than ours,'' Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, a Chechen leader claimed the Russians were being forced to retreat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russian forces in many areas (of Grozny) have in fact been thrown back to
the starting positions from which they started storming in mid-January,'' rebel
commander Aslanbek Ismailov said, according to Interfax.
</P>
<P>
	   Many positions in the city have changed hands several times. The rebels move
around frequently and attack the Russians from all sides, and Russian servicemen
often take buildings by day only to abandon them at night for fear of militant
attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechen snipers were firing from high-rises west and southwest of Minutka
Square on Thursday, while federal tanks blasted rebel positions from the
southeast, Russian media reported. Rebels and Russian soldiers also were
fighting from trenches dug into streets near the square, Interfax quoted Chechen
military commander Isa Munayev as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Eyewitnesses reported the rebels were suffering shortages of food and
ammunition. Federal troops have cut many rebel supply lines, said Ruslan
Dadayev, a Chechen who left Grozny on Thursday. He said the rebels were
occasionally raiding Russian positions to steal ammunition.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships unleashed bombs and
rockets on the capital and Chechnya's southern mountains, the two main centers
of rebel resistance. The military command said Thursday that Russian aircraft
had made 100 sorties over the past 24 hours, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops entered breakaway Chechnya in September after Chechen-based
militants invaded villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan. The
rebels also were blamed for a series of deadly bombings of apartment houses in
Moscow and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
	   As many as 250,000 people have fled Chechnya since the fighting began.
Civilian deaths and the high number of refugees have prompted international
criticism of the war, which is popular among Russians.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe voted to
give Russia three months to show progress toward peace in Chechnya and improve
the plight of civilians or face expulsion from the body. The council is the
continent's highest human rights body, and expulsion would be a symbolic blow to
Russian aspirations for closer ties with Europe.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rican Actress Out of Prison  </HEADLINE>
   By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rican authorities on Thursday freed an
actress convicted of murder more than a decade ago for hiring hit men to kill
her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   The parole board decided to free Lydia Echevarria, upholding Gov. Pedro
Rossello's decision last month to grant her clemency for health reasons.
Echevarria was sentenced to 208 years in jail for the 1983 death of her husband
Luis Vigoreaux, a television producer and variety show host.
</P>
<P>
	   Suffering from diabetes, Echevarria left the prison in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Thanks to God,'' she said as she was taken to a van that whisked her past
the gates of the Women's Prison in Vega Alta, about 20 miles southwest of San
Juan. Dozens of reporters and onlookers were crowded outside the prison awaiting
her release.
</P>
<P>
	   Echevarria, 68, was convicted of murder in 1986 for hiring killers who
kidnapped Vigoreaux, beat him with a tire iron, stabbed him with an ice pick and
then locked him in the trunk of his car and set it ablaze, burning him alive.
Prosecutors said Echevarria was angry because she suspected Vigoreaux was going
to leave her for a younger woman.
</P>
<P>
	   Echevarria was known for her roles in local theater and television, and she
appeared on Vigoreaux's show.
</P>
<P>
	   The five-member parole board had the final say over whether to allow her to
go free because Rossello stopped short of granting a full pardon.
</P>
<P>
	   Echevarria's release was fought by stepsons Roberto Vigoreaux, a local
legislator, and Luis Vigoreaux Jr., himself a variety show host. Daughters
Glendaly and Vanessa supported the clemency.

<HEADLINE> Mayor: Honesty on Nuclear Waste  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The federal government should be completely open about the
risks of shipping nuclear waste across the country, Cleveland Mayor Michael R.
White said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Department of Energy has hearings scheduled Friday in Cleveland to
hear from residents concerned about a proposal that could mean the shipment of
waste from nuclear power plants through the Cleveland area toward a proposed
dump in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I urge the Department of Energy to do everything in its power to ensure
that Clevelanders receive accurate and complete information,'' White said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has proposed storing waste from the nation's nuclear power
plants at an underground dump at Yucca Mountain, Nev., about 100 miles northwest
of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest round of public hearings on the matter began Monday in Lincoln,
Neb. More hearings are scheduled Tuesday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Cleveland, Lincoln and Chicago sit along the main rail and highway
routes connecting the East Coast to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nevada destination makes Ohio an obvious transit point because of its
location between the East Coast and Midwest highway connections to Nevada, said
Robert J. Halstead, of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects. Cleveland's
position at the juncture of rail routes from Buffalo, N.Y., and Harrisburg, Pa.,
makes it a similar focal point for rail shipments, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Lesser, an official at the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio who
helped prepare testimony for the hearing, said it is too early to tell how much
waste would move through Ohio and for how long.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Gov. Apologizes for Scandal  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER WILLS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Gov. George Ryan apologized Thursday for
drivers-license corruption in the Illinois secretary of state's office, which he
headed before becoming governor a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers in the office have admitted taking bribes in exchange for granting
drivers licenses to unqualified people. The workers donated some of the bribe
money to Ryan's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal grand jury investigation has led to the indictments of 28 people.
Seventeen have pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm angered because this corruption case has overshadowed the good things
that we've done in the office,'' the Republican governor said at a news
conference. ``I'm angry at myself for not recognizing the problem a lot
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ryan has not been named as a target of the investigation and has repeatedly
denied having any knowledge that his employees were collecting cash in exchange
for fixing driver's license tests.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said he believes his campaigns were given around $150,000 by
bribe-takers. He said he has donated about $90,000 to charity to make up for the
tainted donations and will be giving more.
</P>
<P>
	   Ryan said he now sees that it was a mistake to let his government employees
contribute to his campaigns. Ryan stopped taking such contributions once he
became governor and said he may pursue legislation to ban the practice
throughout state government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This has been a very difficult lesson for me, but I've learned it and I've
learned it very well,'' Ryan said.

   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Seeking to boost his standing among an increasingly
politically active constituency, Vice President Al Gore boasted Thursday of
having more openly gay potential convention delegates in New York than Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp said that while its slate of delegates for the state's March 7
presidential primary included 11 openly gay candidates, slates for the former
senator from New Jersey had just five openly gay people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign later ended up wearing some egg when state party officials
said Bradley's campaign had reported having seven openly gay prospective
delegates -- not five as Gore had claimed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign pounced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Al Gore campaign continues to distort the facts in an attempt to win
the Democratic primary against Senator Bill Bradley at any cost -- even the cost
of the truth,'' Bradley's campaign said in a statement accusing Gore campaign of
``lies and distortions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Ragon, a spokesman for Gore's New York campaign team, conceded the
mistake, but said the error was the result of incorrection information given the
campaign by the state party.

	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole told students and teachers at an
urban elementary school Thursday that her former rival, Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush, has the character and experience to help Michigan
families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You look at his family and how devoted he is,'' she said of the Texas
governor, citing his promises to cut taxes and improve education by allowing
more decisions to be made at the local level. ``He's going to be thinking of
every way he can help families.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Dole, wife of the 1996 GOP presidential nominee, said she believes Bush
will win the New Hampshire Republican primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But not every moment focused on Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   A teacher's comment shifted the spotlight back to Mrs. Dole, a former
Cabinet secretary who quit the GOP presidential contest last year.
</P>

reading teacher, told Mrs. Dole.

	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Squabbling over New York's presidential primary ballot
continued Thursday. Developer Donald Trump won the right to compete for
Independence Party backing and Steve Forbes lost his spot on the Republican
ballot in three Long Island congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump, who is not an announced presidential candidate, is considering
running for the Reform Party's presidential nomination, and his New York
supporters are seeking to run delegate slates for him in the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But a coalition within the Independence Party, New York's version of the
Reform Party, has been trying to have Trump's delegates thrown off the ballot.
The Democracy Coalition supports Trump nemesis and Reform presidential candidate
Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   In retaliation for the Long Island challenge to his petitions, Forbes has
gone into state court in an attempt to get rival Texas Gov. George W. Bush
removed from the GOP ballot in six districts in New York City.

	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina Democratic Party members said Thursday
they have asked a federal judge to block the Feb. 19 Republican presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer representing state Rep. Todd Rutherford of Columbia and other
Democrats want the primary blocked unless the GOP opens balloting at all
precincts and conforms to federal voting rights laws.
</P>
<P>
	   State GOP Chairman Henry McMaster said Republicans plan to open all
precincts and that the complaint won't hold up in court because the party
primaries don't have to abide by federal election laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no merit to those contentions,'' McMaster said.
</P>
<P>
	   He would not say how many precincts already had arrangements to be staffed,
but said the party would try to open them all.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar complaint is pending with the U.S. Justice Department. Rutherford
and the other Democrats said the GOP was deliberately trying to keep blacks from
voting in the primary by keeping precincts closed.

	   TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Cancellation of the state's April 4 presidential
primary could make it difficult for Kansas Republicans to get their delegation
seated at the party's national convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   State GOP Chairman Mark Parkinson worried Wednesday that the 35 delegates
may not receive credentials because the party had to change its plans for
choosing them.
</P>
<P>
	   Without credentials, they won't be able to vote on the party's national
platform or its presidential nominee at the August convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   Parkinson said he is working with the Republican National Committee and
conceded that Kansas would have a problem getting its delegates recognized only
if the contest for the presidential nomination remained in doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said: ``We're scrambling.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Bill Graves and other prominent Republicans were not aware that
canceling the election could cause such a problem. Graves plans to sign a bill
that cuts the current state budget, which includes a provision canceling the
election.

	   MONTEVALLO, Ala. (AP) -- Reform Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan
said no one should be offended to see the Confederate battle flag flying over a
public building.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This flag flew over the battlefields. It never flew over the slave
fields,'' Buchanan said this week on a fund-raising swing through Alabama.
</P>
<P>
	   He said ``many great men'' fought and died for the flag, which critics view
as a symbol of slavery. Defenders see it as a symbol of Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan said one of his great-grandfathers died at Vicksburg, Miss.,
fighting for the Confederacy, and another was captured outside of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederate battle flag was removed from the pole atop the Alabama
Capitol dome in Montgomery in 1993 after a lawsuit contended that state law
provides only for the state and national flags to fly atop the Capitol.

<HEADLINE> Health groups, right-to-die pioneers start group to improve care of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WEST WINDSOR, N.J. (AP) - Pioneers in the right-to-die movement are
collaborating with New Jersey universities and health care, government and
public policy groups to find ways to ease dying patients' final months.
<P>
	   Relatives of the dying, and caregivers from doctors to pastoral counselors,
need to learn how to provide compassion, comfort and dignity to the dying,
representatives of the 23-member New Jersey Comfort Care Coalition said Thursday
in announcing the month-old organization's goals.
</P>
<P>
	   "We receive so much love and care around the beginning of our life. Why
shouldn't we receive the same love and care at the end of our life?" said Julia
Quinlan, the Wantage Township woman who, with her husband, founded the Karen Ann
Quinlan Hospice in memory of their daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Karen Ann died in a Morris Plains nursing home in 1984, more than nine years
after she mysteriously slipped into a coma at age 21 after having a few drinks
at a party. Her parents' efforts to get a Catholic hospital to disconnect her
respirator led to the New Jersey Supreme Court's landmark 1976 decision granting
the right to die, the nation's first such court ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Armstrong, the attorney who argued the case for the Quinlans and a
nationally prominent medical ethicist, said New Jersey has a proud history of
pioneering patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong cited the state's comprehensive laws governing living wills and
the state Supreme Court's rulings in the Quinlan case and in 1987 in the case of
Kathleen Farrell, a young wife dying at home whose right to be disconnected from
a respirator was affirmed after her death.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite that, he said, "We found that we weren't doing such a good job at
the bedside."
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition hopes to change that.
</P>
<P>
	   It plans to develop public outreach and professional training programs that
can be models for the rest of the nation, said Gary Stein, executive director of
the coalition's lead agency, New Jersey Health Decisions. Armstrong chairs the
board of the nonprofit group, which tries to get to the public involved in
healthcare issues and decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   "Above all, we seek to promote comfort, compassion and caring for the
dying," Stein said.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition plans public education and outreach programs - from television
and radio ads to public policy forums - to teach the public about care options
to make dying less painful physically and spiritually, rather than to simply
prolong dying with technology. Those options include hospice programs, which
generally care for terminal patients in their homes, emphasizing pain control,
emotional support and other comfort measures, as well as less formal strategies.
</P>
<P>
	   Stein said mini-courses for doctors, nurses, social workers and clergy in
training could start by fall at professional schools at coalition members
Rutgers University, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and
Drew University's Theological School. Full-fledged, semester-long courses could
begin at the universities in the spring of 2001, and other, continuing-education
programs will be developed for doctors, nurses and counselors already working.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition also will develop ways to evaluate the new strategies'
influence, and will examine state policy on financing care of the dying and
design an innovative package of end-of-life benefits for state-regulated
insurance plans. Both federal and state medical reimbursement programs often
cover aggressive, life-prolonging treatment but don't adequately reimburse for
less-expensive care focused on the patient's comfort.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, the coalition has secured three grants from foundations, including
a three-year, $450,000 support grant from the Plainsboro-based Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation. The other two grants, each for $60,000, will fund specific
projects.
</P>
<P>
	   One, from the Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey, will support efforts to
help people with disabilities get better care and make decisions about advance
directives, legal documents also called living wills that detail what care
patients do and do not want in their final days.
</P>
<P>
	   The other, from the Soros Foundation's Project on Death in America, will be
used to develop a model curriculum at the Rutgers University School of Social
Work to help social workers guide their clients through end-of-life care
decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Quinlan, a coalition supporter, said the dying deserve dignity and
respect.
</P>
<P>
	   "I became aware of a dying patient's needs when Karen was in the intensive
care unit at St. Clare's Hospital," in Denville, she said. "I just felt there
had to be a better way to care for the dying."
</P>
<P>
	   Years after Julia and Joseph Quinlan founded the hospice, her husband was
treated by the program during his final seven weeks as he succumbed to cancer,
Mrs. Quinlan recalled. They were able to share meals daily and his pets were at
his side constantly.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was totally different from a hospital setting," she said. "It gave me
the opportunity to share in his death as we had shared the laughter, the joys
and the sorrows in our life."

<P>
	   Much of the nation saw snow -- and braced for even more -- while still
digging out and trying to return to normal Thursday after the wintry punch that
caught so many people flat-footed earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
	   In Oklahoma, schools were closed statewide, meetings postponed, and state
employees excused from work. Some courts also shut down so workers could stay
safe at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasters called for more snow in central Oklahoma -- as much as 10 to 14
inches -- and said some roads could become nearly impassable.
</P>
<P>
	   Slipping and sliding, Arkansas residents abandoned their jobs by the
thousands and tried to make it home as up to 15 inches of snow fell.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At one time it was coming so thick, it looked like the world ended 200
yards from the windows,'' said Pati Brown, the manager of the Mountain Harbor
Resort in Mount Ida, Ark.
</P>
<P>
	   Many schools and businesses were closed, and tens of thousands remained
without electricity Thursday throughout the Carolinas, Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama residents stripped store shelves bare, closed schools and generally
hunkered down, while freezing rain, sleet and snow interrupted hundreds of
airline flights, snarled highway traffic and cut power to thousands of homes
across North and Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Baltimore announced that it already had exhausted its annual snow removal
budget as of Thursday, half of the Maryland's school districts remained closed
and commuters cursed snow-narrowed streets as traffic crawled.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia residents as far south as Albany and Columbus were nervously
awaiting more snow, sleet and freezing rain that were predicted -- with images
of last week's ice-covered roads and darkened houses in the Atlanta area still
fresh on their minds.
</P>
<P>
	   Last weekend's storm in north Georgia left 500,000 customers without
electricity and caused an estimated $44 million in damage. The coming storm is
expected to cover a much greater area and dump even more precipitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Emboldened by sunshine and improving roads, North Carolinians dug out their
cars and began replenishing empty pantries, still amazed by the 2-foot
snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
	   Making her first grocery shopping foray since Monday night's storm, Ann Long
recalled how the falling snow looked beautiful at first:
</P>
<P>
	   ``But then it started to look a little like a monster. ... And I thought
it's amazing how fast something that is so pretty can turn into something so
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, on standdown since the Y2K
threat fizzled, was up and running to respond to emergencies. The rest of the
state was shutting down, including schools and colleges, local governments and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Even in Florida, winter's reach matched its grasp.
</P>
<P>
	   The chilly weather kept beachgoers out of the surf at Daytona Beach, and the
Volusia County Beach Patrol sent home its part-time lifeguards because there
weren't enough swimmers.

<HEADLINE> Gillette Reports Earnings Decline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- Gillette, the troubled leader of the world's shaving products
industry, reported declining profits in the fourth quarter as sales slumped in
most key product lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's net income for the three-month period ending Dec. 31, 1999 was
$339 million, down from $435 million in the same period of 1998. Earnings per
share dropped from 39 to 32 cents, meeting the lowered expectations of analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter fell from $3.18 billion in 1998 to $3.04 billion in
1999.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, Gillette warned investors to expect a decline in sales and
profits as it worked to fix problems in underperforming sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of blades and razors dropped 8 percent from the same quarter in 1998,
and profits from those products were down 18 percent. Duracell battery sales
rose 9 percent on the quarter, but profits dropped 2 percent, and sales of Braun
products were lower as well, with profits dropping 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Full-year sales for 1999 were $9.9 billion, down from $10.1 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The company earned a total of $1.3 billion, or $1.14 per share in 1999, up
from $1.1 billion, or 95 cents per share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Gillette were up 68 3/4 cents, at $40, at 5:15 p.m. on the New
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Arrests in Strike Called by Basques  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) -- Police detained 15 protesters participating in a
general strike Thursday to demand the transfer of 400 separatist prisoners to
jails closer to home.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike was called by the Euskal Herritarrok party, considered the
political wing of the ETA militant group. The strike covered the three northern
provinces that make up the Basque region and included the cities of Bilbao and
San Sebastian.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike was widely ignored, Spain's main trade unions and a Basque
employers federation said. Only small stores, particularly in rural areas,
closed because of pressure from picketers, the state news agency EFE said.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike comes a week after a car-bomb, widely blamed on the ETA, killed
an army colonel in Madrid and sparked mass anti-ETA demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   ETA, which has killed nearly 800 people since 1968, ended a 14-month
cease-fire on Dec. 3 and warned that its violent campaign for Basque
independence would resume.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of those detained Thursday were accused of assaulting a policeman while
the rest were arrested for offenses such as disrupting traffic, EFE reported.
Also, train service between the towns of Irun and Tolosa was disrupted because
electrical power lines were sabotaged, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   No major incidents of violence were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The neighboring Navarra region, which has many Basque speakers, was included
in the strike call because separatists want to incorporate it into a future
Basque state.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Father Reacting With Rage  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father expressed rage Thursday at the
perceived treatment his boy's grandmothers received during their reunion with
the child, blaming Cuban exiles for difficulties during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I felt very indignant,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez told reporters in Havana.
``They just ruined everything.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez complained that during Wednesday's meeting in Miami Beach, the
grandmothers' cellular phones were confiscated, making it impossible for him to
speak freely with his son for the first time since the boy's Nov. 25 rescue off
Florida's coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez and his family have accused Elian's Miami relatives of listening in
and cutting short telephone calls between father and son. He also believed the
relatives had tried tell the 6-year-old what to say -- and not say.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and Fidel Castro's top
man for Cuba-U.S. relations, complained that anti-communist protests held near
the home of Barry University president Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, where the
reunion took place, created ``infernal conditions'' for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Alarcon was accompanying Gonzalez during a meeting with a Pittsburgh
delegation discussing sister city plans for Matanzas, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Alarcon accused the Miami relatives of breaking an agreement not to make
contact with the grandmothers during the meeting. Not only did Elian's cousin
turn the boy over to the grandmothers, she also listened at the door and
recounted what happened later, Alarcon said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said O'Laughlin cut short the meeting, which he said was supposed to last
at least two to three hours under agreements with the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like some people visiting a person in jail,'' Alarcon charged.
</P>
<P>
	   He also criticized the confiscation of the cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They prevented the boy from talking with his father and grandfathers. It
would have been the first chance to talk with them without the pressures
exercised by the kidnappers,'' he said, using the Cuban government's term for
those advocating Elian's presence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Thursday, the Cuban government said the grandmothers were subjected
to ``betrayals'' and ``humiliations'' during their reunion with the child and
criticized the nun who hosted the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   In an editorial entitled ``Disgustingly Infamous,'' the Communist Party
daily Granma said the tense 90-minute reunion was marked by ``deceits, lies,
tricks, betrayals, humiliations, and inhuman and despotic treatment'' for the
``the loving and heroic grandmothers.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The university president entered the room repeatedly and in an urgent tone
declared that the meeting was over,'' the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sister O'Laughlin said Thursday that she decided the boy should stay in the
United States. While blaming both sides for the stressful encounter, she
especially criticized Cuban officials' heavy-handedness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She should be a little bit serious,'' Alarcon said. ``What heavy handed?
She didn't even allow a phone conversation with the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Paternal grandmother Mariela Quintana and maternal grandmother Raquel
Rodriguez brought letters and pictures from the boy's former classmates to the
Wednesday night meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 chanting, flag-waving anti-communist demonstrators reportedly
could be clearly heard inside the house. Some cheered and others booed as the
grandmothers made their way inside.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers later flew to Washington for meetings with more lawmakers
in their fight to bring Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast. He had left
Cuba with his mother, who died along with her boyfriend and nine others when
their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
	   The child's Miami relatives want him to stay in the United States. But his
father, four grandparents and great-grandmother want him back, and Cuba's
government has launched a massive political drive criticizing the United States
and Cuban exiles.

<HEADLINE> Judge Throws McCain Back Off Ballot  </HEADLINE>
   By JESSE J. HOLLAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A judge on Thursday threw Sen. John McCain out of the
Republican presidential primary in eight of New York's congressional districts,
one day after two Democratic election officials helped him stay on those
ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Cannizzaro overturned the state Board of
Elections' decision to allow McCain to compete in the districts despite
challenges from state Republicans, most of whom support GOP presidential
front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In the challenged districts, the Arizona senator did not have the number of
signatures on his presidential petitions that state law requires in order to
qualify for the primary. However, McCain supporters argued that the signature
requirement should not apply to him since he is a valid presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   New York election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane.
But Cannizzaro disagreed, calling the signature requirements ``reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from party members to
qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31
congressional districts in which they wish to compete. In effect, there are 31
separate GOP primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters had challenged McCain in 16 districts. Cannizzaro's decision
leaves McCain off the ballot in a fourth of the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Buley, a state Republican Committee lawyer working in support of Bush,
cheered the decision. ``We're pleased and think it was the proper decision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign lawyer Henry Berger said they had not yet decided whether
to appeal. McCain on Friday planned to ask a federal judge to place him on the
ballot in all 31 of New York's congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are disappointed,'' Berger said. ``But I'm going to see what happens in
federal court ... and then make a decision whether to appeal.''
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   In an ironic twist, it was Democrats who helped McCain stay on the ballot in
those eight districts. The two Republican members of the state elections board
had voted Wednesday to uphold the challenges to McCain's petitions. But the
board's two Democrats abstained, thus depriving the Bush camp of the third vote
it needed to have the petitions invalidated.
</P>
<P>
	   The state board had hoped to finalize the ballot by Jan. 31.

<HEADLINE> Analysts: Coke Still Good Investment  </HEADLINE>
    By CHAD ROEDEMEIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- While investor uncertainty continued to hit the stock of
Coca-Cola Co. hard Thursday, some analysts are saying that the company remains a
good choice for people who invest for the long term.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke has suffered through three tough years and Wednesday said it was
eliminating 6,000 jobs -- more than one-fifth of its work force.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke shares fell $3.56 Thursday to $59.50 on the New York Stock Exchange,
putting its loss for the past two days at nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Phil Larkins, who manages money for wealthy clients at Atlanta-based
Legacy South, said none of his clients have called him about getting rid of
their Coke holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given the premier global distribution network they have, and given the fact
that it's the No. 1 recognized brand name in the world, it still has a certain
comfort level for long-term investors," Larkins said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Douglas Lane, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in New York, said
he is encouraging investors to buy Coke stock now -- not only for its long-term
potential, but because he expects Coke to bounce back soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Lane said the job cuts put Coca-Cola back on course after nearly two years
of falling profits and image problems. He expects a more efficient Coca-Cola to
resume its strong growth toward the end of this year and into 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not the time to be looking in the rear-view mirror at Coke," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But there is still some uncertainty at Big Red. Incoming CEO Doug Daft
indicated that long-term growth goals have been too ambitious, and the company
will not give details on its new strategic plan for another six months.
</P>
<P>
	   Without some further clarity from the company, short-term investors are
likely to stay away, analysts said. That could come as early as Friday, when
Coke executives travel to New York for a briefing for analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   The company suffered a string of setbacks during the last 18 months,
including a severe economic downturn in Asian markets, a discrimination lawsuit
filed by a group of minority employees and a costly product recall and two
failed takeover bids in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest job cutback in Coke's 113-year-history, announced Wednesday,
will affect 2,500 positions at the company's Atlanta headquarters, 800 elsewhere
in the United States and 2,700 outside the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The reorganization is aimed at reducing control from Atlanta and giving more
power to managers around the world. Some stock analysts said the job cuts were a
tacit admission by Coke that it had become bloated and overinvested in some
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke estimated that the job cuts will save $300 million a year, but said
earnings would be reduced by $800 million before taxes this year to the cover
costs of the realignment.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Swanson, an analyst for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, said the job cuts
will let the company react more efficiently to changes in the global economy. He
said its stock price will improve as the economy improves in other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their bottom line performance is very tied to the global economy," Swanson
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The move may have been good for investors, but it hit employees hard.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's very low morale and a lot of questions," Coke employee Camille
Martin said Thursday outside the company's gated compound. "There's a lot of
fixing up this company has to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Martin voluntarily turned in her resignation notice two months ago, but
said her co-workers in the accounting department will not find out who loses
their jobs for another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Coca-Cola is one of Atlanta's most prominent companies, the job
cuts should not hurt the booming local economy, said Don Ratajczak, director of
economic forecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "How significant is this layoff to Atlanta's economy? Psychologically, it's
huge; economically, it's small," Ratajczak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola barely sneaks into the top 20 employers in the city, Ratajczak
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last 12 months, Atlanta created 115,000 jobs -- more jobs than all of
New England created in the same time period, Ratajczak said. With an
unemployment rate of only 2.6 percent, the displaced workers from Coke should
have little trouble finding jobs.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court reverses Monmouth child rape conviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Agreeing with an appeals panel, the state Supreme
Court Thursday reversed a 1996 verdict in which a Monmouth County father was
convicted of raping his young daughter.
<P>
	   In a 4-3 decision, the justices ruled that the trial court judge gave the
jury too much leeway to consider testimony from the victim's older sister, who
said she too was molested by the father when she was little.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendant, who was identified only by his initials G.V., was never
charged in the older girl's case because the statute of limitations had run out,
according to Deputy Attorney General Teresa A. Blair.
</P>
<P>
	   He was convicted of molesting and raping his younger daughter for a
five-year period starting when she was 6, and was sentenced to 15 years in
prison. But the Appellate Division reversed the conviction on aggravated sexual
assault and other charges, setting the stage for Thursday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair said the state will retry G.V., and will abide by the justices' ruling
limiting the use of the older daughter's testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a shame we have to retry it," she said, noting the trauma the
daughters, now both in their 20s, will have to relive.
</P>
<P>
	   G.V.'s defense attorney, Alan I. Smith, declined to comment, saying he had
not yet read the 46-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the ruling, the victim, whom the court referred to as Laura,
lived with her father, mother, older sister and two younger brothers in an
unidentified Monmouth County community.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1985, when Laura was 6, her father began to touch her intimate parts or
have her touch his. Two years later, they began to have sexual intercourse. On
some occasions, G.V. forced Laura to have sex with one of the brothers, the
ruling said.
</P>
<P>
	   He told the girl that he would kill her, other family members and her pets
if she told anyone of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   G.V. and his wife later split up and she obtained a restraining order
against him for unrelated reasons. But when Laura learned that her mother sought
to rescind the order, she sank into a deep depression "staring into space,
unable to speak, with her body clenched," the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't until after she was hospitalized for anorexia and bulimia that
Laura, by then 13 years old, confided to another patient about her father. The
older sister then revealed that G.V. had molested her as well many years
earlier, the justices wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   But because the defendant was not convicted in the older girl's case, her
trial testimony of "other crimes" was so prejudicial as to warrant a reversal in
the younger girl's case, a majority of the justices ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nothing could be more prejudicial than the erroneous admission of such
testimony," the court wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   A majority of the justices ruled that the older daughter's testimony could
only be allowed in a retrial to counter G.V.'s "vendetta defense" that Laura
fabricated the charges in anger over his leaving her mother for a new
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   But Associate Justice Virginia Long, in a dissenting opinion shared by Chief
Justice Deborah Poritz, said a jury shouldn't be allowed to hear the older
girl's testimony even in that narrow context.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices also parted ways on a remedy. While a majority said the error
was serious enough to warrant a reversal, Associate Justices James H. Coleman
Jr., Marie Garibaldi and Peter Verniero disagreed.

<HEADLINE> Woman Connected To Columbine Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By JON SARCHE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- The young woman who bought two shotguns and a rifle for the
Columbine gunmen at a gun show told a legislative committee Thursday she
supports a bill requiring background checks at such shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Robyn Anderson, who was 18 at the time, told legislators she wished it had
been harder to buy guns for Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who were 17. Ms.
Anderson said she would not have purchased the guns if she had to give her name
for a criminal background check.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I look back at it, I think I was kind of naive,'' she said. ``I wish
a law requiring background checks had been in effect at the time.''
</P>
<P>
	   She insisted she did not know of Harris and Klebold's plans to use the guns
inside the high school last April. The gunmen shot 12 students and a teacher to
death before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I assumed they asked me to buy the guns because their parents would not
have approved,'' Ms. Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Anderson has not been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
	   She did not have to undergo a background check because the purchase was from
a private dealer. The bill would require background checks by private sellers as
well as licensed sellers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature is also considering bills that would prohibit gun sales to
people under 21 and sales to people who are buying firearms for someone else.
All have the backing of Gov. Bill Owens.
</P>
<P>
	   A Republican lawmaker who opposes the gun-show bill, Rep. Shawn Mitchell,
said Ms. Anderson was being used by the measure's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You tragically and carelessly did something and now you're tragically and
carelessly being manipulated,'' Mitchell said.

<HEADLINE> Man Executed in Texas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man was executed by injection Thursday for
stabbing two men to death 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   James Walter Moreland, 39, never denied killing Clinton Corbet Abbott and
John Royce Cravey. The two friends were stabbed repeatedly in the back, robbed
and left to die in a Eustace trailer home after a day of beer drinking Oct. 9,
1982.
</P>
<P>
	   After he was strapped to the gurney Thursday night, Moreland's first words
were, ``Jesus, God, Lord.''
</P>
<P>
	   He gave a lengthy final statement in which he told his father and brother,
watching through a window nearby, that he loved them. Moreland then turned to
his victims' relatives and apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I really mean that. It's not just words. My life is all I can give. I

<HEADLINE> EU, US Claim Win in Banana Dispute  </HEADLINE>
   By NAOMI KOPPEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- With neither the United States nor the European Union
appealing, the World Trade Organization on Thursday formally adopted its earlier
ruling that a controversial U.S. trade law is valid.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides claimed victory in the dispute, which stemmed from how the law
was being applied to EU banana imports.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first time that a dispute between the two trading powers was
settled in the WTO with neither side appealing. The WTO ruled last month that
the law is legal.
</P>
<P>
	   The law, Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act, allows the United States to
impose sanctions on another country for breaking trade rules without first
consulting other WTO members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are pleased that the U.S. has requested the adoption of this report
that will bring them, I hope, definitively in the path of multilateralism,''
said EU Ambassador Roderick Abbott.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The EU has decided not to appeal. We feel very good about the results of
this report,'' said U.S. Ambassador Rita Hayes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Europeans brought the matter to the WTO when the United States initiated
the Section 301 procedure in the long-running dispute between the two trading
powers over EU banana imports.
</P>
<P>
	   Three trade experts appointed to consider the dispute ruled last month that
the law was illegal in principle, but that in practice the United States had
made a firm commitment never to impose sanctions without getting WTO approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the adoption of the report, the controversy over 301 is not yet
finished.
</P>
<P>
	   A second panel has been asked to look at the use of the law in the banana
dispute and report back in March.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union claims Washington acted illegally by announcing its
intention to impose sanctions before a decision was made by the WTO. Although
sanctions were not actually imposed until the United States had WTO permission,
Washington then illegally backdated the sanctions, the EU claims.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is currently imposing sanctions of $191 million per year
on European Union imports.

<HEADLINE> Judge Throws McCain Back Off Ballot  </HEADLINE>
   By JESSE J. HOLLAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A judge on Thursday threw Sen. John McCain out of the
Republican presidential primary in eight of New York's congressional districts,
one day after two Democratic election officials helped him stay on those
ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Cannizzaro overturned the state Board of
Elections' decision to allow McCain to compete in the districts despite
challenges from state Republicans, most of whom support GOP presidential
front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In the challenged districts, the Arizona senator did not have the number of
signatures on his presidential petitions that state law requires in order to
qualify for the primary. However, McCain supporters argued that the signature
requirement should not apply to him since he is a valid presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   New York election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane.
But Cannizzaro disagreed, calling the signature requirements ``reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from party members to
qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31
congressional districts in which they wish to compete. In effect, there are 31
separate GOP primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters had challenged McCain in 16 districts. Cannizzaro's decision
leaves McCain off the ballot in a fourth of the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Buley, a state Republican Committee lawyer working in support of Bush,
cheered the decision. ``We're pleased and think it was the proper decision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign lawyer Henry Berger said they had not yet decided whether
to appeal. McCain on Friday planned to ask a federal judge to place him on the
ballot in all 31 of New York's congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are disappointed,'' Berger said. ``But I'm going to see what happens in
federal court ... and then make a decision whether to appeal.''
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   In an ironic twist, it was Democrats who helped McCain stay on the ballot in
those eight districts. The two Republican members of the state elections board
had voted Wednesday to uphold the challenges to McCain's petitions. But the
board's two Democrats abstained, thus depriving the Bush camp of the third vote
it needed to have the petitions invalidated.
</P>
<P>
	   The state board had hoped to finalize the ballot by Jan. 31.

<HEADLINE> Former city prosecutor says he conspired with Camden mayor to  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A former Camden municipal prosecutor admitted
Thursday that he conspired with Mayor Milton Milan to shake down a city employee
for a $5,000 political bribe.
<P>
	   Milan vehemently denied the allegations made in federal court by Joseph S.
Caruso, saying they were "totally untrue." Caruso pleaded guilty and implicated
Milan.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's striking a deal. He's doing what he has to do," Milan said. "He's an
individual who got into some type of trouble and is looking to make the best of
it."
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso, 35, of Voorhees, a former Democratic fundraiser and member of
Milan's transition team, admitted soliciting a $5,000 campaign donation from
Elliot Stomel, a municipal public defender, in 1997 in order for Stomel to be
reappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Caruso, the $5,000 was requested on behalf of Milan, who became
the city's mayor in 1997. Stomel was told he would lose his $30,000-a-year job
if he didn't make the contribution.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso told U.S. District Judge Stephen M. Orlofsky that Milan repeatedly
asked him if Stomel had paid the contribution. The money was eventually
deposited into a fund that paid for Milan's mayoral campaign events.
</P>
<P>
	   Stomel initially gave Caruso a check payable to a political action committee
supporting unsuccessful Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jim McGreevy. That
check was never cashed and Caruso asked Stomel to replace it with one payable to
Milan's political action committee.
</P>
<P>
	   McGreevy, the mayor of Woodbridge, was out of the country Thursday and could
not be reached for comment. But a spokesman said his campaign was unaware of the
contribution. Federal authorities, too, said he did not know about the donation.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a plea agreement reached in court Thursday, Caruso agreed to cooperate
with federal authorities investigating the Milan administration and alleged
corruption in Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm the mayor of the City of Camden. I'm focused and not concerned he's
testifying against me," Milan said. "I'm just amazed and shocked that the
justice system would allow that to happen."
</P>
<P>
	   The guilty plea is the latest sign that prosecutors are putting more heat on
Milan, who has not been charged with a crime. In recent weeks, his name has
surfaced in a drug trial with former drug dealers alleging that Milan purchased
cocaine and tipped them off about pending raids.
</P>
<P>
	   Last summer, federal authorities raided Milan's home and City Hall office.
Milan has not been charged with any wrongdoing, although his attorney at the
time said Milan was the target of the probe.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that the mayor is the
target," Milan's attorney, Carlos Martir, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso agreed to tell investigators what he knows about alleged corruption
in Camden. His attorney, Jeffrey Zucker, would not elaborate on that testimony,
but said "I think it's pretty obvious."
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso, a lawyer, may face disciplinary action that could include
disbarment.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan has said he never spoke with Caruso about reappointing Stomel in
exchange for a campaign contribution. Stomel had been the city's public defender
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   In court Thursday, Caruso matter-of-factly responded to questions by the
judge.
</P>
<P>
	   He admitted acting as Milan's messenger and soliciting Stomel on behalf of
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did the mayor tell you in the presence of others that the mayor would
reappoint Stomel, if Stomel paid the $5,000 political contribution?" the judge
asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso replied, "yes."
</P>
<P>
	   The case came to light after Stomel notified prosecutors and agreed to
secretly record conversations with Caruso. Stomel said Caruso told him that
Milan was considering naming another lawyer as public defender.
</P>
<P>
	   Days after the bribe was paid, a resolution before city Council appointing a
new municipal public defender was removed from the agenda under orders from the
mayor, prosecutors said. Stomel received a one-year reappointment a short time
later.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso stood trial in December on extortion and bribery charges involving
the $5,000 contribution. The trial ended in a hung jury and his lawyer began
negotiating a plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after his indictment, Caruso was fired as municipal prosecutor.
Stomel also was dismissed after he testified at Caruso's trial. He has sued the
city alleging that he was fired because he testified.
</P>
<P>
	   By pleading guilty, Caruso hopes to avoid a prison sentence and retain his
law license. He faces probation to up to five years in prison and a $250,000
fine on the conspiracy charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlofsky scheduled sentencing for April 7.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Rise in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was lower against the yen early Friday as traders
eyed a tumble by the euro. Japanese stocks rose.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was quoted at 105.02 yen, down 0.62 yen from its level of 105.64
yen late Thursday in Tokyo and below 105.09 yen late in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 75.04 points, or 0.39
percent, to 19,284.76 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the
average closed up 98.53 points, or 0.52 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar retreated against the yen as dealers
anticipated the reaction of Asian markets to the euro's fall overseas Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy selling of euros for dollars by U.S. hedge funds pushed the European
currency at one point to an all-time low of 98.69 cents in New York trading
Thursday. The euro later recovered somewhat to trade at 98.86 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Friday in Tokyo, the euro was quoted at 103.69 yen, down from 105.84
yen the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei posted moderate gains as investors bet that
new investment funds were set to pump money into shares in technology companies
and other growth industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, a wait-and-see attitude prevailed amid concern that a U.S. interest
rate rise expected to be announced next week may be only the first of several
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section companies was up
16.05 points, or 0.95 percent, at 1,701.95. The TOPIX rose 21.81 points, or 1.31
percent, to 1,685.90 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.6600
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6350. Its price fell 0.11 point to 100.34.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ethics Complaint Reviewed  </HEADLINE>
   By KELLY P. KISSEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday ordered its
professional conduct committee to investigate complaints that President Clinton
lied and obstructed justice in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee could suspend the president's law license or recommend he be
disbarred if it finds merit to the complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said Thursday, ``We're not commenting on
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arkansas lawyer L. Lynn Hogue filed the first complaint on behalf of the
Southeastern Legal Foundation of Atlanta on Sept. 15, 1998, days after Clinton
testified before Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's order was issued after Hogue told the court he thought the
complaint had been ignored for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a victory not only for SLF, but also for the nation's legal
community and the millions of Americans who still believe that lawyers who lie
under oath have forfeited their right to practice law,'' foundation president
Matt Glavin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The second complaint was filed by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright
last April after she found Clinton in contempt of court during the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was asked in both cases about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
In her complaint, Wright said Clinton testified falsely.
</P>
<P>
	   James Neal, director for the court's professional conduct committee, did not
return telephone calls seeking comment. In the court proceedings, the committee
argued that confidentiality prevented release of information about the case.
</P>
<P>
	   According to committee guidelines, if the committee finds sufficient
evidence to support a complaint, a docket number will be assigned and Clinton
notified.
</P>
<P>
	   After Clinton and the accusers respond, the committee will consider the
evidence and possible punishments. The most serious would be to refer the case
to circuit court for disbarment proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Icahn To Control Bankrupt Casino  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN CURRAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Five months after filing for bankruptcy
protection, the Claridge Hotel and Casino Corp. proposed a reorganization plan
Thursday under which billionaire financier Carl Icahn would get control of the
struggling casino.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden, calls for the casino's
landlord and the partnership that owns the enterprise to transfer the Claridge's
assets to a reorganized Claridge.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the casino's unusual corporate structure, the limited partnership owns
all of the property's non-casino assets except a parking garage. It leases them
to the Claridge Corp.'s operating subsidiary. The subsidiary, in turn, owns the
slot machines and table games and is responsible for making debt payments to the
bondholders.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the reorganization plan filed Thursday, the holders of the
Claridge's $85 million in first mortgage notes would be given 100 percent of the
equity in the new Claridge.
</P>
<P>
	   In a bow to the casino's smaller investors, the plan also gives noteholders
the option of instead receiving a new 10-year secured note up to $100,000 or 15
percent of the principal amount of his or her holdings, whichever is greater.
</P>
<P>
	   Creditors, meanwhile, would be paid their due -- but not immediately. The
plan calls for them to be paid in full in seven equal annual installments
beginning the day the plan is approved by a judge.
</P>
<P>
	   A hearing on the plan will be held within a month. No date has been set.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Claridge spokesman Glenn Lillie said the casino, which
originally opened in 1981, would continue to operate normally.
</P>
<P>
	   Icahn is the largest single bondholder, owning about 40 percent of the
bonds. If approved, the Claridge's "joint plan of ownership" would put control
of the business into Icahn's hands.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the nation's richest men, Icahn is known for buying troubled
companies at bargain prices and then reselling them at a profit.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear Thursday what Icahn's plans are for the Claridge. His
bankruptcy attorney, Ed Weisfelner, would not say whether Icahn intends to
operate the Claridge himself or sell it if he gains control.

<HEADLINE> Burger King Ads Over Pokemon Dangers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Burger King says it will run national ads next week
publicizing a second recall of its Pokemon toy balls after a 4-month-old
Indianapolis boy suffocated in his crib on one of the toys.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami-based restaurant chain's announcement came hours after the
Consumer Product Safety Commission issued its second nationwide alert in a month
about the dangers posed by ``Poke Balls.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 25 million of the toys were handed out with Burger King children's
meals late last year. The packaging contained no warnings and described them as
``safety tested and recommended for all ages.''
</P>
<P>
	   Zachary Jones was the second infant to suffocate when half of the hollow
ball, about the size of a tennis ball, covered his mouth and nose. He died
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Another plastic ball was blamed for the suffocation death of a 13-month-old
California girl in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Burger King said it will start running 15-second television advertisements
on Tuesday warning parents about the toys. The ads will run for one week on all
major networks and more than 20 cable outlets, spokeswoman Kim Miller said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's consumer alert says parents should ``immediately take the balls
away from children under the age of 3. They should discard the ball or return
both halves of the ball and the clip to a Burger King restaurant for a free
order of fries.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Pokemon toys were safety tested only for choking, not for suffocation.
Burger King spokesman Charles Nicolas said it's not an industry practice to test
for suffocation.
</P>
<P>
	   When the recall was first announced Dec. 27, Burger King placed an ad in USA
Today, posted signs in its restaurants and sent out notices to 56,000
pediatricians. It had also put the recall announcement on its tray liners and
carryout bags.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Speech May Aid Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- The State of the Union and the State of Al Gore's
Campaign are so intertwined that the vice president has made sure one man has
his fingerprints on both efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Shrum, who is traveling with Gore in the final days of the New Hampshire
campaign, helped write the address that dovetails with Gore's campaign proposals
and gives him credit for administration achievements, aides say.
</P>
<P>
	   The speech is peppered with half a dozen laudatory references to Gore, as in
``with the help of the vice president'' and ``I propose we follow Vice President
Gore's suggestion...''
</P>
<P>
	   If Gore has his way, he will benefit as much as Clinton from the nationally
televised address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have fought alongside this president for the economy and for the other
important things we have seen from the Clinton-Gore administration,'' the vice
president told New Hampshire Public Radio. Hours later, Gore flew to Washington
to take his traditional State of the Union perch behind Clinton -- looking down
on Congress, applauding his boss and basking in the president's praise.
</P>
<P>
	   Shrum said that scene will help Gore in his campaign against Bill Bradley.
The former New Jersey senator, rocked in the vice president's 2-to-1 victory in
the Iowa caucuses, is struggling to stay close to the front-running Gore in
state polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vice president's there at the address. He's doing his job. People
believe he has the experience and skills to keep the prosperity and the economy
in good shape,'' Shrum said between campaign stops with the vice president.
``Any kind of visual confirmation will be very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
	   So helpful, indeed, that Bradley's campaign has accused the White House of
purposely scheduling the address five days before Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
	   Shrum is a full-time campaign adviser and a part-time White House
consultant, putting him at the intersection of Clinton's policies and Gore's
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington operative played down his role, saying he hadn't been
involved in the address in several days. Even then, ``I didn't see my role as a
representative of the vice president. I was helping the president,'' Shrum said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, advisers say Shrum and the vice president's West Wing staff left
their mark on the speech. Gore's chief of staff, Charles Burson, reviewed early
drafts and attended rehearsals with the president and his staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers said final drafts of the text included new adult education,
children's health care, environmental and technology programs -- all of which
fit Gore's campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the runup to the speech, Clinton announced emergency subsidies for
low-income families to pay heating bills in about a dozen states, including $5.4
million for this state alone. Shortly before the Iowa caucuses, Clinton gave his
vice president credit for a new health care initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore is a big part of this presidency,'' said Clinton's chief of staff,
John Podesta. ``Next week, we'll have the biggest economic expansion in the
nation's history. Al Gore is a big part of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   This is the latest evolution of what Gore himself called ``a complex
relationship'' with Clinton. Just as polls show most Americans are torn between
their approval of Clinton's performance and their disappointment with his
personal behavior, Gore seems to have wavered between embracing his boss and
pushing him away.
</P>
<P>
	   But the vice president says people oversimplify their relationship. ``It's
not true that I'm either distancing myself from him or that I'm trying to run as
a derivative candidate,'' Gore told New Hampshire Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said Gore can link himself to Clinton this week because eight out
of 10 New Hampshire Democrats approve of Clinton's job performance, even if his
personal approval rating is much lower. Gore also stands to benefit from
dramatic improvements in New Hampshire's economy since the 1992 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think as far as the primaries are concerned this is good for Gore, as
long as the focus is on Clinton's programs and not him personally,'' said David
Rhode, political science professor at Michigan State University.
</P>
<P>
	   Other analysts said Gore has already rounded up the pro-Clinton vote, thus
the address won't pad his margin over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody knows he's Clinton's vice president so I don't think it adds
much,'' said Democratic consultant Jim Duffy of Washington. ``Regardless of
whether the initiatives are his or the president's, he will stand or fall on
people's impressions of whether he can be a leader. Recently, he's done a pretty
good job of showing people he can do the job. He's on a roll now. He's on a roll
because of the way he's campaigning -- the way he's communicating -- rather than
program stuff.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But, then again, the timing can't hurt,'' Duffy added.

   Clinton proposes $350 billion tax cut in final State of the Union
By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) --President Clinton proposed a $350 billion tax cut and big
spending increases for schools and health care Thursday night as he offered the
final agenda of his presidency and declared, ``The state of our union is the
strongest it has ever been.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said that next month the United States will achieve the longest
period of economic growth in its history. In remarks prepared for delivery
before a joint session of Congress, he called on Americans to ``set great goals
for our nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president also was to propose a gun-licensing plan that would require
congressional action, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president offered a long litany of initiatives, many of them sure to be
rewritten or ignored by an election-year Congress. His tax cut proposals were
intended primarily to promote educational opportunities and expand health
insurance and child care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For too long this Congress has been standing still on some of our most
pressing national priorities,'' the president chided. ``Let's begin with them.''
He called for passage of a patients' bill of rights to strengthen consumer
protection, ``common-sense'' gun-safety legislation, campaign finance reform, an
increase in the minimum wage and votes on long-stalled judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   Five days before the New Hampshire primary, Clinton seized the opportunity
to boost Vice President Al Gore in his race for the Democratic presidential
nomination. In his prepared text, there were six references to the vice
president. Also in the audience, another candidate: his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, a candidate for the U.S. Senate seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of Clinton's proposals were repackaged from earlier years and, in some
cases resubmitted with spending figures double or triple the original amount.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton boasted that the nation has been lifted from economic distress,
social decline and political gridlock.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs. The fastest
economic growth in more than 30 years. The lowest unemployment rates in 30
years. The lowest poverty rates in 20 years. The lowest African-American and
Hispanic unemployment rates on record. The first back-to-back surpluses in 42
years.''
</P>
<P>
	   He thanked lawmakers who put ``progress above partisanship'' but said the
GOP-dominated Congress has ``been standing still on some of our most pressing
national priorities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Details of Clinton's gun-licensing plan were withheld from advance copies of
his text, but aides said the president would propose an initiative requiring
congressional action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands,'' the
president said, recalling the tragedy of the massacre at Columbine High School.
Tom Mauser, the father of slain student Daniel Mauser, was among those invited
to listen to Clinton's speech in a VIP box with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton noted that the Senate last year had approved legislation requiring
background checks for purchases at gun shows, child safety locks for all new
handguns and a ban on importing large-capacity ammunition clips. He credited
Gore with casting the Senate's tie-breaking vote but pointed out that the House
failed to pass the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Mauser's father has taken a leave from his job to fight for tougher gun
laws, Clinton said. ``I pray that his courage and wisdom will move this Congress
to make common-sense gun safety legislation the very next order of business,''
the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans ridiculed Clinton's proposals but did not rule out working with
him on such issues as education and health care. ``If we enacted all the new
programs the president has talked about, we'd spend just about the entire
surplus on bigger and more expensive government,'' said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and
social progress with so little internal crisis or so few external threats,'' the
president said. ``Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity -- and
therefore such a profound obligation -- to build the more perfect union of our
founders' dreams.''
</P>
<P>
	   Excerpts of his speech were released in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's tax program includes marriage penalty relief, tax deductions of up
to $2,800 annually per family for college tuition and fees and retirement
savings accounts for low- and moderate-income families. He also proposed steps
to encourage charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by Republicans
and Democrats as both sides battle for control of Congress and the White House.
Smarting from Clinton's veto of their $792 billion tax-cut package last year,
House Republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax breaks and
marriage penalty relief this year. Presidential candidates have their own
proposals, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called
Clinton's tax cuts too limited. ``We think all Americans deserve tax relief, not
just the handful the president picks,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package would cost $350 billion over 10 years. However,
his plan envisions cutting that price tag by $100 billion by closing tax havens,
shelters and loopholes. Congress has previously rejected many of those ideas on
grounds they are tax increases.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no major foreign policy announcements, although Clinton urged
Congress to give China permanent normal trading relations with the United
States. He also asked for $1.6 billion for Colombia to fight narco-traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   While urging higher spending and targeted tax cuts, Clinton said, ``We must
not forsake the path of fiscal discipline that got us here. We must make these
investments and tax cuts only in the context of a balanced budget that
strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and pays down the national
debt.''
</P>
<P>
	   The booming economy and swelling tax revenues give Clinton and Republicans a
big purse for any tax reductions or spending increases. Both sides claim they
are dedicated to protecting Social Security and eliminating the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   In the category of unfinished business, Clinton urged an increase in the
minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour, a patients' bill of rights to strengthen
consumers' rights in health insurance programs, tougher gun laws, an overhaul of
campaign finance laws, hate crimes legislation and another installment of his
program to put more police on the street.
</P>
<P>
	   He called anew for Medicare to include a prescription drug benefit and to
let people as young as 55 buy Medicare coverage -- this time with a 25 percent
tax credit to make the cost more manageable. ``In good conscience,'' Clinton
said, ``we cannot let another year pass without extending to all seniors the
lifeline of affordable prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
	   To reinforce his appeal for tighter gun control, Clinton invited Tom Mauser,
father of slain Columbine High School shooting victim Daniel Mauser, as one of
the guests in the VIP box with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   To help developing countries, Clinton proposed $1 billion in tax incentives
for drug makers to develop vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. The
goal is to create a market for new vaccines by providing $1 credit for every $1
spent for vaccines distributed in Africa and other poor countries.
</P>
<P>
	   A major part of the speech dealt with education, a politically popular
subject that has been a staple of Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   He proposed a $4.5 billion initiative to double spending for after-school
and summer school programs and to expand the Head Start program for needy
children to cover 950,000 kids. The president also called for doubling money to
turn around failing schools and to increase spending by $450 million to hire
more teachers to reduce class size.
</P>
<P>
	   His tax breaks for college would cost $30 billion over 10 years. Another
proposal would expand the earned income tax credit for the working poor by $21
billion. A tax credit for long-term care would cost $27 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   To build momentum for the speech, many of Clinton's proposals were announced
in advance. One of his biggest initiatives was a 10-year, $110 billion proposal
to provide health coverage to the parents of children protected by the state
Children's Health Insurance Program. If approved, it would be the largest
increase in health coverage in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's agenda revives battles with Republicans over Social Security and
Medicare. He said his proposals would extend the life of Social Security to 2050
and Medicare to at least 2025. Clinton would devote nearly $400 billion of the
surplus for Medicare solvency and prescription drugs.

<HEADLINE> GOP Responds To Clinton's Speech  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans responding to President Clinton's State of
the Union address Thursday argued they have proposed bigger tax cuts and better
approaches to improving health care and education.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the president, first-term Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Frist
of Tennessee said their party stands for protecting Social Security, extending
health insurance to more Americans, eliminating the national debt and ensuring
that Medicare beneficiaries have access to prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   But these goals must be accomplished without an explosion of federal
spending and new bureaucracies, they said. ``Mr. President, please no more red
tape,'' Frist said.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins and Frist, two 47-year-old pragmatists known for working well with
Democrats, both cited personal experiences in promoting the GOP way.
</P>
<P>
	   Frist, a heart-lung transplant surgeon, recalled working in England for the
British National Health Service and seeing ``firsthand the rationing, the lack
of choice, the long waits and the denial of care for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Clinton's health care proposals, including his ambitious plan to
extend coverage to the parents of children protected by the Children's Health
Insurance Program, were ``just as bad'' as his 1993 attempt to create a
universal health care program.
</P>
<P>
	   The children's program lets states offer Medicaid or other insurance to
children in low-income working families who are not poor enough to qualify for
traditional Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, Frist said, would work to reform Medicare, pass a patients'
rights bill that makes lawsuits against HMOs a last resort and ensure that
Americans have choice and security in their health care alternatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins, a former college administrator, repeated the Republican principle
that better education must come through more local control. ``The debate in
Washington is not about money. It's about who makes the decisions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins said Republicans will continue to increase federal funds for
elementary and secondary education, but local schools and communities should
decide how to spend the money. She said Republicans also will increase federal
grants for use in teacher recruiting and training and will promote education
savings accounts so parents better can save money for their children's
education.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins touched briefly on other Republican goals -- cutting taxes such as
the estate ``death tax,'' eliminating the $3.6 trillion public debt in the next
15 years and building a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., earlier Thursday also spoke of a
Republican plan to improve prescription drug coverage for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Clinton, who has proposed creating a new Medicare prescription drug
plan open to all, Hastert said the GOP would focus on helping the one-third of
senior citizens who now lack access to or cannot afford private options. Tax
credits and block grants to states were among the options, he said.

<HEADLINE> GOP: Clinton Short on His Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton embraced several Republican priorities
in the $350 billion tax cut outlined Thursday, but GOP leaders say the president
could have already signed many of them into law.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, pointed
out that relief from the so-called ``marriage penalty'' and protecting the
middle class from the alternative minimum tax were part of the $792 billion GOP
tax cut vetoed by Clinton last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Congress fixed these problems last year and we will do so again this year,
and we hope the president won't veto tax relief again,'' said Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton described his 10-year, $350 billion tax relief plan Thursday in his
final State of the Union address to Congress. Details were provided hours
earlier by the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   In the speech, Clinton said tax cuts must be made ``without forsaking the
path of fiscal discipline'' that led to a huge projected budget surplus and
without forgetting that Social Security and Medicare face insolvency as baby
boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Indeed, we must make these investments and tax cuts in the context of a
balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and
Medicare and pays down the national debt,'' Clinton said in prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Tax cuts and how to use the huge projected budget surpluses are a hot
political issue this year, particularly for the Republicans. Clinton's plan
gives Vice President Al Gore a tax cut to promote if he wins the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP presidential frontrunner, is pushing a
five-year, $483 billion tax cut, while Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., proposes
cutting taxes by $237 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   One GOP priority embraced by Clinton would partly fix a tax code glitch in
which millions of two-income married couples pay more income taxes than if they
were single. Clinton wants to gradually double the standard income tax deduction
for married people, cutting taxes for more than 9 million couples at a cost of
$45 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans intend to move legislation dealing with the marriage penalty to
the House floor by mid-February, although it is likely to be broader in scope
and also help married people who itemize their tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of Clinton's fiscal 2001 tax relief plan has been released over the
past weeks, including an expansion of the earned income tax credit for the
working poor, fixing the minimum tax so it affects fewer middle-class people,
and credits or deductions for long-term health care, college expenses and people
who need health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   New items unveiled Thursday include:
</P>
<P>
	   --Retirement Savings Accounts for low-income families in which the
government would provide a 2-for-1 match for the first $100 contributed by each
person. Cost:$54 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --A package of tax breaks and incentives to encourage philanthropy,
including allowing non-itemizers to take a tax deduction for charitable giving.
Another measure would be designed to make it easier to donate appreciated assets
like stocks and real property. Cost:$14 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --Increasing the dependent child care credit and extending it to parents who
stay home with their children. Cost:$30 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --A tax credit for pharmaceutical companies that develop new vaccines
against malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS. Cost:$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said the president will use some of the projected surplus to pay for
the tax cuts but is also likely to advocate closing corporate tax loopholes and
shelters -- and possibly other tax increases -- to foot roughly $100 billion of
the cost. Similar proposals in the past have received a cool reception in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill, Republicans said they also intend to push for abolition of
inheritance taxes, economic development credits in poor areas and savings
accounts for college tuition. They also said their tax cuts would be much larger
than the president's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I appreciate President Clinton's $350 billion tax cut proposal, but I
think we can do more,'' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth,
R-Del.

<HEADLINE> Most of U.S. Seeing More Snow  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Much of the nation saw snow -- and braced for even more -- while still
digging out and trying to return to normal Thursday after the wintry punch that
caught so many people flat-footed earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
	   A strong disturbance caused snow from the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma into
Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi
</P>
<P>
	   In Oklahoma, schools were closed statewide, meetings postponed, and state
employees excused from work. Some courts also shut down so workers could stay
safe at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasters called for more snow in central Oklahoma -- as much as 10 to 14
inches -- and said some roads could become nearly impassable.
</P>
<P>
	   Slipping and sliding, Arkansas residents abandoned their jobs by the
thousands and tried to make it home as up to 15 inches of snow fell.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At one time it was coming so thick, it looked like the world ended 200
yards from the windows,'' said Pati Brown, the manager of the Mountain Harbor
Resort in Mount Ida, Ark.
</P>
<P>
	   Many schools and businesses were closed, and tens of thousands remained
without electricity Thursday throughout the Carolinas, Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama residents stripped store shelves bare, closed schools and generally
hunkered down, while freezing rain, sleet and snow interrupted hundreds of
airline flights, snarled highway traffic and cut power to thousands of homes
across North and Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Baltimore announced that it already had exhausted its annual snow removal
budget as of Thursday, half of the Maryland's school districts remained closed
and commuters cursed snow-narrowed streets as traffic crawled.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia residents as far south as Albany and Columbus were nervously
awaiting more snow, sleet and freezing rain that were predicted -- with images
of last week's ice-covered roads and darkened houses in the Atlanta area still
fresh on their minds.
</P>
<P>
	   Last weekend's storm in north Georgia left 500,000 customers without
electricity and caused an estimated $44 million in damage. The coming storm is
expected to cover a much greater area and dump even more precipitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Emboldened by sunshine and improving roads, North Carolinians dug out their
cars and began replenishing empty pantries, still amazed by the 2-foot
snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
	   Making her first grocery shopping foray since Monday night's storm, Ann Long
recalled how the falling snow looked beautiful at first:
</P>
<P>
	   ``But then it started to look a little like a monster. ... And I thought
it's amazing how fast something that is so pretty can turn into something so
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, on standdown since the Y2K
threat fizzled, was up and running to respond to emergencies. The rest of the
state was shutting down, including schools and colleges, local governments and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Even in Florida, winter's reach matched its grasp.
</P>
<P>
	   The chilly weather kept beachgoers out of the surf at Daytona Beach, and the
Volusia County Beach Patrol sent home its part-time lifeguards because there
weren't enough swimmers.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore Closes in on Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has closed the gap against George
W. Bush in a potential presidential matchup, says a national poll released
Thursday -- 10 months ahead of the November election.
</P>
<P>
	   The NBC-Wall Street Journal poll also found a majority of Americans happy
with the direction of the country and two-thirds gave President Clinton high job
approval marks, said the poll made public on the day of Clinton's final State of
the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   The national poll showed Republican front-runner Bush at 47 percent and
Democratic front-runner Gore at 44 percent. Gore had trailed the Republican in
head-to-head matchups throughout 1999. The poll of 1,010 American adults taken
Jan. 25-26 had a 3 percentage point error margin, larger for subgroups.
</P>
<P>
	   When Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan was included in the general
election matchup, both Gore and Bush were at 43 percent and Buchanan was at 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Bush led by 50 percent to 39 percent and has maintained an
average double-digit lead over Gore in the poll throughout 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had an 8-point lead over former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival, in a
head-to-head matchup in the latest poll. In polls late last year, Bradley
usually performed better against Bush than Gore did, largely because of
Bradley's appeal to independents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore's problem in 1999 was consolidating Democrats,'' said Fred Yang, a
partner in one of the firms that conducted the poll, Peter D. Hart Research
Associates. ``As a result of Iowa, he has quickly been able to consolidate his
Democratic support.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore leads Bradley in polling for the New Hampshire primary next Tuesday.
Sen. John McCain and Bush are locked in a tough battle there, with McCain
leading in some polls and tied with Bush in others.
</P>
<P>
	   The differences since December in the poll by Democratic pollster Hart and
Republican pollster Bob Teeter were likely the result of Gore's performance in
the weeks leading up to his victory in the Iowa caucuses Monday night, Yang
said, citing other polling data on Gore in the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is clearly a good poll for Gore, but it's not a bad poll for Bush.
His numbers still hold up very well,'' said Yang, noting the public still has a
positive view of Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Teeter said the poll indicated you've got ``a country that is happy,
affluent and thinks things are going pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Bush remains very popular with the public and he saw the closing of
the gap as natural as the race takes shape.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't tell if Gore is getting a blip because he's been in the public a
lot and beaten Bradley and we'll see that go back down,'' Teeter said, noting
that Bush still had a 14-point lead among independent voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore led Bradley 64 percent to 22 percent, compared with a 54 percent-to-32
percent Gore lead in the December poll. Bush led McCain nationally, 63 percent
to 15 percent, in the new poll, about the same margin as in December.
</P>
<P>
	   When Americans were asked whether they wanted a presidential candidate whose
views were more liberal, more conservative or the same as Clinton's, 50 percent
said about the same, 37 percent said more conservative and 8 percent said more
liberal.

<HEADLINE> Mayor: Honesty on Nuclear Waste  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The federal government should be completely open about the
risks of shipping nuclear waste across the country, Cleveland Mayor Michael R.
White said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Department of Energy has a hearing scheduled Friday in Cleveland to
hear from residents concerned about a proposal that could mean the shipment of
waste from nuclear power plants through the Cleveland area toward a proposed
dump in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I urge the Department of Energy to do everything in its power to ensure
that Clevelanders receive accurate and complete information,'' White said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has proposed storing waste from the nation's nuclear power
plants at an underground dump at Yucca Mountain, Nev., about 100 miles northwest
of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle Fisher, spokeswoman for the Department of Energy's Yucca Mountain
Project Office, said Friday's hearing will be the 19th of 20 scheduled during a
six-month comment period. Ten hearings have been held in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're still studying the site and the routes. Even if everything were
approved, we would not be starting until 2010,'' Ms. Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest round of public hearings began Monday in Lincoln, Neb., and
another hearing is scheduled Tuesday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Cleveland, Lincoln and Chicago sit along the main rail and highway
routes connecting the East Coast to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nevada destination makes Ohio an obvious transit point because of its
location between the East Coast and Midwest highway connections to Nevada, said
Robert J. Halstead, of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects. Cleveland's
position at the juncture of rail routes from Buffalo, N.Y., and Harrisburg, Pa.,
makes it a similar focal point for rail shipments, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Lesser, an official at the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio who
helped prepare testimony for the hearing, said it is too early to tell how much
waste would move through Ohio and for how long.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Photo IDs for Gun Buys  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged states Thursday to issue photo ID
licenses for handgun purchases, much like licenses for driving or hunting.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal was the last from Clinton's State of the Union agenda that was
not revealed in advance of Thursday's speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's plan, anyone who wants to buy a handgun would be required to
first obtain a license showing he has passed a background check and a gun safety
requirement, such as a training course or an exam.
</P>
<P>
	   States could choose not to participate in the program, according to a White
House official who discussed the proposal on condition of anonymity. In states
that decline to set up the licensing system, a federally approved gun dealer or
a federal entity would issue the license, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not mandating this,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tighter gun control already has emerged as an issue in the presidential
campaign.
</P>

	   Vice President Al Gore has called for mandatory photo ID licenses for
handgun buyers. He would require manufacturers and federally licensed sellers to
report gun sales to state authority. Further, Gore would ban so-called Saturday
night specials and expand background checks and mandate child-safety locks.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, has urged mandatory licenses for handgun buyers and gun
registration. He also would raise license fees on dealers and ban ``Saturday
night specials.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has called for raising the
age for handgun purchases to 21. He also supports instant background checks at
gun shows. Bush opposes universal gun registration.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes says he would let states set firearm standards.

<HEADLINE> Huge study tests Squibb drug on patients with mild hypertension  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Could an experimental hypertension drug keep senior
citizens with a common, but rarely treated, type of borderline high blood
pressure from dying or having a heart attack, stroke or heart failure?
<P>
	   Scientists in 16 countries, led by a cardiologist at the University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, have begun a mammoth, five-year study to
find the answer. They are hoping the medication will prevent patients' arteries
from stiffening further and thus pushing their blood pressure dangerously high.
</P>
<P>
	   The study begun last fall will include about 12,600 patients at about 900
sites around the world, according to the lead researcher, Dr. John D. Kostis, a
cardiology professor and chairman of the Department of Medicine at UMDNJ-Robert
Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a history-making clinical trial," Kostis said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The study will test a Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. drug, called omapatrilat, on
patients who have an early stage of what's called isolated systolic hypertension
because only their systolic blood pressure is above normal.
</P>
<P>
	   Systolic pressure, the top number in a blood pressure reading, occurs when
the heart contracts, forcing blood into the arteries; diastolic pressure, the
lower number in a blood pressure reading, occurs when the heart relaxes between
beats. Usually if one pressure is elevated, the other is high as well.
</P>
<P>
	   From the 1950s until the 1990s, cardiologists and researchers focused on
patients' diastolic pressure, partly because the heart is at rest two-thirds of
the time. Efforts to control hypertension concentrated on bringing down
patients' diastolic pressure until studies by Kostis and other researchers in
the late 1990s showed that using diuretics prevented cardiac "events" such as
heart attacks in many patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Kostis said those studies showed that the level of a patient's systolic
pressure was a better predictor than diastolic pressure of whether their heart
condition would worsen or kill them.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no proof that treating the mildest forms of this isolated systolic
hypertension benefits the patient," but this study could prove just that, said
Kostis, who spent a decade trying to organize and get funding for it.
</P>
<P>
	   Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has its research headquarters in Princeton, is
funding the study. It is hoping the federal Food and Drug Administration, which
earlier this month said it would expedite its evaluation of the drug, will
approve it for sale by June.
</P>
<P>
	   Half the patients will take a 20 mg or 40 mg dose of omapatrilat each day
and half will take a sugar pill. Neither the patients nor their doctors will
know who got what until the study ends. Patients must be 65 or older and have a
systolic blood pressure of 141 to 159 and a diastolic pressure below 90.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they're doing a great thing for whoever might need it," said Alfred
Feld, 72, of Old Bridge, one of the first patients recruited.
</P>
<P>
	   Feld, a retired salesman and manager in the textile industry, has had
borderline high blood pressure for years but is always on the go with errands
and civic activities. He doesn't want his heart condition to worsen and force
him to slow down.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm thrilled to be getting it," he said. While Feld doesn't know if he's
actually taking the drug, he said his blood pressure was fine at his annual
physical last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Jeffrey Cutler, head of clinical hypertension trials at the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said given that several million elderly
Americans have isolated systolic hypertension and there have been no large
studies of whether cutting their blood pressure is beneficial, "it's an
important thing to nail down."
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwide, 15 percent to 20 percent of people over age 60 have the
condition.
</P>
<P>
	   "A positive result from such a trial could have important influences on
practice patterns," Cutler said, adding that he would have preferred to see the
study also compare omapatrilat to the most commonly used heart drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Omapatrilat, which has the brand name Vanlev, belongs to a new class of
cardiovascular drugs known as vasopeptidase inhibitors and could become the
first in that class to go on sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Like other cardiac drugs called ACE inhibitors, vasopeptidase inhibitors
block the effects of certain enzymes that constrict arteries and thicken the
walls of arteries and the heart itself, pushing up blood pressure. Kostis said
the drug also blocks effects of another type of enzyme that also narrows blood
vessels, while at the same time increasing levels of a chemical that dilates
those vessels and flushing excess, pressure-raising fluids from the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's uniquely suited for this kind of blood pressure, because it appears to
lower systolic blood pressure more than other drugs," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> GOP: Clinton Short on His Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans responding to President Clinton's State of
the Union address Thursday argued they have proposed bigger tax cuts and better
approaches to improving health care and education.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the president, first-term Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Frist
of Tennessee said their party stands for protecting Social Security, extending
health insurance to more Americans, eliminating the national debt and ensuring
that Medicare beneficiaries have access to prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   But these goals must be accomplished without an explosion of federal
spending and new bureaucracies, they said. ``Mr. President, please no more red
tape,'' Frist said.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins and Frist, two 47-year-old pragmatists known for working well with
Democrats, both cited personal experiences in promoting the GOP way.
</P>
<P>
	   Frist, a heart-lung transplant surgeon, recalled working in England for the
British National Health Service and seeing ``firsthand the rationing, the lack
of choice, the long waits and the denial of care for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Clinton's health care proposals, including his ambitious plan to
extend coverage to the parents of children protected by the Children's Health
Insurance Program, were ``just as bad'' as his 1993 attempt to create a
universal health care program.
</P>
<P>
	   The children's program lets states offer Medicaid or other insurance to
children in low-income working families who are not poor enough to qualify for
traditional Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, Frist said, would work to reform Medicare, pass a patients'
rights bill that makes lawsuits against HMOs a last resort and ensure that
Americans have choice and security in their health care alternatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins, a former college administrator, repeated the Republican principle
that better education must come through more local control. ``The debate in
Washington is not about money. It's about who makes the decisions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins said Republicans will continue to increase federal funds for
elementary and secondary education, but local schools and communities should
decide how to spend the money. She said Republicans also will increase federal
grants for use in teacher recruiting and training and will promote education
savings accounts so parents better can save money for their children's
education.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins touched briefly on other Republican goals -- cutting taxes such as
the estate ``death tax,'' eliminating the $3.6 trillion public debt in the next
15 years and building a national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Republicans were more blunt in their criticism of Clinton's proposed
new spending. ``Part of Bill Clinton's legacy will be the notion that Santa
Claus comes to town at the end of January instead of December,'' said Florida
Rep. Tillie Fowler, a member of the House GOP leadership. ``He has presented his
list of goodies aimed at pleasing every constituency.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``As Washington digs out of the latest winter blizzard, the Congress will
dig out of an avalanche of presidential spending initiatives,'' said House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert earlier Thursday also spoke of a Republican plan to improve
prescription drug coverage for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Clinton, who has proposed creating a new Medicare prescription drug
plan open to all, Hastert said the GOP would focus on helping the one-third of
senior citizens who now lack access to or cannot afford private options. Tax
credits and block grants to states were among the options, he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Teen Smoking Down  </HEADLINE>
   By RUSS BYNUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Smoking among high schoolers dropped in 1999 for the first
time since the government began keeping track at the start of the decade. But
nearly one in 10 children have already smoked cigarettes by middle school.
</P>
<P>
	   A nationwide survey of 7,529 high schoolers in September and October found
that 28.4 percent reported using tobacco products in the preceding month, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, the last time the CDC looked at high school smoking, 36.4 percent
of students said they had smoked in the preceding month. At the time, teen
smoking was on the rise, from 34.8 percent in 1995 and 27.5 percent in 1991, the
first year the CDC started keeping track.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC said it expected teen smoking rates to drop -- just not by so much.
The agency said differences between the 1999 survey and earlier studies may have
exaggerated the decline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We may have peaked in terms of smoking rates among high school students,''
said Michael Eriksen, director of the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health.
</P>
<P>
	   The drop in smoking rates had been expected because tobacco companies raised
cigarette prices about 45 cents a pack last year to help pay for the $206
billion national settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the settlement, billboard ads for cigarettes were banned and the
tobacco industry was barred from running advertisements with cartoon characters
such as Joe Camel that anti-smoking activists say are aimed at youngsters. In
many places, cigarette billboards have been replaced by signs with anti-smoking
messages.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time ever, the CDC also surveyed middle school students about
smoking, questioning about as many middle-schoolers as high school students.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine percent of the students in grades six through eight said they had
smoked cigarettes. Nearly 13 percent said they had used some tobacco product --
including chewing tobacco, pipes and cigars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it was that surprising, because we see such high rates in
high school that we know it begins in middle school. We just didn't know at what
level,'' Eriksen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Todd, director of tobacco control for the American Cancer Society,
agreed that higher cigarette prices should result in fewer smokers of high
school age. But he said the CDC's numbers surprised him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wouldn't expect a decline that dramatic,'' Todd said. ``We'll have to
continually monitor it to get a better picture of what's really going on.''
</P>
<P>
	   The questions used in the surveys and the one in 1997 were the same, said
Wick Warren, a CDC statistician. But response rates varied. About 90 percent of
schools responded to the 1999 tobacco survey. The earlier surveys, which also
included questions about sex, got responses from about 75 percent of schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also found that the wide gap in smoking rates between white and
black high school students does not exist among middle-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
	   The proportion of blacks smoking in high school was nearly 16 percent --
half the percentage of white smokers. But in middle school, both racial groups
were about 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Though it is too soon to tell, this could signal the end of a 25-year trend
in which blacks started smoking later than whites.
</P>
<P>
	   Two trendy types of imported cigarettes -- bidis and kreteks -- are being
smoked by about 5 percent of high schoolers and 2 percent of middle-schoolers.
That makes them almost as popular as chewing tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   Bidis are skinny, unfiltered Indian cigarettes that come in flavors such as
vanilla. Kreteks are a kind of clove cigarette.

<HEADLINE> Man Guilty in Rwanda Genocide Case  </HEADLINE>
   By SUKHDEV CHHATBAR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- A former Rwandan tea factory manager was convicted
Thursday by a U.N. tribunal for three genocide-related charges, including raping
a Tutsi woman and encouraging four of his employees to rape her as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfred Musema was the second defendant to come before the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to be convicted of rape.
</P>
<P>
	   His was the seventh verdict handed down by the tribunal, which was created
in 1994 to prosecute chief architects and perpetrators of the 1994 genocide of
more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
	   Musema is the first private citizen tried and convicted by the tribunal. The
others were soldiers or government officials. He was sentenced to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The 50-year-old Musema looked down when the judges announced his sentence,
the maximum allowed under court rules.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Musema personally led attackers to attack large numbers of Tutsi refugees
and raped a young Tutsi woman. He knowingly and consciously participated in the
commission of crimes, and never showed remorse for his personal role in the
commission of the atrocities,'' said presiding Judge Lennart Aspegren of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-judge panel found Musema guilty on one count each of rape,
genocide and crimes against humanity. It acquitted him on six other
genocide-related counts.
</P>
<P>
	   His attorney, Steven Kay of Britain, said afterward he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said Musema, former director of the state-owned tea factory in
Gisovu, in western Rwanda's Kibuye province, was guilty of raping the woman and
encouraging his employees to as well. Another witness at the trial testified
that Musema had disemboweled a pregnant woman, saying he wanted to ``find out
what the inside of a Tutsi woman looks like.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Rwandan genocide was unleashed by an extremist Hutu government bent on
exterminating Rwanda's minority Tutsis. The slaughter was led by Rwanda's
then-Hutu army and Hutu militiamen.
</P>
<P>
	   Musema's rape conviction ``goes to show the resolve of the judges of the
tribunal to address the issue of rape,'' said tribunal spokesman Kingsley
Moghalu. ``Rape was pervasive during the genocide in 1994.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a precedent-setting ruling, the court ruled in 1998 that prosecutors
could issue indictments for rape because sexual assault was aimed at
exterminating Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
	   Musema also was convicted of crimes against humanity for allowing workers at
the tea factory to participate in massacres and use the factory grounds for the
task, the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trial, Musema denied charges he had led massacres of Tutsis who
were attempting to defend themselves at Bisesero Hill in Kibuye during the
genocide. But the judges dismissed most alibis offered by witnesses called to
testify on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was the swiftest since formal court proceedings got under way at
the international court in January 1997. Amendments to court procedures last
year have sped up the trials.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribunal, which has 39 people in custody in the northern Tanzanian town
of Arusha, handed down its first convictions in September 1999. Musema was
arrested in Switzerland on Feb. 11, 1995, and was later transferred to the
tribunal.

<HEADLINE> Bobbitt Found Guilty of Harassment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH TONAWANDA, N.Y. (AP) -- John Wayne Bobbitt, who made national headlines
after his then-wife Lorena Bobbitt cut off his penis in 1993, was found guilty
of harassment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bobbitt, 32, was sentenced to time served for the Nov. 2 altercation with a
former girlfriend, adult film star Desiree A. Luz. He was jailed 17 days before
posting the $50,000 bond. The court also ordered him to not contact or
communicate with Ms. Luz.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was innocent,'' said Bobbitt outside the courthouse. ``I wasn't prepared
for the defense, and I was innocent.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bobbitt's ex-wife was found innocent by reason of insanity after she argued
she cut off her husband's penis because he was abusive.
</P>
<P>
	   After surgery reattached his penis, Bobbitt made a number of adult films and
worked in a Nevada brothel. In North Tonawanda, he had worked as a bartender and
tow truck operator.

<HEADLINE> Court Strikes Grandparent-Visitation  </HEADLINE>
   By JACKIE HALLIFAX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida Supreme Court struck down part of a
state law that gives grandparents the right to seek court-ordered time with
their grandchildren, the third time the court has said the state cannot overrule
a parent in the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling concerned a provision that gave grandparents greater rights of
visitation if the child is ``born out of wedlock.''
</P>
<P>
	   As with two other provisions of the law it has struck down, the court ruled
the ``out of wedlock'' condition unconstitutionally violates the right of the
parents to raise their children as they see fit without interference.
</P>
<P>
	   The only two remaining provisions of the law allow grandparents to seek
court-ordered visitation when the parents of their grandchildren have divorced
or deserted the child.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's unanimous decision stemmed from a Palm Beach County dispute
involving the 5-year-old son of Dominick Brunetti and Beth Saul. Their son,
Tyler, lived with his mother and her parents until she was killed in a car
accident. When Tyler then moved in with his father, the mother's parents sought
the right to see him, and a judge awarded them weekly visits.
</P>
<P>
	   All 50 states have laws allowing grandparents and others to seek visitation
after divorces or under other circumstances. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a
challenge to a Washington state law, is looking at the conflict between a
state's desire to promote children's best interests and parents' right to raise
their children free from government interference.
</P>
<P>
	   Visitation laws have been struck down or sharply narrowed in a few other
states, including Georgia and Tennessee, but generally have survived court
challenges.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Dad: I Spurned Payoffs  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father told U.S. immigration officials that
his Miami relatives offered him millions of dollars, a house and a car to join
the 6-year-old boy in the United States, according to court papers filed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I could go there with all my family and would be taken care and could have
a job if I wanted to work, but with the money offered I would not need to do
so,'' the father said. ``That's when I hung up the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government filed the papers in response to a lawsuit filed by the
boy's Miami relatives, who are challenging an order that Elian be sent back to
live with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   In its 400-page response, the government argued that the federal courts have
no right to intervene and that allowing Elian to stay could ``seriously
prejudice the ability of the U.S. government to help parents in the United
States recover their children taken to foreign countries.''
</P>
<P>
	   The motion quoted a statement by a State Department official who said people
who abduct their children to Islamic countries often argue that the social
environment in the United States is unsuitable for children. Failing to send
Elian back to Cuba could make those arguments more acceptable to foreign
authorities, the government said.
</P>
<P>
	   The next hearing in the case is set for the week of March 6, although the
judge in the case could issue a ruling sooner.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute over Elian's fate began two months ago, after he was found
clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic. His mother and 10 other people
fleeing Cuba for Florida died after their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's Cuban grandmothers have been in the United States for the past
week to appeal for his return. They had a tearful, tense reunion with the boy in
Florida on Wednesday, and on Thursday they renewed their efforts on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   The court papers reflect some of the dominant themes of the debate: The
families in Cuba and Florida each say the other side is lying and being
manipulated by political forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez, a great-uncle who has temporary custody of the boy in
Miami, told immigration officials that he spoke to Elian's father by telephone
two or three days before the boy was even found. Lazaro Gonzalez said Elian's
father asked him to protect Elian ``by whatever means available'' but eventually
changed his tune and asked for Elian to come back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all think he's under pressure from the government, because of his
change in sentiment, and I'm amazed about this,'' Lazaro Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was interviewed by Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials in Havana on Dec. 13 and 31.
</P>
<P>
	   In those interviews, the boy's father said his relatives in Miami offered
him $2 million, a house and a car if he would join his son in the United States.
He also said a church had offered $4 million to Elian so he would be set for
life. He did not specify which church made the offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Never did we offer him money,'' she said. ``We would never buy our family.
We would never buy anybody because we are the type of family that believes money
can't buy people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Silma Dimmel, the INS official who conducted the interview, said in a
statement that Elian's father ``did not appear at all nervous or intimidated,''
and ``based on his demeanor, I had no reason to believe he was being coerced.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father checked ``No'' on a questionnaire asking him whether he
wanted the boy to stay in the United States, whether he was being coerced and
whether he had ever requested a visa to travel to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the court papers, INS officials asked these questions in
written form in case the room was bugged.
</P>
<P>
	   In his account, Elian's father claims that his ex-wife, Elisabeth Brotons,
took the boy out of Cuba without telling him. After the boy turned up in the
United States, ``at all times I asked that Elian be returned to me,'' his father
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father also complained that the relatives in Miami had interfered
with his attempts to speak with his son on the phone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we call and Elian starts saying, `Grandma I want to be with you' or
`Daddy I want to go with you,' they immediately make him cry, or give him a
candy or start tapping on the lines saying that the lines are getting bad and
hang up the phone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Marisleysis Gonzalez told the INS that the boy's father was being pressured
by the communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His tone of voice is different, like people telling him what to say,'' she
said. ``The phone sounds like it's being tapped.''
</P>
<P>
	   The father told reporters in Cuba on Thursday that he was furious with the
way the grandmothers were treated during their reunion with the child. Gonzalez
complained that the grandmothers' cellular phones were confiscated, making it
impossible for him to speak with his boy out of the presence of the Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I felt very indignant,'' Gonzalez said. ``They just ruined everything.''

<HEADLINE> Parent, Pilot Are Clinton Guests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The president's guests for Thursday's State of the Union
address included a decorated Air Force pilot, a member of the World Cup-winning
women's soccer team and the father of a teen-ager killed in the shootings at
Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the guests were being seated alongside first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton. One guest, former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, was to take a seat
on the House floor. The president was expected to refer to some of his guests in
the speech, his eighth and final State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   The guests were:
</P>
<P>
	   --Pat Brown of Johnson City, Tenn., a retiree who spends $4,000 of her
savings each year on prescription drugs for heart and thyroid ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   --Ruth Summerlin, an elementary school principal in Beaufort, S.C., who
improved her students' reading and math test scores so dramatically that the
school went from one of South Carolina's 200 worst to a blue-ribbon citation
from the Education Department in five years.
</P>
<P>
	   --Dr. Francis S. Collins, who oversees the federal government's project to
map and sequence all human DNA by 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   --Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minn., who was having trouble paying child
support but now is keeping up with his obligation after enrolling in an
employment and training program.
</P>
<P>
	   --Tom Mauser, father of Columbine victim Daniel Mauser, who has taken a
leave of absence from his job with the Colorado Department of Transportation to
advocate gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   --Bob Knowling Jr. of Santa Clara, Calif., chief executive of Covad
Communications, who is seeking to increase diversity in the field of information
technology.
</P>
<P>
	   --Capt. John Cherrey of Englewood, N.J., who rescued a fellow pilot who was
shot down during the NATO mission in Yugoslavia. Cherrey was awarded the Silver
Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service.
</P>
<P>
	   --Christina Jones of Round Rock, Ariz., a Navajo who volunteers with
Americorps as a tutor for fourth-graders. She plans to teach in her community
after graduation from Dine College.
</P>
<P>
	   --Julie Foudy of Laguna Niguel, Calif., co-captain of the 1999 women's World
Cup soccer team.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert invited an Illinois-area cardinal to the
address as his guest amid a controversy over the rejection of a Roman Catholic
priest to be the House's new chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert denied to reporters earlier Thursday that Cardinal Francis George of
Chicago was in attendance to quell criticism from Catholics. ``Cardinal George
is a friend of mine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The speaker said he was not sure if the cardinal was invited before or after
a brouhaha erupted last month over the rejection of the Rev. Timothy O'Brien, a
Catholic priest from Wisconsin as the House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   Catholics and Democrats have charged that Hastert, R-Ill., and Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, chose the Rev. Charles Parker Wright, a Presbyterian
minister, despite the preference of a bipartisan selection committee for
O'Brien. The House has never had a Catholic chaplain, a post that pays $132,100
a year.

<HEADLINE> Witness: Police Made Me Lie  </HEADLINE>
   By BEN DOBBIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A key witness in a 1973 murder trial testified
Thursday that a police detective terrorized him into lying on the stand, at one
point spinning the barrel of his gun as they sat in a jail cell.
</P>
<P>
	   Wayne Wright was one of two teen-age runaways whose testimony helped convict
two prostitutes for the murder of Timothy Haworth, 52, a Philadelphia
businessman who was battered and strangled in a Rochester alley in 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   At the retrial of John Duval, whose conviction was overturned last spring
after he'd spent 25 years in prison, Wright maintained that chief detective
William Mahoney had beaten him in custody and threatened to charge him with
murder if he didn't testify against Duval.
</P>
<P>
	   A day before he was to appear in court, Wright, who was held in jail as a
material witness, said the detective nudged him awake in a jail cell and pulled
out his revolver.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was just sitting there spinning the barrel of his revolver'' and asking
if ``you know what you're going to say'' on the stand, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I got up on the stand and regurgitated what they fed into me,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   He retracted his testimony in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The convictions were overturned a few months later after prosecutors came
upon a buried synopsis of a police interview with the other teen, Jon Jackson,
in which he denied seeing Duval or Tyson with the victim -- contrary to what the
teens had testified at trial. Wright also says he never saw them together.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval and fellow prostitute Betty Tyson got 25 years to life imprisonment.
In the absence of physical evidence, they were convicted of murder on the basis
of confessions they insist were beaten out of them by Mahoney, and on the
testimony of the two teens.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors decided not to retry Tyson -- the city gave her $1.2 million in
compensation -- but went after Duval again. While Tyson had steadfastly
maintained her innocence, Duval had twice admitted his guilt before a parole
board. He says he lied because he didn't think he would be freed until he
admitted guilt.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahoney, who was investigated at least 10 times for allegedly abusing
suspects, resigned in 1980 after he was convicted of fabricating evidence in an
unrelated case. He died in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeking $350B Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) --President Clinton proposed a $350 billion tax cut, big
spending increases for schools and health care and photo ID licenses for handgun
purchases Thursday as he offered the final agenda of his presidency. ``The state
of our union is the strongest it has ever been,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton issued a stinging rebuke to an election-year Congress as he
delivered his last State of the Union address. ``For too long this Congress has
been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities,'' he
chided.
</P>
<P>
	   The president noted that next month the United States will achieve the
longest period of economic growth in the nation's history, and called on
Americans to ``set great goals.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president offered a long litany of initiatives, many of them sure to be
rewritten or ignored by Congress. His tax cut proposals were intended primarily
to promote educational opportunities and expand health insurance and child care
for lower- and middle-income Americans. The initiatives included relief from the
``marriage penalty'' -- an idea first championed by Republicans -- and a new
program of retirement savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the proposals were released in advance but the White House withheld
Clinton's gun licensing measure until the last minute to build suspense. Similar
to a plan offered by Vice President Al Gore, it would require handgun purchasers
to first obtain a state license showing they have passed a background check and
a gun safety requirement, such as a training course or an exam.
</P>
<P>
	   States could choose not to participate in the program. The National Rifle
Association condemned the plan as pointless and unworkable.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was greeted by applause and handshakes by Republicans and Democrats
alike. He called for passage of a patients' bill of rights to strengthen
consumer protection, gun-safety legislation, campaign finance reform, an
increase in the minimum wage and votes on long-stalled judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans ridiculed Clinton's proposals but did not rule out working with
him on such issues as education and health care. ``If we enacted all the new
programs the president has talked about, we'd spend just about the entire
surplus on bigger and more expensive government,'' said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Five days before the New Hampshire primary, Clinton seized the chance to
boost Gore in his race for the Democratic presidential nomination. In his
prepared text, there were six references to the vice president. Clinton also
recognized another candidate: his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, running for the
U.S. Senate seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of Clinton's proposals were repackaged from earlier years and, in some
cases resubmitted with spending figures double or triple the original amount.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton boasted that the nation has been lifted from economic distress,
social decline and political gridlock.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs. The fastest
economic growth in more than 30 years. The lowest unemployment rates in 30
years. The lowest poverty rates in 20 years. The lowest African-American and
Hispanic unemployment rates on record. The first back-to-back surpluses in 42
years.''
</P>
<P>
	   In offering his gun licensing plan, Clinton said, ``We've all seen what
happens when guns fall into the wrong hands,'' the president said. His words
recalled the tragedy of the massacre at Columbine High School. Tom Mauser, the
father of slain student Daniel Mauser, was among those invited to listen to
Clinton's speech in a VIP box with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   The president boasted of the nation's upbeat times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and
social progress with so little internal crisis or so few external threats,'' the
president said. ``Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity -- and
therefore such a profound obligation -- to build the more perfect union of our
founders' dreams.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's tax program includes marriage penalty relief, tax deductions of up
to $2,800 annually per family for college tuition and fees and retirement
savings accounts for low- and moderate-income families. He also proposed steps
to encourage charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by Republicans
and Democrats as both sides battle for control of Congress and the White House.
Smarting from Clinton's veto of their $792 billion tax-cut package last year,
House Republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax breaks and
marriage penalty relief this year. Presidential candidates have their own
proposals, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called
Clinton's tax cuts too limited. ``We think all Americans deserve tax relief, not
just the handful the president picks,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package would cost $350 billion over 10 years. However,
his plan envisions cutting that price tag by $100 billion by closing tax havens,
shelters and loopholes. Congress has previously rejected many of those ideas on
grounds they are tax increases.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no major foreign policy announcements, although Clinton urged
Congress to give China permanent normal trading relations with the United
States. He also asked for $1.6 billion for Colombia to fight narco-traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   While urging higher spending and targeted tax cuts, Clinton said, ``We must
not forsake the path of fiscal discipline that got us here. We must make these
investments and tax cuts only in the context of a balanced budget that
strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and pays down the national
debt.''
</P>
<P>
	   The booming economy and swelling tax revenues give Clinton and Republicans a
big purse for any tax reductions or spending increases. Both sides claim they
are dedicated to protecting Social Security and eliminating the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Called anew for Medicare to include a prescription drug benefit and to
let people as young as 55 buy Medicare coverage -- this time with a 25 percent
tax credit.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Proposed $1 billion in tax incentives for drug makers to develop vaccines
for malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Called for doubling spending for after-school and summer school programs
and to expand the Head Start program for needy children to cover 950,000 kids.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Offered tax breaks for college costing $30 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Expanded the earned income tax credit for the working poor by $21
billion, and offered a tax credit for long-term care costing $27 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Proposed a 10-year, $110 billion proposal to provide health coverage to
the parents of children protected by the state Children's Health Insurance
Program. If approved, it would be the largest increase in health coverage in 35
years.

<HEADLINE> Most of U.S. Seeing More Snow  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Much of the nation saw snow -- and braced for even more -- while still
digging out and trying to return to normal Thursday after the wintry punch that
caught so many people flat-footed earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
	   A strong disturbance caused snow from the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma into
Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi
</P>
<P>
	   In Oklahoma, schools were closed statewide, meetings postponed, and state
employees excused from work. Some courts also shut down so workers could stay
safe at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasters called for more snow in central Oklahoma -- as much as 10 to 14
inches -- and said some roads could become nearly impassable.
</P>
<P>
	   Slipping and sliding, Arkansas residents abandoned their jobs by the
thousands and tried to make it home as up to 15 inches of snow fell.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At one time it was coming so thick, it looked like the world ended 200
yards from the windows,'' said Pati Brown, the manager of the Mountain Harbor
Resort in Mount Ida, Ark.
</P>
<P>
	   Many schools and businesses were closed, and tens of thousands remained
without electricity Thursday throughout the Carolinas, Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama residents stripped store shelves bare, closed schools and generally
hunkered down, while freezing rain, sleet and snow interrupted hundreds of
airline flights, snarled highway traffic and cut power to thousands of homes
across North and Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Baltimore announced that it already had exhausted its annual snow removal
budget as of Thursday, half of the Maryland's school districts remained closed
and commuters cursed snow-narrowed streets as traffic crawled.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia residents as far south as Albany and Columbus were nervously
awaiting more snow, sleet and freezing rain that were predicted -- with images
of last week's ice-covered roads and darkened houses in the Atlanta area still
fresh on their minds.
</P>
<P>
	   Last weekend's storm in north Georgia left 500,000 customers without
electricity and caused an estimated $44 million in damage. The coming storm is
expected to cover a much greater area and dump even more precipitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Emboldened by sunshine and improving roads, North Carolinians dug out their
cars and began replenishing empty pantries, still amazed by the 2-foot
snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
	   Making her first grocery shopping foray since Monday night's storm, Ann Long
recalled how the falling snow looked beautiful at first:
</P>
<P>
	   ``But then it started to look a little like a monster. ... And I thought
it's amazing how fast something that is so pretty can turn into something so
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, on standdown since the Y2K
threat fizzled, was up and running to respond to emergencies. The rest of the
state was shutting down, including schools and colleges, local governments and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Even in Florida, winter's reach matched its grasp.
</P>
<P>
	   The chilly weather kept beachgoers out of the surf at Daytona Beach, and the
Volusia County Beach Patrol sent home its part-time lifeguards because there
weren't enough swimmers.

   MUSKOGEE, Okla. (AP) -- A judge has ordered attorneys not to comment on any

outside his middle school.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore Closes in on Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has closed the gap against George
W. Bush in a potential presidential matchup, says a national poll released
Thursday -- 10 months ahead of the November election.
</P>
<P>
	   The NBC-Wall Street Journal poll also found a majority of Americans happy
with the direction of the country and two-thirds gave President Clinton high job
approval marks, said the poll made public on the day of Clinton's final State of
the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   The national poll showed Republican front-runner Bush at 47 percent and
Democratic front-runner Gore at 44 percent. Gore had trailed the Republican in
head-to-head matchups throughout 1999. The poll of 1,010 American adults taken
Jan. 25-26 had a 3 percentage point error margin, larger for subgroups.
</P>
<P>
	   When Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan was included in the general
election matchup, both Gore and Bush were at 43 percent and Buchanan was at 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Bush led by 50 percent to 39 percent and has maintained an
average double-digit lead over Gore in the poll throughout 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had an 8-point lead over former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival, in a
head-to-head matchup in the latest poll. In polls late last year, Bradley
usually performed better against Bush than Gore did, largely because of
Bradley's appeal to independents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore's problem in 1999 was consolidating Democrats,'' said Fred Yang, a
partner in one of the firms that conducted the poll, Peter D. Hart Research
Associates. ``As a result of Iowa, he has quickly been able to consolidate his
Democratic support.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore leads Bradley in polling for the New Hampshire primary next Tuesday.
Sen. John McCain and Bush are locked in a tough battle there, with McCain
leading in some polls and tied with Bush in others.
</P>
<P>
	   The differences since December in the poll by Democratic pollster Hart and
Republican pollster Bob Teeter were likely the result of Gore's performance in
the weeks leading up to his victory in the Iowa caucuses Monday night, Yang
said, citing other polling data on Gore in the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is clearly a good poll for Gore, but it's not a bad poll for Bush.
His numbers still hold up very well,'' said Yang, noting the public still has a
positive view of Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Teeter said the poll indicated you've got ``a country that is happy,
affluent and thinks things are going pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Bush remains very popular with the public and he saw the closing of
the gap as natural as the race takes shape.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't tell if Gore is getting a blip because he's been in the public a
lot and beaten Bradley and we'll see that go back down,'' Teeter said, noting
that Bush still had a 14-point lead among independent voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore led Bradley 64 percent to 22 percent, compared with a 54 percent-to-32
percent Gore lead in the December poll. Bush led McCain nationally, 63 percent
to 15 percent, in the new poll, about the same margin as in December.
</P>
<P>
	   When Americans were asked whether they wanted a presidential candidate whose
views were more liberal, more conservative or the same as Clinton's, 50 percent
said about the same, 37 percent said more conservative and 8 percent said more
liberal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Objects to U.N. on Iraq Oil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States has balked at a U.N. plan to
dramatically speed up the delivery of humanitarian supplies to Iraq -- despite
having pledged to try to get more goods to Iraqis in a resolution last month,
diplomats said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States voted for the Dec. 17 resolution, which not only created a
new U.N. weapons inspection agency for Iraq but also outlined ways to improve
the U.N. humanitarian program in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq has been unable to sell its oil on the open market since sanctions were
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Security Council launched the
U.N. oil-for-food program in 1996 to allow Iraq to export limited amounts of oil
to buy humanitarian goods for its people.
</P>
<P>
	   Food and medicine funded through the program are already approved within two
working days. But large contracts for other items considered to be of a
humanitarian nature, including goods to improve Iraq's agriculture, electric and
public works sectors, take as long as a week to process.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Dec. 17 resolution, the Security Council said it would act on
contracts for humanitarian and other essential civilian goods ``within a target
of two working days.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Washington balked Wednesday when the head of the Iraq program, Benon
Sevan, announced at a sanctions committee meeting that his office would start
submitting contracts for approval within two days beginning Feb. 1, diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said they needed more than two days to review the contracts
to prevent items with a potential military use from slipping through the
multibillion dollar program.
</P>
<P>
	   A State Department official, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity,
said the United States would start putting humanitarian contracts on hold if the
two-day rule is applied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you make it every case has to be dealt with in two working days, then
you'll find that we're putting 95 percent of all cases on hold,'' said the
official. ``And they'll stay on hold until we finish.''
</P>
<P>
	   Diplomats said the issue concerned different interpretations of what
``within a target of two working days,'' actually meant, with the United States
saying that language in the resolution may be the goal for approval but not
necessarily the deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States leads all 15 nations on the Security Council in placing
contracts for supplies on hold, currently blocking $1.3 billion worth of
contracts.

two-day rule is applied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you make it every case has to be dealt with in two working days, then
you'll find that we're putting 95 percent of all cases on hold,'' said the
official. ``And they'll stay on hold until we finish.''
</P>
<P>
	   Diplomats said the issue concerned different interpretations of what
``within a target of two working days,'' actually meant, with the United States
saying that language in the resolution may be the goal for approval but not
necessarily the deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States leads all 15 nations on the Security Council in placing
contracts for supplies on hold, currently blocking $1.3 billion worth of
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Greek Hunters Charged in Poaching  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Six hunters were arrested Thursday at a nature
reserve, where they had built a small pond and placed ducks there to attract
rare migratory birds, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The poachers were spotted by forest guards at the reserve where hunting is
banned, outside the city of Kavala, some 435 miles northeast of Athens. Police
said they had also dug trenches and built barriers using branches to remain out
of sight while waiting for the birds.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were all detained and charged with violating hunting laws. They will
appear Friday before a magistrate who will set their trial date.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 300,000 Greeks have a hunting license, while the six-month hunting
season usually begins in late August.

<HEADLINE> Parent, Pilot Are Clinton Guests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The president's guests for Thursday's State of the Union
address included a decorated Air Force pilot, a member of the World Cup-winning
women's soccer team and the father of a teen-ager killed in the shootings at
Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the guests were being seated alongside first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton. One guest, former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, was to take a seat
on the House floor. The president was expected to refer to some of his guests in
the speech, his eighth and final State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   The guests were:
</P>
<P>
	   --Pat Brown of Johnson City, Tenn., a retiree who spends $4,000 of her
savings each year on prescription drugs for heart and thyroid ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   --Ruth Summerlin, an elementary school principal in Beaufort, S.C., who
improved her students' reading and math test scores so dramatically that the
school went from one of South Carolina's 200 worst to a blue-ribbon citation
from the Education Department in five years.
</P>
<P>
	   --Hank Aaron, baseball's all-time home run king, who was honored last year
by Congress a quarter-century after breaking Babe Ruth's longstanding record.
</P>
<P>
	   --Dr. Francis S. Collins, who oversees the federal government's project to
map and sequence all human DNA by 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   --Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minn., who was having trouble paying child
support but now is keeping up with his obligation after enrolling in an
employment and training program.
</P>
<P>
	   --Tom Mauser, father of Columbine victim Daniel Mauser, who has taken a
leave of absence from his job with the Colorado Department of Transportation to
advocate gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   --Bob Knowling Jr. of Santa Clara, Calif., chief executive of Covad
Communications, who is seeking to increase diversity in the field of information
technology.
</P>
<P>
	   --Capt. John Cherrey of Englewood, N.J., who rescued a fellow pilot who was
shot down during the NATO mission in Yugoslavia. Cherrey was awarded the Silver
Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service.
</P>
<P>
	   --Christina Jones of Round Rock, Ariz., a Navajo who volunteers with
Americorps as a tutor for fourth-graders. She plans to teach in her community
after graduation from Dine College.
</P>
<P>
	   --Julie Foudy of Laguna Niguel, Calif., co-captain of the 1999 women's World
Cup soccer team.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert invited an Illinois-area cardinal to the
address as his guest amid a controversy over the rejection of a Roman Catholic
priest to be the House's new chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert denied to reporters earlier Thursday that Cardinal Francis George of
Chicago was in attendance to quell criticism from Catholics. ``Cardinal George
is a friend of mine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The speaker said he was not sure if the cardinal was invited before or after
a brouhaha erupted last month over the rejection of the Rev. Timothy O'Brien, a
Catholic priest from Wisconsin as the House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   Catholics and Democrats have charged that Hastert, R-Ill., and Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, chose the Rev. Charles Parker Wright, a Presbyterian
minister, despite the preference of a bipartisan selection committee for
O'Brien. The House has never had a Catholic chaplain, a post that pays $132,100
a year.

<HEADLINE> El Salvador's Leader Doubts Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- Human rights groups are protesting the
appointment of a general they say oversaw the slaying of a French nurse and four
others during El Salvador's civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Center for the Promotion of Human Rights has continually
asserted that on April 15, 1989, Gustavo Adolfo Perdomo ordered his men to
execute Madeleine Lagadec and four other people at a rural hospital in El
Salvador's Tortugal region of the central San Vicente province.
</P>
<P>
	   Perdomo, a lifelong military bureaucrat, directed a special governmental
battalion during the 12-year civil war, during which government forces battled
leftist insurgents.
</P>
<P>
	   President Francisco Flores, who recently promoted Perdomo to general,
responded to the charges Thursday, saying that the French government has cleared
the general of any wrongdoing and has not objected to his appointment.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, a French judge requested that Salvadoran authorities look into
Perdomo's involvement and that of another general in Lagadec's death, but the
request was denied because the officers were protected by an amnesty that was
part of the peace agreement signed in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Flores did admit, however, that an unidentified French judge recently had
contacted the Salvadoran Supreme Court in hopes of having the court review the
case. But such a request violates international convention and can't be honored,
Flores said.
</P>
<P>
	   In France, officials in the office of French Judge Renaud Van Ruymbecke said
this week that the judge was ready to deploy a team of French investigators to
El Salvador to aid the Supreme Court in its review of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Flores defended Perdomo's record as a military leader, saying there ``was
never any credible evidence that he was responsible for the crime.''
</P>
<P>
	   But a 1989 report produced by the Salvadoran Truth Commission implicates
Perdomo in the killings. It details a military offensive known as ``Operation
Lightning,'' in which Salvadoran soldiers followed up the bombing of the
Tortugal region by deploying specialized groups of troops, including the one led
by Perdomo, with orders to kill any wounded people they encountered.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Workers Sue Timber Cos.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A group of foreign workers is suing three giant
timber companies, alleging they were underpaid after being recruited to come to
the United States to plant trees.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the suits were filed Thursday and one Wednesday in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   The workers, mostly Mexicans, claim International Paper, Georgia-Pacific,
and Champion International Corp. broke the rules of the federal program that
allows them to use foreign labor by not paying the prevailing wage for the work.
</P>
<P>
	   The plaintiffs also claim they haven't been paid overtime as required by
federal law for the seasonal work they do, mostly re-planting trees on the
companies' lands in the southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
	   James Knoepp, an attorney with the Migrant Farmworker Justice Project in
Belle Glade, estimated as many as 6,000 workers may be eligible to join the suit
and said they would be seeking ``several million'' dollars in back pay.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesmen for two of the companies said they hadn't seen the lawsuits and
couldn't comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, we follow all regulations relative to labor practices,'' said
Ken Haldin, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Georgia Pacific.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gov. Mike Leavitt announced Thursday he will run for a
third term, saying he wants to lead Utah through the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor has spent much of the past year dealing with accusations that
people who worked to bring the Olympics to Salt Lake City had given gifts, cash
and scholarships to International Olympic Committee members and their families.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, he defended himself again against charges that his top aides
knew about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The record is clear. Every time I had any credible evidence I acted to
straighten it out,'' said Leavitt, 48.
</P>
<P>
	   If re-elected in November, the Republican governor would be only the second
Utah governor to serve a third term. It would be his last four-year term under
state term limits approved in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   No candidates have announced plans to challenge him.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Speech May Aid Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- The State of the Union and the State of Al Gore's
Campaign are so intertwined that the vice president has made sure one man has
his fingerprints on both efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Shrum, who is traveling with Gore in the final days of the New Hampshire
campaign, helped write the address that dovetailed with Gore's campaign
proposals and gave him credit for administration achievements.
</P>
<P>
	   So it was no surprise that the speech was peppered with half a dozen
laudatory references to Gore, as in ``with the help of the vice president'' and
``I propose we follow Vice President Gore's suggestion...'' Clinton even
borrowed from the vice president's campaign platform, proposing photo IDs for
handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
	   If Gore has his way, he will benefit as much as Clinton from the nationally
televised address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have fought alongside this president for the economy and for the other
important things we have seen from the Clinton-Gore administration,'' the vice
president told New Hampshire Public Radio. Hours later, Gore flew to Washington
to take his traditional State of the Union perch behind Clinton -- looking down
on Congress, applauding his boss and basking in the president's praise.
</P>
<P>
	   Shrum said that scene will help Gore in his campaign against Bill Bradley.
The former New Jersey senator, rocked in the vice president's 2-to-1 victory in
the Iowa caucuses, is struggling to stay close to the front-running Gore in
state polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vice president's there at the address. He's doing his job. People
believe he has the experience and skills to keep the prosperity and the economy
in good shape,'' Shrum said between campaign stops with the vice president.
``Any kind of visual confirmation will be very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
	   So helpful, indeed, that Bradley's campaign has accused the White House of
purposely scheduling the address five days before Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore has been a loyal vice president, but his loyalty hasn't translated
into a bold vision for where we need to go into the next decade,'' Bradley
spokesman Eric Hauser said as Clinton delivered the address.
</P>
<P>
	   Shrum is a full-time campaign adviser and a part-time White House
consultant, putting him at the intersection of Clinton's policies and Gore's
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington operative played down his role, saying he hadn't been
involved in the address in several days. Even then, ``I didn't see my role as a
representative of the vice president. I was helping the president,'' Shrum said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, advisers say Shrum and the vice president's West Wing staff left
their mark on the speech. Gore's chief of staff, Charles Burson, reviewed early
drafts and attended rehearsals with the president and his staff.
</P>
<P>
	   The address included new children's health care and technology programs that
fit Gore's campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the runup to the speech, Clinton announced emergency subsidies for
low-income families to pay heating bills in about a dozen states, including $5.4
million for this state alone. Shortly before the Iowa caucuses, Clinton gave his
vice president credit for a new health care initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore is a big part of this presidency,'' said Clinton's chief of staff,
John Podesta. ``Next week, we'll have the biggest economic expansion in the
nation's history. Al Gore is a big part of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   This is the latest evolution of what Gore himself called ``a complex
relationship'' with Clinton. Just as polls show most Americans are torn between
their approval of Clinton's performance and their disappointment with his
personal behavior, Gore seems to have wavered between embracing his boss and
pushing him away.
</P>
<P>
	   But the vice president says people oversimplify their relationship. ``It's
not true that I'm either distancing myself from him or that I'm trying to run as
a derivative candidate,'' Gore told New Hampshire Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said Gore can link himself to Clinton this week because eight out
of 10 New Hampshire Democrats approve of Clinton's job performance, even if his
personal approval rating is much lower. Gore also stands to benefit from
dramatic improvements in New Hampshire's economy since the 1992 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think as far as the primaries are concerned this is good for Gore, as
long as the focus is on Clinton's programs and not him personally,'' said David
Rhode, political science professor at Michigan State University.
</P>
<P>
	   Other analysts said Gore has already rounded up the pro-Clinton vote, thus
the address won't pad his margin over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody knows he's Clinton's vice president so I don't think it adds
much,'' said Democratic consultant Jim Duffy of Washington. ``But, then again,
the timing can't hurt,'' Duffy added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Receives Upgraded Warplanes  </HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS MEIXLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ESKISEHIR AIR BASE, Turkey (AP) -- The Turkish military on Thursday took
delivery of two rebuilt F-4 warplanes, part of an ambitious multi-billion dollar
modernization program that foresees the country as a major regional power.
</P>
<P>
	   The commander of the Turkish military, Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, pointed to
instability in the nearby Balkans and Caucasus, saying that ``such
uncertainties... require the Turkish armed forces to be more powerful.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fighters were upgraded in Israel and also highlight the growing military
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey and Israel Aircraft Industries are working together to upgrade 54
F-4Es, adding advanced radar and electronic warfare capabilities and
strengthening the structures of the aircraft. The project is expected to cost
$700 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-six of the aircraft will be upgraded in Israel. The other 28 planes
will be reworked in Turkey by Turkish workers using Israeli technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The new electronics are expected to extend the life of the aircraft, which
first entered service in the United States in the late 1960s and saw combat in
Vietnam, until the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey is dramatically expanding the capabilities of its armed forces and is
expected to spend some dlrs 150 billion over the next 25 years purchasing new
tanks and helicopters and expanding its air force.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Turkish relations with Greece have improved in recent months,
Turkey is wary of the growing Iranian military and fears that Syria and Iraq
could become threats in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   The military expansion also comes as Turkey embarks on a more outward
looking foreign policy, sending peacekeepers to the Balkans and courting former
Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey, the former Ottoman Empire, regards the Balkans and the Caucasus as
its traditional sphere of influence.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Squabble on Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush gained the endorsement of Jack Kemp,
a favorite of conservatives, on Thursday and said the Republican Party needs a
presidential nominee who can debate the Democrats, ``not mimic them.''
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested that Sen. John McCain's tax proposals are too like President
Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, said he'd devote a projected $1 trillion, 10-year budget
surplus bonus to paying off the national debt by 2013 instead of adding it to
the proposed tax cut that Bush says would be too little to protect against the
spending habits of Washington politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator also said he'd be a better debater against Vice
President Al Gore because ``Bush stands mute on campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's much easier for me to attack Clinton and Gore because I have the high
ground,'' said McCain, who is a strong advocate of campaign finance changes.
</P>
<P>
	   He holds the edge over Bush in polls of likely voters in the New Hampshire
presidential primary next Tuesday. But the Texas governor said he has a good
chance of winning and can withstand losing anyhow. Campaigning in Nashua, Bush
said he hopes New Hampshire Republicans will choose him as a candidate ``who can
win, who can unify the party.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think when the Republicans go into the booths in New Hampshire and
around the country, it's important to nominate somebody who will be able to
debate the Democratic nominee on key issues, not mimic them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jaffrey, Bush stood in the front hall of a white brick colonial home,
built in 1830, and told townspeople he is a man ``on a mission to lift the
spirit of America.'' And to cut its taxes, he said, so that surplus funds won't
be spent ``on a bigger, more intrusive federal government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said a McCain remark in the Wednesday night debate made his point.
``When he said his tax plan was similar to President Clinton's tax plan, it made
it real clear the difference of opinion on taxes,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   What McCain said was that Clinton had moved toward a plan like his, not the
other way around.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush aides said they were considering producing an ad off that exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning Thursday in Hampton Beach and Newington, McCain rolled his eyes
when told of Bush's comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's spinning like Bill Clinton,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush got a boost during the day when Kemp, the Republicans' 1996 vice
presidential nominee, endorsed him at a campaign event at a Nashua defense
technology plant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush is the one who can inspire the Congress, who can inspire the
nation,'' said Kemp, who endorsed Forbes in 1996 before the publisher dropped
out. He called Forbes a good friend and suggested that perhaps Bush should name
him treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   Kemp, a former New York congressman, is also a former presidential contender
as well as Bob Dole's running mate in the last election.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, campaigning at the Puritan Backroom Restaurant in Manchester, said
he was not surprised at the endorsement, even though he and Kemp have worked
together to promote a flat income tax and Bush has failed to endorse one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jack's a very nice fellow,'' he said. ``But he is part of the
establishment, and it's no surprise the establishment would rally around its
own, especially when they realize they've met their match.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for McCain, the Arizona senator gives few signs that he is very
encouraged by the polls in New Hampshire. He leads Bush narrowly in tracking
polls in the state, ahead 40 percent to 35 percent in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup
poll, and 41 percent to 33 percent in a Fox-WMUR-University of New Hampshire
tracking poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The error margin for the two tracking polls taken through Wednesday night
was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   But Wednesday night, full of energy after the debate, McCain appeared for a
moment to be looking beyond the Republican race. ``We're going to beat Gore like
a drum,'' he declared at a post-debate party in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's town hall meeting Thursday at Yoken's Restaurant was packed. The
crowd spilled out into the halls, and people in the back of the stifling room
stood on chairs to see the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, McCain released a new television ad that will air in New
Hampshire through the primary. In it, McCain promises to return government ``to
whom it belongs, the people.'' The words ``Character,'' ``Courage'' and ``Ready
to Lead'' fade in over footage of McCain at town hall meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   There was more talk about abortion Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Good people can disagree on that issue,'' Bush said. The night before, he
had said in the debate that if he could write a constitutional amendment on
abortion, it would say that the rights of the unborn are protected by law.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes, who finished third to Bush and Forbes in Iowa, challenged McCain
in the debate for saying earlier in the day that it would be a family decision
should his teen-age daughter become pregnant and want an abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, campaigning at a school in Bedford on Thursday, said, ``No pro-life
Republican can support McCain with any kind of confidence. I'll tell you right
now pro-life people who support McCain are throwing away their votes on someone
who will betray us. He does not have this conviction in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Thursday, ``It's a little painful when your family is brought
up.'' But he said a candidate ``can't get angry'' about it.

	   Some reaction to President Clinton's State of the Union address:
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president's agenda will help sustain record economic growth by paying
down the national debt by 2013. It will make prudent use of the surplus to
extend the life of Social Security and Medicare and to provide a fiscally
responsible middle-class tax cut. Unfortunately, Republicans have no plans to
use one penny of the surplus to strengthen Social Security or Medicare.'' --
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without the Republican Congress to block big government programs and
higher taxes proposed by the Clinton-Gore administration, we wouldn't have a
balanced budget much less the surplus we have now.'' -- Jim Nicholson,
Republican National Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just as we plan ahead to safeguard Medicare and Social Security, we need
to plan for our natural security -- saving land always stands the test of
time.'' -- William Meadows, president of the Wilderness Society
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ''... Waiting for Clinton's so-called marriage tax relief would be like
waiting for food in a Russian bread line.'' -- Janet Parshall, spokeswoman for
the Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ``The national debt is a serious matter. Republicans have supported paying
off the debt by 2015, the administration by 2013 with the new surplus. This is
not a game of one-upmanship. It is imperative that we take politics out of this
and do what is best for the future of this nation.'' -- Rep. Steven Kuykendall,
R-Calif.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Seeking to boost his standing among an increasingly
politically active constituency, Vice President Al Gore boasted Thursday of
having more openly gay potential convention delegates in New York than Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp said that while its slate of delegates for the state's March 7
presidential primary included 11 openly gay candidates, slates for the former
senator from New Jersey had just five openly gay people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign later ended up wearing some egg when state party officials
said Bradley's campaign had reported having seven openly gay prospective
delegates -- not five as Gore had claimed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign pounced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Al Gore campaign continues to distort the facts in an attempt to win
the Democratic primary against Senator Bill Bradley at any cost -- even the cost
of the truth,'' Bradley's campaign said in a statement accusing Gore campaign of
``lies and distortions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Ragon, a spokesman for Gore's New York campaign team, conceded the
mistake, but said the error was the result of incorrection information given the
campaign by the state party.

	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole told students and teachers at an
urban elementary school Thursday that her former rival, Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush, has the character and experience to help Michigan
families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You look at his family and how devoted he is,'' she said of the Texas
governor, citing his promises to cut taxes and improve education by allowing
more decisions to be made at the local level. ``He's going to be thinking of
every way he can help families.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Dole, wife of the 1996 GOP presidential nominee, said she believes Bush
will win the New Hampshire Republican primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But not every moment focused on Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   A teacher's comment shifted the spotlight back to Mrs. Dole, a former
Cabinet secretary who quit the GOP presidential contest last year.

	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Squabbling over New York's presidential primary ballot
continued Thursday. Developer Donald Trump won the right to compete for
Independence Party backing and Steve Forbes lost his spot on the Republican
ballot in three Long Island congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump, who is not an announced presidential candidate, is considering
running for the Reform Party's presidential nomination, and his New York
supporters are seeking to run delegate slates for him in the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But a coalition within the Independence Party, New York's version of the
Reform Party, has been trying to have Trump's delegates thrown off the ballot.
The Democracy Coalition supports Trump nemesis and Reform presidential candidate
Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
	   In retaliation for the Long Island challenge to his petitions, Forbes has
gone into state court in an attempt to get rival Texas Gov. George W. Bush
removed from the GOP ballot in six districts in New York City.

	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A South Carolina Democratic Party member said
Thursday he has asked a federal judge to block the Feb. 19 Republican
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer representing state Rep. Todd Rutherford of Columbia asked the judge
to block the primary unless the GOP opens balloting at all precincts and
conforms to federal voting rights laws.
</P>
<P>
	   State GOP Chairman Henry McMaster said Republicans plan to open all
precincts and that the complaint won't hold up in court because the party
primaries don't have to abide by federal election laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no merit to those contentions,'' McMaster said.
</P>
<P>
	   He would not say how many precincts already had arrangements to be staffed,
but said the party would try to open them all.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar complaint is pending with the U.S. Justice Department. Rutherford
has accused the GOP of deliberately trying to keep blacks from voting in the
primary by keeping precincts closed.

	   TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Cancellation of the state's April 4 presidential
primary could make it difficult for Kansas Republicans to get their delegation
seated at the party's national convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   State GOP Chairman Mark Parkinson worried Wednesday that the 35 delegates
may not receive credentials because the party had to change its plans for
choosing them.
</P>
<P>
	   Without credentials, they won't be able to vote on the party's national
platform or its presidential nominee at the August convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   Parkinson said he is working with the Republican National Committee and
conceded that Kansas would have a problem getting its delegates recognized only
if the contest for the presidential nomination remained in doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said: ``We're scrambling.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Bill Graves and other prominent Republicans were not aware that
canceling the election could cause such a problem. Graves plans to sign a bill
that cuts the current state budget, which includes a provision canceling the
election.

	   MONTEVALLO, Ala. (AP) -- Reform Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan
said no one should be offended to see the Confederate battle flag flying over a
public building.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This flag flew over the battlefields. It never flew over the slave
fields,'' Buchanan said this week on a fund-raising swing through Alabama.
</P>
<P>
	   He said ``many great men'' fought and died for the flag, which critics view
as a symbol of slavery. Defenders see it as a symbol of Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan said one of his great-grandfathers died at Vicksburg, Miss.,
fighting for the Confederacy, and another was captured outside of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederate battle flag was removed from the pole atop the Alabama
Capitol dome in Montgomery in 1993 after a lawsuit contended that state law
provides only for the state and national flags to fly atop the Capitol.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Photo IDs for Gun Buys  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged states Thursday to issue photo ID
licenses for handgun purchases, much like licenses for driving or hunting.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal was the last from Clinton's State of the Union agenda that was
not revealed in advance of Thursday's speech. The White House said it would go
beyond the gun legislation Clinton proposed last year, which is stalled in
committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every state in this country already requires hunters and automobile
drivers to have a license. I think they ought to do the same thing for handgun
purchases,'' Clinton said. ``I hope you'll help me pass that in this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Rifle Association dismissed the licensing proposal as
unworkable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's it going to solve? The criminals could care less,'' said NRA
executive vice president Wayne LaPierre. ``They're not going to stand in line;
they won't comply with it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's plan, anyone who wants to buy a handgun would be required to
first obtain a license showing he has passed a background check and a gun safety
requirement, such as a training course or an exam.
</P>
<P>
	   States could choose not to participate in the program, according to a White
House official who discussed the proposal on condition of anonymity. In states
that decline to set up the licensing system, a federally approved gun dealer or
a federal entity would issue the license, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not mandating this,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tighter gun control already has emerged as an issue in the presidential
campaign. In fact, Clinton's licensing plan is very similar to one already
offered by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's program calls for making gun license mandatory, and requiring
manufacturers and federally licensed sellers to report gun sales to state
authority. Further, Gore would ban so-called Saturday night specials and expand
background checks and mandate child-safety locks.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, has urged mandatory licenses for handgun buyers and gun
registration. He also would raise license fees on dealers and ban Saturday night
specials.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has called for raising the
age for handgun purchases to 21. He also supports instant background checks at
gun shows. Bush opposes universal gun registration.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes says he would let states set firearm standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal unveiled by Clinton was part of an overall strategy seeking to
tighten gun regulations and increase gun safety. The president previously
revealed he would seek $280 million in the fiscal 2001 budget for hiring more
firearms agents and prosecutors at federal, state and local levels, tracing guns
used in crimes, increasing funding for ballistics tests.

<HEADLINE> Judge Throws McCain Back Off Ballot  </HEADLINE>
   By JESSE J. HOLLAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A judge on Thursday threw Sen. John McCain out of the
Republican presidential primary in eight of New York's congressional districts,
one day after two Democratic election officials helped him stay on those
ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Cannizzaro overturned the state Board of
Elections' decision to allow McCain to compete in the districts despite
challenges from state Republicans, most of whom support GOP presidential
front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In the challenged districts, the Arizona senator did not have the number of
signatures on his presidential petitions that state law requires in order to
qualify for the primary. However, McCain supporters argued that the signature
requirement should not apply to him since he is a valid presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   New York election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane.
But Cannizzaro disagreed, calling the signature requirements ``reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from party members to
qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31
congressional districts in which they wish to compete. In effect, there are 31
separate GOP primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters had challenged McCain in 16 districts. Cannizzaro's decision
leaves McCain off the ballot in a fourth of the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Buley, a state Republican Committee lawyer working in support of Bush,
cheered the decision. ``We're pleased and think it was the proper decision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign lawyer Henry Berger said they had not yet decided whether
to appeal. McCain on Friday planned to ask a federal judge to place him on the
ballot in all 31 of New York's congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are disappointed,'' Berger said. ``But I'm going to see what happens in
federal court ... and then make a decision whether to appeal.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said it was ``disturbing that such a thing would happen in the freest
nation in the world.'' He said Bush should telephone Gov. George Pataki and tell
him to ``Let John McCain on the ballot.'' Pataki supports Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all know that I'm a qualified candidate,'' McCain told reporters after
a town hall meeting at Nashua High School in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would take the issue to the floor of the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia this summer if the courts fail to satisfy him.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   In an ironic twist, it was Democrats who helped McCain stay on the ballot in
those eight districts. The two Republican members of the state elections board
had voted Wednesday to uphold the challenges to McCain's petitions. But the
board's two Democrats abstained, thus depriving the Bush camp of the third vote
it needed to have the petitions invalidated.
</P>
<P>
	   The state board had hoped to finalize the ballot by Jan. 31.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
	   Last January, the Monica Lewinsky scandal still swirled as Hillary Rodham
Clinton watched her husband's State of the Union speech. Seated next to her was
slugger Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, for whom the first lady rooted while
growing up in suburban Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, she is an ardent New York Yankee fan and owner of a $1.7 million
home north of New York City that will serve as a base for her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is raising millions of dollars to take on New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani in what is shaping up as one of the nation's top political
contests this year.
</P>
<P>
	   As her husband delivers his last State of the Union, Mrs. Clinton's
political career is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   She has moved out of the White House and into the home in Chappaqua, N.Y. In
a sign of just how much things have changed, she commuted to Washington for her
husband's address from fund-raisers for her own campaign in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton paid tribute to his wife in his speech, praising her work
to streamline adoption and foster care programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, I am forever grateful to the person who has led our efforts
from the beginning, and who has worked so tirelessly for children and families
for 30 years now: my wife, Hillary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, with daughter Chelsea by her side, smiled at her husband and
mouthed `thank you' as she stood to acknowledge applause from her front-row seat
in the visitors gallery. The president applauded with the crowd for his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   He also called on the entertainment industry ``to accept the first lady's
challenge'' and to develop a single, voluntary rating system for all children's
entertainment that would be less confusing to parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is drawing heavily from Hollywood and the entertainment
industry in her fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   The president focused his speech on broad issues such as ambitious plans to
spend more to improve health care and education -- some of the same issues Mrs.
Clinton will make key in her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the specific initiatives the president mentioned -- making college
tuition tax deductible -- first was advanced by Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer
of New York in his successful bid to oust GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, too, is expected to campaign on that issue as she tries to
appeal to some of the same middle-class suburban voters who helped Schumer get
elected.
</P>
<P>
	   If she is successful in her bid for office the first lady will trade in her
coveted seat in the gallery for a spot on the crowded House floor she now
overlooks. There she will be elbow-to-elbow with some of the same lawmakers who
voted to impeach her husband.

<HEADLINE> Minority Applications Up at UC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- More black and Hispanic students have applied to
attend the University of California, Berkeley, next fall, despite officials'
fears that the end of affirmative action would put off minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The most significant increase came in Hispanic applications for the fall
freshman class: 3,382 Hispanic students applied for the fall semester, up 20
percent from 2,818 last year. Applications from black students increased 9.7
percent, from 1,135 last year to 1,245.
</P>
<P>
	   Applications from Asian-Americans, the biggest group on campus, rose 7.3
percent to 11,522, and white applications rose less than 1 percent to 11,385.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, Berkeley received 32,696 applications for its roughly 4,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hope that this is a result of our outreach efforts, we've done special
things with the students from Los Angeles and we've redoubled our efforts in the
(San Francisco) Bay Area,'' said Richard Black, acting associate director of
admissions and enrollment.
</P>
<P>
	   UC regents voted to stop considering race in admissions in 1995, and the
change took effect for freshmen in 1998.

	   That year, black and Hispanic admissions tumbled at Berkeley. Black
admissions went from 545 in 1997 to 236 in 1998, down 57 percent. Last fall, 293

<HEADLINE> Judge throws McCain back off the eight contested presidential  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A judge on Thursday threw Sen. John McCain out of
the Republican presidential primary in eight of New York's congressional
districts, one day after two Democratic election officials helped him stay on
those ballots.
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Cannizzaro overturned the state Board of
Elections' decision to allow McCain to compete in those eight districts despite
challenges from state Republicans, most of whom support GOP front-runner George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In the challenged districts, the Arizona senator did not have the number of
signatures on his presidential petitions that New York state law required him to
have to qualify for the primary. However, McCain supporters argued that since he
was a valid national presidential primary contender, the signature requirement
should not apply to him.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all know that I'm a qualified candidate," McCain told reporters after a
town hall meeting at Nashua High School in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would take the issue to the floor of the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia this summer if the courts fail to satisfy him.
</P>
<P>
	   New York election laws are generally considered the nation's most arcane.
But Cannizzaro disagreed, calling the signature requirements "reasonable."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not the prerogative of any single candidate to interpose his or her
own judgment in place of that of the state Legislature in this regard," the
judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from party members to
qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the state's 31
congressional districts in which they wish to compete. In effect, there are 31
separate GOP primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters had challenged McCain in 16 of those districts. Cannizzaro's
decision leaves McCain off the ballot in a fourth of the state's districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Buley, a state Republican Committee lawyer working in support of Bush,
cheered the decision. "We're pleased and think it was the proper decision," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign lawyer Henry Berger said they had not yet decided whether
to appeal. McCain on Friday planned to ask a federal judge in Brooklyn to place
him on the ballot in all 31 of New York's congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are disappointed," Berger said. "But I'm going to see what happens in
federal court tomorrow and then make a decision whether to appeal."
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   In an ironic twist, it was the Democrats who helped McCain stay on the
ballot in those eight districts. The two Republican members of the state Board
of Elections had voted on Wednesday to uphold the challenges to McCain's
petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   But the board's two Democrats abstained, thus depriving the Bush camp of the
third vote it needed to have the petitions invalidated for a lack of signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no clear indication Thursday when the ballot for New York's March
7 primary would be finalized. The state board had hoped to finalize the ballot
by Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Cannizzaro's decision is merely the latest salvo in the ongoing battle over
New York's March 7 presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Mega-developer Donald Trump has won a battle to compete for Independence
Party backing and Steve Forbes has lost his spot on the GOP ballot in three Long
Island congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   But the battles now head to the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   In retaliation for the Long Island challenges to his petitions, Forbes has
gone into state court in an attempt to get Bush knocked off the GOP ballot in
six New York City districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-Trump forces trying to grab control of New York's arm of the Reform
Party, known as the Independence Party, have sued to get him off their ballot
completely.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump is not an announced presidential candidate. Nonetheless, he is
considering running for the Reform Party's presidential nomination and his New
York supporters are seeking to run delegate slates for him in the March 7
primary.	   But the Independence Party's Democracy Coalition, led by leftist
activist Lenora Fulani, have been trying to have Trump's delegate slates thrown
off the ballot, claiming insufficient signatures from party members on his
petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   While Fulani is backing conservative Pat Buchanan's bid for the Reform
Party's nomination, her faction is running delegate slates for the New York
primary that are uncommitted to any candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   The state chairman of the Independence Party, Jack Essenberg, is backing
Trump. Fulani is attempting to have Essenberg removed as state party chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Board of Elections refused to throw Trump off the ballot and an
appeal of decision by the Fulani forces is to be heard Friday in a state court
in Albany.

   BRILLION, Wis. (AP) -- The Ariens Co., a Wisconsin-based snowblower
manufacturer, is recalling 27,000 of its snowblowers because of reported fuel
leaks, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is recalling its Ariens and Lesco models because fuel can leak
from a fuel-line connection.
</P>
<P>
	   The recall includes five models of the SS332 and SS522 orange Ariens units
manufactured in 1997 and 1999 and the LSS522 green Lesco model, the commission
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The recalled snowblowers were sold in retail outlets, including Home Depot,
from July 1997 to January 2000 for $450 to $560, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
	   People should stop using the blowers immediately and return the unit to a
local dealer for free repair, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congress Link Always Tense  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has never had an easy time dealing with
Congress -- even when Democrats ran it -- and he's gotten no signs from
Republican leaders that things are about to change this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, the fact that everybody but Clinton is a candidate in 2000 is feeding a
strange hope at the White House of actually getting something done before he
leaves office. The president even figures the agenda he articulated Thursday
night stands ``a better than 50-50 chance'' of passage.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, once he took the podium, Clinton tried to temper expectations
about his legislative goals: ``We will not reach them all this year. Not even in
this decade. But we will reach them.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP leaders politely accepted Clinton's appeals for side-by-side action on
issues like Social Security. But they made it clear that they would simply
ignore Clinton if he is not open to their ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are a number of priorities that are non-negotiable for
Republicans,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican
Conference. ``He can either work with Republicans ... or side with those in his
party who block progress at every turn.''
</P>
<P>
	   To some, Clinton's prediction of last-minute legislative magic seems rather
bold. They say Clinton should stick to ``bite-sized initiatives'' if having a
legacy is important to him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There won't be anything that will be written about in the history books,''
said Marshall Whitman, director of congressional relations for the Heritage
Foundation. ``This president has the worst relationship with a Congress since
Nixon left the White House grounds on the helicopter.''
</P>
<P>
	   But others say Clinton's lame-duck status frees him to be an agent
provocateur for Vice President Al Gore, using legislative proposals to try to
force Republicans into taking positions they must then defend before the voters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The truth is, he has a lot of cards to play,'' said Al From, president of
the Democratic Leadership Council. ``The Republicans have interests too. They
can't go to the voters having just blocked everything Clinton's done.''
</P>
<P>
	   It is an added twist in the saga of Clinton vs. Congress, a story line that,
over seven years, has hit upon nearly every type of conflict available to the
executive and legislative branches of government.
</P>
<P>
	   Consider 1993, when a Congress full of his fellow Democrats sent Clinton's
ambitious health care reform package to a watery grave. Or 1994, when a restive
electorate gave Clinton a Republican majority to contend with in Congress,
forcing him to scrap his liberal-sounding agenda and start over from the middle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A great marching speech. It went left-right, left-right, left-right,''
Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., said of the 1995 State of the Union address -- which
drew slow, begrudging applause and was interrupted by shouts from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Later that same year, though, Clinton emerged victorious from an epic
struggle over balancing the budget that shut down the federal government. The
following year, 1996, Clinton and GOP leaders regarded each other with studied
cool, uncertain of whose programs would play well on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   More than Clinton's legislative agenda hung in the balance when he went
before Congress in January 1998. The president had been accused of having an
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which he denied.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP lawmakers seized upon the Lewinsky matter as grounds for removing
Clinton from office. The president struggled to secure passage of an Asian
financial bailout and failed to get approval for ``fast track'' trade
negotiating authority. Before year's end, Clinton admitted to the affair, and
the House voted to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
	   The impeachment was still playing out last January, when Clinton delivered
his seventh State of the Union address. House members debated whether he should
even be invited to give the speech, since the Senate had yet to vote on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton gave the speech anyway, and Republicans responded with distant,
unenthusiastic reactions. Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and Rep. Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, remained seated and gave him no applause at all.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, Clinton is back as an impeachment survivor, and GOP leaders are
speaking to him in terms that sound friendly -- and ominous.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter Wednesday, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
sought cooperation on a Social Security initiative. ``As we both know, the news
will soon focus on what you have and have not accomplished during your
presidency,'' Archer said.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Probes Four Generals  </HEADLINE>
   By FREDDY CUEVAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- The Honduran government announced Thursday
that it was investigating four generals for allegedly diverting $100 million
from military budgets during a 14-year period.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation involves Gens. Humberto Regalado Hernandez, Anulfo
Cantarero Lopez, Luis Alonso Discua Elvir and Mario Hung Pacheco, each of whom
acted as commander-in-chief of the armed forces at different times between 1985
and 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Honduran Controller General Vera Rubi said in a news conference that the
results of the investigation should be released soon.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual budget for the Honduran military is about $55 million. Between
1980 and 1989, however, the armed forces received more than $1 billion from the
United States to arm and finance the activities of about 14,000 Nicaraguan
``contra'' rebels and their families who established camps on the Honduran side
of the border.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``contras'' were demobilized and repatriated in April 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary investigation has revealed that about $100 million cannot be
accounted for during the 14-year period from 1985-99, Rubi said.
</P>
<P>
	   Regalado Hernandez was chief of the armed forces from 1986 to 1990. He was
replaced by Cantarero Lopez, who was in power for only 11 months before being
overthrown. Discua Elvir was in charge from 1990 to 1995, when he became an
alternate ambassador at the United Nations. Pacheco was the last
commander-in-chief, serving from 1995 to 1999, when control of the army was
turned over to a civilian president.
</P>
<P>
	   In January 1999, the Honduran government ended decades of military dominance
by ratifying constitutional reforms that eliminate the position of
commander-in-chief of the army and disbanded the Superior Council, the top
military body.
</P>
<P>
	   The current role of the armed forces is to fight drug and arms trafficking,
terrorism, illiteracy and destruction of the environment.

<HEADLINE> For Hillary Clinton, first State of the Union as candidate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - What a difference a year makes.
<P>
	   Last January, the Monica Lewinsky scandal still swirled as Hillary Rodham
Clinton watched her husband's State of the Union speech. Seated next to her was
slugger Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, for whom the first lady rooted while
growing up in suburban Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, she is an ardent New York Yankee fan and owner of a $1.7 million
home north of New York City that will serve as a base for her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is raising millions of dollars to take on New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani in what is shaping up as one of the nation's top political
contests this year.
</P>
<P>
	   As her husband delivers his last State of the Union, Mrs. Clinton's
political career is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   She has moved out of the White House and into the home in Chappaqua, N.Y. In
a sign of just how much things have changed, she commuted to Washington for her
husband's address from fund-raisers for her own campaign in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton paid tribute to his wife in his speech, praising her work
to streamline adoption and foster care programs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Of course, I am forever grateful to the person who has led our efforts from
the beginning, and who has worked so tirelessly for children and families for 30
years now: my wife, Hillary," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton smiled at her husband and mouthed 'thank you' as she stood to
acknowledge applause from her front-row seat in the visitors gallery. The
president applauded with the crowd for his wife, who sat between daughter
Chelsea and Baseball Hall-of-Famer Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
	   He also called on the entertainment industry "to accept the first lady's
challenge" and to develop a single, voluntary rating system for all children's
entertainment that would be less confusing to parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is drawing heavily from Hollywood and the entertainment
industry in her fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   The president focused his speech on broad issues such as ambitious plans to
spend more to improve health care and education - some of the same issues Mrs.
Clinton will make key in her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the specific initiatives the president mentioned - making college
tuition tax deductible - first was advanced by Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer
of New York in his successful bid to oust GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, too, is expected to campaign on that issue as she tries to
appeal to some of the same middle-class suburban voters who helped Schumer get
elected.
</P>
<P>
	   If she is successful in her bid for office the first lady will trade in her
coveted seat in the gallery for a spot on the crowded House floor she now
overlooks. There she will be elbow-to-elbow with some of the same lawmakers who
voted to impeach her husband.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Speech May Aid Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- The State of the Union and the State of Al Gore's
Campaign are so intertwined that the vice president made sure one man has his
fingerprints on both efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Shrum, who is traveling with Gore in the final days of the New Hampshire
campaign, helped write the address that President Clinton delivered Thursday
night in Washington, dovetailing with Gore's campaign proposals and giving him
credit for administration achievements.
</P>
<P>
	   So it was no surprise that the speech was peppered with laudatory references
to Gore, as in ``with the help of the vice president'' and ``I propose we follow
Vice President Gore's suggestion...'' Clinton even borrowed from the vice
president's campaign platform, proposing photo IDs for handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
	   He flubbed one attempt to praise Gore, saying his vice president helped make
communities ``more liberal.'' Gore laughed as Clinton corrected himself: ``more
livable.''
</P>
<P>
	   If Gore has his way, he will benefit as much as Clinton from the nationally
televised address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have fought alongside this president for the economy and for the other
important things we have seen from the Clinton-Gore administration,'' the vice
president told New Hampshire Public Radio. Hours later, Gore flew to Washington
to take his traditional State of the Union perch behind Clinton -- looking down
on Congress, applauding his boss and basking in the president's praise.
</P>
<P>
	   Shrum said that scene will help Gore in his campaign against Bill Bradley.
The former New Jersey senator, rocked in the vice president's 2-to-1 victory in
the Iowa caucuses, is struggling to stay close to the front-running Gore in
state polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vice president's there at the address. He's doing his job. People
believe he has the experience and skills to keep the prosperity and the economy
in good shape,'' Shrum said between campaign stops with the vice president.
``Any kind of visual confirmation will be very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
	   So helpful, indeed, that Bradley's campaign has accused the White House of
purposely scheduling the address five days before Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore has been a loyal vice president, but his loyalty hasn't translated
into a bold vision for where we need to go into the next decade,'' Bradley
spokesman Eric Hauser said as Clinton delivered the address.
</P>
<P>
	   Shrum is a full-time campaign adviser and a part-time White House
consultant, putting him at the intersection of Clinton's policies and Gore's
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington operative played down his role, saying he hadn't been
involved in the address in several days. Even then, ``I didn't see my role as a
representative of the vice president. I was helping the president,'' Shrum said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, advisers say Shrum and the vice president's West Wing staff left
their mark on the speech. Gore's chief of staff, Charles Burson, reviewed early
drafts and attended rehearsals with the president and his staff.
</P>
<P>
	   The address included new children's health care, environment and technology
programs that fit Gore's campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the runup to the speech, Clinton announced emergency subsidies for
low-income families to pay heating bills in about a dozen states, including $5.4
million for this state alone. Shortly before the Iowa caucuses, Clinton gave his
vice president credit for a new health care initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the latest evolution of what Gore himself called ``a complex
relationship'' with Clinton. Just as polls show most Americans are torn between
their approval of Clinton's performance and their disappointment with his
personal behavior, Gore seems to have wavered between embracing his boss and
pushing him away.
</P>
<P>
	   But the vice president says people oversimplify their relationship. ``It's
not true that I'm either distancing myself from him or that I'm trying to run as
a derivative candidate,'' Gore told New Hampshire Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said Gore can link himself to Clinton this week because eight out
of 10 New Hampshire Democrats approve of Clinton's job performance, even if his
personal approval rating is much lower. Gore also stands to benefit from
dramatic improvements in New Hampshire's economy since the 1992 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think as far as the primaries are concerned this is good for Gore, as
long as the focus is on Clinton's programs and not him personally,'' said David
Rhode, political science professor at Michigan State University.
</P>
<P>
	   Other analysts said Gore has already rounded up the pro-Clinton vote, thus
the address won't pad his margin over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody knows he's Clinton's vice president so I don't think it adds
much,'' said Democratic consultant Jim Duffy of Washington. ``But, then again,
the timing can't hurt,'' Duffy added.

Clinton Proposes Tax Cut, New Spending
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his last State of the Union address, President Clinton
tonight proposed a $350 billion tax cut, big spending increases for schools and
health care and photo ID licenses for handgun purchases. Clinton was greeted by
applause and handshakes by Republicans and Democrats alike. He called for
passage of a patients' bill of rights to strengthen consumer protection,
gun-safety legislation, campaign finance reform, an increase in the minimum wage
and votes on long-stalled judicial nominations. The president noted that next
month the United States will achieve the longest period of economic growth in
the nation's history, and called on Americans to "set great goals."

Capitol Hill Wary on Cuban Boy

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As relatives competing for custody of 6-year-old Cuban
refugee Elian Gonzalez crisscrossed Capitol Hill today, support dwindled for a
bill to make the boy an American citizen. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
said "there's a difference of opinion" among Republicans about how to proceed.
In the Senate, there was strong Democratic opposition to the citizenship bill
and Republicans were divided. A day after meeting with the Cuban boy in Miami
Beach, his grandmothers continued to lobby against the citizenship bill,
insisting Elian be allowed to return to his father in Cuba -- preferably in
their company.

But nearly one in 10 children have already smoked cigarettes by middle school. A
nationwide survey of 7,529 high schoolers in September and October found that
28.4 percent reported using tobacco products in the preceding month, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention said today. In 1997, the last time the CDC
looked at high school smoking, 36.4 percent of students said they had smoked in

masses of people doing it at once, it says the crowd thinks there's very little

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeking $350B Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) --President Clinton proposed a $350 billion tax cut, big
spending increases for schools and health care and photo ID licenses for handgun
purchases Thursday as he offered the final agenda of his presidency. ``The state
of our union is the strongest it has ever been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the start of an election-year, Clinton issued a stinging rebuke in his
last State of the Union address. ``For too long this Congress has been standing
still on some of our most pressing national priorities,'' he chided.
</P>
<P>
	   The president noted that next month the United States will achieve the
longest period of economic growth in the nation's history, and called on
Americans to ``set great goals.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president offered a long litany of initiatives, many of them sure to be
rewritten or ignored by Congress. His tax cut proposals were intended primarily
to promote educational opportunities and expand health insurance and child care
for lower- and middle-income Americans. The initiatives included relief from the
``marriage penalty'' -- an idea first championed by Republicans -- and a new
program of retirement savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the proposals were released in advance but the White House withheld
Clinton's gun licensing measure until the last minute to build suspense. Similar
to a plan offered by Vice President Al Gore, it would require handgun purchasers
to first obtain a state license showing they have passed a background check and
a gun safety requirement, such as a training course or an exam.
</P>
<P>
	   States could choose not to participate in the program. The National Rifle
Association condemned the plan as pointless and unworkable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every state in this country already requires hunters and automobile
drivers to have a license. I think they ought to do the same thing for handgun
purchases,'' Clinton said. ``I hope you'll help me pass that in this Congress
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton called for passage of a patients' bill of rights to strengthen
consumer protection, gun-safety legislation, campaign finance reform, an
increase in the minimum wage and votes on long-stalled judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans ridiculed Clinton's proposals but did not rule out working with
him on such issues as education and health care. ``If we enacted all the new
programs the president has talked about, we'd spend just about the entire
surplus on bigger and more expensive government,'' said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was greeted by applause and handshakes by Republicans and Democrats
alike. His wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea, home from college, were in the
audience. His speech will go into the record books as his longest State of the
Union address: 89 minutes, besting his 1995 record of 81 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   More than an hour into his speech, Clinton flubbed a line meant to credit
Gore with helping making communities more ``livable.'' Instead, Clinton said
``liberal'' -- not once but twice. The audience -- Gore included -- guffawed.
</P>
<P>
	   Five days before the New Hampshire primary, Clinton seized the chance to
boost Gore in his race for the Democratic presidential nomination. In his
speech, there were six references to the vice president. Clinton also recognized
another candidate: the first lady, running for the U.S. Senate seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of Clinton's proposals were repackaged from earlier years and, in some
cases resubmitted with spending figures double or triple the original amount.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton boasted that the nation has been lifted from economic distress,
social decline and political gridlock.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs. The fastest
economic growth in more than 30 years. The lowest unemployment rates in 30
years. The lowest poverty rates in 20 years. The lowest African-American and
Hispanic unemployment rates on record. The first back-to-back surpluses in 42
years.''
</P>
<P>
	   In offering his gun licensing plan, Clinton said, ``We've all seen what
happens when guns fall into the wrong hands,'' the president said. His words
recalled the tragedy of the massacre at Columbine High School. Tom Mauser, the
father of slain student Daniel Mauser, was among those invited to listen to
Clinton's speech in a VIP box with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   The president boasted of the nation's upbeat times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Never before has our nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and
social progress with so little internal crisis or so few external threats,'' the
president said. ``Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity -- and
therefore such a profound obligation -- to build the more perfect union of our
founders' dreams.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's tax program includes marriage penalty relief, tax deductions of up
to $2,800 annually per family for college tuition and fees and retirement
savings accounts for low- and moderate-income families. He also proposed steps
to encourage charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by Republicans
and Democrats as both sides battle for control of Congress and the White House.
Smarting from Clinton's veto of their $792 billion tax-cut package last year,
House Republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax breaks and
marriage penalty relief this year. Presidential candidates have their own
proposals, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called
Clinton's tax cuts too limited. ``We think all Americans deserve tax relief, not
just the handful the president picks,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package would cost $350 billion over 10 years. However,
his plan envisions cutting that price tag by $100 billion by closing tax havens,
shelters and loopholes. Congress has previously rejected many of those ideas on
grounds they are tax increases.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no major foreign policy announcements, although Clinton urged
Congress to give China permanent normal trading relations with the United
States. He also asked for $1.6 billion for Colombia to fight narco-traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the United States must help Russia and China become strong,
prosperous democratic nations. ``Both are behind held back from reaching their
full potential -- Russia by the legacy of communism, economic turmoil, a cruel
and self-defeating war in Chechnya; China by the illusion that it can buy
stability at the expense of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   The booming economy and swelling tax revenues give Clinton and Republicans a
big purse for any tax reductions or spending increases. Both sides claim they
are dedicated to protecting Social Security and eliminating the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Called anew for Medicare to include a prescription drug benefit and to
let people as young as 55 buy Medicare coverage -- this time with a 25 percent
tax credit.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Proposed $1 billion in tax incentives for drug makers to develop vaccines
for malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Called for doubling spending for after-school and summer school programs
and to expand the Head Start program for needy children to cover 950,000 kids.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Offered tax breaks for college costing $30 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Expanded the earned income tax credit for the working poor by $21
billion, and offered a tax credit for long-term care costing $27 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Proposed a 10-year, $110 billion proposal to provide health coverage to
the parents of children protected by the state Children's Health Insurance
Program. If approved, it would be the largest increase in health coverage in 35
years.

    MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Katie Douglas scored 17 of her 25 points in the second
half as 17th-ranked Purdue wore down Minnesota for a 69-50 victory Thursday.

<P>
	   Purdue was unable to put away Minnesota until midway through the second
half. A basket by the Gophers' Kim Bell with 17:34 remaining in the game cut

<HEADLINE> State of the Union Address Excerpts  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Excerpts from President Clinton's State of the Union address:
EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
	   Because education is more than ever the key to our children's future, we
must make sure all our children have that key. That means quality preschool and
afterschool, the best trained teachers in every classroom, and college
opportunities for all our children.
</P>
<P>
	   All successful schools have followed the same proven formula: higher
standards, more accountability, so all children can reach those standards. I
have sent Congress a reform plan based on that formula. ... Each year, the
national government invests more than $15 billion in our schools. It's time to
support what works and stop supporting what doesn't.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE
</P>
<P>
	   In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending to all
seniors the lifeline of affordable prescription drugs. Record numbers of
Americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones at home. Last year, I
proposed a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care. Frankly, that wasn't enough.
This year, let's triple it to $3,000 -- and this year, let's pass it.
CRIME &AMP; GUN CONTROL
</P>
<P>
	   Crime in America has dropped for the past seven years -- the longest decline
on record, thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community
police, sensible gun safety laws, and effective prevention. But nobody believes
America is safe enough. So let's set a higher goal: Let's make America the
safest big country in the world. ...
</P>
<P>
	   We must strengthen gun laws and better enforce laws already on the books.
Federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since I took office. But again,
we must do more. I propose to hire more federal and local gun prosecutors, and
more ATF agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers and bad-apple dealers.
And we must give law enforcement the tools to trace every gun -- and every
bullet -- used in a crime in America.
GLOBALIZATION
</P>
<P>
	   To keep our historic economic expansion going, we need a 21st century
revolution to open new markets, start new businesses, and hire new workers right
here in America -- in our inner cities, poor rural areas, and on Indian
reservations. Our nation's prosperity has not yet reached these places. ...
Everywhere I've gone, I've met talented people eager for opportunity, and able
to work. Let's put them to work.
</P>
<P>
	   For business, it's the smart thing to do. For America, it's the right thing
to do. And if we don't do it now, when will we ever get around to it?
FOREIGN POLICY
</P>
<P>
	   America cannot prevent every conflict or stop every outrage. But where our
interests are at stake and we can make a difference, we must be peacemakers. ...
</P>
<P>
	   The same advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in the palms of our
hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal and easier to use. ...
</P>
<P>
	   In a world where 1.2 billion people live on less than a dollar a day, we
must do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the poorest
countries so they can invest in education, health and economic growth -- as the
pope and other religious leaders have urged. Last year, Congress made a down
payment on America's share. And I ask for your continued support.
ENVIRONMENT
</P>
<P>
	   The greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming.
... Many people in the United States and around the world still believe we can't
cut greenhouse gas pollution without slowing economic growth. In the Industrial
Age that may have been true. In the digital economy, it isn't.
DIVERSITY
</P>
<P>
	   In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority race in America.
In a more interconnected world, this diversity can be our greatest strength. ...
America is stronger for it. But as we have seen, these differences all too often
spark hatred and division, even here at home. ... No American should be
subjected to discrimination in finding a home, getting a job, going to school,
or securing a loan.

	   The president's tax package joined a mix of proposals urged by Republicans
and Democrats as both sides battle for control of Congress and the White House.
Smarting from Clinton's veto of their $792 billion tax-cut package last year,
House Republicans are drafting their own version of educational tax breaks and
marriage penalty relief this year. Presidential candidates have their own
proposals, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called
Clinton's tax cuts too limited. ``We think all Americans deserve tax relief, not
just the handful the president picks,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's tax package would cost $350 billion over 10 years. However,
his plan envisions cutting that price tag by $100 billion by closing tax havens,
shelters and loopholes. Congress has previously rejected many of those ideas on
grounds they are tax increases.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no major foreign policy announcements, although Clinton urged
Congress to give China permanent normal trading relations with the United
States. He also asked for $1.6 billion for Colombia to fight narco-traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the United States must help Russia and China become strong,
prosperous democratic nations. ``Both are behind held back from reaching their
full potential -- Russia by the legacy of communism, economic turmoil, a cruel
and self-defeating war in Chechnya; China by the illusion that it can buy
stability at the expense of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also:
</P>
<P>
	   --Called anew for Medicare to include a prescription drug benefit and to let
people as young as 55 buy Medicare coverage -- this time with a 25 percent tax
credit.
</P>
<P>
	   --Proposed $1 billion in tax incentives for drug makers to develop vaccines
for malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   --Called for doubling spending for after-school and summer school programs
and to expand the Head Start program for needy children to cover 950,000 kids.
</P>
<P>
	   --Offered tax breaks for college costing $30 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expanded the earned income tax credit for the working poor by $21 billion,
and offered a tax credit for long-term care costing $27 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --Proposed a 10-year, $110 billion proposal to provide health coverage to
the parents of children protected by the state Children's Health Insurance
Program. If approved, it would be the largest increase in health coverage in 35
years.

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks 6, Avalanche 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Tony Amonte had two goals and two assists Thursday night as
the Chicago Blackhawks ended a three-game losing streak with a 6-4 victory over
the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
	   Amonte, who hadn't scored in six games, and Doug Gilmour connected 3:37
apart late in the second period to snap a 2-2 tie after the Avalanche had
rebounded from a 2-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Jean-Yves Leroux, Eric Daze and Dean McAmmond also had goals for the
Blackhawks, who handed Colorado only its third loss in 15 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Forsberg, Chris Drury, Aaron Miller and Sandis Ozolinsh scored for the
Avalanche, who were outshot 10-0 by Chicago in the opening seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Leroux strarted the scoring 57 seconds into the game when his shot off a
centering pass from Josef Marha beat goalie Marc Denis. Daze made it 2-0 at
5:22.
</P>
<P>
	   Forsberg cut it to 2-1 with 26 seconds left in the first with a power-play
goal. Drury tied it at 2-all at 10:22 of the second period, but goals by Amonte
and Gilmour late in the period restored Chicago's lead to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
	   On a 2-on-1 break with Martin Skoula, Drury faked a pass and then fooled
Jocelyn Thibault with a low shot just inside the goalpost.
</P>
<P>
	   Amonte's deflection, however, completed a give-and-go with Gilmour to make
it 3-2 with 4:46 left in the second. Gilmour then redirected Boris Mironov's
feed with 1:09 remaining in the period to stretch it to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
	   McAmmond was credited with making it 5-2 at 6:54 of the third. However, it
appeared Amonte's centering pass went in off a Colorado defender.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller cut it to 5-3 at 9:46 on a slap shot from the blue line.
</P>
<P>
	   Amonte scored again with 5:26 left after stealing the puck from Drury.
Ozolinsh completed the scoring with 45.5 seconds left.

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers 102, Magic 90  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM WITHERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Lamond Murray scored 24 points, Shawn Kemp had 20 points
and 14 rebounds and the Cleveland Cavaliers had an unusually easy time Thursday
night in a 102-90 win over the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cavs, playing their second home game following a rough trip to the West,
made 32 free throws to snap Orlando's three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Cedric Henderson added 16 points in his fourth straight double-digit game
for the Cavs, who are hoping to put together a win streak before the All-Star
break to position themselves for a playoff push in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Darrell Armstrong had 21 points and Tariq Abdul-Wahad 17 for the Magic, who
didn't score for two extended stretches in the third quarter when the Cavs built
a 12-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   And for one of the few times this season, Cleveland was able to open a big
lead and finish off the job.
</P>
<P>
	   Kemp, who had fouled out of four of his previous six games, got the Magic in
foul trouble instead.
</P>
<P>
	   He consistently drove the lane on Orlando's frontline defenders and was able
to pick up touch fouls on Charles Outlaw, Chris Gatling and Ben Wallace. Kemp
finished 12-of-15 from the line.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cavs opened the second half with an 8-0 run as the Magic went the first
5:27 without scoring. But just when Cleveland looked like it might take control,
the Cavs went cold from the floor and didn't score for a 4:11 span as Orlando
pullled to 63-59 on Corey Maggette's jumper.
</P>
<P>
	   But Orlando went into another offensive funk, failing to score for another
4:17 as the Cavs opened a 76-64 lead after three.

<HEADLINE> 89-Minute Speech a Clinton Record  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Good thing the lawmakers and guests kept standing up to
clap during President Clinton's State of the Union speech on Thursday night.
Sitting for 89 minutes straight might have been a little uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's final State of the Union address was also his longest -- beating
by eight minutes the record he set in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   On paper, the speech to a joint session of Congress was 200 words shorter
than last year's speech, Clinton said afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought it would be five minutes shorter than last year's speech,''
which ran 77 minutes, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton blamed the overrun on 128 rounds of applause, although his own ad
libs added several dozen words.
</P>
<P>
	   Since taking office in 1993, Clinton's shortest State of the Union speech
was in 1997, at 60 minutes. Last year, the president spoke for 77 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The shortest State of the Union ever was an 833-word written statement from
George Washington. Clinton's text this year ran more than 8,000 words.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is well-known for lingering at the lectern.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, Clinton ignored flashing red lights and other attempts to cut him
off during a presidential nominating speech for Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis. Allotted 15 minutes, Clinton spoke for 32 minutes. The Democratic
National Convention audience applauded when Clinton began a sentence, ``I want
to say, in closing ...''
</P>
<P>
	   The White House warned ahead of time that Clinton might take his time
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rumors of a halftime show are greatly exaggerated,'' press secretary Joe
Lockhart said before the speech.

<HEADLINE> President's invited guests include soccer player, Air Force pilot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The president's guests for Thursday's State of the
Union address included a decorated Air Force pilot, a member of the World
Cup-winning women's soccer team and the father of a teen-ager killed in the
shootings at Columbine High School.
<P>
	   Most of the guests were being seated alongside first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton. One guest, former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, was to take a seat
on the House floor. The president was expected to refer to some of his guests in
the speech, his eighth and final State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   The guests were:
</P>
<P>
	   -Pat Brown of Johnson City, Tenn., a retiree who spends $4,000 of her
savings each year on prescription drugs for heart and thyroid ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   -Ruth Summerlin, an elementary school principal in Beaufort, S.C., who
improved her students' reading and math test scores so dramatically that the
school went from one of South Carolina's 200 worst to a blue-ribbon citation
from the Education Department in five years.
</P>
<P>
	   -Dr. Francis S. Collins, who oversees the federal government's project to
map and sequence all human DNA by 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   -Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minn., who was having trouble paying child
support but now is keeping up with his obligation after enrolling in an
employment and training program.
</P>
<P>
	   -Tom Mauser, father of Columbine victim Daniel Mauser, who has taken a leave
of absence from his job with the Colorado Department of Transportation to
advocate gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   -Bob Knowling Jr. of Santa Clara, Calif., chief executive of Covad
Communications, who is seeking to increase diversity in the field of information
technology.
</P>
<P>
	   -Capt. John Cherrey of Englewood, N.J., who rescued a fellow pilot who was
shot down during the NATO mission in Yugoslavia. Cherrey was awarded the Silver
Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service.
</P>
<P>
	   -Christina Jones of Round Rock, Ariz., a Navajo who volunteers with
Americorps as a tutor for fourth-graders. She plans to teach in her community
after graduation from Dine College.
</P>
<P>
	   -Julie Foudy of Laguna Niguel, Calif., co-captain of the 1999 women's World
Cup soccer team.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert invited an Illinois-area cardinal to the
address as his guest amid a controversy over the rejection of a Roman Catholic
priest to be the House's new chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert denied to reporters earlier Thursday that Cardinal Francis George of
Chicago was in attendance to quell criticism from Catholics. "Cardinal George is
a friend of mine," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The speaker said he was not sure if the cardinal was invited before or after
a brouhaha erupted last month over the rejection of the Rev. Timothy O'Brien, a
Catholic priest from Wisconsin as the House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   Catholics and Democrats have charged that Hastert, R-Ill., and Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, chose the Rev. Charles Parker Wright, a Presbyterian
minister, despite the preference of a bipartisan selection committee for
O'Brien. The House has never had a Catholic chaplain, a post that pays $132,100
a year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presidency Winding Down  </HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At the dawn of the nation, Benjamin Franklin looked at a
painting of a sun low on the horizon and decided it must be rising, President
Clinton told Congress on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   In his final State of the Union speech, he made no reference to the fact
that his own presidency was slowly sinking in the sky.
</P>
<P>
	   Smooth as ever -- except when he talked about encouraging ``liberal''
communities instead if ``livable'' ones -- Clinton told lawmakers there was so
much to do. Left unstated was that he won't be around to do all, or even much,
of it, with less than a year before he's gone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's,'' was his favorite exhortation. ``I ask you,'' he said. ``I implore
you.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must --''
</P>
<P>
	   Longwinded, he outlasted many in his audience.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 50 seats on the Republican side and at least 15 on the Democratic
side emptied before the 89-minute address was done.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind Clinton, as president of the Senate, sat Al Gore, who by this time
next year wants to be president of the United States. In the gallery sat Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who hopes to win a Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
	   They were silent witnesses to Clinton's valedictory to Congress. But since
they came in first, they got ovations of their own, and Clinton plugged each of
them in his remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Not since 1988 had Congress sat for a State of the Union speech from a
president certain to be gone in a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Back then it was Ronald Reagan, in front of a Congress controlled by
Democrats, many of whom had had their fill of the man and his boundless
optimism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The 'feel-good' slogans have gone flat with time,'' West Virginia Sen.
Robert Byrd, then majority leader, said that night. He spoke of the Reagan
administration in the past tense even though it had almost a year to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Mindful that ``it's just one small step from legacy to lame duck,'' as he
recently joked, Clinton tried to make sure he continues to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, for one, wasn't buying it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``President Clinton apparently intends these final months in office to be
spent buffing his image for history,'' he said. ``But the torch is about to be
passed to a new leader, and I believe that most of the old administration's
spending proposals should be, and will be, discreetly discarded.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spoke in circumstances far less perilous than his last State of the
Union speech. That came a month after he was impeached by the House, three weeks
before his acquittal by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, Republican leaders who were either feigning or feeling boredom, and
whose hostility was ill concealed, whispered to each other through the speech
and ignored most ovation lines.
</P>
<P>
	   This year they were lighter on their feet and quicker to clap, and Clinton
made a point of giving them something to applaud for.
</P>
<P>
	   After urging stiffer restrictions on guns, opposed by many Republicans in
Congress, he threw them a bone. He said existing gun laws must be better
enforced -- precisely what the Republicans have been saying to his
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   That brought them to their feet.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside, the Capitol Dome glowed in the biting cold from spotlights that
fell, too, on a hilly expanse of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, a little of the usual luster was missing, with all Supreme Court
justices begging off in a brief note from the court citing travel plans and
minor illnesses but thanking the sergeant of arms for the invitations.
</P>
<P>
	   So, no judicial robes. But there was brass.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's high military leaders listened with their shining shoulder
stars. As is their custom, they applauded tributes from their commander to the
men and women in uniform and sat impassively through his oratory on domestic
policy.

<P>
	   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Freshman DerMarr Johnson scored 21 points -- all in
the first half -- and Kenyon Martin added 14 as No. 1 Cincinnati beat Louisville
75-65 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson, a 6-foot-9 shooting guard, hit his first eight shots, including
five 3-pointers. Martin, a senior center, scored 10 points in the second half as
the Bearcats never let the Cardinals within seven points.
</P>
<P>
	   Pete Mickeal and Kenny Satterfield each added 11 points for the Bearcats
(19-1, 7-0 Conference USA), who won their 11th consecutive game since a 66-64
loss to crosstown-rival Xavier on Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Nate Johnson scored 19 points, Reece Gaines had 11 and Tony Williams 10 for
the Cardinals (11-7, 3-4), who lost for the fourth time in five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati led by as many as 18 points midway through the second half. Ryan
Fletcher's 3-pointer gave the Bearcats a 61-45 lead with 7:20 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   A 9-2 Louisville run cut the margin to nine and forced a Cincinnati timeout
with 4:43 to play. The Cardinals pulled within 67-60 on consecutive 3-pointers
by Williams, but would get no closer.
</P>
<P>
	   Satterfield, Conference USA's assist leader, matched a career-high with 11
and added five rebounds. The Bearcats shot 63 percent (30-of-48) from the field,
including 9-of-19 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   Louisville made 49 percent of its shots (28-of-57), including 7-of-14 from
3-point range, and outrebounded the much taller Bearcats 26-23.
</P>
<P>
	   A 14-2 run, sparked by two 3-pointers by Johnson, put the Bearcats up 35-19
with 3:57 to play in the half. A 9-2 Louisville run cut the margin to 39-27 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati made 15 of 23 first-half shots, including 7 of 10 from 3-point
range.

<HEADLINE> Rise in Margin Debt Spurs Concerns  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Unprecedented levels of margin debt, the amount of money
borrowed by individual investors to purchase stocks, has some analysts concerned
with potential fallout in the event of a market downturn.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a serious subject and it's creating concern because it's really a
measure of investor confidence," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at
Edward Jones, a St. Louis brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you see masses of people doing it at once, it says the crowd thinks
there's very little chance that stocks are going to go down. But we know from
history that stock markets aren't a one-way street," he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is expressing concern about the
level of margin debt, saying Wednesday during testimony before the Senate that
the central bank is studying the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans had borrowed $228.5 billion to buy stock as of Dec. 31, 1999, up
from $141 billion a year earlier -- a 62 percent jump, according to Ned Davis
Research, a Venice, Fla., market data firm. In 1990, the figure stood at around
$35 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Borrowing accelerated rapidly in the last months of 1999, when the
technology-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market was surging upward at an unprecedented
rate, said Sam Burns, a research analyst at Ned Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerns have surfaced over the buying on margin because a significant
market downturn could wipe out hundreds of thousands of debt-ridden investors
and exacerbate a widespread selling panic.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's how the scenario could unfold, Burns said:
</P>
<P>
	   Investors borrow money to buy stock in the hope that the stock will increase
in value.
</P>
<P>
	   The stock purchased on margin is used as collateral against the value of the
loan.
</P>
<P>
	   If the stock goes up, everyone's happy because the investor can use the
profits to pay back the borrowed money plus interest charged by the lender --
usually the investor's broker.
</P>
<P>
	   But if the stock price falls, thus lowering the value of the lender's
collateral, the lender can make what's known as a margin call, which requires
the borrower to put up more cash to ensure that the loan is repaid in full.
</P>
<P>
	   Margin calls are usually covered by selling the stock purchased on margin,
and that's where things get sticky, according to Burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Should U.S. stock markets stumble at some point, hundreds of thousands of
margin investors would likely sell stock into an already falling market to pay
back their margin loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Those margin-related sales would only contribute to a selling panic, Burns
explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Many historians blame the 1929 stock market crash on widespread margin
buying among investors who were then forced to sell stock to pay back their
loans when the market tanked.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve Board, which regulates margin borrowing, currently
requires investors to have at least $2,000 in a trading account to buy on
margin. In addition, investors are limited to purchasing $2 of stock for every
$1 in their account.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Greenspan said the Federal Reserve was reluctant to exercise
its authority to tighten limits on such borrowing, saying that studies have
suggested that a rising level of stock prices is unrelated to liberal margin
requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, which oversees the Nasdaq stock market, are seeking changes that would
increase to $25,000 the minimum amount some active traders need to keep in their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The move is designed to ensure that investors who want to borrow money to
buy stocks have plenty of collateral to pay back their debts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commissions is also discussing the issue with
the Fed, the NYSE and the NASD, said spokesman Chris Ullman, "to get their
perspectives on what is the actual margin situation."
</P>
<P>
	   But not everyone supports the changes.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Tappan, the co-founder of MTrader.com, an educational online site for
active traders, said margin borrowing has traditionally allowed small investors
an opportunity to take a larger stake in the markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very valuable tool because it provides leverage," Tappan said.
"Without it, you're playing against a stacked deck."
</P>
<P>
	   Small investor advocates frequently complain that the markets are biased in
favor of large, institutional investors such as pension and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Tappan acknowledged that certain investors, such as day traders, accept
tremendous risks when they borrow money to speculate on the markets. Day traders
buy and sell thousands of shares, betting on the movement of the stock to make
money.
</P>
<P>
	   The practice of borrowing money to day trade came under scrutiny last July
when debt-ridden trader Mark Barton killed nine people at two Atlanta brokerage
firms.

<HEADLINE> Analysts: Coke Still Good Investment  </HEADLINE>
    By CHAD ROEDEMEIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Ronald Greenburg bought 100 shares of the Coca-Cola Co. in
1988 because he heard investor Warren Buffett was buying $1 billion worth.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenburg, a 50-year-old from Steubenville, Ohio, who works in the diamond
business, continued to buy shares of Coca-Cola over the next 12 years. And now,
even after the worst 18 months in company history, Greenburg's faith in Big Red
is unshaken.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't judge a good company by a few awkward quarters," Greenburg said.
"I feel that way so much."
</P>
<P>
	   Investor uncertainty has hit Coke's stock hard recently. But some analysts
say the company remains a good choice for people who invest for the long term.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke has suffered through three tough years and Wednesday said it was
eliminating 6,000 jobs -- more than one-fifth of its work force.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke shares have since fallen nearly 10 percent, trading Thursday at $59.50
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   But Douglas Lane, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in New York, calls the
market response "an overreaction."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Lane said he is encouraging investors to buy Coke stock now -- not
only for its long-term potential, but because he expects Coke to bounce back
soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Lane said the job cuts put Coca-Cola back on course after nearly two years
of falling profits and image problems. He expects a more efficient Coca-Cola to
resume its strong growth toward the end of this year and into 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not the time to be looking in the rear-view mirror at Coke," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Phil Larkins, who manages money for wealthy clients at Atlanta-based Legacy
South, said none of his clients have called him about getting rid of their Coke
holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given the premier global distribution network they have, and given the fact
that it's the No. 1 recognized brand name in the world, it still has a certain
comfort level for long-term investors," Larkins said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   But there is still some uncertainty. Incoming CEO Doug Daft indicated that
long-term growth goals have been too ambitious, and the company will not give
details on its new strategic plan for another six months.
</P>
<P>
	   Without some further clarity from the company, short-term investors are
likely to stay away, analysts said. That could come as early as today, when Coke
executives travel to New York for a briefing for analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   The company suffered a string of setbacks during the last 18 months,
including a severe economic downturn in Asian markets, a discrimination lawsuit
filed by a group of minority employees and a costly product recall and two
failed takeover bids in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest job cutback in Coke's 113-year-history, announced Wednesday,
will affect 2,500 positions at the company's Atlanta headquarters, 800 elsewhere
in the United States and 2,700 outside the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The reorganization is aimed at reducing control from Atlanta and giving more
power to managers around the world. Some stock analysts said the job cuts were a
tacit admission by Coke that it had become bloated and overinvested in some
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Coke estimated that the job cuts will save $300 million a year, but said
earnings would be reduced by $800 million before taxes this year to the cover
costs of the realignment.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Swanson, an analyst for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, said the job cuts
will let the company react more efficiently to changes in the global economy. He
said its stock price will improve as the economy improves in other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their bottom line performance is very tied to the global economy," Swanson
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The move may have been good for investors, but it hit employees hard.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's very low morale and a lot of questions," Coke employee Camille
Martin said Thursday outside the company's gated compound. "There's a lot of
fixing up this company has to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Martin voluntarily turned in her resignation notice two months ago, but
said her co-workers in the accounting department will not find out who loses
their jobs for another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Coca-Cola is one of Atlanta's most prominent companies, the job
cuts should not hurt the booming local economy, said Don Ratajczak, director of
economic forecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "How significant is this layoff to Atlanta's economy? Psychologically, it's
huge; economically, it's small," Ratajczak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca-Cola barely sneaks into the top 20 employers in the city, Ratajczak
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last 12 months, Atlanta created 115,000 jobs -- more jobs than all of
New England created in the same time period, Ratajczak said. With an
unemployment rate of only 2.6 percent, the displaced workers from Coke should
have little trouble finding jobs.

<HEADLINE> Chase Privacy Pact May Prompt Trend  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that financial titan Chase Manhattan Corp. has agreed
to ask account holders before selling their names to outside marketers, will
other banks offer similar privacy protections to lure customers?
</P>
<P>
	   Don't bank on it.
</P>
<P>
	   Most big banks aren't ready to do that, and it might ultimately be up to
states to compel them to tighten their privacy practices, a consumer advocate
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Chase can do it, that means other banks can do it," Frank Torres,
legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said about the new settlement agreement
between Chase and New York state's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
	   However, he added, most big banks remain strongly opposed to this type of
privacy requirement. Under the agreement, Chase must have written consent from
account holders before it can sell or share their data with outside marketers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, financial institutions are concerned about recent privacy
enforcement actions against banks by several states as well as an initiative by
some states to enact new privacy laws that are stricter than federal
requirements Congress established in November.
</P>
<P>
	   "The states are fully engaged," said John Byrne, senior counsel for the
American Bankers Association. Banks around the country are "taking stock of
their privacy procedures," he said. "Some banks will decide on their own to go
beyond the mandated procedures ... if that's what their customers want to see."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the settlement accord announced Tuesday by Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer in Albany, N.Y., Chase agreed to stop providing outside marketers with
the credit line and balance information of customers. As many as 22 million
consumers had been affected. Chase, the nation's third-largest bank holding
company, has some $370 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
	   The case "really demonstrates the need for legislation that protects
consumers from having their personal, sensitive financial information
distributed outside of the bank," said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of
the American Civil Liberties Union. "I hope other banks follow (Chase) but I'm
not optimistic."
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattan-based Chase agreed not to share any customer data with outside
marketers, such as telemarketers, without customers' express written consent.
Even in cases where customers do give their permission, Chase agreed to provide
only their names, addresses and telephone numbers to the marketing firms, but
not any financial data.
</P>
<P>
	   This is stricter than the privacy provision in the new federal law, which
allows banks and other financial institutions to share customers' data with
outside firms unless customers expressly ask them not to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   The financial services industry had opposed even this more lenient
requirement. It won the right in the legislation for banks, securities firms and
insurance companies that are affiliated under the same corporate roof to share
customers' data. Customers are unable to stop such sharing by affiliated
financial companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The case involving Chase arose from an investigation by Spitzer's office
into allegations that the bank had provided customer information to marketers in
violation of its own privacy policy as disclosed to consumers. The data it
shared was said to have included encrypted account numbers and loan data.
</P>
<P>
	   The marketing firms used the information to phone Chase customers to try
selling them emergency road service plans, discount shopping clubs, legal
services, travel clubs, garden supplies and magazine subscriptions. Chase
received a commission on successful sales.
</P>
<P>
	   While it agreed to the settlement, Chase denied any wrongdoing. State
officials said they hadn't accused the bank of anything illegal, but they
promised to pursue similar enforcement actions against other financial
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Schmermund, a spokesman for America's Community Bankers, suggested
that privacy policies could be "a very effective tool" for banks to market
themselves to consumers and retain customers.
</P>
<P>
	   But Byrne said his group "would not want to see banks competing against one
another on the basis of privacy protections."
</P>
<P>
	   It would be "self-defeating" for banks to claim they had stricter privacy
policies than rival institutions, Byrne maintained. Attractive prices and a
variety of services should remain the basis for competition, he said.

Clinton Proposes Tax Cut, New Spending
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his last State of the Union address, President Clinton
Thursday night proposed a $350 billion tax cut, big spending increases for
schools and health care and photo ID licenses for handgun purchases. He called
for passage of a patients' bill of rights to strengthen consumer protection,
campaign finance reform, and an increase in the minimum wage. Republicans
ridiculed Clinton's proposals but did not rule out working with him on such
issues as education and health care. "If we enacted all the new programs the
president has talked about, we'd spend just about the entire surplus on bigger

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Said To Need More Than Cuts  </HEADLINE>
    By KATHY GAMBRELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Defense industry analysts said they doubt the 2,800
layoffs announced by Lockheed Martin will be enough to help the defense
contractor's troubled aeronautics and space divisions.
</P>
<P>
	   Analyst Joseph Campbell of Lehman Brothers called Lockheed's effort to
downsize "important steps in the right direction, but lots more to go."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is part of a thousand little things they need to do," Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plans for a 2 percent reduction in a work force of 140,000 were
announced Thursday and follow a series of disappointments and losses. The
company said the cuts would generate $200 million in annual savings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bethesda-based company was expected to release its fourth-quarter and
year-end earnings today. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial
estimated the company would earn 59 cents a share for the quarter and $1.49 a
share for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Nisbet of JSA Research Inc., said Lockheed will have to do more than
adjust the size of its work force, but said that reducing some layers of
management would allow "better communication between workers and the front
office".
</P>
<P>
	   The majority of those savings will be achieved in the Aeronautical Systems
business, which would be consolidated into a single unit to be called Lockheed
Martin Aeronautics Co., headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and headed by Dain
Hancock, a Lockheed Martin executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2,500 job cuts in the aeronautics division will come in approximately
equal measure from the company's three primary sites in Georgia, California and
Texas, the company said. Additional personnel reductions of 2,000 people
previously announced for the Marietta, Ga., facility, bring the total workforce
reduction to 4,500 in that sector.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the Space Systems business will establish a new Lockheed Martin
Space Systems Co. in Denver that will be led by Albert Smith, another executive
vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palmdale, Calif., site would continue advanced development initiatives.
The Fort Worth and Marietta, Ga., facilities will focus on aircraft production
and assembly, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Four sub-assembly plants in Clarksburg, West Va.; Johnstown, Pa.; Meridian,
Miss., and Pinellas, Fla. will report to the new Lockheed Martin Aeronautics
Company.
</P>
<P>
	   "These actions are the direct result of our continuing drive to improve our
customer focus, flatten our management structure and enhance our financial
performance," said Vance Coffman, chairman and chief executive officer of
Lockheed Martin. "They will result in real savings and ensure greater
flexibility allowing us to successfully adapt to changing market conditions,
maintain the level of program execution our customers expect, while improving
our ability to react to new business opportunities."
</P>
<P>
	   Peter B. Teets, Lockheed's president and chief operating officer stepped
down last year, taking responsibility for disappointing financial results which
led the defense contractor to slash its earnings estimates for this year by more
than half.
</P>
<P>
	   James "Mickey" Blackwell also left as head of aeronautical systems, which
makes the F-16 jet fighter and was the poorest performer last year among
Lockheed's four core businesses.

<HEADLINE> Canada Probed Bombing Suspect  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- Canada's intelligence agency said Thursday it had
investigated a man now reportedly in custody in Senegal for involvement in an
alleged terrorist bombing plot in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Another man implicated in the alleged plot, Ahmed Ressam, pleaded innocent
in federal court in Seattle on Thursday to charges of involvement in the alleged
plot.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam, an Algerian, was arrested Dec. 14 for allegedly trying to smuggle
bomb-making components from Canada into the United States. Three other Algerian
nationals and a woman married to an Algerian are in custody, and police in the
United States and Canada are searching for another Algerian.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times reported Thursday that Mohambedou Ould Slahi was arrested
in Senegal at the request of U.S. authorities who suspect him of organizing the
bomb plot. It said no charges have been filed, but that the United States would
seek Slahi's extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Times report, Slahi's brother-in-law is a top lieutenant of
Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden is one of 18 people indicted in the
United States on charges of conspiracy to attack Americans in the 1998 bombings
of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12
Americans. Bin Laden is believed to be in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, a law enforcement official who requested anonymity said
investigators were not sure whether Slahi was a major figure in the bomb plot or
merely a messenger. The official also said U.S. investigators are unsure if
Slahi's brother-in-law is a key Bin Laden aide.
</P>
<P>
	   No specific evidence has been released that shows bin Laden was behind the
alleged bombing plot and authorities have not said what the targets might have
been.
</P>
<P>
	   Slahi was in Canada before going to Senegal, said Dan Lambert, spokesman for
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. Sometime after Ressam's Dec. 14
arrest, Slahi left ``due, in part, to the investigation that was ongoing,''
Lambert said. He declined to provide any details of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The secretary of a Montreal mosque where Slahi stayed described him as a
devout Muslim who led prayers every day. Bahaa Elbatal said Slahi moved into the
Assunna mosque early in the month and stayed until Jan. 21, when he presumably
left the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never felt he was a dangerous person,'' Elbatal said.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior government official in Senegal and an officer at the central police
station in Dakar told The Associated Press Friday they knew nothing of Slahi's
detention.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. official in Senegal declined to comment. Another U.S. official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the situation was sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   Little was revealed about Slahi, a citizen of Mauritania, but investigators
told the Times he was in constant contact with a construction company in Sudan
that was owned by bin Laden and was a front for bin Laden's international
organization, al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, Slahi traveled to Montreal, where he worked closely with Mokhtar
Haouri, one of the Algerians charged with helping Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   American officials said there are other emerging links between the bomb plot
and bin Laden. One involves Hamid Aich, an Algerian who lived for three years in
a Vancouver suburb where he shared an apartment with Abdelmajid Dahoumane, the
Times said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dahoumane, accused of being Ressam's accomplice, remains at large.
</P>
<P>
	   Irish police said they arrested Aich on Dec. 21 and seized personal papers
and computer records. They released him the following day, and gave the seized
material to the FBI for analysis, Superintendent John Farrelly said.
</P>
<P>
	   In France, judicial sources said Thursday that a Paris court had opened an
inquiry last week against a person or persons for ``criminal association in
relation to a terrorist operation.'' They did not identify the target of the
investigation, but said it followed the Ressam arrest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   A French anti-terrorism judge went to the United States earlier this month
to lead the inquiry, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Teen Smoking Down  </HEADLINE>
   By RUSS BYNUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Smoking among high schoolers dropped in 1999 for the first
time since the government began keeping track at the start of the decade. But
nearly one in 10 children have already smoked cigarettes by middle school.
</P>
<P>
	   A nationwide survey of 7,529 high schoolers in September and October found
that 28.4 percent reported smoking cigarettes in the preceding month, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, the last time the CDC looked at high school smoking, 36.4 percent
of students said they had smoked in the preceding month. At the time, teen
smoking was on the rise, from 34.8 percent in 1995 and 27.5 percent in 1991, the
first year the CDC started keeping track.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC said it expected teen smoking rates to drop -- just not by so much.
The agency said differences between the 1999 survey and earlier studies may have
exaggerated the decline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We may have peaked in terms of smoking rates among high school students,''
said Michael Eriksen, director of the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health.
</P>
<P>
	   The drop in smoking rates had been expected because tobacco companies raised
cigarette prices about 45 cents a pack last year to help pay for the $206
billion national settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the settlement, billboard ads for cigarettes were banned and the
tobacco industry was barred from running advertisements with cartoon characters
such as Joe Camel that anti-smoking activists say are aimed at youngsters. In
many places, cigarette billboards have been replaced by signs with anti-smoking
messages.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time ever, the CDC also surveyed middle school students about
smoking, questioning about as many middle-schoolers as high school students.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine percent of the students in grades six through eight said they had
smoked cigarettes. Nearly 13 percent said they had used some tobacco product --
including chewing tobacco, pipes and cigars.

	   ``I don't think it was that surprising, because we see such high rates in
high school that we know it begins in middle school. We just didn't know at what
level,'' Eriksen said.

	   Ron Todd, director of tobacco control for the American Cancer Society,
agreed that higher cigarette prices should result in fewer smokers of high
school age. But he said the CDC's numbers surprised him.

	   ``I wouldn't expect a decline that dramatic,'' Todd said. ``We'll have to
continually monitor it to get a better picture of what's really going on.''

	   The questions used in the surveys and the one in 1997 were the same, said
Wick Warren, a CDC statistician. But response rates varied. About 90 percent of
schools responded to the 1999 tobacco survey. The earlier surveys, which also
included questions about sex, got responses from about 75 percent of schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also found that the wide gap in smoking rates between white and
black high school students does not exist among middle-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
	   The proportion of blacks smoking in high school was nearly 16 percent --
half the percentage of white smokers. But in middle school, both racial groups
were about 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Though it is too soon to tell, this could signal the end of a 25-year trend
in which blacks started smoking later than whites.
</P>
<P>
	   Two trendy types of imported cigarettes -- bidis and kreteks -- are being
smoked by about 5 percent of high schoolers and 2 percent of middle-schoolers.
That makes them almost as popular as chewing tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   Bidis are skinny, unfiltered Indian cigarettes that come in flavors such as
vanilla. Kreteks are a kind of clove cigarette.
