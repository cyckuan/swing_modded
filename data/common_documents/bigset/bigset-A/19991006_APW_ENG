<HEADLINE> Titans' McNair Eager To Get Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Steve McNair isn't a patient man.  
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee Titans quarterback has watched the success of his  
team on television while he recuperates from back surgery. He's 
happy they're 3-1, but it's the watching and waiting he can do 
without. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy sitting and watching your team go to war, and  
you're not in there. It's hard sitting at home. It's something I'm 
not used to, and I don't plan on getting used to it,'' McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair started 34 consecutive games for Tennessee before  
reinjuring his back at practice on Sept. 17. Two days later, 
doctors repaired a ruptured disc just hours before backup Neil 
O'Donnell stepped in and led the Titans to a 26-9 victory over the 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	While McNair has spent the past two Sundays on his couch  
watching the Titans, O'Donnell has become the AFC's third-rated 
passer with a 92.4 rating behind New England's Drew Bledsoe and 
Seattle's Jon Kitna. The man signed to a one-year contract just 
before training camp to back up McNair has led Tennessee to an 
upset victory at Jacksonville and nearly rallied the Titans before 
losing 24-22 at San Francisco last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair can't remember the last time he sat out a game due to  
injury. He almost got too excited watching the Jacksonville game 
and found himself yelling a couple of times. It was a little easier 
watching the loss to the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neil has stepped in and is doing a great job,'' McNair said.  
``It's more fun sitting out with them winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a man who has played through a variety of injuries the past  
two seasons, McNair's biggest problem now is not pushing his 
rehabilitation. He started Monday with a series of exercises 
designed to strengthen his stomach and back muscles, and he has to 
work himself up to the point where he can toss a ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Fisher said that might be a couple weeks away.  
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, things should really speed up. But these two  
weeks are really critical. He needs to take this step by step,'' 
Fisher said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	When McNair went down, Fisher told O'Donnell to make his  
decision tough when McNair is ready to return to the lineup. 
McNair, who threw for a career-high 341 yards in his only game this 
season, said he hopes to improve quickly enough to return before 
the target date of Oct. 31 against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very rough for me. I'm learning to deal with it. I've  
just got to hurry up and get well,'' McNair said. ``But this is a 
process you can't rush. I want to be out there and contributing to 
help this team do what it's been doing the past four weeks.''

<HEADLINE> Abbott Labs Accused of Price Fixing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Abbott Laboratories is accused of price-fixing in  
a lawsuit filed over practices involving a drug used to treat high 
blood pressure and prostate trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed yesterday in Cook County Circuit Court by  
United Wisconsin Services Inc. and several other health insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	It alleges that Abbott abused its patent on the drug Hytrin and  
prevented competition from generic drugs. The North Chicago-based 
company sells $540 million worth of Hytrin each year, the lawsuit 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott officials declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Abbott, whose manufacturing processes have come under  
recent scrutiny, announced that a former federal regulator will 
help oversee its quality control efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael G. Beatrice, formerly with the U.S Food and Drug  
Administration, will work with Marcia Thomas, whose duties involve 
Abbott's troubled diagnostic unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatrice and Thomas will both deal with the FDA, which is  
investigating how the pharmaceutical company manufactures medical 
test kits. The kits are placed into hospital and laboratory 
diagnostic machines and used to measure patient drug and disease 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott has said it has been advised by the FDA that the agency  
could order the company to halt production of the kits. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott last year was forced to suspend shipments of its  
clot-busting drug Abbokinase after an FDA investigation.

<HEADLINE> Safeco Pulls Sponsorship of Classic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Safeco Corp. said Wednesday it will discontinue  
sponsorship of the Safeco Classic, the longest continuously 
sponsored tournament on the LPGA tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance company said the decision to discontinue  
sponsorship after 18 years stemmed partly from a shift in its 
marketing focus from regional to national that followed its 
acquisition of American States Financial Corp. As part of that 
focus, Safeco paid about $40 million for naming rights to the 
Seattle Mariners' new baseball stadium, Safeco Field.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rescue Team Saves Lives Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- In the span of about a month, members of the  
elite Urban Search and Rescue team saw more death and destruction 
than most people could ever imagine. 
</P>
<P>
	They waded through rubble and debris from earthquakes that  
buried thousands of people in Turkey and Taiwan in hopes of finding 
survivors. In the end, they found just five -- and that was enough 
to make the trips worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving someone's life, that's the most rewarding thing you can  
do,'' said Dan Bickham, manager of the team's rescue units. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairfax County's search and rescue team is comprised of local  
firefighters and is one of two U.S. rescue squads that responds to 
earthquakes. About 70 of the 135 members are sent abroad, and 
competition to become a team member is fierce. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairfax County became involved because of its proximity to  
Washington and because it had developed a rescue team in the 1980s 
to handle construction accidents in the burgeoning Washington 
suburbs. The U.S. government pays the expenses -- exceeding $1 
million per trip -- and covers overtime costs for firefighters who 
stay home. 
</P>
<P>
	Most firefighters are used to dealing with the knowledge that  
they could be rushed into harm's way at a moment's notice. In 
Fairfax County, the next phone call could send them half a world 
away, to a hellish scene of destruction, death and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	Team members were still recuperating from their mission to  
Turkey when they got news that a quake had rocked Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we go,'' thought team leader Mike Tamillow.  
</P>
<P>
	The team was activated at Sept. 20 and was in the air with  
56,000 pounds of equipment about 11 hours later. The team is 
designed to be self-sufficient for 10 days, a necessity in disaster 
zones. 
</P>
<P>
	The team rescues people pinned beneath tons of concrete, people  
who otherwise would die alone in the dark. They saved four lives 
from the Aug. 16 quake in Turkey that killed 16,000 people, and one 
person from the Sept. 21 temblor in Taiwan, where thousands died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went three days with two hours of sleep in Turkey,''  
recalled team member Andy Hubert. ``It was chaos. Every time we 
turned around somebody was coming up saying someone else was buried 
nearby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert and his teammates don't like to talk about the corpses,  
the desperate cries. What drives them is talking about ``the 
saves,'' like the team's first: an elderly woman trapped in the 
1988 earthquake in Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember it like it was yesterday,'' he said. ``I'll never  
forget the look on her face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the five recent saves and two in the Armenian  
earthquake, the team rescued a man in the Philippines following a 
quake there. In Oklahoma City and after the U.S. embassy bombing in 
Kenya, the team recovered nothing but corpses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, we'll never get a large number of saves,''  
Bickham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Team members attend group discussions with family members and  
counselors after returning from abroad. Private counseling -- paid 
for by the government -- also is available. But the stress has 
proved too much for some, and a handful of members have dropped out 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hardest on our families. Everything comes to a screeching  
halt,'' Tamillow said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's first mission was the Armenian earthquake, which  
killed 25,000. The team got little direction from unprepared 
officials in the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamillow recalled trying to coordinate rescue plans with Soviet  
officials. The Soviets appeared overwhelmed, and a bottle of vodka 
sat on a table in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was otherworldly,'' Tamillow said.  
</P>
<P>
	From that mission, its international role began.  
</P>
<P>
	``From our lessons there, we worked to develop a more systematic  
approach,'' said Pete Bradford of the Office of U.S. Foreign 
Disaster Assistance, which works with the Fairfax team. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has since developed an international search  
and rescue committee to establish international procedures. A team 
in Dade County, Fla., also responds to international disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is always, how do we do it lighter, cheaper and  
without delay?'' said Chuck Mills of the National Association for 
Search and Rescue in Chantilly. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their efforts, the men are reluctant to accept praise.  
</P>
<P>
	``As far as being heroes, we are just husbands and fathers, and  
we would want others to work just as hard to save our families,'' 
Bickham said.

<HEADLINE> Air Guard Leaves for Polar Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTIA, N.Y. (AP) -- Two National Guard cargo planes took off for  
the South Pole on Wednesday to pick up a 47-year-old doctor who 
discovered a lump in her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerri Nielsen, the only physician at the South Pole research  
station, is believed to have been treating herself with 
chemotherapy since mid-July, when drugs and medical equipment were 
air-dropped for her in a risky emergency flight during the middle 
of the howling Antarctic winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Science Foundation, which operates the research  
station, would not release any information about Ms. Nielsen's 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	A replacement doctor is also on the flight and will be left at  
the domed research station, said foundation spokesman Peter West. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the polar darkness and extreme cold, flights cannot  
take off or land at the South Pole station from March through 
October. The sun rose over the continent in mid-September, and now 
that things are beginning to warm up, the conditions are safer. 
</P>
<P>
	A trip had been scheduled for Oct. 25, but West said waiting  
would have not guaranteed better weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The two C-130 aircraft left for McMurdo Station on the edge of  
Antarctica to wait for weather conditions that would allow the 
final, 800-mile leg of the trip, said Maj. Robert Bullock of the 
New York National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take five days to reach McMurdo. One plane will then  
continue on when weather permits and the other will be on stand-by, 
Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because temperatures will be about 65 degrees below zero, the  
plane will stay on the ground at the South Pole only long enough to 
pick up Ms. Nielsen and drop off the other doctor and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving for Antarctica last November, Nielsen lived in  
the Youngstown, Ohio, area. Her assignment at the station was to 
have ended in November.

<HEADLINE> The Artists: Maruch Santiz Gomez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For years, the green highlands of southern  
Mexico were reddened with blood as Zapatista rebels battled the 
government for the rights of poor Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the gunshots in Chiapas, one young woman found a separate  
peace: She pointed a camera lens away from death, capturing instead 
the life in her village -- the people, animals and objects she 
loved. 
</P>
<P>
	But Maruch Santiz Gomez is doing more: The 24-year-old mother of  
two is helping rescue the Mayan oral tradition from oblivion, with 
images and words that illustrate the beliefs of her elders. 
</P>
<P>
	Though she first held a camera only six years ago, her testament  
to the Mayan way has made her an internationally known 
photographer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found her photos so startling, so postmodern -- these odd  
objects in the middle of open spaces in the village,'' says Carlota 
Duarte, an American artist and photographer who first taught Maruch 
-- as she's universally known -- to use a camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Maruch recently made her New York debut with a solo show at an  
elegant gallery off Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	With her baby sleeping in a knotted shawl on her back, the  
artist greeted visitors cradling glasses filled with wine. 
</P>
<P>
	Her vision of everyday life in Mexico's poorest state has been  
critically acclaimed in galleries from England, Germany and Iceland 
to the Netherlands, South Africa and Spain. Harvard and Stanford 
universities both have displayed her work. 
</P>
<P>
	A book titled ``Creencias'' (``Beliefs'') features her haunting  
images from Romerillo, a hamlet of about 300 people where she lives 
in a wooden plank house with a dirt floor and no running water. She 
cooks on an open fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Spanish, Maruch says that she wants ``to rescue and  
maintain our ancient culture and our mother tongue'' -- her Mayan 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	She begins with images close to the earth: pottery, a log, a  
fire, a child, a pig. 
</P>
<P>
	They come with curious bits of ancient Mayan advice passed on  
from the elders in the Chamula Indian community. For example, the 
picture of a person asleep while a hand holds a sandal over him is 
accompanied by the words: ``If someone snores a lot, you can hit 
him lightly on the nose with a sandal or insert a little lizard's 
tail up one nostril.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's important to save these traditions, Maruch says. ``These  
words have never been written down, and no one has ever taken 
photographs of them. The new generation doesn't speak much of these 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her recent New York exhibit at the Mexican Cultural Institute  
off Madison Avenue brought prices of up to $800 for each 
black-and-white photo -- a fortune for a young woman who lives in 
the Chiapas highlands near the southern city of San Cristobal de 
las Casas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very moved that they treated me with respect,'' she  
says. Gallery visitors ``were very clean, nicely dressed, and I 
felt a little ashamed of my own simplicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the earnings, she and her husband are now buying the  
taxicab he drives. But money is not her motive. 
</P>
<P>
	In a state moving forward fast -- there's now a cybercafe in San  
Cristobal -- Maruch is keeping alive her ancestors' beliefs ``so 
that they do not disappear,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, cameras that recorded Mexico's Maya Indians were  
usually held by hands several skin tones lighter than those shown 
on the film. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are people who have often been depicted as quaint,  
picturesque, romantic,'' says Duarte. ``They're modern and very 
real, and I wanted to empower them to take their place in the 
world. Photography is a strong carrier of information, and why 
should other people present the information about them?'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Duarte in 1992 started the Chiapas  
Photography Project, which teaches indigenous people to record 
their own world. Having heard of the project by word of mouth, men 
and women of all ages come to learn to click a camera shutter. Some 
travel all day by bus from remote villages, Indian peasants who 
wear no shoes and speak no Spanish. Others live in cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave people access to tools and materials. And I gave them  
only technical information -- how you hold the camera and so on -- 
not a standard of what makes a good photo,'' says Duarte, who calls 
the budding photographers her ``colleagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At first, they use disposable cameras, recycling even those  
while their color film is processed in local shops. 
</P>
<P>
	One photographer stood out -- a teen-ager named Maruch, who had  
once spent her days herding her family's sheep. 
</P>
<P>
	As she snapped away with a manual 35 mm camera years ago, Maruch  
noticed that Duarte's automatic one was more practical. She wanted 
it, telling her, ``Every time I get focused, an animal runs into 
the picture. And I have to start all over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So they made a deal: Maruch would weave Duarte a Mayan shawl in  
return for a Fuji 35 mm automatic camera she uses to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	Being a photographer comes with a price: ``The women in the  
village speak ill of me, saying I'm not a good wife. They say I 
should stay at home, spin wool and weave, take care of the babies, 
prepare meals and wash the clothes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, adds Maruch, ``I've been to other places where men  
sometimes fix the meals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mayan admonitions that accompany her photos ``speak to the  
profound human need and desire to control the vagaries of life,'' 
explains Duarte. And they're an antidote to the harsh lives that 
unfold close to nature -- and close to the bloody five-year civil 
war between Zapatista guerrillas and the Mexican government. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to doing family chores, Maruch works at the  
project's Indigenous Photography Archive in San Cristobal, which 
has thousands of pictures taken by about 150 Mayan photographers. 
Some are in a book titled ``Camaristas,'' a word derived from 
``camera'' that project participants invented to describe 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of the photographs are of domestic activity, the  
families' experiences, their fields, their animals, their 
celebrations,'' says Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
	She says the native photographers are paid -- albeit only about  
10 cents in pesos per photo -- ``because we want to respect people's 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born to a Mexican father and an American mother, Duarte says her  
mixed roots helped her set a special artistic goal for the project: 
``Seeing what kind of images might be created by people who had 
free use of a camera and no familiarity with the history of 
photography. I wasn't there as a colonizer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The project came about almost accidentally after she visited  
Chiapas several times as a tourist from Boston, where she had 
taught college and produced a book of her own photographs. Drawn by 
the Mayan culture, she remained for eight years. Duarte holds dual 
Mexican and U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the 55-year-old artist funded the project with her own  
money and contributions from friends. Now the Ford Foundation gives 
$17,000 yearly for six staffers and the training programs. Despite 
private donations for other needs, it's a struggle from year to 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to give people a voice, when society or circumstances  
have denied them that opportunity,'' says Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
	She remembers ``standing next to people who were trembling  
because they'd never used a telephone before. Now we have people 
using cameras, computers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maruch has no intention of leaving Chiapas.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither does Duarte.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to stay here till I die,'' the artist says.

<HEADLINE> American Home To Cut 700 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, N.J. (AP) -- American Home Products Corp. will eliminate  
about 700 jobs in its Cyanamid Agricultural Products division, or 
about 13 percent of the unit's worldwide work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts disclosed today are included in a wide-ranging  
restructuring of the Cyanamid unit, which is headquartered in 
Parsippany. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, AHP officials said they are trying to make their  
manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts more efficient. They 
also will make changes to the unit's research operations and buy 
back a portion of its soybean herbicide inventory from the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyback results from distribution changes and comes while  
the company is preparing to launch a new soybean herbicide for the 
2000 season. The repurchase will cost the company $330 million, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The eliminated positions represent 13 percent of the Cyanamid  
workforce, which totals 5,500 worldwide. About 2,300 employees are 
in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will close four U.S. regional administrative sales  
offices by the end of 1999, said AHP spokesman Lowell Weiner. Those 
offices are in Denver, Indianapolis, Des Moines, Iowa, and Memphis, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP did not immediately release the number of employees who work  
at those offices. Weiner said layoffs -- and possibly other office 
closings -- would occur worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring costs will be reflected as a special charge in  
the company's third-quarter earnings.

<HEADLINE> Angry DH Skips Workout, Leaves Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Boston Red Sox designated hitter Reggie  
Jefferson, who has a .300 career batting average, left the team 
after being omitted from the postseason roster because manager Jimy 
Williams wanted more versatility. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson was at Jacobs Field Tuesday but did not participate in  
the team's workout before tonight's opener of the best-of-5 
division series against the Indians. Afterward, he spoke with 
general manager Dan Duquette in the lobby of the team hotel, then 
left Cleveland, team spokesman Kevin Shea said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe reported that Jefferson and Duquette had an  
argument Tuesday night, but Shea denied that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a confrontation. It wasn't a shouting match,'' Shea  
said. ``Dan saw him in the lobby and Dan just asked him, `You sure 
you want to let your teammates down by leaving the club?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Herald, quoting a source close to the player,  
reported today that Jefferson had packed his bags and left 
Cleveland. Jefferson did not comment before departing. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Red Sox advance to the second round, the roster could  
change. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Williams decided to keep infielders Lou Merloni and  
Donnie Sadler because of recent injuries to shortstop Nomar 
Garciaparra and third baseman John Valentin, who are ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Merloni and Sadler can play several positions, while Jefferson,  
a mediocre fielder, started all his 83 games as a DH and played in 
two of them at first base. He hit .277 in 206 at bats with five 
homers and 17 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston also kept two other potential lefty DHs, catcher Scott  
Hatteberg and first baseman Brian Daubach. The Red Sox have two 
potential righty DHs, first baseman Mike Stanley and outfielder 
Butch Huskey. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson is 7-for-16 in his career against Cleveland's Game 1  
starter, Bartolo Colon, but was 4-for-27 against the Indians this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox kept 11 pitchers, but left Pat Rapp, part of the  
rotation for most of the season, off the roster. He was 6-7 with a 
4.12 ERA in 37 games, 26 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong late-season performances by righty Ramon Martinez and  
lefty Kent Mercker left Rapp out of the rotation. Martinez and 
Mercker are expected to start after Pedro Martinez and Bret 
Saberhagen pitch the first two games.

<HEADLINE> Global Warming Fight May Cost Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Fighting global warming could cost the United States and other  
industrialized nations significantly less than most analysts have 
predicted, a study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are supposed to be  
reduced under an international agreement called the Kyoto Protocol. 
The cost has been widely debated and many nations have not ratified 
the protocol, with critics fearing it may be too expensive or 
disputing the causes of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies of the cost have focused almost exclusively on  
reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the cost of complying may be up to 60 percent less than  
previously estimated when efforts are made to reduce all six types 
of gases covered by Kyoto, the new analysis says. 
</P>
<P>
	The work is presented in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature  
by John Reilly and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly calculated the cost of meeting the Kyoto requirements in  
two ways: by reducing only carbon dioxide and by cutting all six 
kinds of greehouse gases in the least costly manner. 
</P>
<P>
	He found that the United States would have to spend $68 million  
a year if the country focused solely on carbon dioxide, vs. $42 
million a year using the alternative approach. The costs were 
calculated using 1995 dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the lower figure is too high, said Daniel Lashof, a global  
warming expert with the Natural Resource Defense Council who did 
not participate in the study. The analysis does not anticipate 
future developments in pollution control technology or big 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that could be achieved 
rather cheaply overseas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Glenn Kelly, executive director of the Global Climate  
Coalition, a business group, said the technology does not exist yet 
for the study results to be applied. ``We're looking at economic 
theories and it is overly optimistic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are serious questions about our ability to measure these  
gases, not just carbon dioxide,'' Kelly said.

<HEADLINE> Cyclist Booted From Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TREVISO, Italy (AP) -- A Moldovian rider was thrown out of the  
World Cycling Championships for failing a blood test before today's 
elite men's time trial, the sport's governing body said. 
</P>
<P>
	Igor Bonciucov, who had a red blood cell count higher than the  
allowed level, is the first rider to be banned at the 
championships, which began Monday. He was among 12 cyclists from 
six countries tested today, the International Cycling Union said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ICU tested 26 riders Tuesday, and all passed.  
</P>
<P>
	Bonciucov was not among the favorites for the 31.4-mile time  
trial. He finished 33rd in the time trial at the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians, meanwhile, said that one of their entrants in  
Saturday's junior men's road race will be replaced because he 
failed a test administered by the team today. 
</P>
<P>
	Giacomo Garofoli is the second cyclist Italy has removed from  
its roster after a blood-and-urine test. 
</P>
<P>
	A high red blood cell count can be a signal of the use of the  
banned growth hormone EPO, but it also can occur naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	EPO, or erythropoietin, allows users to cram oxygen into the  
blood, enhancing their performance levels. It has been linked to 
the deaths of about 20 cyclists since the late 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Idle Grateful for Python Breakup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- While fans may have been heartbroken when Monty  
Python broke up in 1983, Eric Idle says he was thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am exceedingly grateful. I have had a wonderful time over  
the past 16 years and I would like to thank them all personally for 
it,'' Idle said, responding to questions from readers of The 
Independent newspaper, which published the answers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Could Idle be joking?  
</P>
<P>
	After all, he is promoting a new book, ``The Road to Mars,'' and  
he is participating with the other surviving Pythons in a 30th 
anniversary special this weekend on the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
	One reader asked Idle why he agreed to participate in providing  
new material for the special, after once saying the group would 
never reunite. 
</P>
<P>
	He replied: ``I have discovered I really don't mind doing Monty  
Python, providing none of the others are around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent quoted an unidentified spokeswoman for Idle as  
saying her boss was trying to be funny.

<HEADLINE> Bell Ponders Minorities in Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Law professor and author Derrick Bell, who  
has devoted his career to advocating minority causes, says he and 
other minority law professionals may do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than being given access to real influence, it is more  
likely that we are legitimizing a system that really relegates us 
to an ineffectual but decorative fringe,'' Bell, who now teaches at 
New York University, said Tuesday in a speech at the University of 
California's Hastings College of the Law. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, a former civil rights lawyer with the federal government  
and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, became Harvard's 
first black tenured law professor in 1971. He took an unpaid leave 
in 1990 to protest the law school's failure to grant tenure to any 
black women, and left two years later after the school refused to 
extend his leave. 
</P>
<P>
	He has written several books on racial issues and the law,  
including ``And We Are Not Saved'' and ``Faces at the Bottom of the 
Well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His speech Tuesday expressed a recurring theme of his writings,  
that there is ``no cure to racism in America'' but it must be 
continually challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell said he and other civil rights lawyers ``urged the use of  
law and litigation as the major means to end racial discrimination 
... with an inadequate understanding of both the limits of the law 
and the pervasive role of racism in this society.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Address Teamsters Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reaching out to a key labor group, President  
Clinton will speak at a New York dinner honoring Teamsters union 
president James P. Hoffa, whose powerful federation is struggling 
to recover from years of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will meet privately with Hoffa on Thursday at an event  
sponsored by the National Labor Research Association, a 
labor-backed research group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president reaches out on a regular basis to labor union  
leaders in this country and will continue to do so,'' White House 
press secretary Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's appearance comes four days before the AFL-CIO, which  
includes the Teamsters, opens its annual convention in Los Angeles. 
The union is expected to consider whether to endorse Vice President 
Al Gore in his race against former Sen. Bill Bradley for the 
Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart played down the politics of Thursday's event.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they'll discuss issues that involve rank and file  
Teamsters and working Americans,'' Lockhart said. ``I don't know 
that there'll be any discussions of political endorsements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's attendance at the dinner also gives prominence to the  
Teamsters' drive to end strict federal supervision intended to 
remove any taint of mob influence from the union.

<HEADLINE> Gore Opens New Tenn. Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Declaring ``home is where we start  
from,'' Vice President Al Gore moved his campaign to Tennessee on 
Wednesday and named a new campaign manager, diversifying his inner 
circle as part of his effort to re-energize his presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new day,'' he declared to the cheers of about 200  
supporters, including wife, Tipper, and his 87-year-old mother, 
Pauline. 
</P>
<P>
	Adopting a more casual look, Gore cut a ribbon officially  
opening his new campaign headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very powerful moment in this campaign,'' Gore said.  
``Powerful because of what home means. ... Home is not only a 
place, it's an idea that we return to. Home is where we start from. 
Home is where we learn our values. It's where we return to remember 
ourselves in the best sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moving the campaign headquarters from Washington to his home  
state of Tennessee is part of Gore's attempt to shake his image as 
a Beltway insider, distance himself from President Clinton and 
retool a top-heavy campaign that's been losing momentum to former 
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, his only rival for the Democratic 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, wearing a blue knit sport shirt and cowboy boots, told  
reporters he plans to run a less-scripted campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``My attitude is let 'er rip,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	As evidence of his new style of campaigning, Gore shunned a  
stage that had been set up for his speech, choosing instead to walk 
in front of his supporters while speaking. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled being disillusioned when he returned to Tennessee  
after serving in Vietnam as an Army reporter. Living in Nashville 
and working as a reporter helped reinvigorate him and get him to 
believe again in the ``spirit of democracy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in a time when we need more than ever to rekindle the  
spirit of democracy,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president opened his remarks by introducing his new  
campaign manager, Donna Brazile. She replaces Craig Smith, a 
longtime aide to President Clinton who did not want to move to 
Tennessee with the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile, who worked for 1988 Democratic presidential nominee  
Michael Dukakis, is one of the Democratic Party's most experienced 
grass-roots organizers. The appointment of Brazile, who is black, 
helps diversify Gore's inner circle, which has been criticized for 
being dominated by white males. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanying Gore to a soul food restaurant in Nashville,  
Brazile said she would work to ``help facilitate one of the 
greatest grass-roots campaigns that's ever been run in this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She takes over as Gore's staff is deciding whether to leave the  
campaign or head to Tennessee. Deputy campaign manager Stacie 
Spector has departed her post because personal and family reasons 
make moving impracticable. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he looks forward to debating Bradley. ``We could even  
have a debate right here in Nashville,'' he said. ``I think that 
would be a good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Hampton of Marion County, wearing an orange ``Al Gore for  
President'' hat, said he has known Gore all his life and believes 
he is more qualified than Bradley to be president. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's experienced, he knows what he's talking about, he knows  
the needs of the people,'' Hampton said, even while admitting that 
he knows nothing about Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Anderson of Nashville said it was good for Gore to get  
``back to his roots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you get lost in Washington,'' Anderson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Though Gore was born and raised in Washington, he considers  
Tennessee his home. As a boy, he spent summers working on his 
family's farm in Carthage, about 50 miles east of Nashville. As a 
young man, he worked as a reporter at The Tennessean in Nashville 
before being elected to the U.S. House in 1976. He was re-elected 
three times, and won the first of two U.S. Senate races in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter said he advised Gore  
campaign chairman Tony Coelho a few weeks ago to move the 
headquarters to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe you can get great work done in Washington, but you  
can also get more advice than you need,'' said McWherter, who was 
the Clinton-Gore Tennessee campaign manager in 1992 and '96.

<HEADLINE> Chileans Brace for Pinochet Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- As a ruling approaches on Gen. Augusto  
Pinochet's fate, Chileans appear convinced the ailing former 
dictator's best chance for freedom lies in medical clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is expected Friday on whether Pinochet can be  
extradited from Britain to Spain to face charges of human rights 
violations during his authoritarian regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who relinquished power in 1990, carries a pacemaker,  
suffers from diabetes, has difficulties walking and recent reports 
indicate he has suffered two mild strokes. Associates say he also 
has had episodes of depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the only way out for Gen. Pinochet today is the  
humanitarian way,'' Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes told the 
Santiago daily El Mercurio. ``I think it would be senseless to risk 
his death in London; so I think humanitarian reasons are now being 
considered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valdes said the government has provided British authorities with  
a complete report on the 83-year-old's health, ``expressing our 
concern'' about his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was detained in Britain a year ago on a warrant by a  
Spanish judge who wants to try him on torture charges. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean government report has acknowledged that  
3,197 people were killed or disappeared in the crackdown on 
suspected leftists after Pinochet toppled elected Marxist President 
Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup. 
</P>
<P>
	The impending ruling on the extradition request has galvanized  
Pinochet's opponents and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the disappeared are planning an all-night vigil  
late today to await the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We trust extradition will be authorized,'' said Viviana Diaz,  
the president of the relatives' group holding the vigil. ``But if 
the judge rules otherwise, we will continue to fight for justice as 
we have done for more than 25 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the charged atmosphere preceding the ruling, Diaz has  
received anonymous death threats, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the former dictator will hold their own vigil at  
the Pinochet Foundation, a private group of the staunchest Pinochet 
followers. 
</P>
<P>
	Associates of Pinochet admit being pessimistic about the ruling,  
but held out hope that his poor health might save him. 
</P>
<P>
	British Home Secretary Jack Straw is empowered to grant Pinochet  
clemency after the end of the legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's lawyers said they would appeal extradition, if he is  
not granted clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of his family appear split on whether Pinochet would  
accept clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father is a man of dignity who entered Britain through the  
front door and wants to leave through the front door,'' his 
daughter Lucia said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	His son Marco Antonio disagreed, saying ``the chances of him  
returning home by reasons other than clemency are remote, so I 
think he would accept that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz and other relatives of the missing say Pinochet does not  
deserve leniency. 
</P>
<P>
	``No humanitarian considerations should free Pinochet from  
responsibility for the atrocities during his regime,'' Diaz said.

</P>
<P>
	Broakes, who headed the property and construction conglomerate  
Trafalgar House, was known as the figurehead behind the successful 
redevelopment of the London Docklands area. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his career as an insurance underwriter, but soon became  
interested in property development. He became a millionaire in his 
20s. 
</P>
<P>
	He assumed the chairmanship of Trafalgar House at age 35,  
accumulating some of the country's best-known assets over the next 
decade, among them Cunard and the Ritz. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Broakes made a successful bid for the troubled  
Beaverbrook empire, which owned the Daily Express, the Sunday

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Martin S. Davis, who reshaped the sprawling Gulf  
&AMP; Western conglomerate into the publishing and entertainment 
powerhouse called Paramount Communications, died Monday of a heart 
attack. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had been a partner in recent years in a private investment  
firm whose holdings include the maker of Lionel trains. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, Davis was selected as chief executive of G&AMP;W. The  
company at the time was a classic diversified conglomerate with 
assets ranging from cigars and agricultural products to financial 
services, industrial products, chemicals and motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis began a sweeping corporate restructuring, selling about  
150 businesses with revenues amounting to $6 billion between 1983 
and 1989 and liquidating a $900 million investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	The company focused on its publishing and entertainment  
operations which included Simon &AMP; Schuster, Prentice Hall, Madison 
Square Garden, TV stations and Paramount Pictures. It changed its 
name to Paramount Communications in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1993, Davis and Paramount agreed to sell Paramount  
to Sumner Redstone's Viacom Inc., the owner of the MTV and the 
Showtime pay TV service, for about $8.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the deal provoked a bidding battle war and involved many of  
the biggest names in the media and entertainment businesses. Viacom 
eventually prevailed, although the price was about $2 billion more 
than the initial agreement.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Art Farmer, a be-bop master of the trumpet, the  
fluegelhorn and an instrument he invented, the flumpet, died of 
cardiac arrest Monday. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, Farmer, who was considered a master of  
ballad playing, designed the flumpet, a cross between the 
fluegelhorn and the trumpet which combined projection with warmth. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer studied piano and violin in grade school. As a teen-ager,  
he joined a dance band playing big-band arrangements with his twin 
brother, the bassist Addison Farmer, who died in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Art Farmer quit school to join Johnny Otis's group on tour and  
record the be-bop classic ``Farmer's Market'' with Wardell Gray's 
band. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, he went on tour with Lionel Hampton. A year later, he  
joined bands led by Gigi Gryce and Horace Silver. At the end of the 
1950s, he formed the sextet Jazztet with saxophonist Benny Golson, 
with whom he wrote harmonically sophisticated music and helped 
define the state of the art for mainstream jazz.

<P>
	SPIRO, Okla. (AP) -- Rod Shoate, a former University of Oklahoma  
football standout, was found dead in his apartment Monday. He was 
46. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiro Police Chief Darrell Barham said a medical doctor  
determined Shoate died of natural causes. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoate's family issued a statement saying that he died of a  
long-term illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoate was an All-American in 1973 and 1974. He later played  
with the New England Patriots and in the United States Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	He played linebacker for Sooners teams that recorded a 29-4-1  
record and won the 1974 national championship. Shoate finished 
seventh in the Heisman Trophy voting as a senior in 1974 and was 
one of four finalists for the Lombardi Award that same year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, Shoate was drafted in the second round by the Patriots.  
He played in 76 games with the Patriots, starting in 65 of them.

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Leonard S. Shoen, who transformed the moving  
industry when he founded U-Haul International Inc. more than five 
decades ago, died of blunt force trauma Monday in an apparent 
suicide. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoen drove his car into a wooden power pole, police said. The  
case remained under investigation Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoen founded U-Haul in 1945 and built it into the most  
recognized do-it-yourself moving company in the nation with its 
signature orange and white trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	With an initial investment of $5,000, he and then-wife Anna Mary  
Carty started the company at the Carty Ranch in Ridgefield, Wash., 
where they built the first U-Haul trailers. The company is now 
based in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Shoen's sons -- Joe and Mark -- forced their father into  
retirement and pushed for control of the parent company, Reno-based 
Amerco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The move triggered a fight that ended in a $1.5 billion jury  
award. A judge later reduced the award to $461 million, and the 
company then sought bankruptcy protection from the debt.

<HEADLINE> Braves 5, Astros 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Kevin Millwood is no longer an afterthought to  
Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz. After Wednesday, he 
deserves to be mentioned right along with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching one of the greatest postseason games in baseball  
history, Millwood threw a one-hitter -- facing only two batters 
above the minimum -- to give the Atlanta Braves a critical 5-1 
victory over the Houston Astros, evening the first-round series at 
one game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, pitching in the postseason for the first time, allowed  
a second-inning homer to Ken Caminiti but that was all. It was the 
first complete-game one-hitter in the postseason in 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed a big win today,'' the 24-year-old Millwood said.  
``It was probably the biggest game I have pitched in my career, so 
I would have to say it was my best performance ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No kidding.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was working,'' he said. ``My fastball was good. My  
curveball was good. My slider was good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, 18-7 during the regular season, didn't pitch at all  
the last two postseasons while the Braves were knocked out in the 
NL championship series -- even though he won 17 games in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves couldn't pass him by this year. Millwood stepped up  
to become the Braves most consistent starter while Maddux, Glavine 
and Smoltz -- with seven Cy Youngs among them -- went through 
assorted struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I slept pretty good last night,'' Millwood said. ``I thought  
it was going to be kind of tough to get to sleep, but I think some 
of the nervous energy I worked up during the day kind of wore me 
out. I slept good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And pitched even better, throwing the first complete game  
one-hitter in the postseason since Game 2 of the 1967 World Series. 
Boston's Jim Lonborg beat the St. Louis Cardinals 5-0, allowing a 
double to Julian Javier with two outs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Glavine and Mark Wohlers combined on a one-hitter for the  
Braves against Cleveland in Game 6 of the 1995 World Series. The 
were two other combined one-hitters in LCS play. 
</P>
<P>
	``A stronger game has not been pitched against us all year  
long,'' Houston manager Larry Dierker said. ``We really only hit 
two balls hard the whole game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Braves desperate for a victory after losing the first  
game 6-1 Tuesday, Millwood retired 15 batters in a row after 
Caminiti's homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The streak was broken when third baseman Chipper Jones booted a  
grounder with one out in the seventh, but the error didn't bother 
his pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood got the next two batters on grounders. The Braves broke  
open a 2-1 game with three runs in the bottom half on Brian 
Jordan's sacrifice fly and run-scoring singles by Ryan Klesko and 
Andruw Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-5 series shifts to the Astrodome, where the next two  
games will be played Friday and Saturday. If a fifth game is 
needed, it would be at Turner Field on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us confidence going into Houston,'' Jordan said. ``I  
mean, momentum has switched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan and Klesko flip-flopped in the batting order, a move that  
paid off with two RBIs from Jordan, hitting fourth instead of 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko, dropped from the cleanup spot, had three hits, scored  
twice and drove in a run. 
</P>
<P>
	But everyone was overshadowed by Millwood, who flirted with a  
no-hitter several times during the regular season, allowing only 
two hits in four separate starts. 
</P>
<P>
	He went at least six innings in every start after June 28.  
Overall, Millwood finished second in the NL to Arizona's Randy 
Johnson with a 2.68 ERA and led the majors by allowing a .202 
average to hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a dominant pitcher,'' Jordan said. ``We needed a big  
game from our pitcher and he came up with a big game for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves got to Houston starter Jose Lima in the first inning,  
with Gerald Williams scoring on Jordan's two-out, broken-bat 
single. Lima might have been flustered by a visit from third-base 
umpire Bruce Froemming before the very first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Froemming noticed a stain on the right hip of Lima's uniform and  
walked over to check it out. The umpire appeared to touch the spot 
with a finger before allowing Lima to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have been checking the side of my pants all year,'' said  
Lima, who said the stain was simply dirt. ``I don't have to cheat 
to win ball games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lima, 21-10 during the regular season but 0-2 against the  
Braves, went 6 2-3 innings, allowing four runs and nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti, who hit a three-run homer in the ninth inning Tuesday  
to seal Houston's victory, burned the Braves again in the second 
inning. On a 1-2 pitch, Millwood tried to sneak a fastball over the 
inside corner, and it wound up in the right-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be his only mistake.  
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Perez's sacrifice fly in the sixth broke a 1-1 tie. Andruw  
Jones had the key hit in the inning, a double that broke his 
0-for-20 slump in division series play. It was Atlanta's first 
extra-base hit of this series. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The crowd of 41,913 was larger than Game 1, but still the  
second-smallest in Atlanta postseason history. ... The Braves broke 
a four-game home losing streak in the playoffs. ... Only once in 
the 1990s have the Braves won a postseason series after losing the 
first game -- in 1991, Atlanta defeated Pittsburgh 4-3 in the NL 
championship series after losing Game 1. Since then, the Braves are 
0-4 when they've lost the opener. ... Bill Spiers did not start for 
Houston after going 2-for-4 in Game 1. Stan Javier took his place 
in right field and went 0-for-4. ... Millwood said he has pitched 
only one other postseason game in his career, pitching eight 
shutout innings for Class-A Durham in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Still No Sign of Knicks' Sprewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Without even the courtesy of a phone  
call to the coach or general manager, Latrell Sprewell remained 
absent from training camp Wednesday for the increasingly frustrated 
New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's agent told general manager Scott Layden that the  
player was in Milwaukee and would join the team Wednesday night or 
Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was still no communication from Sprewell himself, a  
silence that was clearly bothering Layden and coach Jeff Van Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anybody wants to be informed. It's a basic thing,''  
Van Gundy said. ``But it's not a distraction. This, too, will pass. 
We'll be on to another controversy in another few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks gave Sprewell permission to miss the start of camp  
because of a civil trial in Martinez, Calif., stemming from a 
traffic accident that Sprewell admittedly caused. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Sprewell said he'd join the Knicks after closing  
arguments, which were Monday. Then he said he wanted to wait for a 
verdict, which came Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Next came the news that he had flown home to Milwaukee and still  
wasn't giving the Knicks a firm arrival time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotten different information from the different  
attorneys, so that part has been frustrating,'' Layden said. 
``That's one of the reasons I would like to get him here and talk 
to him face-to-face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell could be fined $2,500 for his first two missed  
practices, and $5,000 for any missed practices thereafter. Layden 
would not comment on whether the Knicks would fine Sprewell, saying 
he wanted to speak to the player first. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy did his best to shrug it off while also making it  
clear that he was eager to speak to Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to sit here and sell the notion that because he  
missed my first two practices he's doomed to fail this year,'' Van 
Gundy said. ``But at the same time everyone has a responsibility to 
their teammates, coaches and team to work together. You can't have 
people missing practice, but the only reason there's any 
indecisiveness is because I haven't spoken to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other Knicks went through another set of two-a-day  
practices, and the team brought in referees from the CBA to give 
them a taste of how tightly games will be called this season under 
the NBA's crackdown on rough play. 
</P>
<P>
	Scrimmages that were supposed to last eight minutes took 20, and  
Van Gundy said there wasn't a single set of back-to-back 
possessions that wasn't blown dead by a whistle. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing, recovering from a ruptured Achilles' tendon,  
worked out on a treadmill while sitting out drills and scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you combined Patrick's yesterday and today, he'd (have  
walked) halfway back to New York,'' Van Gundy said.

<HEADLINE> Agassi To Play in Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Andre Agassi will play in the Davis  
Cup, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	After having vowed never to play again, Agassi, the world's No.  
1 player, decided to return to the U.S. team, saying Wednesday he 
would play in the first round in February. 
</P>
<P>
	With Pete Sampras still injured and uncertain to be available,  
Agassi will anchor American hopes to reclaim the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, Agassi said he would never again participate in  
Davis Cup competition after friend and team doctor George Fareed 
was dropped from the squad. 
</P>
<P>
	But Agassi changed his mind after John McEnroe became captain.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be the best captain ever so far,''  
Agassi said at the Swiss Indoors. ``He'll help a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll bring a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of energy, a lot of  
experience. It's an advantage to have someone on your team with 
this kind of fighting spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe played on 12 Davis Cup teams, including five champions.  
He still holds six U.S. Davis Cup records and compiled an overall 
record of 59-10. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't just McEnroe's Davis Cup prowess which swayed  
Agassi, it also was the fact the U.S. Tennis Association allowed 
the team to have some say in the choice of captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me the most important thing was how the decision was made  
so the players had say-so in some of the more important areas such 
as who the captain is,'' Agassi said. ``And I know with John the 
team will always make decisions as a unit, which is something you 
always hope for in the Davis Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding speculation McEnroe might play in the Davis Cup  
doubles matches, Agassi was diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's addicted to competition,'' Agassi said, laughing. ``It  
would be a new thing for a coach to be a player, but John is 
objective enough to have the best team out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In deciding to return to Davis Cup competition, Agassi  
overlooked his differences with the U.S. Tennis Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw for the 2000 Davis Cup competition will be Thursday in  
London. The United States will then learn its first-round opponent 
for competition Feb. 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is one of eight seeded teams. The others are  
Germany, Britain, Spain, Australia, France, Russia and Slovakia. 
The Americans will face one of the eight non-seeded countries: 
Austria, Czech Republic, Italy, Netherlands, Zimbabwe, Belgium, 
Brazil or Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Cattle Futures Fall on Russian News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	News that Russia will withdraw from the beef market because of  
high prices helped send cattle futures prices tumbling in trading 
Wednesday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, hog and pork belly futures were mixed, cocoa  
futures continued their slide and grain and soybean futures prices 
were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures prices began their slide on reports Russia  
will drop beef because prices are too high and use its food aid 
loan to purchase chicken, grain and protein meal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about a significant amount of beef, about $70  
million,'' said analyst Charles Levitt of Alaron Trading Corp. 
``Obviously that takes something away from the consumption side of 
the beef and cattle market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the market remains strong because of high cash prices  
being paid for beef, as demand is soaring on the approach of the 
holidays and millennium celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurting cattle prices was the weakness of hog futures, sent  
lower by high slaughter rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA quarterly hogs and pigs report, released Sept. 24,  
promised fewer hogs would be coming to market than is currently the 
case, Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	According the report, the weekly slaughter would total 2 million  
hogs, Levitt said. The slaughter is about 2.1 million heads a week, 
close to year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses in hog futures were limited by comments made  
Wednesday by USDA Secretary Dan Glickman to the House Agriculture 
Committee. He said more pork donations to Russia were a 
possibility, giving a boost to pork belly futures. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle were .55 cent lower at 69.20 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle were .53 cent lower at 82.37 cents a pound; 
December live hogs were .72 cent lower at 44.70 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were .37 cent higher at 61.22 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed on the Chicago Board  
of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures surged late as a rally in soyoil futures,  
triggered by technical factors, gave strength to the overall 
market. The rise was limited by the good weather in the U.S. 
soybean crop growing region, a boon for harvest activity. The mild 
conditions are expected to continue into the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	During his appearance before the House Agriculture Committee,  
Glickman said Russia is seeking 1 million metric tons of soybeans 
and soy products in a proposed food aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices finished fractionally higher in quiet  
trading, with many traders staying on the sidelines as they await 
the USDA's crop production and supply and demand reports, being 
released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn prices received a lift from light farmer selling. Gains  
were limited by the brisk pace of the corn harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices ended on a mixed note after falling in  
early trading. Losses were limited by commercial buying and the 
strength of the soybean market. Wheat futures continue to suffer 
from huge wheat stocks and poor export business. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was a 1/4 cent lower at $2.64 1/4 a  
bushel; December corn was 1 1/4 cents higher at $2.04 3/4 a bushel; 
December oats were 1 3/4 cents higher at $1.11 3/4 a bushel; November 
soybeans were 5 1/2 cents higher at $4.89 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures prices fell on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa  
Exchange on weak processing data from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Netherlands reported its third-quarter cocoa grind totaled  
98,828 metric tons, a 9 percent decrease from the same quarter a 
year ago. The Netherlands is the world's largest cocoa processor, 
and the market is interpreting the figures as an indication cocoa 
demand is declining, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	October is the start of the 1999-2000 cocoa season, and West  
African production appears very good, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	December cocoa was $27 lower at $948 a metric ton.

<HEADLINE> Details of Health Insurance Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Major provisions of legislation, approved Wednesday by the  
House, aimed at giving people greater access to health insurance: 
</P>
<P>
	--Tax breaks: Phases in a tax break for people who purchase  
health insurance or long-term care coverage on their own, much like 
the break given to companies that buy it for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also allows people who are self-employed to deduct the full cost  
of their health insurance premiums, for both regular health 
coverage and for long-term care. Under current law, this would not 
take effect for another two years. 
</P>
<P>
	These provisions are popular with both parties, but Democrats  
complained that the GOP had no plan to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	--Medical savings accounts: Expands a small program that allows  
Americans to put money into a tax-free account to be used for 
health costs when they purchase a high-deductible insurance plan in 
case of expensive emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say this gives people an attractive new option;  
Democrats complain that it would drain the healthiest and 
wealthiest people from the general insurance pool, raising costs 
for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gives small businesses the option to buy health insurance under  
federal rather than state regulation -- exempting them from state 
mandates that larger, self-insured companies now avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cost: The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the cost at $48  
billion over 10 years.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Health-Care Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled House approved a  
package of tax breaks Wednesday to help the uninsured afford health 
care coverage, overriding complaints from Democrats that the plan 
would be financed out of surplus Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote, 227-205 and largely along party lines, served as  
prelude to a clash Thursday over a White House-backed bill to 
strengthen patients' hands in dealing with their insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people are concerned about the fact that they  
can't gain access to affordable health care,'' said Rep. David 
Dreier, R-Calif., arguing on behalf of a measure that GOP 
leadership said was essential to help the estimated 44 million 
Americans who lack insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats contended the GOP bill would do little to solve  
that problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill does nothing except to help the insurance companies  
and the well-to-do and the healthy,'' said Rep. John Dingell of 
Michigan. He and other Democrats added it would rely on funds in 
the Social Security surplus to finance the tax breaks, a step that 
Republicans have promised not to take and that is the subject of a 
GOP advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing in this bill that invades the Social Security  
trust fund,'' and that was certified by the Congressional Budget 
Office, retorted Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the 
tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	By making their claim, Democrats were probably ``seeking some  
advantage in the election next year,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, expected to cost $48.6 billion over 10 years, would:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Give workers without insurance at their jobs a new tax  
deduction to offset the cost of private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allow the self-employed a full 100 percent tax deduction for  
health insurance beginning Jan. 1, 2001, two years faster than 
current law. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Create a new tax deduction for the full cost of long-term-care  
insurance premiums and a new exemption for taxpayers who care for 
elderly relatives at home. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes a provision, opposed by many Democrats, that  
would allow more medical savings accounts, which let people opt out 
of the current health insurance market and buy high-deductible 
plans on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would give small businesses the option to  
buy health insurance under federal rather than state regulation -- 
exempting them from state mandates that bigger self-insured 
companies now avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats generally oppose MSAs, claiming that younger,  
healthier individuals would buy them, thereby raising the cost of 
insurance for the rest of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security issue has become prominent in recent weeks,  
as Republicans have stressed their determination not to invade the 
trust funds for other programs and began airing television 
commercials against Democrats on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the vote on the tax bill, lawmakers turned to a  
second measure -- supported by the White House and opposed by the 
GOP leadership -- to arm patients with rights in dealing with 
insurance companies, including the right to sue in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, President Clinton accused GOP leaders of  
using legislative ``poison pills'' to doom the so-called patients' 
bill of rights measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same sort of thing they did to kill common-sense gun  
legislation'' last spring, Clinton charged, referring to a measure 
that died in a crossfire of opposition from conservatives and 
liberals. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats who solidly back that second bill complained that  
Republicans had refused to allow them a chance to offset its cost -- 
thereby jeopardizing the prospects for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The votes are not going to be there to pass this,'' said Rep.  
Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that they had given Democrats the rules  
they had sought for debate. ``The Democrats have moved the goal 
post again,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats said that was precisely what the GOP had in mind.  
``They are in league with the insurance lobby,'' said Rep. Rosa 
DeLauro of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argued that after seeking a vote for months on the  
bill, Democrats were secretly maneuvering for its defeat so they 
could continue to exploit the health care issue politically. ``This 
last minute pay-for problem is a smokescreen for the fact that they 
want to play politics,'' said John Feehery, a spokesman for House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMO bill, backed by Dingell and Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga.,  
would arm patients with a variety of new rights in dealing with 
health insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	It would make it easier to go to an emergency room or see a  
specialist and would give patients the chance to take their 
complaints to independent panels. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest point of contention, though, was a provision to  
allow patients to sue an HMO in state court over disputes about 
their care. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with possible defeat on the issue, the leadership threw  
its support behind a freshly drafted alternative that would extend 
a more limited right to sue -- in federal rather than state courts. 
</P>
<P>
	To prevail in Thursday's votes, Republicans would need the  
support of conservatives who traditionally oppose any right to sue, 
as well as from moderates who have indicated support for the White 
House-backed bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, they would need the acquiescence of the insurance  
industry and busines groups, as well, since Republican lawmakers 
would be unlikely to vote for a limited right to sue and risk a 
backlash from their traditional supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chamber of Commerce said late in the day it was continuing  
to oppose the alternative right-to-sue bill, indicating the GOP 
leadership was encountering at least some resistance to its 
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Bush Proposes National Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- As Republican presidential candidate George  
W. Bush calls for mandatory state exams to gauge school performance 
nationwide, a similar program in his home state of Texas has 
brought higher pupil scores, criticism and a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it (Bush's testing plan) is a horrible idea, given  
the history of the state of Texas'' with a state exam required for 
graduation, said Leticia Saucedo, staff attorney for the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization filed a lawsuit on behalf of Hispanic education  
groups and some minority students who completed their school work 
but did not receive diplomas because they failed the statewide 
academic skills test required to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs argue that the ``exit test'' is invalid and  
discriminatory. State lawyers defend the exam as fair and say the 
gap between minorities and whites is narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Tuesday, Bush proposed requiring states to design  
and administer annual tests to pupils in grades three through 
eight. States that fail to improve after five years would lose some 
of the federal money they receive for elementary and secondary 
education, while improving schools would be eligible for bonus 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same speech, the Texas governor criticized other  
Republican leaders for the second time in a week. ``Too often, my 
party has confused the need for limited government with a disdain 
for government itself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too often, on social issues, my party has painted an image of  
America slouching toward Gomorrah. Too often, my party has focused 
on the national economy, to the exclusion of all else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week Bush criticized Republican leaders in Congress for  
advocating a slowing of payments to working poor families in an 
effort to reduce the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills is given  
beginning in elementary school, only the exit test is being 
challenged in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	But others question whether the overall testing program drives  
the public school curriculum and thus narrows pupils' education 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has driven our scores up dramatically. ... The other side  
of the coin is there's a price, and I think teachers have been 
feeling and parents are beginning to feel that price,'' said Jay 
Levin of the Texas State Teachers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a great emphasis placed on the testing in the overall  
academic program, and there's a lot of practice going on for the 
test, which I'm not saying is good or bad. In some situations, it 
does take away the ability to teach more critical thinking skills 
and analytic skills,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say testing is the best way to gauge whether schools  
are doing their job and that Texas' program has worked well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps the public know what they're getting for their money.  
That's important since they pay for it,'' said John Cole of the 
Texas Federation of Teachers, whose national affiliate endorsed 
Vice President Al Gore, a contender for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, the mandatory test is a key part of the state  
accountability system for schools, which are rated based on student 
scores, dropouts and attendance. The system predates Bush but has 
been strengthened under his tenure as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The test was given this spring to more than 1.8 million Texas  
students in grades three through eight and those preparing to 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those, 78 percent passed all sections of the test. That's up  
from 73 percent last year, and from 53 percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the mere fact that we give a school district a grade  
based on how they're performing in terms of their students 
mastering the state's curriculum has been an enormous motivator for 
teachers, students and administrators,'' said Teel Bivins, a 
Republican who chairs the state Senate Education Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational  
Fund lawsuit, which is in mid-trial, Cole, of the Texas teachers 
association, said the state test should not be attacked for showing 
that students haven't mastered the material. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a little bit like saying you want to throw out the  
thermometer because it keeps showing some kids have a fever,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saucedo said her group is concerned about test results being  
used in a way that punishes students since the Texas system long 
has experienced unequal funding among schools and has a ``history 
of unequal educational opportunities among students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we've ever said we're against tests as an  
evaluation tool. Our problem is to use it in a punitive way. I 
think it harms students in the end more than it helps them,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Angry DH Skips Workout, Leaves Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Red Sox designated hitter Reggie Jefferson  
reportedly skipped Tuesday's mandatory workout and left the team 
because he was angry about being left off the postseason roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Herald, quoting a source close to the player,  
reported today that Jefferson had packed his bags and left 
Cleveland. Jefferson did not comment before departing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe, also citing a source it did not identify, said  
Jefferson and Boston general manger Dan Duquette were involved in a 
shouting match at the team hotel on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In place of Jefferson, the Red Sox decided to keep infielder Lou  
Merloni on the 25-man roster because of concerns over recent 
injuries to shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and third baseman John 
Valentin. Reliever Tom Gordon was also told he made the roster for 
the best-of-5 series against the Cleveland Indians, which begins 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The roster could be changed between rounds if the Red Sox  
advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-handed Jefferson is 7-for-16 in his career against  
Cleveland's Game 1 starter, Bartolo Colon.

<HEADLINE> ATT in Joint Phone Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. and a rural wireless company are  
teaming up to acquire American Cellular Corp., an operator of small 
Cellular One franchises in 10 states.

Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois. It operates under the Cellular One 
trade name, which is owned and franchised by the regional phone 
company SBC Communications and Western Wireless Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobson will be responsible for day-to-day management of a new,  
equally owned venture with AT&AMP;T that the companies have created to 
buy and operate American Cellular. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of all three companies have approved the transaction,  
which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2000. The merger 
also requires the approval of American Cellular's shareholders and 
federal regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal extends the reach of Dobson's wireless operations from  
11 states with 5.9 million potential subscribers to 17 states with 
10.8 million potential subscribers. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pele's Son Is Convicted of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The son of Brazilian soccer legend Pele  
was convicted of murder early Wednesday for taking part in a street 
car race which resulted in the death of a passing motorcyclist. 
</P>
<P>
	Edson Cholbi do Nascimento, 29, was sentenced to six years in  
``semi-open'' prison, which means he must sleep in the prison but 
may leave during the day to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento and Marcilio Marcilio Jose Marinho de Melo, 25, -- who  
was also convicted and sentenced to 6 years in semi-open prison -- 
were accused of racing their cars in Santos, a port town 48 miles 
southeast of Sao Paulo, when they struck and killed 50-year-old 
retiree Pedro Simoes Neto. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Melo's car was the one that hit Neto, Nascimento was  
found guilty for taking part in the race which occurred in Oct. 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair will be free while they appeal the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Octavio Borba de Vasconcellos began to present his  
case before a jury at 8 a.m. Tuesday and, expect for breaks for 
lunch and dinner ran straight through to 1:00 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Group To Investigate Brown Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The American Psychiatric Association  
said it will investigate whether the head of Brown University's 
psychiatric department failed to disclose more than $500,000 in 
consulting fees, most from pharmaceutical companies whose health 
benefits he praised in journals and at conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Martin Keller, a noted researcher on depression, could be  
banned from APA-sponsored conferences if he did not follow the 
group's policies for financial disclosures, association spokeswoman 
Lynn Writsel said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe reported this week that Keller failed to  
disclose that he was paid the consulting fees in 1998. Most of the 
money came from pharmaceutical companies whose drugs he lauded in 
medical journals and at the APA's annual meeting this year and 
last, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller, of Newton, Mass., did not return telephone messages left  
at his home and office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe reported that Keller received consulting fees from  
companies such as Pfizer Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Wyeth-Ayerst, 
and Eli Lilly -- all of which market antidepressants he praised in a 
series of medical research reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The school said Keller followed the school's rules to the  
letter. It requires annual conflict-of-interest reports for 
researchers who make more than $10,000 or 10 percent in equity. The 
reports are reviewed by a misconduct committee and the dean of the 
graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
	But the school does not require disclosure of specific dollar  
amounts earned. 
</P>
<P>
	Writsel said an association committee will review Keller's case  
later this month. If the committee determines punishment is 
necessary, it could range from a warning to a ban from making any 
presentations at future meetings.

<HEADLINE> Braves 5, Astros 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Kevin Millwood is no longer an afterthought to  
Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz. After Wednesday, he 
deserves to be mentioned right along with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching one of the greatest postseason games in baseball  
history, Millwood threw a one-hitter -- facing only two batters 
above the minimum -- to give the Atlanta Braves a critical 5-1 
victory over the Houston Astros, evening the first-round series at 
one game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, pitching in the postseason for the first time, allowed  
a second-inning homer to Ken Caminiti but that was all. It was the 
first complete-game one-hitter in the postseason in 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed a big win today,'' the 24-year-old Millwood said.  
``It was probably the biggest game I have pitched in my career, so 
I would have to say it was my best performance ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No kidding.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was working,'' he said. ``My fastball was good. My  
curveball was good. My slider was good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, 18-7 during the regular season, didn't pitch at all  
the last two postseasons while the Braves were knocked out in the 
NL championship series -- even though he won 17 games in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves couldn't pass him by this year. Millwood stepped up  
to become the Braves most consistent starter while Maddux, Glavine 
and Smoltz -- with seven Cy Youngs among them -- went through 
assorted struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I slept pretty good last night,'' Millwood said. ``I thought  
it was going to be kind of tough to get to sleep, but I think some 
of the nervous energy I worked up during the day kind of wore me 
out. I slept good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And pitched even better, throwing the first complete game  
one-hitter in the postseason since Game 2 of the 1967 World Series. 
Boston's Jim Lonborg beat the St. Louis Cardinals 5-0, allowing a 
double to Julian Javier with two outs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Glavine and Mark Wohlers combined on a one-hitter for the  
Braves against Cleveland in Game 6 of the 1995 World Series. The 
were two other combined one-hitters in LCS play. 
</P>
<P>
	``A stronger game has not been pitched against us all year  
long,'' Houston manager Larry Dierker said. ``We really only hit 
two balls hard the whole game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Braves desperate for a victory after losing the first  
game 6-1 Tuesday, Millwood retired 15 batters in a row after 
Caminiti's homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The streak was broken when third baseman Chipper Jones booted a  
grounder with one out in the seventh, but the error didn't bother 
his pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood got the next two batters on grounders. The Braves broke  
open a 2-1 game with three runs in the bottom half on Brian 
Jordan's sacrifice fly and run-scoring singles by Ryan Klesko and 
Andruw Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-5 series shifts to the Astrodome, where the next two  
games will be played Friday and Saturday. If a fifth game is 
needed, it would be at Turner Field on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us confidence going into Houston,'' Jordan said. ``I  
mean, momentum has switched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan and Klesko flip-flopped in the batting order, a move that  
paid off with two RBIs from Jordan, hitting fourth instead of 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko, dropped from the cleanup spot, had three hits, scored  
twice and drove in a run. 
</P>
<P>
	But everyone was overshadowed by Millwood, who flirted with a  
no-hitter several times during the regular season, allowing only 
two hits in four separate starts. 
</P>
<P>
	He went at least six innings in every start after June 28.  
Overall, Millwood finished second in the NL to Arizona's Randy 
Johnson with a 2.68 ERA and led the majors by allowing a .202 
average to hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a dominant pitcher,'' Jordan said. ``We needed a big  
game from our pitcher and he came up with a big game for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves got to Houston starter Jose Lima in the first inning,  
with Gerald Williams scoring on Jordan's two-out, broken-bat 
single. Lima might have been flustered by a visit from third-base 
umpire Bruce Froemming before the very first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Froemming noticed a stain on the right hip of Lima's uniform and  
walked over to check it out. The umpire appeared to touch the spot 
with a finger before allowing Lima to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have been checking the side of my pants all year,'' said  
Lima, who said the stain was simply dirt. ``I don't have to cheat 
to win ball games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lima, 21-10 during the regular season but 0-2 against the  
Braves, went 6 2-3 innings, allowing four runs and nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti, who hit a three-run homer in the ninth inning Tuesday  
to seal Houston's victory, burned the Braves again in the second 
inning. On a 1-2 pitch, Millwood tried to sneak a fastball over the 
inside corner, and it wound up in the right-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be his only mistake.  
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Perez's sacrifice fly in the sixth broke a 1-1 tie. Andruw  
Jones had the key hit in the inning, a double that broke his 
0-for-20 slump in division series play. It was Atlanta's first 
extra-base hit of this series. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The crowd of 41,913 was larger than Game 1, but still the  
second-smallest in Atlanta postseason history. ... The Braves broke 
a four-game home losing streak in the playoffs. ... Only once in 
the 1990s have the Braves won a postseason series after losing the 
first game -- in 1991, Atlanta defeated Pittsburgh 4-3 in the NL 
championship series after losing Game 1. Since then, the Braves are 
0-4 when they've lost the opener. ... Bill Spiers did not start for 
Houston after going 2-for-4 in Game 1. Stan Javier took his place 
in right field and went 0-for-4. ... Millwood said he has pitched 
only one other postseason game in his career, pitching eight 
shutout innings for Class-A Durham in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Saudi's Deportation Prompts Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Saudi man suspected of involvement in the  
1996 attack on U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia is making an 11th-hour 
appeal to avoid deportation back to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	The deportation of Hani al-Sayegh had been scheduled for today,  
but his lawyer filed an emergency motion Tuesday with the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia seeking to halt his 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Sayegh has been seeking asylum in the United States on  
grounds that he would be subjected to torture if he were returned 
to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer argued that Attorney General Janet Reno erred in  
denying his request for asylum under the United Nations Convention 
Against Torture, which the United States has signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno relied on assurances from the Saudis that al-Sayegh would  
not be tortured, but ignored evidence from international human 
rights groups, al-Sayegh's lawyer argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said al-Sayegh would not be deported until the 
department heard from the court and that they were preparing a 
response to his motion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deportation order was issued after al-Sayegh backed out of a  
deal to help U.S. agents investigate the June 1996 bombing in 
Khobar, Saudi Arabia. The bombing killed 19 American airmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Sayegh is alleged by Saudi officials to have driven a car  
that signaled the driver of an explosives-laden truck when to pull 
up to the Khobar Towers apartments, where the U.S. military 
personnel were living. 
</P>
<P>
	He had cut a deal with U.S. officials that called for him to  
plead guilty to participating in an unrelated plot against 
Americans in Saudi Arabia that was never carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1997, Canada expelled al-Sayegh for alleged terrorist  
activity. Reno allowed him into the United States solely for 
prosecution under the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon arrival, he reneged on the deal, claiming he had not  
understood it, knew nothing about the Khobar attack and was out of 
Saudi Arabia when the bombing occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to al-Sayegh's appeal Tuesday, the State Department said  
his anticipated deportation raises the potential for retaliatory 
action against Americans and U.S. interests worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``worldwide caution'' said the United States has increased  
security at U.S. government facilities worldwide and reminds 
private Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All Americans should maintain a low profile, vary routes and  
times for all required travel and treat mail from unfamiliar 
sources with suspicion.''

<HEADLINE> Ducks Player Gets 10-Game Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anaheim Mighty Ducks defenseman Ruslan Salei  
will miss most of October after the NHL suspended him for 10 games 
for his hit that sidelined Dallas' Mike Modano indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Salei cross-checked Modano face first into the boards during the  
second period of Saturday's game. Modano sustained injuries to his 
head, face and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests to determine when Modano will return were scheduled for  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have all the respect in the world for him,'' Salei said.  
``It is just a bad accident. It's the result (not the incident 
itself) why I'm being punished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salei wasn't the only one on the Ducks to be punished. Two of  
his teammates were also suspended by the league for separate 
actions in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Pascal Trepanier received a five-game penalty and  
forward Jim McKenzie will sit for four. 
</P>
<P>
	Salei will forfeit $109,756 in salary and will be eligible to  
return on Oct. 29 against the Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	I think it's a hair light, but it's a start,'' said Dallas'  
Brett Hull, who jumped to Modano's defense after the cross check 
and got into a fight with Salei. ``Hopefully it will be (enough), 
but you don't know. It's a part of the game that has to go. That 
kind of rough play cannot be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NHL executive vice president and director of hockey operations  
Colin Campbell has said Modano was fortunate the injuries were not 
more serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a dangerous act by Mr. Salei against an opponent who  
was in a vulnerable position and unable to defend himself,'' 
Campbell said. ``Everyone connected with hockey knows that a hit or 
a push from behind on a player is an extremely dangerous play and 
can result in serious injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three suspensions began Tuesday against the Phoenix Coyotes.  
Because league rules prohibit teams from replacing suspended 
players on the 23-man active roster, all 20 of the remaining 
players on the Mighty Ducks' roster were in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ducks lost 4-0 to the Coyotes on Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Trepanier was suspended for hitting Dallas center Joe Nieuwendyk  
with an elbow to the head midway through the third period. 
Trepanier is eligible to return Oct. 16 at Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our stance against hits to the head remains very much in  
place,'' Campbell said. ``Such behavior will not be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie was suspended for initiating an altercation with Stars  
defenseman Darryl Sydor, and persisting although Sydor offered no 
resistance and was defenseless. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk returned to play against the Detroit Red Wings on  
Tuesday night, but Sydor remained out indefinitely with a fractured 
eye socket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're sending a message,'' Nieuwendyk said after  
Tuesday night's game. ``It's an unfortunate thing that had to 
happen -- three ugly incidents in one game. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie, who will be eligible to return Oct. 15 at Tampa Bay,  
said Sydor started the incident by throwing an elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw the tape,'' McKenzie said. ``Did I start the fight?  
The tough part is the league handles the decision and that's all 
there is to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trepanier forfeits almost $10,000 in salary, while McKenzie  
loses close to $13,000. The money goes to the Players' Emergency 
Assistance Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest suspension for an on-ice infraction was 21 games  
given to Washington's Dale Hunter for a late hit on a celebrating 
Pierre Turgeon after Turgeon scored against the Capitals during the 
1993 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lysiak of the Chicago Blackhawks was suspended 20 games in  
1983 for intentionally tripping an official. Three others have 
received 15-game suspensions.

<HEADLINE> Schools Giving Depression Surveys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- There are no right or wrong answers for this test.  
No studying required. Students don't have to give their names. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, however, could have serious implications.  
</P>
<P>
	In all, 1,100 Holliston High School students are scheduled to  
take a depression survey Thursday, joining a a growing number of 
schools participating in National Depression Screening Day. 
Organizers hope the surveys will lead to help for the 5 percent to 
8 percent of high school students estimated to be clinically 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 500,000 and 800,000 American teen-agers experience  
clinical depression each year, said Dr. Douglas Jacobs, who founded 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Depression is a difficult diagnosis to make among teen-agers  
because the symptoms -- irritability, low self-esteem and poor 
performance -- ``get confused with the angst of being a teen-ager,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the screenings won't automatically pinpoint which students  
may need help. Because the questionnaires are anonymous, the 
impetus falls on the student to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is we're going to have an inventory come back  
saying this kid is suicidal, this kid is going off the chart on 
this and we're not going to know who that kid is,'' said Holliston 
school psychologist Donna Moilanen. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 3,000 sites across the country are participating in this  
week's screening, the ninth annual. While hundreds of college 
campuses offer the screenings, only a few high schools take part. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, nine high schools, including Holliston, three middle  
schools and three school districts are participating in California, 
Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Canada, according to the 
National Mental Illness Screening Project, which administers the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Students answer 27 questions -- Do they feel hopeless? Have  
trouble concentrating? Feel sad? Contemplate suicide? -- on a scale 
of zero to 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Students tally up their points themselves after being told that  
scores of 20 or higher may indicate depression. The questionnaire 
is accompanied by names and telephone numbers they can call for 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	A high number doesn't automatically equal depression, said  
Moilanen, who expects about 10 percent of students will score in 
that range. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means there's cause for concern and we need to sit down and  
get that student some help,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average age of depression onset has been dropping over the  
years, and now hovers around 30, down from 40 several decades ago. 
An estimated 17 million to 20 million Americans suffer from 
depression each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Holliston decided to partake in the screenings after seeing the  
results of a state behavior survey taken by its students last year. 
Nearly one-quarter of the students said they had experienced 
suicidal thoughts, and 12 percent said they had tried to kill 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15- to  
24-year-olds nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	While societal stigma against depression is easing among adults,  
it remains taboo among teen-agers, said Carol Glod, who studies 
teen-age depression at McLean Hospital in Belmont and teaches the 
subject at Northeastern University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teen-agers and parents of teen-agers are very concerned about  
depression, but it's still a bad word,'' she said. ``No kid wants 
to say they're depressed and no parent wants to say `My child has 
an illness that's psychiatric.'''

<HEADLINE> Troubled Times for UCLA Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The trouble began late last season when  
UCLA's 20-game winning streak ended. And the trouble, on and off 
the field, hasn't stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been spoiled the last two years,'' coach Bob Toledo  
said. ``Sometimes, it takes a little luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten months ago, the Bruins blew a 17-point second-half lead to  
lose at Miami 49-45, preventing them from playing in the Fiesta 
Bowl for the national championship. Then came a 38-31 loss to 
Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI investigation into an alleged mobster's ties to UCLA  
players followed. Although the investigation failed to uncover any 
evidence of wrongdoing, the program was besmirched. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the handicapped parking scandal during the summer,  
resulting in 16 current or former Bruins pleading no contest to a 
misdemeanor charge and causing 10 players to be suspended for this 
season's first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, amid suspensions and injuries, the Bruins won just two  
of their first five games. And those were nothing to brag about, 
coming at home against Boise State and Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Toledo said, the Bruins had some bad luck in their latest  
loss, a 28-27 setback at Arizona State last Saturday in which the 
Sun Devils moved 80 yards on four plays to score the winning 
touchdown with 23 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a young team and they're learning,'' Toledo said.  
``I see us getting better. I'm going to coach hard, I'm going to 
get after them. It's a teaching process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA had won 15 straight Pac-10 games before losing at Stanford  
42-32 last month. The loss at ASU means the Bruins' chances of 
reaching the Rose Bowl again are, at best, minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still all sticking together,'' said linebacker Robert  
Thomas, one of the suspended players who has excelled since 
returning three games ago. ``The season's not over yet. We're going 
to strap it up, make sure we don't have a losing season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is the Bruins play four of their next five games  
at the Rose Bowl, where they've won 12 straight regular-season 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	And they're getting some injured players back, like standout  
wide receiver Danny Farmer, who sprained his ankle in August and 
missed two of UCLA's first four games. He had only three receptions 
before catching six for 148 yards at ASU. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins entered the season short on experience at  
quarterback. But they had one of the nation's finest corps of wide 
receivers in Farmer, Brian Poli-Dixon and Freddie Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell has been hampered by injuries and has caught just 14  
passes for 190 yards. Poli-Dixon broke his wrist in the third game 
and is out for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	What's happened to Cory Paus has been typical of the bad luck. A  
redshirt freshman, Paus shared the quarterbacking with junior Drew 
Bennett the first two games, then was selected the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	He completed his first eight passes and 9-of-12 overall for 113  
yards against Fresno State before he was sacked in the second 
quarter and left with a bruised chest and strained neck. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing the Stanford game, Paus returned and went just  
15-of-40 for 235 yards with two interceptions against ASU. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he played horribly. But as the Bruins prepare for  
Saturday night's game against Oregon, Paus is upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't gone the way we want it to go so far,'' he said.  
``But there's no reason why we can't win the rest of them.''

<HEADLINE> UCSB's Bell Faces Foot Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- UC Santa Barbara point guard Larry  
Bell fractured the fifth metatarsal in his right foot and will 
undergo surgery Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	UCSB coach Bob Williams said Bell will be in a cast for at least  
three weeks following the operation, and if all goes as 
anticipated, he will be able to play by mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, a senior, started 14 of UCSB's 28 games last season,  
including the final 12, and averaged 3.6 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 
a team-leading 4.3 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry is one of our leaders and a projected starter, so it  
will take its toll on us, but we look forward to his return,'' 
Williams said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Attack GOP Spending Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are using a House Republican  
proposal to cut spending across the board by 2.7 percent as a 
launching pad to attack them for considering harsh cuts in crucial, 
popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Republicans have not yet decided to pursue the cuts  
or what their final size would be, Democrats at the White House and 
the Capitol jumped on them Tuesday anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	As Republicans continued seeking ways to avoid spending Social  
Security's surpluses this year, Democrats trotted out their own 
examples of what they asserted such cuts would mean: Over 1 million 
low-income children denied federal education aid, perhaps 200,000 
fewer troops, up to 11 million fewer meals served by the Meal on 
Wheels program for the elderly and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could go on to what it would do to the NIH budget,'' said  
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, referring to the National 
Institutes of Health, ``what it would do to the FBI budgets, what 
it would do to our anti-terrorism efforts around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is like a blind date,'' said the top Democrat on the  
House Appropriations Committee, Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin. 
``Wait till the mask comes off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unsure whether they could push the plan through the House that  
they narrowly control, Republicans have not yet decided to use it. 
They also don't know precisely how deep the final cut would be 
because it is unclear if any programs would be exempted, such as 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, called the proposal ``a  
work in progress,'' and fired back. 
</P>
<P>
	``This White House wants to spend more money,'' he said.  
``Everything they do and say is designed to have more money to 
spend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said the idea has  
``currency'' among GOP lawmakers. But he said House leaders want to 
coordinate their savings with the Senate, and warned that proposed 
across-the-board spending reductions often end up getting 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as you talk about across-the-board cuts, everybody  
jumps up and salutes it, and then their second point is, 'But I 
have this very special program''' they want to exempt, Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called the plan  
``one of the options we could consider'' as spending bills are 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
	House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, and other  
GOP leaders proposed the across-the-board cuts at a closed meeting 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Their goal was to replace $8.7 billion in savings Republicans  
had planned on getting by delaying income-support payments to the 
poor, a plan that was severely wounded when top GOP presidential 
candidate George W. Bush, the Texas governor, lambasted it. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Kasich's presentation, the 13 fiscal 2000 spending  
bills would be cut by 2.7 percent. That would be about a $15 
billion cut, but because of the way some federal spending is 
delayed, only $8.7 billion of the savings would occur this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal 2000 began Oct. 1. So far, just four of the 13 bills have  
been signed into law.

<HEADLINE> States Push Up Against Y2K Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some states are moving precariously close to  
the new year without correcting Y2K computer problems in state-run 
programs such as food stamps and Medicaid that affect hundreds of 
millions of Americans, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Dates set by some states for completing their computer fixes are  
``so close to the turn of the century that the risk of disruption 
to their programs is substantially increased,'' said Joel 
Willemssen of the General Accounting Office, the investigative wing 
of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the Health and Human Services, Agriculture and  
Labor departments on Wednesday told the House Government Reform 
Committee panel overseeing the Y2K issue that the delays were 
worrisome, although they were confident service would not be 
disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Shirley Watkins, Agriculture's undersecretary for  
food, nutrition and consumer services, said it would be December 
before Georgia and Maryland will finish work on computers handling 
nutrition programs. Both, she said, will have backup systems to 
prevent service cutoffs in case of computer crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Hugler of the Labor Department said the District of  
Columbia won't fix its unemployment insurance program until the end 
of the year, and California still has some work left on its 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Many older computers read only the last two digits in a year and  
could malfunction if they mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 
1900. 
</P>
<P>
	A GAO report issued Wednesday to the Senate Finance Committee  
listed: 
</P>
<P>
	--New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina and the Virgin  
Islands as high risk in terms of having their Medicaid benefits 
systems ready. 
</P>
<P>
	--Alabama, Alaska, Massachusetts, Puerto Rico and the Virgin  
Islands as high risk for Medicaid information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma and  
the Virgin Islands as lagging in fixing computers related to food 
stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	--Alabama, California, Illinois, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North  
Carolina, Oklahoma, Utah and the Virgin Islands as still having 
work to do on their child support enforcement systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not acceptable,'' said Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif.,  
chairman of the government management subcommittee. ``More than 
$125 billion in federal taxpayer dollars flows into these programs 
each year, and millions of American families count on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agencies have been given high marks for moving quickly  
to fix Y2K problems, but of 43 federal programs deemed ``high 
impact,'' 10 are administered by the states and not one of those is 
considered fully Y2K compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Benzen of the National Association of State Information  
Resource Executives, which represents 48 state chief information 
officers, said the states overall are doing well, with the 43 
member states representing more than 94 percent of the nation's 
population now at least 75 percent compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzen said it was hard to classify state performances because  
the situation changes daily as they rush to complete work. For 
example, New Mexico, which got a high-risk rating for its Medicaid 
system, said problems it had in testing its computer upgrades have 
been resolved, and they expect to get a low-risk rating in the next 
review.

<HEADLINE> Edmundo Vanishes After Sentencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Police were combing the city  
Wednesday to arrest soccer star Edmundo, who vanished after a court 
upheld his conviction for manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrived early at Edmundo's home in a luxury condo in the  
beachfront Barra da Tijuca district, but employees said he wasn't 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmundo's lawyer, Arthur Lavigne, said in a televised interview  
that his client had not fled but was simply avoiding the press and 
would show up later. Attorneys reportedly filed for a writ of 
habeas corpus to allow Edmundo to stay out of jail while they try 
to change the conviction to community service. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a court sentenced Edmundo to 4 1/2 years in prison  
under a work release program that would allow him to spend nights 
in prison but leave to work during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal expert Clovis Sahione said a judge would have to decide  
whether Edmundo could play night games and said he likely would be 
prohibited from leaving Rio overnight. Many Brazilians expect 
Edmundo will get a deal that allows him to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The all-time scoring leader of the Brazilian first division with  
29 goals, Edmundo was a member of the Brazilian national team that 
finished second in the 1998 World Cup. After a stormy season with 
Italy's Fiorentina, he returned to Vasco da Gama this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 2, 1995, Edmundo's pickup truck collided with a car and  
flipped over. The car smashed into a pole, killing three 
passengers. The truck's air bag saved Edmundo, who received 10 
stitches in his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	At the trial, four witnesses said he was going at least 60 mph  
in a 40 mph zone. Witnesses also testified he had consumed a large 
amount of alcohol, although Edmundo said he had only two glasses of 
beer.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `The Limey' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Don't even think about messing with Dave Wilson. Chain smoking  
and dressed in black, this brash British ex-con is on a mission: 
Trek to Los Angeles and find his daughter's killer. 
</P>
<P>
	He rocks L.A. like an earthquake in ``The Limey.'' Director  
Steven Soderbergh, who created the independent smash ``sex, lies 
and videotape'' a decade ago, again offers an edgy, hip film with a 
terrific cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh from a nine-year prison term for one of his many  
white-collar schemes, Wilson (Terence Stamp) learns his estranged 
daughter, Jenny, has died in an explosive car crash in Los Angeles. 
The young woman moved there from England with dreams of stardom, 
and instead frolicked with record producer Terry Valentine (Peter 
Fonda). 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson thinks Jenny's death was no accident, and when he tracks  
down Valentine, he has all the more reason for suspicion. Tanned 
and trim with a blinding smile, Valentine reigns comfortably from 
his modern mansion in the Hollywood Hills, letting his tattooed 
thugs do his drug running on the streets below. 
</P>
<P>
	Soderbergh's Los Angeles isn't the sun-dappled, palm-tree-lined  
paradise so often depicted in films. It's smoggy, bleak and gray, 
full of sleazy people doing bad things. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson doesn't hesitate to sink to their level -- beating a few  
guys up, running their cars off the road, even firing a few rounds 
when necessary. But he finds a few decent souls, mostly actors and 
wannabes, who befriended Jenny and knew her in a way he never did. 
They help Wilson in his obsessive quest and hurtle along with him 
toward the film's surprising climax. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of what makes ``The Limey'' so sharp is how it plays with  
time and narrative structure in a stylish way, similar to ``Go'' 
and, before that, ``Pulp Fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's quite an ambitious approach, really. We see Wilson start  
telling a story in a coffee shop. All of a sudden, he's riding in a 
car at night. Seconds later, he's sitting in a modest motel room. 
Giant chunks of time seem to have flown by on screen, but the story 
he's telling stays intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Soderbergh's dreamlike, stream-of-consciousness directing style  
also is intriguing. As Wilson talks about the daughter he barely 
knew, grainy, black-and-white memories flash into the present-day 
action: Jenny playing with sand on the beach; flashing an impish 
grin; threatening to call the police to report his latest offense. 
We're right inside Wilson's head. 
</P>
<P>
	But Soderbergh at times relies on these techniques too heavily,  
making simple, linear storytelling seem really appealing only once 
in a while. 
</P>
<P>
	The cast is always strong, however. As the title character,  
Stamp is a man to be cheered and detested at the same time. He's a 
criminal to the core, but his sense of justice almost makes him 
noble. He was never there for his daughter when she was alive -- 
perhaps he can makes amends by avenging her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Fonda is in top form as Valentine, and there are lots of clever  
1960s references to remind us of his ``Easy Rider'' days. His 
character ranges from breezy arrogance to melancholy longing, as he 
clearly yearns for his high-flying youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Lesley Ann Warren is the lone source of peace and stability in  
the movie, playing an acting coach and former soap star who was a 
mother figure to Jenny. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the best moments come from a series of well-written  
scenes in which supporting characters banter about absolutely 
nothing. One of them features a hit-man heckling child actors on 
the set of a commercial. They provide a chorus of comic relief amid 
the intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Limey,'' an Artisan Entertainment release, was written by  
Lem Dobbs (``Romancing the Stone,'' ``Kafka''). It is rated R for 
strong language and violence and runs 87 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Auditors Criticize HUD Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Auditors in the Department of Housing and  
Urban Development have recommended shutting down a White 
House-praised program for reinvigorating the department, saying it 
is poorly run, a waste of money and riddled with politics. 
</P>
<P>
	But President Clinton supports the program so strongly his  
senior advisors have recommended that he veto an appropriations 
bill funding HUD if Republicans in Congress persist in trying to 
kill it. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD's inspector general's office, in a 150-page report issued  
Sept. 30, called the Community Builders program an ``overly 
expensive'' endeavor that exacerbates its long-standing management 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our opinion, HUD should discontinue the Community Builder  
position,'' said the report. ``It cannot afford the Community 
Builder concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program was created in 1997 to separate ``customer service''  
functions in HUD from the department's operation, monitoring, 
enforcement and policing of HUD's dozens of housing programs. At 
the time it was touted as one of Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo's 
efforts to overhaul HUD and do away with its reputation as a 
``poster child of inept government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was about not having the same person playing both good cop  
and bad cop,'' a senior HUD official said Wednesday, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD officials said 400 employees in the department were  
transferred into the Community Builders program and another 400 
were hired from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	But the department's auditors said the reorganization was not  
properly planned or implemented, and the department may have 
violated hiring rules in building its staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``To establish the Community Building position, HUD had to  
allocate salary, training and travel dollars, as well as personnel, 
from its monitoring and enforcement role at a time when the 
department was already significantly decreasing its workforce,'' 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The result, the auditors said, was an increase in the number of  
HUD employees ``not part of a specific program, engaged in customer 
relations and owing their jobs to the department's political 
management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a response, HUD officials said the audit was one-sided,  
politically motivated and timed to strengthen the Republican 
position as Congress and the White House scramble to finish the 
federal budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, this isn't about the merits of the Community Builders  
program,'' David Egner, a HUD spokesman, said Wednesday. ``It's 
just about scoring partisan political points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several independent consulting firms, including Ernst &AMP; Young,  
have praised the program as innovative and effective, Egner said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Friday, the White House Office of Management and  
Budget said Clinton's senior advisors would recommended a veto of 
the HUD spending bill because ``the administration strongly objects 
to the Senate's intention to eliminate the Community Builders 
Program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A letter signed by 17 Democratic senators Wednesday praised  
Community Builders and urged Appropriations Committee Chairman 
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., to allow lawmakers to reconsider a plan to 
reduce or eliminate it. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum, it is clearly far too early to judge whether the  
program should be terminated,'' the letter said. ``In addition, the 
current bill significantly reduces HUD staff, thereby undermining 
the department's efforts to reorganize and improve its service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HUD and the department's independent inspector general's office  
have clashed before. An apparent feud between Inspector General 
Susan Gaffney and top housing officials spilled into the public in 
March, when Deputy Secretary Saul Ramirez told a Senate 
subcommittee that Gaffney had taken a ``destructive, attack 
approach'' to the department.

<HEADLINE> Chief Wahoo Opponents Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Protesters opposed to the Cleveland Indians'  
Chief Wahoo mascot rallied peacefully Wednesday outside of Jacobs 
Field before the AL divisional playoff game between Cleveland and 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Wahoo has long been criticized as insensitive and  
demeaning, particularly by American Indians and church groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully people will understand that we're not against  
Cleveland baseball,'' protest organizer Juan Renya said. ``We're 
against Cleveland racism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, protesters have demonstrated against the  
Indians nickname and the Wahoo mascot outside the stadium on 
opening day and during baseball's playoffs and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year and in 1997, demonstrators were arrested for burning  
Wahoo in effigy. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians owner Dick Jacobs has repeatedly said he will not change  
the team's nickname, but he is planning to sell the team.

the yen. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	``A lot of short-covering is going on, especially after players  
went short on the cash and futures markets yesterday,'' said

<HEADLINE> Carter Presses for Hearst Pardon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Former President Carter, who commuted Patty  
Hearst's prison sentence two decades ago, is urging President 
Clinton to pardon the newspaper heiress. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been a model citizen in every way,'' Carter told the Los  
Angeles Times in a story published today. ``The fact is she 
deserves the pardon. Her oldest daughter has just entered college. 
And all this time, Patty has not been able to vote, she's not been 
a full-fledged American citizen. And I think she's one special 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter has been in contact with Clinton, Vice President Al Gore  
and Attorney General Janet Reno about the pardon, Carter 
spokeswoman Carrie Harmon said today in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that President Carter has felt strongly  
about for a long time and communicated with the Bush administration 
about as well,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said he was  
unaware of any contact between Carter and Clinton about a pardon. 
``None that I know of,'' Lockhart said. ``I don't know of any 
conversations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst Shaw, who now uses her married name, was kidnapped by the  
radical Symbionese Liberation Army on Feb. 4, 1974, when she was a 
19-year-old college student. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father, Randolph Hearst, publisher of the San Francisco  
Examiner, sponsored a food giveaway in an attempt to meet the SLA's 
demand that he feed the poor in San Francisco. But the group 
refused to let her go, and she ultimately joined her abductors, 
assumed the name Tania and denounced her wealthy parents. Two 
months after the kidnapping, she was photographed carrying a 
carbine during an SLA holdup of a San Francisco bank. 
</P>
<P>
	She was captured by the FBI in 1976 and sentenced to seven years  
in prison for her part in the robbery. She had served 21 months 
when Carter commuted her sentence in January 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst Shaw, now 45, married her former bodyguard, Bernard Shaw,  
and they live in Connecticut with their daughters, Lydia, 14, and 
Gillian, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Since her release from prison, she has become a celebrity,  
appearing in John Waters two movies and several television sitcoms, 
writing novels and doing charitable work. 
</P>
<P>
	She declined comment on Carter's efforts.  
</P>
<P>
	``She wants to express her gratitude for President Carter's  
confidence in her,'' her attorney, George Martinez, said. ``She is 
quite moved by his support. He has been her refuge in a sea of 
misunderstanding.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Mayor Race Is Neck-and-Neck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With four weeks remaining until Election  
Day, Republican Sam Katz and Democrat John F. Street are tied in 
the race for Philadelphia mayor, according to a new poll released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz, a businessman, is seeking to become Philadelphia's first  
Republican mayor in half a century, while Street, a former City 
Council president, would be the city's second black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	If the election were held today, Katz would get 39 percent of  
the vote and Street would get 38 percent, according to the Keystone 
Poll conducted by the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at 
Millersville University. More than one in five voters were still 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz has gotten crossover endorsements from former Democratic  
candidates Happy Fernandez and John White Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has seven Democrats for every two Republicans.  
Forty percent of the city's 1.4 million residents are black. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, 37 percent of the respondents identified crime  
and drugs as the most important issue facing the city, followed by 
education at 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 361 registered Democrats, 101 registered  
Republicans, and 58 independents and members of other parties was 
taken Friday through Monday and has an error margin of plus or 
minus 4.3 percentage points. It was conducted for the Philadelphia 
Daily News and Fox News, Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Article Leaves Broncos Seething </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- ``We're finished.''  
</P>
<P>
	The quote on the cover of Sports Illustrated's Oct. 11 issue is  
attributed to an unidentified member of the defending Super Bowl 
champion Denver Broncos, who are 0-4 and seem to be a magnet for 
internal turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	It did not sit well in Denver's locker room Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``The disturbing part is that's going to be the feeling  
throughout the country,'' fullback Howard Griffith said. ``The 
cover of that magazine pretty much says it all, and that's the way 
we're going to be portrayed. People are going to think the whole 
team feels that way, but that's not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos coach Mike Shanahan was less diplomatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``I call people out,'' he said. ``No. 1, if you say it and you  
won't stand up for it, you're a coward. And if you feel that way 
after four losses, after the success that we've had and have given 
up on the season after four games, I don't want you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The story, by Michael Silver, was written following Denver's  
21-13 loss to the New York Jets on Sunday. It described a dinner 
scene where one player pointed to a barrel of microbrew vats and 
said, ``See that big tank on the right? That's where I'm headed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another player stood up, stuck a fork to his chest and yelled,  
``We're done,'' according to the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was terrible. It was a bad way of doing business between  
people who you were taking to dinner,'' Denver defensive end Alfred 
Williams said. ``I wouldn't expect any of my dinner conversations 
to come up in any newspaper, no matter what the situation was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver said Wednesday he understands why some players would be  
upset, but explained that he was trying to give readers an idea of 
how the Broncos are dealing with adversity in the wake of two Super 
Bowl championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying these quotes mean the Broncos will quit,''  
Silver said. ``I liken it to that feeling where you're falling off 
a cliff and just when you realize you're about to crash land, you 
have some fun in your free-fall. I don't take it literally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver also emphasized that the ``We're finished'' quote came in  
the locker room after the Jets game. He said about 15 players -- 
``virtually one from every position'' -- had similar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos have given people little reason to believe they can  
become the first team in NFL history to start the season 0-4 and 
win a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver lost MVP running back Terrell Davis to a season-ending  
knee injury Sunday and are embroiled in a quarterback controversy 
that started when Shanahan benched Bubby Brister during training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan on Wednesday reinstated Brister after Brian Griese  
failed to get a win in the first four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos also placed Davis on injured reserve and replaced  
him on the active roster with offensive lineman Evan Pilgrim. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' backup, Derek Loville, pulled up in practice Wednesday  
with a slight injury to his left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he felt a slight cramp, like a charley horse,''  
Shanahan said. ``He doesn't think it's too serious. We didn't want 
to push him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lamentable start to the 1999 season prompted Denver fans to  
lash out, booing Griese during the Jets game and leaving the 
stadium when the Broncos still had a chance to win in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Brister made an obscene gesture toward a group  
of taunting fans, and one spectator threw a metal object that hit 
cornerback Dale Carter just below his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting to realize that we can only depend on  
ourselves,'' running back Derek Loville said. ``Our fans are acting 
crazy. We're getting hit from every angle. People in the media are 
taking jabs at us now. That's fine because there's going to come a 
time when we're back on top and everyone will be patting us on the 
back.''

<HEADLINE> Rider: Plane Worries Kept Me Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Isaiah Rider mended fences with coach  
Lenny Wilkens, then hit the court after missing the first day of 
the Atlanta Hawks' training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived Wednesday and took a physical, then joined his  
teammates for the afternoon practice at the University of Tennessee 
at Chattanooga. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider blamed his absence on the plane he was to fly in from his  
home in Oakland, Calif., to the team's camp here. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he went to the airport gate after a short layover and  
saw a commuter jet he called a ``crop-duster plane'' and refused to 
get on. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can believe it or not believe it,'' Rider said. ``You can  
check on it. It doesn't matter to me. I don't ride those type of 
planes and that was my decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider, who has a troubled history in the NBA, also acknowledged  
he had reconsidered his role with the Hawks, saying he was 
discouraged by the idea of joining a team that was rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really not motivated,'' he said. ``I was really looking  
honestly maybe to move on and to see if they could move me on 
because I want to win, and that's what it's all about for me. It's 
not about having a big year and getting a lot of money in my 
contract. That's secondly. Firstly, I want to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider missed a mandatory media gathering in Atlanta and three  
practices before he arrived Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not comment further about his lack of contact with the  
team the last two days, but said he was encouraged after talking to 
Wilkens and would begin practice Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize that we're a lot better than I thought we were,''  
Rider said. ``If I come and do my thing, maybe I can get this team 
over the hump, and in turn that will satisfy my soul and make me 
happy at the end of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Pete Babcock, who spent the last few days trying  
to track down Rider, said he spoke with the guard about ``the 
realities of the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I empathize with him. I understood his concerns. It doesn't  
relieve him of his responsibilities,'' Babcock said. ``If he comes 
in and makes a major contribution and handles himself well, we'll 
make every effort to keep him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider has averaged 18 points during his six-year career, showing  
the ability to dominate at the offensive end and thrive in an 
up-tempo offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks decided the 28-year-old guard was the kind of player  
they needed to improve their speed, quickness and creativity after 
ranking as the second-worst offensive team in the NBA last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks acquired Rider and Jimmy Jackson in an August trade  
with the Portland Trail Blazers despite his record of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He showed up late for his first pro practice with the Minnesota  
Timberwolves in 1993 and has been adding to his list of offenses 
ever since, including feuds with coaches and convictions for 
marijuana possession and assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkens, entering his 27th season as an NBA head coach, said  
he's never had a player disappear before the start of training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will see this situation is different than any one he's ever  
been in,'' Wilkens said.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai To Sell TVs to North Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The South Korean government approved  
Wednesday a plan by the Hyundai group to sell 30,000 TV sets to 
North Korea on a deferred payment arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, worth $4.45 million, reflects Hyundai's growing  
business links with North Korea. Under a $942 million deal, the 
largest South Korean conglomerate launched a sightseeing cruise of 
a scenic North Korean mountain in November. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea will pay for the shipment over five years starting  
in 2001, Hyundai officials said, but the first of the 20-inch sets 
will leave for North Korea later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai is pushing a number of business projects in North Korea,  
including construction of a large-scale industrial park where it 
plans to relocate 800 to 900 garment and other labor-intensive 
South Korean factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai plans to use surplus South Korean electricity for the  
park, which will be built on North Korea's southwest coast, close 
to the border with South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Korean government encourages expansion of business  
with North Korea under its engagement policy towards the isolated 
communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and  
the capitalist South in 1945. The Koreas are technically still at 
war, because their 1950-53 Korean War ended with a shaky armistice, 
not a permanent peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> WorldCom Boss a Modest Billionaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLINTON, Miss. (AP) -- In this town where roads are made of  
brick, cars are left unlocked and college kids dart in and out of 
coffee shops, Bernard J. Ebbers is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 native of Edmonton, Alberta, came here in the late  
1960s to play basketball for Mississippi College, a private school 
with more than 3,600 students. Today, the 58-year-old billionaire 
lives in Brookhaven but the center of his life's work -- MCI 
WorldCom Inc.-- is in Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	To townspeople, he is Bernie Ebbers, not only the boss to 900  
MCI WorldCom employees, but also the vice chairman of the 
Mississippi College board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He comes to ball games,'' said Howell W. Todd, Mississippi  
College president. ``He's very loyal to this institution. He's very 
keen on our philosophy and mission, and in ensuring that we carry 
out that mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is also quiet and faithful and once canceled a Saturday night  
business function with the Metro Jackson Chamber of Commerce so he 
could finish preparing the lesson for Sunday school the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he is a deeply spiritual man; his faith is extremely  
important to him, and his values,'' said Todd. 
</P>
<P>
	It might be faith that helped prompt Ebbers, whose early jobs  
included that of basketball coach and small-chain motel owner, to 
invest in a tiny long-distance company called Long Distance 
Discount Services, even though he knew little about the phone 
business. That was in 1983, just before AT&AMP;T was dismembered. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned that company, an idea drawn up in a Hattiesburg coffee  
shop, into the nation's second-largest telecommunications company 
with net income last year of $2.6 billion and an overall value 
around $117.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	LDDS has been involved in 60 mergers since it was born. Before  
Tuesday, Ebbers' biggest deal was when his company, renamed 
WorldCom, bought MCI Communications. Now, he's maneuvered MCI 
Worldcom to take over Sprint Corp., in a $115 billion deal that is 
the largest corporate acquisition in history. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was surprised about the latest announcement; analysts had  
been saying MCI WorldCom needed Sprint for its wireless segment. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ebbers realized that, too, his friends say.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's safe to say that Bernie is always a step or two  
ahead of the rest of us,'' said Duane O'Neill, president of the 
Metro Jackson Chamber of Commerce. ``He's a true visionary in that 
he makes it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebbers, a former cowboy and soybean rancher, is credited with  
methodically making his company grow and remain profitable and 
competitive in an era of corporate mergers that has set the entire 
industry on its ear. 
</P>
<P>
	None of which surprises Todd, who has known Ebbers for five  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is very unassuming; doesn't want to draw a lot of attention  
to himself,'' says Todd. ``But beware because underneath all that 
laid-back attitude is a steel-trap mind and one of the sharpest, 
shrewdest individuals I've ever known. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can look at the company and see that.''

<HEADLINE> Post Office Hails On-Time Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The post office delivered 94 percent of local  
mail on schedule during the three months that ended Sept. 30, the 
agency reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's up from 93 percent for the corresponding period a year  
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our best performance ever in meeting the needs of our  
customers,'' said Postmaster General William J. Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The on-time rate is calculated by the independent firm of  
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which sends test mailings across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Postal Service has established performance goals in  
most of the nation with the aim of delivering local mail overnight 
within each area. The areas cover the 465 ZIP codes in which 80 
percent of the mail is delivered. 
</P>
<P>
	The national score means that 94 percent of local mail was  
delivered on time in those performance areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Highest scoring areas at 96 percent were the Omaha,  
Neb.-Wichita, Kan., region and Springfield, Mass.

<HEADLINE> Bush Makes Early Move To Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After George W. Bush condemned a House  
Republican proposal to squeeze budget savings out of a program for 
the working poor, the irked sponsor said the governor needed an 
education on the way Congress works. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush knew well enough to have it work to his political  
advantage on that point. Now he is chiding the GOP more broadly for 
casting a negative image. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was making the case that the conservative philosophy is the  
compassionate philosophy,'' the GOP presidential front-runner said 
Wednesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was moving toward the political center, where the vital  
swing vote will be in the 2000 general election. It's early for 
that; in the Republican primaries that come first, conservative 
votes are crucial. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard M. Nixon once said a Republican candidate has to move  
far enough right to get nominated, then far enough to the center to 
get elected. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush's towering lead -- in the polls, in campaign money, and  
in party allies -- opens the option of playing to the center sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	None of which alters Bush's self description: compassionate  
conservative. What he's doing is defining the terms his way. 
``Conservatism has become the creed of hope,'' he said. ``The creed 
of aggressive, persistent reform. The creed of social progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Predictably, rival candidates seeking conservative support in  
the primaries said Bush doesn't deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us seem to be embracing the idea that the way to win  
is to be everything to everybody,'' said Gary Bauer. Steve Forbes 
said it amounted to declaring war on the conservative movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also is putting space between his campaign and the  
Republican-led Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	He's more popular than they are. And Republican leaders are  
struggling to produce an already-tardy budget that will force cuts 
in programs popular with voters, to balance the books without 
borrowing from Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush agrees with the goal, but he doesn't have to sign on to the  
details. He is campaigning for president, not drafting budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional job approval ratings are sagging in public opinion  
polls, and the budget crunch is still to come. President Clinton 
gained in earlier rounds, in 1995 when Republicans got the blame 
for government shutdowns, and in 1998, in a compromise that 
included spending he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	So there are perils for a presidential candidate tied tightly to  
Congress. Bob Dole suffered them when he was both the 1996 
nominee-in-waiting, and the Senate majority leader. His answer was 
to quit the Senate, his career for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's answer is to pick his spots and make his points, on  
programs and philosophy. He can't run against Congress, especially 
one in which 147 House Republicans and 20 senators have endorsed 
him. So his comments in a New York speech on Tuesday about his 
party's negative outlook did not directly blame Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's where the GOP record is being written.  
</P>
<P>
	Too often, Bush said, the Republican Party has painted an image  
of hopeless cultural and social decline, and ``has focused on the 
national economy to the exclusion of all else, speaking a sterile 
language of rates and numbers. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Too often, my party has confused the need for limited  
government with a disdain for government itself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said that is not an option for conservatives, whose goal  
should be limited government, ``focused, effective and energetic 
... doing a few things and doing them well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting stuff done here, real stuff, compassionate  
conservative stuff,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, the fellow Texan behind 
the budget maneuver Bush helped derail. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay had proposed, and other House GOP leaders had agreed to a  
plan in which $8.7 billion would have been taken out of the current 
budget by shifting from lump sum to monthly payments to recipients 
of the earned income tax credit, which pays an average of $1,890 a 
year to low-income families. Senate leaders saw the image problem 
and said it wouldn't pass there, but the House hierarchy was going 
ahead -- until Bush weighed in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs  
of the poor,'' he said at a campaign news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay denied his plan would have done that. ``It's obvious Mr.  
Bush needs a little education on how Congress works,'' said the 
Houston Republican, who has endorsed Bush for the nomination. ``I 
don't think he knew what he was talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his opposition undercut the proposal. Republican leaders are  
talking now of across-the-board spending cuts instead. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Springer Wants Free Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins knuckle-baller Dennis Springer, who  
has pitched for five teams in the past five seasons, exercised his 
right to free agency Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer had a 6-11 record with a 4.86 ERA with the Marlins this  
year. He pitched a team-high 196 1-3 innings, giving up 231 hits 
and 64 walks. He struck out 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer, who was 3-11 with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1998, is  
17-29 in his major league career, which began with Philadelphia in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins also optioned infielder-outfielder John Roskos and  
infielder Chris Clapinski to AAA Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	Roskos, who hit .167 in 13 games this season, has exercised his  
right to free agency. Clapinski, signed with Calgary for the 2000 
season. He hit .232 in 56 at-bats with the Marlins in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Nixon, Kissinger: Viet Chat on Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Nixon's policy in Vietnam was  
faltering. 
</P>
<P>
	A major offensive had just ended in March 1971 with desperate  
South Vietnamese soldiers clinging to U.S. helicopters making a 
hasty retreat. U.S. military leaders in Southeast Asia complained 
that Washington was meddling. And according to a newly released 
secret Nixon tape, the on-the-ground commander of U.S. troops was 
tipping the bottle a bit early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Nixon and Henry Kissinger, his national security adviser,  
rationalized in a candid Oval Office conversation that the largest 
attack that U.S.-backed South Vietnamese troops had launched 
against communist forces to date hadn't been a complete failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider the operation a major achievement even with all the  
screw-ups,'' Kissinger said during their chat on March 23, 1971. 
``I must tell you, Mr. President, quite candidly that ... our 
people let us down -- not the South Vietnamese. They let us down in 
the first three weeks, then they complained to you that I was 
interfering too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger offered a stinging criticism of Gen. Creighton Abrams  
Jr., commander of U.S. military forces in Vietnam from 1968 to 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	``Abrams went every weekend to Thailand, for Christ's sake, to  
see his family when we had our whole thing riding on this thing,'' 
he said. Kissinger later added: ``Abrams is drinking now in the 
middle of the day. I really think we ought to consider replacing 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon's conversation with Kissinger was among 445 hours of tape  
recordings released Tuesday by the National Archives, more than 
doubling the number of hours of Nixon tapes previously available 
for public listening. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes, covering events from February to August 1971, include  
conversations about China, the environment, unemployment and 
anti-war demonstrations. The recordings capture a worried Nixon 
crafting a strategy to attack his perceived enemies following the 
leak of the Pentagon Papers, a classified government study of U.S. 
involvement in Vietnam that was published by The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 1, 1971, Nixon lectured his chief of staff, H.R.  
Haldeman: ``We're up against an enemy, a conspiracy,'' Nixon says, 
rapping on a desk to underscore his message. ``We are going to use 
any means, is that clear?'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he learned that papers from the liberal-leaning Brookings  
Institution think tank had not yet been ``raided,'' as he'd 
ordered, Nixon raised his voice and admonished Haldeman to ``Get it 
done! I want it done! I want the Brookings safe cleaned out!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another conversation, Nixon calls the Supreme Court ``a  
disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a senile old ... in (Justice Hugo) Black. You've  
got an old fool and a black fool in that (Justice) Thurgood 
Marshall. Then you've got (Justice William) Brennan, I mean, a 
jackass Catholic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another, Nixon complains about Jewish people in the  
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to look at any sensitive areas where Jews are involved,  
Bob,'' Nixon tells Haldeman. There are exceptions, he said, but, 
``Generally, you can't trust the bastards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from the Richard Nixon Library &AMP; Birthplace  
Foundation in Yorba Linda, Calif., who reviewed the tapes insisted 
the president was not anti-Semitic. It noted his many Jewish 
advisers and said: ``The president's words about the Jewish 
community on these tapes show that his basic sense of compassion 
and support for these communities tends to coexist with terminology 
from an earlier time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes also offer a behind-the-scenes glimpse of life in the  
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	On one tape, Nixon complains that the hot water in his shower  
runs cold after about a minute. He wants it fixed so the water 
``will run hot as long as I want to keep the damn hot water on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in early 1971, it was the Vietnam War that consumed hours of  
tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger regarded the offensive to cut North Vietnamese supply  
lines in Laos in March as a key test of the South Vietnamese Army's 
readiness to defend its people. That was the thrust of Nixon's 
``Vietnamization'' policy: Pull out American troops, yet continue 
to provide support to keep South Vietnam from falling into 
communist hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Media coverage of this withdrawal tended to emphasize its  
disorderly aspects, although it was the president's view that the 
operation had achieved its goal,'' the Nixon foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the tape, Kissinger said film on the evening news of South  
Vietnamese soldiers hanging from the landing skids of American 
choppers was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you analyze the pictures ... interestingly, they are  
wearing their field packs and carrying their rifles,'' Kissinger 
tells Nixon. ``This is not a rabble that's running for the 
helicopters. These are combat soldiers coming out with their 
weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Kutler, a Nixon historian and author, disagrees. ``It  
was a total defeat,'' he said of the operation -- one of the first 
signs that Nixon's Vietnamese policy would not work. ``The South 
Vietnamese cut and ran.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Arrested in 1991 Texas Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Authorities in Texas and West Virginia  
arrested four men Wednesday in one of Texas' most sensational 
unsolved crimes: the slaying of four teen-age girls at an Austin 
yogurt shop nearly eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects were teen-agers at the time of the killings, and  
three of them attended the same high school in Austin -- though none 
went to school with the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 6, 1991, the girls were shot in the head in an apparent  
robbery at the I Can't Believe It's Yogurt! shop where two of them 
worked. The store then was set on fire in a crime that horrified 
the community because of its random brutality and the youth of the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a long and difficult road for all of us in this  
community,'' said Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle. 
``We have all taken it personally for all these years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Charleston W.Va., police Maj. Pat Epperhart said Robert Burns  
Springsteen Jr., 24, was arrested Wednesday morning at a home in 
the city. Springsteen was charged in Texas with capital murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael James Scott, 25, of Buda, Texas, was arrested in the  
Austin area. Maurice Pierce, 24, was arrested in Lewisville, north 
of Dallas, and Forrest Wellborn, 23, was picked up in Lockhart, 
southeast of Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen was held without bail in West Virgina. Scott was  
held without bail in the Travis County Jail. They were 17 at the 
time of the crime and face a maximum punishment of life prison or 
death if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Earle said his office would move immediately to have Springsteen  
returned to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellborn and Pierce, who were 16 and 15 at the time of the  
killings, were charged as juveniles. Earle said he would seek to 
have them tried as adults, but they would face a maximum sentence 
of life in prison if convicted. Judge Jeanne Meurer set bonds of $1 
million for Wellborn and $1.5 million for Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott and Springsteen told police that they and the others  
planned the robbery earlier on the evening of the killings, 
according to affidavits filed with arrest warrants. They went into 
the yogurt shop and unlocked the back door, returned later, took 
money from the store, then shot and killed each of the girls, 
according to the warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen's neighbors in Charleston told police he had been  
bragging about the slayings, Epperhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen was believed to have been in West Virginia since  
leaving Austin in 1992, Epperhart said. He said he did not know 
what Springsteen had been doing since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The four victims were Eliza Hope Thomas, 17; Amy Ayers, 13;  
Jennifer Harbison, 17; and Sarah Harbison, 15; Jennifer's sister. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second anniversary of the killings, Austin police said  
they had investigated more than 5,000 leads without an arrest. 
Their investigations took them down several dead ends. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, a man in Mexico reportedly confessed to the killings  
and was sentenced to prison for an unrelated murder. The man later 
recanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also speculated that a killer by the name of  
Kenneth Allen McDuff may have been involved, because he was 
convicted of abducting and murdering a young Austin woman at a car 
wash. McDuff was executed in 1998 without shedding any light on the 
yogurt shop case.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Are Mixed / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond trading lacked any clear direction  
Thursday. Analysts said investors were digesting the Federal 
Reserve Board's decision Tuesday not to raise interest rates, and 
already speculating about next month's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/16  
point, or 63 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
generally moves in the opposite direction, was unchanged at 6.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Uncertainty over what the Fed might do at its next meeting  
scheduled for Nov. 16 led many investors to shy away from long-term 
bonds and concentrate on shorter-termed three-month and six-month 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe statements released by Fed policymakers indicate a  
preference toward a rate hike next month, a belief that fueled 
Tuesday's sharp selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, investors were apparently seeking the relative  
safety of short-term interest-bearing assets while they prepare for 
upcoming economic data releases. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of both short-term Treasury  
securities fell 1/16 point, while intermediate maturities ranged 
from a decline of 1/16 point to a gain of 1/16 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the yield on three-month Treasury was 4.78  
percent, as the discount fell 0.06 point from Monday's auction to 
4.66 percent. The six-month yield was 5.06 percent as the discount 
fell 0.05 percentage point to 4.86 percent. One-year yields and 
discounts were unchanged at 5.31 percent and 5.04 percent, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay at maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.19 percent from 5.00 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/32 to 111 15/32. The average yield to 
maturity of the index was 5.94 percent, up from 5.93 percent.

<HEADLINE> Few Small Biz Takers for Y2K Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lots of loan money remains to help small  
businesses tackle technology problems associated with the new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly $495 million.  
</P>
<P>
	For the few keeping count, that represents nearly 99 percent of  
the maximum $500 million that had been earmarked for possible use 
last spring for the Small Business Administration's Y2K Action Loan 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not many loans,'' conceded Michael Stamler, an SBA spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
	The federal government had been bracing for heavy demand among  
the nation's estimated 24 million small businesses for financial 
help in replacing computer equipment or software in anticipation of 
any Y2K computer problems. Last April, President Clinton signed a 
law mandating the SBA program, which authorizes the federal backing 
of as much as $500 million in private-sector loans. 
</P>
<P>
	As of early October, only 58 Y2K Action loans, totaling $4.6  
million, were completed. That's nationwide. The loan amounts ranged 
from $14,000 to $720,000. 
</P>
<P>
	So, does that mean most small businesses don't need the help?  
</P>
<P>
	``Probably a third of small businesses have already taken care  
of their Y2K difficulty, and they're in the process of testing and 
preparing for Jan. 1,'' Stamler said. ``Another third is ... hoping 
to get inexpensive versions of corrected software and hardware ... 
without borrowing funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other third is just going to wait and see what happens.''  
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, a recent survey by The Willard &AMP; Shullman Group in  
Greenwich, Conn., shows that more than half of small businesses 
have, in fact, made some plans for the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-eight percent reported they have or will complete the Y2K  
preparation process by the end of 1999, 22 percent planned to do 
nothing, while 19 percent weren't sure what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The smallest of the small businesses tend to fall in the last  
two categories, said Jane Applegate, who runs a small business 
consulting firm in Pelham, N.Y. And a small number of the smallest 
of small businesses may not even use a computer, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the majority of businesses who do depend on a computer  
to ring up sales, keep track of inventory or pay bills, ``they 
can't just stick their heads in the sand,'' Applegate said. ``Y2K 
preparation definitely should be on a small business' 'to-do' 
list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many small businesses could face temporary disruptions, and lost  
income, if they fail to take the Y2K problem seriously, some 
economists say. 
</P>
<P>
	The SBA loans issued this year will be used to upgrade computer  
systems and software, some of which may only recognize the last two 
digits of a year and could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead 
of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The loans made next year, by Dec. 31, 2000, will help companies  
recover from any uninsured damage caused by Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Loan terms are generous: The SBA will guarantee 90 percent on  
Y2K loans of $100,000 or less and up to 85 percent on Y2K loans 
over $100,000, up to $1 million. The SBA will allow a year's 
moratorium on repayment if a borrower runs into difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K program is part of the SBA's guaranteed business loan  
program known as the 7(a) program. Further information about it can 
be obtained by contacting the SBA at 1-800-U-ASK-SBA or visiting 
the SBA web site (www.sba.gov).

<HEADLINE> Activists Protest U.S. on AIDS Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 200 AIDS activists blocked traffic  
outside the office of Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky on 
Wednesday to protest against U.S. policies they say defeat 
developing countries' efforts to get AIDS drugs. Fourteen were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the group ACT UP held signs, chanted slogans and tied  
up traffic outside Barshefsky's office on 17th Street about a block 
from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	They accused Barshefsky of supporting U.S. pharmaceutical  
companies by using the threat of economic sanctions to prevent 
developing countries from producing generic drugs vital in the 
fight against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think that's an accurate picture,'' said Tom  
Tripp, a spokesman with the U.S. Trade Representative's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to recognize there's a complementary relationship  
between issues like public health policy and the protection of 
intellectual property rights,'' Tripp said, which include patent 
agreements. ``It's not one or the other; you have to work them 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators contended the U.S. government supports large  
pharmaceutical companies who want to maintain high prices for 
drugs. The mix of drugs necessary for AIDS patients is too 
expensive for most residents of developing countries, said Julie 
Davids, a spokeswoman with ACT UP. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization had been demonstrating for months against U.S.  
policies toward South Africa after that country passed a law giving 
itself unspecified power to import AIDS drugs from counties where 
they are sold more cheaply or to license production within South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States was pressuring South Africa to amend the 1997  
law but backed down last month after South Africa signed an 
agreement not to implement it in a way that would violate patent 
rights or other world trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore had urged trade officials to work out  
some kind of deal with South Africa after ACT UP protesters started 
dogging him at public appearances, including political events 
promoting his 2000 presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, activists say, the trade office is still restricting other  
developing countries from getting affordable lifesaving medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving lives in Thailand, Brazil and India is just as vital as  
saving lives in South Africa,'' Chris Kimmenez of ACT UP said in a 
statement before the protest.

<HEADLINE> Report: FBI Fired Shots at Davidians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An expert hired by the House Government Reform  
Committee says he believes an FBI agent fired shots during the 
bureau's 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	That view, expressed in an interview published in today's  
editions of The Washington Post, is at odds with the FBI's position 
that none of its agents fired shots at any time during the siege in 
which about 80 people died. 
</P>
<P>
	The expert in thermal imaging and videotape analysis, Carlos  
Ghigliotti, has done work for the FBI in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I conclude that the FBI fired shots on that day,'' Ghigliotti  
told the Post in an interview conducted Tuesday. ``I conclude this 
based on the ground-view videotapes taken from several different 
angles simultaneously and based on the overheard thermal tape. The 
gunfire from the ground is there, without a doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghigliotti, owner of Infrared Technologies Corp., in Laurel,  
Md., said the tapes also confirm that the Davidians fired at FBI 
agents repeatedly during the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Although FBI agents were operating under rules that permitted  
them to return fire, bureau officials have maintained that no 
agents fired any shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghigliotti is not asserting that any injuries or deaths were  
caused by FBI gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the Post he reached his conclusion after spending  
hundreds of hours reviewing various tapes of the siege, including a 
newly released FBI audio recording that was part of a videotape 
turned over to Congress recently in response to a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the committee that retained  
Ghigliotti said ``it is premature to make any final 
determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to go off half-cocked,'' Burton told the Post.  
``As soon as we get all the necessary information, we will hold 
hearings and present the information to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., has been appointed by  
Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate FBI actions at Waco.

<HEADLINE> Martinez Ready for Indians' Best  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pedro Martinez is daring the Cleveland Indians  
to figure him out. 
</P>
<P>
	Go ahead, Boston's ace said. Take a few pitches. Foul a couple  
off. Step out of the batter's box if you have to. See if I care. 
</P>
<P>
	Flashing a trademark cockiness that's as lethal as his fastball,  
Martinez said Tuesday he's not worried about the Indians trying new 
tactics against him in this year's AL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll see what they bring to the table,'' Martinez said. ``If  
it doesn't work for them, it might be too late. Somehow, I've got 
to stay in the strike zone and somehow they have to swing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winless against Martinez the past two seasons, the Indians have  
drawn up a new blueprint for the postseason designed to defeat 
baseball's most dominant player tonight in Game 1 of the best-of-5 
division series. 
</P>
<P>
	They're planning to work Martinez deep into the count by fouling  
off good pitches, not chasing bad ones. They won't overswing. 
They'll run on the right-hander. They'll score early, stay close 
and hope he wears down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what we have to do,'' Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds great, right? Well, everyone has a plan for Martinez.  
</P>
<P>
	Then they have to step into the batter's box.  
</P>
<P>
	Martinez isn't worried about any new tricks the Indians might  
have planned for him. Or that Cleveland was the first team in 49 
years to score more than 1,000 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	No, Martinez is just glad of one thing -- he doesn't have to face  
the Florida Marlins this October. They roughed him up for nine runs 
in 3 2-3 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess they were the strongest team I faced all year,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Take that, Indians.  
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, who will be opposed by Cleveland ace Bartolo Colon,  
had a mind-boggling regular season. In a year when softball-like 
scores became the daily norm in baseball, Martinez put up 
astounding stats. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 23-4 with a 2.07 ERA, nearly three runs lower than the  
league average (4.86). He struck out 313 hitters in 213 1-3 
innings, walking just 37. He held opponents to a .206 batting 
average, .247 on-base percentage and .289 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL Cy Young is in the bag, and Martinez might win the league  
MVP award, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a player, I did not think that a pitcher should be the  
MVP,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said. ``As a manager, I kind 
of feel the same way. Pedro, though, may be the exception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston manager Jimy Williams, who played for St. Louis when Bob  
Gibson was in his prime and has been in baseball for more than 30 
years, isn't sure he has ever seen anything like the year Martinez 
is having. 
</P>
<P>
	``You realize what you're seeing with this kid? What he's doing  
with that ball?'' Williams said. ``Especially when the ERA in the 
American League is what it is. Especially when throughout all of 
baseball, to have 20 homers today is nothing or 30, 40 or 60. He 
has that ability to take that baseball and stop some awfully good 
teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians are one of them. But in the past two years, Martinez  
has treated Cleveland like everyone else, posting a 4-0 record with 
a 1.83 ERA in the regular season and beating the Indians in Game 1 
of the division series in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Martinez started four games against the Indians,  
going 2-0 with a 2.17 ERA and striking out 40 in 29 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his last start against Cleveland on Sept. 15, the Indians  
tried something new. They were more patient at the plate, swinging 
at the fourth and fifth pitches they saw rather than jumping on the 
first close one. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez still struck out 14 in seven innings, but had to work  
much harder than usual and left a tied game after throwing 131 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved it,'' said Vizquel, who had three hits and one  
13-pitch at-bat. ``The last game, we hit him good. We got a lot of 
guys on base. We were relaxed at the plate, and we saw a lot of 
pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez knows the Indians might try the same strategy. That's  
fine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to have to prove to me that what they're going  
to do is going to work for them,'' Martinez said. ``Because I'm not 
going to change my approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox are a confident bunch coming into the series, and  
not just because they'll send Martinez to the mound in the opener. 
They went 8-4 against Cleveland this season, winning five of six 
games at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a little bit of cockiness by knowing that we are able  
to beat them,'' Martinez said. ``But you know what? Those were 
regular-season games. This is the playoffs. So we're going to have 
to forget about the fact that we had them before. We have to have 
them right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians have lost eight straight series openers, last  
winning a Game 1 in the '95 division series against Boston. Beating 
Martinez would end that streak and mean the Indians might not have 
to face him a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be huge,'' catcher Sandy Alomar said. ``But you still  
have to beat the other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, the AL's leading  
hitter who batted .451 with five homers and 17 RBIs against 
Cleveland, said his sore right wrist is OK. He was hit by a pitch 
on Sept. 25, and Tuesday was his first full workout since being 
injured. ``I just went through my normal routines in the field and 
at bat, and I felt fine,'' he said. ... Hargrove has not announced 
his postseason roster, but said Charles Nagy would start Game 2 
against Boston's Bret Saberhagen. ... The Indians are just 1-for-30 
against Red Sox reliever Derek Lowe this season.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Leaning Toward Reform Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan met  
Wednesday with the Reform Party chairman and later said he is 
leaning toward leaving the GOP to seek the third party's 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm leaning toward it,'' Buchanan said at a book-signing after  
the hourlong meeting. ``It's a real possibility. We are looking at 
it very hard right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan also said Reform Party Chairman Russell Verney  
``indicated receptivity to our candidacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an easy decision,'' he added. ``I've been on the  
Republican Party side in the worst crises in the last 30 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Verney said he explained the party's state-by-state nominating  
process. He declined to give his position on a Buchanan bid, saying 
party members would have to decide on a nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has got a huge decision in front of him,'' Verney said.  
``The fact he has to weigh is: Will his supporters and contributors 
stay with him if he leaves the Republican Party. He would be 
publicly acknowledging that the current two-party system has 
failed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billionaire Ross Perot, who founded the Reform Party, did not  
attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Perot and Mr. Buchanan decided it was not appropriate,''  
Verney said. ``Ross is going to remain silent throughout the 
nominating process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who twice has sought the Republican nomination, has  
said he will decide by month's end whether to seek the Reform Party 
nomination for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are looking at clearly is to give the American people  
a choice at the polls,'' he told television station WFAA on 
Wednesday. ``I think the two parties in Washington are really in 
bed with each other. I think the American people need a real choice 
in 2000. That's the only reason I would run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker also is weighing a run  
for the party's bid. Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the highest 
elected Reform Party member, has tried to head off a Buchanan 
candidacy and urged real estate tycoon Donald Trump to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, interviewed Wednesday on ``Dateline NBC,'' said he feared  
that if Buchanan joined the Reform Party he would move the party to 
the fringes and make it a less appealing to mainstream candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	But Trump said he would not run just to thwart Buchanan.  
</P>
<P>
	``That wouldn't be the reason I'd run,'' Trump said. ``I  
wouldn't run unless I really thought I had a chance to win the 
entire election. It wouldn't be worth it to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perot has not ruled out a third presidential race, although  
members of the splinter American Reform Party already have voiced 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' has been  
criticized because of its questions about the U.S. entry in to war 
against Nazi Germany.

<HEADLINE> Gore Proposes Help for Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is proposing preschool  
for every child, ``family friendly'' policies at work and other 
steps to ease the burden on working parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, addressing a Manhattan fund-raising luncheon Tuesday,  
promised to put the concerns of families at the top of his agenda 
if he becomes president. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do not understand the fatigue of the American working  
woman, then you don't deserve to be president of the United 
States,'' he told a mostly female crowd of about 600 supporters. 
``If you elect me president, I will honor your struggle by making 
it easier to be a good worker and a good parent at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, fighting former Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, said he wanted to further women's rights 
by ensuring equal pay for equal work, keeping abortion legal and 
offering help to those juggling the demands of jobs and family. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you elect me president, I will make available high-quality  
preschool for every child in every family across the United 
States,'' said Gore, who shared the stage with his daughter, 
Karenna Gore Schiff, a Columbia University law student and mother 
of a 3-month-old boy. ``It's the single best investment we can 
make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he wants to create tax incentives for employers that  
provide on-site day care or help to parents when child-care 
arrangements fall through. He also said he would encourage 
businesses to offer job shares, flexible schedules and 
telecommuting.

<HEADLINE> School Shooting Survivor Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ore. (AP) -- After a bullet shattered his arm in a  
shooting at an Oregon high school last year, Richard Peek Jr. 
suggested a way to prevent such tragedies: ``I'd make it harder for 
kids to get guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old escaped the deadly rampage only to die in a  
hunting accident Tuesday when he was hit in the head from a bullet 
fired by a fellow shooting survivor, his 17-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Robert Peek crouched to listen for a deer  
when the hammer on his cocked rifle either slipped or got caught on 
his clothing, firing off a round that killed his brother instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case was unfortunately just a tragic accident,'' Lane  
County sheriff's Detective Sgt. Byron Trapp told reporters 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest death stunned a community still scarred by the May  
21, 1998, shooting rampage at Thurston High School when 15-year-old 
Kip Kinkel fatally shot his parents at home and then opened fire in 
the Thurston High cafeteria, killing two classmates and wounding 
two dozen others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richard was almost taken from us on the 21st day of May,  
1998,'' his mother, Susan Clark, said in a statement. ``We thank 
God for the time we have had with him since then. It provided us a 
second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Peek, a 17-year-old junior at the time of the shooting,  
had his back to Kinkel when the attack began and credited his 
schoolbooks with saving his life. He later told reporters his 
notebooks were shredded by gunfire and that a piece of bullet 
lodged on page 125 of his history text. 
</P>
<P>
	Peek had surgery to remove scar tissue from the bullet that tore  
through his left forearm, but he still suffered from a sharp pain. 
Robert Peek was also in cafeteria at the time of the shooting, but 
was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Peek's family later filed a $250,000 lawsuit against Kinkel and  
his parents' estate, alleging that Bill and Faith Kinkel were 
negligent because they provided their son with a weapon when they 
should have known he was disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel, now 17, abandoned a planned insanity defense last month  
and pleaded guilty to four counts of murder and 26 counts of 
attempted murder. He could get up to life in prison when sentenced 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	According to authorities, the Peek brothers were hunting on  
federal land about 18 miles east of Springfield. They were sitting 
on the side of a logging road when they thought they heard a deer 
and each cocked his rifle, loading a round into the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Peek had a lever-action Winchester Model 94 and was  
thumbing the hammer down to half-cock when his hand either slipped 
or the gun caught on his clothing and the gun fired, hitting his 
brother on the right side of the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, he ran to a nearby Lane County dumpsite where he  
found a telephone to call 911, however his brother was dead when 
the medics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	At Thurston High, Richard Peek's picture was flashed on the  
televised morning announcements and students observed a moment of 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends remembered him as a quiet boy who drove a pickup and  
hung with a country crowd known as the ``Cowboys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His sister, Carlene Higgs, said Peek was emotionally unable to  
go back to Thurston and graduate with his class after the shooting. 
He got his high school diploma from Lane Community College, 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the care he received from nurses at Sacred Heart  
Medical Center in Eugene, Peek decided to return to Lane to become 
a registered nurse.

<HEADLINE> Buss Says Pippen Contract Too Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Phil Jackson wanted the Los Angeles  
Lakers to acquire Scottie Pippen, but team owner Jerry Buss said 
Pippen's $67 million contract would have hamstrung the team for too 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was traded by Houston to Portland last week for six  
reserves. He has four years remaining on a five-year deal he signed 
with Chicago before he was traded to the Rockets last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phil definitely felt that Scottie would be a big improvement  
for us in the next year or two,'' Buss told a gathering of 
reporters Wednesday at training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he is aware that if you take somebody like Scottie with a  
long-term contract under the current rules, it would have been 
impossible to ever improve this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buss said the four years remaining on Pippen's contract  
precluded pursuing him. He denied reports that the Lakers offered 
Houston a deal, only to be rejected by the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie is just a great player and certainly for a year or two  
it would've been the right thing to do,'' he said. ``We would've 
probably done it had he not had a four-year contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buss also knew acquiring Pippen would've drained the Lakers'  
budget for free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you take him, you're basically saying this is our  
personnel for the next four years,'' he said. ``Right now we have a 
lot more leeway than that and I think we should maintain that 
leeway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Pippen, Buss believes the combination of Jackson  
and the current roster gives the Lakers an excellent chance to win 
their first NBA championship since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best team we've had in the last 4-5 years,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buss lured Jackson out of retirement in June with a five-year,  
$30 million deal that makes him one of the NBA's highest-paid 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner never spent that kind of money on a coach before, but  
he believes coaches need long-term, rich contracts to deal with 
today's big-money NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult for somebody making one-tenth of what the  
player he's talking to does and get that kind of respect,'' Buss 
said. ``It's probably true that the money associated with it does 
command a certain amount of respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under former coach Del Harris and his replacement Kurt Rambis,  
there was speculation the players didn't respect or listen to 
either man. 
</P>
<P>
	Buss believes Jackson is the answer.  
</P>
<P>
	``He commands a lot of respect. I like his confidence,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buss could be looking at dipping into his wallet again to keep  
swingman Glen Rice around. The Lakers exercised a $7 million option 
on Rice for this season, but he wants a long-term deal starting at 
the league maximum of $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant holding big-money  
contracts, giving Rice the kind of deal he wants could strain the 
team's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to pay three superstars because once you do that,  
you're really freezing any improvements you could make past that 
point and there are nine other soldiers on that team,'' Buss said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Lakers executive vice president Jerry West wants to  
watch Rice this season and see how he fits into Jackson's triangle 
offense. Rice practiced only lightly Wednesday because of 
tendinitis in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he deserves that money, we would have to pay him,'' Buss  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any lingering talk of bringing back Dennis Rodman after his  
ill-fated stint with the Lakers last season appears unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody's really seriously considered bringing  
back Dennis,'' said Buss, who especially wanted Rodman in the first 
place last season.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cop Sentenced for Murder in Md. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- A former Baltimore police officer who  
shot his pregnant mistress before turning the gun on her 5-year-old 
daughter has been sentenced to two lifetime prison terms without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael E. Thompson, 28, escaped the death penalty by agreeing  
to plead guilty to both counts of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mentioning Vicky Austin by name, Thompson acknowledged  
that he ``made a mistake,'' but he said ``that woman'' was also to 
blame because she enraged him by constantly calling his home and 
hanging up, haranguing him to pay child support and threatening to 
expose him to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Austin, an exotic dancer, was eight months pregnant with  
Thompson's child. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson apologized in court Wednesday for killing Ms. Austin's  
daughter, Jessica Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess she was at the wrong place at the wrong time,'' he  
said. ``Just because I might not show remorse on the outside, it 
doesn't mean I don't have it inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's mother said during the sentencing hearing that her  
son was a veteran of the Gulf War, had graduated near the top of 
his class from the Baltimore Police Academy and was named Officer 
of the Month in September 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Austin's mother, Linda Austin of Davie, Fla., also testified  
and told Thompson: ``You have given us a life sentence of pain and 
suffering. May you suffer in hell 'til your dying day.''

<HEADLINE> Ky. Drops Evolution From Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- The word ``evolution'' has quietly been  
deleted from Kentucky's guidelines for what students should be 
taught, two months after Kansas created a furor when it dropped 
Darwin's theory as a required part of the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Education Department edited out ``evolution'' and  
replaced it with the phrase ``change over time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Education Commissioner Gene Wilhoit said the word was  
considered ``a lightning rod that creates a diversion from what 
we're teaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some teachers, already nervous about what they consider an  
assault on a cornerstone of biology from those who favor the 
biblical account of creation, were annoyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They chose the less scientifically correct term and went with  
a more politically feasible term,'' Ken Rosenbaum, director of the 
Kentucky Science Teachers Association, said Wednesday. ``In science 
we have big words like photosynthesis. Do we not call it 
photosynthesis? Do we call it plant food making?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helen Mountjoy, chairwoman of the Kentucky Board of Education,  
said the change would make no difference in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``We teach evolution and we test evolution in Kentucky,'' she  
said. ``There is no change in the way we expect teachers to 
approach this subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In August, the Kansas Board of Education adopted new testing  
standards that play down the scientific importance of evolution, 
including the theory that humans descended from apes and other 
lower species. 
</P>
<P>
	In many states, including Kentucky, there are periodic attempts  
at local levels to push ``creationism'' as a biblical 
counterbalance to evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, officials in the Marshall County school district in  
western Kentucky confiscated science textbooks and glued together 
two pages dealing with the big-bang theory. Some principals had 
complained that the fifth- and sixth-grade textbooks did not 
include the biblical account of creation. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Kentucky science guidelines were first provided to  
teachers in 1995, they did not include the word ``evolution'' in 
the statement: ``Biological change over time accounts for the 
diversity of species developed through gradual processes over many 
generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, science teachers successfully campaigned to  
substitute ``evolution'' for ``change over time.'' This year, the 
original wording was restored. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Ham, director of Answers in Genesis, a ``creationism''  
ministry in Kentucky, said the change won't stop evolution from 
being taught. 
</P>
<P>
	The change ``has nothing to do with de-emphasizing evolution.  
They don't want to offend certain students,'' Ham said.

<HEADLINE> Protein May Fight Prostate Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of men worry that their annual blood  
tests will show an elevated screen for prostate cancer. That result 
is far from good news, but at least it may mean the body is trying 
to overcome the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	A study in today's Journal of the National Cancer Institute  
indicates that prostate specific antigen, the protein doctors test 
for as an indication of prostate cancer, may be part of the body's 
tumor-fighting arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of American men get blood tests every year to check for  
elevated levels of PSA, an indication that cancer is present. 
</P>
<P>
	``God didn't put PSA as a marker of prostate cancer. There's got  
to be some biological function of this molecule, and in our minds 
eye it had not been defined adequately,'' said Dr. John W. Holaday, 
one of a team of researchers in Maryland that found evidence that 
PSA itself may slow the growth of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was data showing that women with advanced breast cancer,  
who had higher levels of PSA, had a better prognosis,'' Holaday 
said in a telephone interview. ``That taught us two things: that 
prostate specific antigen is not prostate specific; and, secondly, 
it appears to be correlated with an improved outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one really ever asked the question: 'What does PSA do?'''  
Holaday said. So his team did the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our results suggest that, in addition to its role as an  
indicator of prostate cancer, PSA may also inhibit the growth of 
blood vessels associated with cancer progression,'' the team from 
EntreMed Inc. of Rockville, Md., reports in the Oct. 6 issue of the 
Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a man over 50, I know that when my prostate PSA levels are  
measured on an annual basis, I look to that as a measure of 
progressive disease or lack thereof,'' Holaday said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I also realize that when it reaches the later years, often  
people don't even treat prostate cancer in men 75 years of age and 
older because it grows so slowly. We think it grows slowly because 
the PSA it makes keeps it in check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer researcher Dr. Gerald Murphy of Northwest Hospital's  
Pacific Northwest Cancer Foundation in Seattle called the result 
``very interesting. I had no idea that PSA would have this 
associated effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said he would need to know more about the type of PSA  
tested and how it operates but said the report helps explain the 
increase in PSA as cancer grows. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists see two fronts in the battle against cancer:  
attacking the tumor cells and battling the endothelial cells that 
make up blood vessels to bring the tumor oxygen and nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	The EntreMed scientists have been working on endostatin, a  
protein that blocks blood-vessel development in tumors. It is 
currently in the first phase of clinical trials on humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Noticing that many patients with growing tumors have increased  
levels of natural endostatin, they began to wonder if increasing 
amounts of PSA, rather than just being ``a harbinger of bad news,'' 
might also indicate that the body is attempting to fight cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	After lab tests indicated that PSA added to cancer cells  
inhibited the formation of new blood vessels, the scientists 
introduced cancer cells to mice susceptible to lung cancer, and 
treated some of the mice with PSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Mice that had been treated with PSA averaged 62 to 78 tumor  
nodules in their lungs after 14 days. In contrast, mice that did 
not receive PSA averaged 99 to 131 tumors. In similar tests using 
endostatin, treated mice averaged eight to 24 tumors.

<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- A Fairfield University football player  
was suspended from the team Wednesday following his arrest at a 
local bar last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Wise, a wide receiver and co-captain, faces charges of  
assaulting a police officer, inciting a riot, breach of peace and 
interfering with an officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise, a senior from Reading, Pa., fought with police officer  
Keith Broderick who responded to a disturbance at the Seagrape 
Cafe, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise was yelling at workers inside the bar when Broderick  
attempted to subdue him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My decision has Eric's and Fairfield University's best  
interests in mind,'' said Eugene P. Doris, the director of 
athletics. ``The suspension will allow Eric to concentrate on 
resolving his situation without the daily distractions of varsity 
football.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Back Injury Knocks Out Martinez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A back injury did what the Cleveland Indians  
couldn't -- knock Pedro Martinez out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The shoo-in for the AL Cy Young award suffered a muscle strain  
in the middle of his back and left after just four innings 
Wednesday night, the second shortest start of his brilliant season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Red Sox were leading 2-0 at the time in the opener of  
the best-of-5 division series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox said he injured himself on a pitch and is  
day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez allowed three hits and one walk and striking out three.  
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, Martinez had one stint on the  
disabled list, from July 19 to Aug. 3, with a sore right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	But he came back even stronger than before.  
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was 23-4 and led the AL with 313 strikeouts and the  
majors with a 2.07 ERA. In his last 10 regular-season starts, he 
was 7-1 with a 1.25 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox were counting on their ace to pitch them to an  
opening-game win. In the next three games, their probable starters 
are Bret Saberhagen, Ramon Martinez and Kent Mercker, who all had 
physical problems this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Pedro Martinez left, he was replaced by Derek Lowe, who  
has been nearly unhittable by the Indians. They were 1-for-30 
against him this year with the only hit coming April 24 by Roberto 
Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lowe gave up a two-run homer to Jim Thome in the sixth that  
tied the score 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez wasn't as sharp as usual, allowing runners in three of  
his four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired the first two batters in the first. Then Alomar  
singled and stole second before Manny Ramirez, struck out, making 
him 2-for-21 with 11 strikeouts in his career against Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome grounded out to start the second, then Harold Baines  
singled. But Baines was forced at second on David Justice's 
grounder and Travis Fryman flied out to center. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez struck out Sandy Alomar starting the third then walked  
Kenny Lofton. In 213 1-3 innings this year, Martinez walked just 37 
batters. Omar Vizquel flied out, then Roberto Alomar singled Lofton 
to third. But Ramirez grounded into a force out. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth, Thome struck out and Baines popped out to second  
baseman Jose Offerman. Martinez's last batter was Justice, who 
grounded out to first baseman Mike Stanley. Martinez rushed to 
first to cover on the play.

<HEADLINE> Habibie Holds Final Cabinet Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Beleaguered incumbent B.J. Habibie  
chaired his last Cabinet meeting Wednesday before a historic vote 
for Indonesia's next head of state is held in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, hundreds of supporters of Habibie's main  
rival, Megawati Sukarnoputri, demonstrated in downtown Jakarta and 
called on the country's highest legislative body to select her as 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally came as doubts escalated over her ability to secure  
the presidency. Critics say she has failed to horse-trade to gather 
support from other parties in the 700-member People's Consultative 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of her popular appeal is rooted in the fact that she is the  
daughter of Indonesia's founding father, President Sukarno, a 
legendary nationalist. However, some critics say she has relied too 
much on her pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
	``She believes she has a `wangsit,' a heavenly mandate, to be  
president,'' said Salim Said, a Jakarta political analyst. ``Her 
talent as a politician is very low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Habibie, who has lost much of his luster in the  
face of one crisis after another, has been lobbying hard to cling 
to power. 
</P>
<P>
	His final meeting of ministers concentrated on the drafting of a  
crucial accountability speech he must deliver to the assembly on 
Oct. 14, just six days before it decides the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Habibie would stress how he has implemented  
sweeping democratic reforms in the 16 months since the departure of 
his former mentor, authoritarian President Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his reformist credentials, Habibie's candidacy has been  
hurt by his links to Suharto, who ruled with an iron fist for 32 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	A major test for Habibie will come on Monday, when Indonesia's  
attorney general is scheduled to announce whether the government 
will pursue or dismiss allegations of massive corruption against 
Suharto, now 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie's critics say he's not likely to put his old boss and  
friend on trial. Moreover Habibie and several of his ministers have 
been linked to a growing banking and corruption scandal of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle won the  
lion's share of votes in a general election in June and now control 
the largest block of seats. But it does not have a majority in its 
own right. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been criticized for failing to form important alliances  
and her bid for power began to look shaky this week after 
candidates she backed lost a bid for two key positions in the 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's peaceful, but noisy street rally was the first major  
demonstration in months by her supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some predicted a violent backlash if Megawati was not selected  
by the assembly later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people will be angry and turn violent everywhere,''  
said Kenedi, who like many in Indonesia, uses only one name.

<HEADLINE> HMO Premium Hikes Likely Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- HMO consumers next year can expect premiums to  
increase by an average 11 percent, up from an 8 percent hike this 
year, according to a survey of health plans released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional average rate of projected increases for 2000 ranged  
from 8.3 percent in the Pacific region to 12.7 percent in the 
Mid-Atlantic region, according to survey by Sherlock Co., a health 
care consulting firm based in North Wales, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Health maintenance organizations predicted premiums would  
increase 4.6 percent for 1998, and they predicted a 2.6 percent 
jump in 1997, the consulting firm said. The predictions tended to 
be close, but usually somewhat higher, than the actual increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of this year's survey was based on surveys completed  
by 143 HMOs, about 22 percent of health plans nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Premiums are expected to increase next years as HMOs seek to pay  
for rising drug costs and higher rates demanded by doctors and 
hospitals, said consultant Douglas Sherlock.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Head Denies Payroll Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers chairman Ed Snider  
angrily denied a report Wednesday that he asked general manager Bob 
Clarke to reduce the team's payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't order Bob Clarke to reduce salaries,'' Snider said.  
``I never said that. I just said we want to reduce salaries in the 
future. In essence, I was saying that salaries are too high in the 
league and so forth, and they have to come down and we have to do 
something about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Inquirer quoted Snider in a story Wednesday  
saying, ``We have too much salary on our books and we have to find 
a way to bring it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how that could be done, Snider said, ``Get rid of players.  
High-priced players who maybe aren't worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It amazes me that we can be so stupid as owners, all of us, me  
included,'' Snider added. 
</P>
<P>
	Snider said Wednesday that he was only speaking in general terms  
and that he has not met with Clarke in an effort to lower the 
team's $47.3 million payroll, second-highest in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was referring to the state of hockey and the fact that most  
of the teams need to be concerned about reducing salaries,'' Snider 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL Players' Association released the salary information  
Tuesday on its Web site, nhlpa.com. The Flyers' payroll is second 
only to the New York Rangers' $58.9 million. Philadelphia had the 
fourth-highest payroll last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Snider applauded the contract stances by Ottawa, which faces the  
threat of a season-long holdout by center Alexei Yashin, and 
Boston, which is holding firm on its $10 million, three-year offer 
to goaltender Byron Dafoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's happening with Yashin and Dafoe, the fact that Boston  
didn't accept arbitrators, it's a necessity today'' to keep 
salaries down, Snider said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Flyers were eliminated from the playoffs by Toronto in  
the first round last year, Snider said it would be up to Clarke to 
reduce the team's $43.2 million payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers did not sign any free agents from other teams, but  
signed nine restricted free agents and two unrestricted free agents 
of their own. The biggest increase was Mark Recchi's $25 million, 
five-year contract, which added $5 million annually to the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Flyers have only two of the top 30 highest-paid players  
in the league this season -- Recchi and captain Eric Lindros, who 
will make $8.5 million. Lindros is tied with the Rangers' Theoren 
Fleury for the fourth-highest salary in the league behind 
Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr ($10.4 million), Anaheim's Paul Kariya 
($10 million) and Colorado's Peter Forsberg ($9 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Snider said the Flyers compute payroll differently than the  
NHLPA, using average salary in a contract to get yearly figures. 
According to the Flyers' calculations, their payroll is about $44 
million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think it's $44 million or $48 million, what's the  
difference?'' Snider asked. ``It's still a lot of money.''

<HEADLINE> Day Off for Rangers, Yankees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just what the Texas Rangers needed: a day off in  
the big city. 
</P>
<P>
	They could watch television and dwell on their seven-game  
postseason slide. 
</P>
<P>
	They could read the newspapers and fixate on their 22-inning  
playoff scoreless streak. 
</P>
<P>
	They could listen to the radio and the constant talk of a Subway  
Series between the Yankees and Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody expects us to win,'' Game 2 starter Rick Helling said  
Wednesday. ``To me, all the pressure is on the Yankees. They won 
the first game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Won is an understatement. Orlando Hernandez held the Rangers to  
two hits in eight innings and Bernie Williams had six RBIs in New 
York's series-opening 8-0 win Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling (13-11), who gave up a major league-high 41 homers,  
pitches against Andy Pettitte (14-11) on Thursday night before the 
series moves to Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, if you're down one, it's a lot more important  
game,'' Pettitte said. ``But it's still important. If we can get 
the second game here and go there to Texas up two, we feel 
confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sound familiar?  
</P>
<P>
	After the Yankees beat Texas in last year's postseason opener,  
Pettitte faced Helling in Game 2 and led New York to a 3-1 win, 
allowing one run and three hits in seven innings with eight 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling gave up three runs and eight hits in six innings.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was just like it has been so far in all these games against  
the Yankees,'' Helling said. ``We got outpitched a little bit, 
didn't score enough runs to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helling, who traveled from the team hotel to the Bronx by limo,  
was the only Rangers' player in sight at Yankee Stadium on 
Wednesday, with manager Johnny Oates giving his team a day off. 
About half the Yankees showed for an optional workout. 
</P>
<P>
	The clubhouse mood was businesslike. The Yankees need 10 more  
wins to achieve their goal of a third World Series title in four 
seasons, and they're hoping to find the consistency that led them 
to a record 125 wins a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is hoping Pettitte will pitch with confidence, as he  
did in a record 21-3 victory at Arlington on Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a scary team to play against because you know they're  
going to break loose,'' New York's Paul O'Neill said. ``They're 
going to score runs when it's all said and done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas hopes so. The Rangers have just one run in their last 42  
playoff innings -- all against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a very good offensive ball club,'' said Rangers general  
manager Doug Melvin, whose team led the American League in batting 
for the second straight year. ``We'll break out of it somewhere 
along the line here. Just hope that it's sooner than later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas may have its best chance against Pettitte, a Texan from  
Deer Park. Juan Gonzalez is 10-for-22 (.455) against the 
left-hander, Rusty Greer is 9-for-25 (.360), Todd Zeile 5-for-14 
(.357) and Rafael Palmeiro 13-for-44 (.295) with four homers and 
nine RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rangers have hit him a lot better in Arlington than in  
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first couple of starts at the Rangers' stadium is when I  
first came up in the league -- had a lot of family and stuff like 
that there,'' Pettitte said. ``I just put a lot of pressure on 
myself the first two years whenever I had starts down there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also put pressure on himself anywhere during the first four  
months of this season. He was 7-8 at the July 31 trade deadline, 
looking lost during some starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre and several of owner George Steinbrenner's  
baseball people argued Pettitte shouldn't be dealt. And once the 
deadline passed, Pettitte appeared to relax, winning three straight 
starts and five of six. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would affect anyone,'' catcher Joe Girardi said.  
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte, 4-4 in 11 postseason starts, was picked to start the  
second game over Roger Clemens, just 1-2 in nine postseason games. 
Torre thinks Pettitte hit bottom in a July 28 start at Chicago's 
Comiskey Park, when he even experimented throwing sidearm on one 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to set a tone and show them that you're going to  
throw strikes and be aggressive,'' Pettitte said. ``We'll get a 
lead again, get them to start pressing a little bit. That's when 
teams start swinging at bad pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, Hernandez, Pettitte, David Cone and Hideki Irabu give  
the Yankees the best five-man rotation in the AL. Bench coach Don 
Zimmer, back at the ballpark after he was hit in the dugout with a 
foul, says it can do better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this ball club has played as well as I think  
they can play,'' Zimmer said. ``I mean, I can't remember playing 10 
straight days this whole year ... where we had 10 good outings.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Clemens (14-10) pitches against Esteban Loaiza (9-5) on  
Saturday in Game 3. ... Texas' seven-game losing streak ties the 
first-round record set by Houston. ... The Yankees are 4-1 at home 
against Texas in postseason play.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Canada and Cuba played to a scoreless tie  
Wednesday night in the first round of the CONCACAF Gold Cup 
qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The result gives both teams one point in the standings and  
forces them into must-win situations when the tournament resumes. 
</P>

	That will occur Friday night when Cuba plays Haiti, followed by  
Canada's game against El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba had the best chance to score in second-half injury time on  
Luis Pellicer's breakaway. But goalkeeper Pat Onstad made the save. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada generated most of the offensive chances, as Cuba played  
most of the game in a defensive shell to get a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	However, both teams demonstrated poor ball control and passing.

<HEADLINE> Raptors Extend GM's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Raptors have given general manager  
Glen Grunwald a multiyear contract extension, The Globe and Mail 
reported in Thursday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported the Raptors will make a formal  
announcement at a news conference on Thursday at the Air Canada 
Centre. The contract is believed to be for at least three years and 
will make Grunwald one of the league's highest-paid GMs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Grunwald and head coach Butch Carter were entering the  
final years of their contracts. The Raptors are also expected to 
announce an extension for Carter within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's done a very good job in rehabilitating this  
franchise,'' said Billy Diamond, the New Jersey-based agent for 
forward Charles Oakley. ``Really, that's what he did. He came into 
a disaster area and rebuilt it. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunwald, the team's vice president and general manager, has  
been with the Raptors since 1994. He was brought into the 
organization by Isiah Thomas, the Raptors' former general manager 
and part owner. 
</P>
<P>
	He took over as general manager of the Raptors in November,  
1997, after Thomas left the club over a dispute with former partner 
Allan Slaight.

<HEADLINE> WWII Laborers Seek Remuneration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of negotiations, German companies  
are coming to the table with an offer on how much compensation 
they're willing to pay Nazi-era slave laborers. 
</P>
<P>
	And in advance of the two-day talks starting today, survivors  
launched a newspaper ad campaign and held a news conference to push 
for what they call a quick and just compensation settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors said the ad campaign will continue through the talks.  
</P>
<P>
	``The corporations who exploited us and who, in genocidal  
partnership with the SS, murdered our friends and relatives have 
grown rich. ... They are worth countless billions,'' Rudy Kennedy, 
a Holocaust survivor from London, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy spoke at a news conference in advance of today's  
reopening of negotiations in Washington to determine compensation 
for as many as 2.4 million people forced into labor to aid 
Germany's Nazi war machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were treated like animals,'' said an ad about Ford Motor  
Co. and its wartime German subsidiary, Ford Werke AG, displayed at 
the news conference. It had not yet run in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bayer (haggled) over the purchase price of 150 female  
prisoners on whom to test a sleeping medication,'' said an ad on 
the pharmaceutical company that ran in Tuesday's New York Times. 
``Bayer found $80 per woman too high a price. They ultimately 
bought them for less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charges are not new, but their presentation in full-page ads  
came as survivors and their attorneys attacked a reported 
compensation offer from 16 German companies as ``a disgrace,'' ``an 
insult'' and ``peanuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney in the negotiations threatened to walk out of the  
talks if industry's offer today is too low. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't step up to the plate and start negotiating ...  
with real money that is representative of their ability to pay, we 
are going to walk away from these meetings,'' said attorney Mel 
Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss said that in months of negotiations, the German companies  
have never given a specific figure of how much they would pay. 
Instead, he said, survivors have relied on newspaper reports and 
rumors for an idea of what might be offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss quoted such a report Tuesday in The Washington Post that  
said compensation of $3.8 billion, or $200 per forced labor 
survivor, is being contemplated. He called that offer a ``paltry 
amount.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reached by phone in Boston, Wolfgang Gibowski, spokesman for the  
German business initiative, said the $3.8 billion figure was wrong 
but would not divulge the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, at the Washington new conference, Weiss also declined  
to say how much survivors are demanding but said it was ``far in 
excess'' of the $20 billion reported elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, leading politicians in Germany pressured German  
businesses to reach an agreement quickly. The German government's 
envoy to the talks, Otto Lambsdorff, pointing to the ad campaign, 
also warned that failure of the talks could damage relations with 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambsdorff said this week that he would be bringing a final  
offer to the table during the talks starting today at the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Reinert, a spokesman at Bayer headquarters in Leverkusen,  
Germany, said Bayer was absorbed during the Nazi era into the IG 
Farben pharmaceutical and chemical conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bayer rejects legal responsibility for whatever may have  
happened under the Nazi dictatorship and at IG Farben,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, Bayer is aware of a humanitarian responsibility and  
therefore is taking part in negotiations aimed at creating a 
foundation for the victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Dearborn, Mich., a Ford spokesman said the company is doing  
research to learn what happened at Ford operations after they were 
placed under government control during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford is part of the global community and is dedicated to  
supporting humanitarian initiatives because it's the right thing to 
do,'' said Jim Vella, Ford global news director.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Leaders Criticize Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential rivals and leading conservatives  
accused George W. Bush on Wednesday of declaring ``war on the 
conservative movement'' with his pointed critique of the GOP's 
emphasis on social and economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Reversing course, Pat Robertson said Bush's bid to soften the  
party's rougher edges threatens to ``alienate the core 
conservatives of the Republican Party.'' The Christian Coalition 
founder had all but endorsed the GOP presidential front-runner 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	That was before Bush delivered an address Tuesday that could  
test his ability to appease conservatives while courting moderate 
voters. The Texas governor said Republicans too often sound 
pessimistic, confuse limited government with ``a disdain for 
government itself'' and focus on economics ``to the exclusion of 
all else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had already upset Republican congressional leaders by  
criticizing plans to shift money from a tax credit program for the 
working poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the efforts of his presidential rivals to fan the flames  
of discontent, several conservatives defended Bush. The most 
notable voice of understanding came from Randy Tate, who works for 
Robertson and said Bush is only guilty of being ``a card-carrying 
member of the optimistic wing of the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The schism underscored the conservative wing's tug-of-war, as  
the movement's leaders are torn between traditional ideology and 
what Mike Farris called ``pragmatic politics.'' Farris, chairman of 
a conservative political action committee called the Madison 
Project, said Bush may not be perfect -- but he can win the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	``George W. Bush is more like Ronald Reagan than his father,''  
Farris said in a telephone interview. ``That doesn't mean he's all 
the way to Reagan on political philosophy, but he's close enough 
for many of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, a conservative competing against Bush for the GOP  
nomination, said, ``This is the ultimate legacy of Bill Clinton 
that some of us appear to be embracing the idea that the way to win 
is to be everything to everybody. That is about as far away from 
Ronald Reagan as you can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush addressed the Farris-led Home School Legal Defense  
Association recently and received a warm reception. He was embraced 
again last week at the Christian Coalition's annual meeting, a sign 
-- his advisers said -- that Bush's efforts to quietly court the 
party's conservative base had paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things I've heard him say would cause me to believe he  
would be worthy of support from the Christian Coalition,'' 
Robertson said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released by Robertson through spokesman Mike  
Russell, the group's founder predicted Wednesday that presidential 
candidate Pat Buchanan will bolt the GOP and give Bush a ``razor 
thin majority'' heading into the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	``For his own good, he would be well advised to avoid statements  
which tend to alienate the core conservatives of the Republican 
Party, which will either drive them into the arms of Pat Buchanan, 
to support other candidates or cause them to stay home on Election 
Day,'' Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign said the governor was not questioning GOP  
ideology -- simply its tone and emphasis on key issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was making the case that the conservative philosophy is the  
compassionate philosophy,'' Bush said between campaign stops 
Wednesday. ``I was making the case that all the time we are talking 
about numbers and economics, we are also talking about what we 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can elevate people out of poverty. I'm talking from the  
heart, and I hope the Republican Party can appreciate it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A litany of conservative leaders criticized Bush, with their  
statements circulated throughout the political community by aides 
to presidential rival Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other politicians who have declared war on the conservative  
movement -- like Nelson Rockefeller -- found out the hard way that 
this was a serious mistake,'' said Free Congress Foundation 
director Paul Weyrich in a statement released on Forbes' 
letterhead. 
</P>
<P>
	``No conservative running for president would leave his  
philosophical brothers and sisters dying on the congressional 
battlefield the way Bush did ... ,'' Rush Limbaugh said on his 
conservative radio show. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Bush has given us another regrettable example of the  
establishment candidate attacking conservative Republicans instead 
of liberal Democrats,'' said Phyllis Schlafly, president of the 
Eagle Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, Forbes said Bush appears embarrassed  
to be a Republican. ``You can't be embarrassed by basic principles 
and expect to govern by those principles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes hopes to stand alone against Bush as the conservative  
alternative in GOP primaries. Bauer, who doesn't have Forbes' 
personal wealth, benefits from deep ties to the conservative 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the signal that was sent (by Bush) is do not expect  
serious attempt to cut back government on the economic side,'' 
Bauer said by telephone. ``And on the social issues, do not expect 
a Bush administration to take on the issues of cultural decline.''

<HEADLINE> What's Missing From `Millennium'? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If you do the math on ``Millennium,'' CNN's  
10-hour portrait of the past thousand years, you're struck by all 
that must be missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Figure it out: ``Millennium'' has less than 30 seconds to cover  
each year's global happenings from AD 1000 to the present. Is this 
a documentary series or a fool's errand? 
</P>
<P>
	But if you tune in its premiere Sunday at 10 p.m. EDT,  
``Millennium'' will surprise you. 
</P>
<P>
	Though it was spurred by millennium mania, this would be a  
fascinating series in any year. It's an ambitious project with no 
stake in being all-inclusive, just compelling. And how time flies 
when you're having fun! 
</P>
<P>
	In five vignettes each hour (that is, per century),  
``Millennium'' seizes on big stories, personalities and ideas, then 
presents them with majesty and style. Actor Ben Kingsley narrates, 
but the words take a back seat to the visuals and music. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's intended to be a pleasure for the eye and the ear,'' says  
British filmmaker Sir Jeremy Isaacs, who shared executive producer 
duties with Pat Mitchell, president of Time Inc.-CNN Productions. 
``It's history as a magic carpet ride into the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here is the itinerary for the first edition, ``Century of the  
Sword: The Eleventh Century'': 
</P>
<P>
	-- The world's preeminent civilization, China, which had  
innovations other cultures hadn't even imagined: printing, paper 
money, gunpowder and kites that carried humans aloft. Not to 
mention what was perhaps the world's first restaurant (it 
specialized in take-out chicken). 
</P>
<P>
	-- The vast expanse of Islam from India to Spain, flourishing  
particularly in Cordoba, Europe's largest city, which was home to 
more than 1,000 mosques. 
</P>
<P>
	-- India, whose towering spiritualism, scholarship and wealth  
were undermined by its indifference to neighboring cultures and 
advances. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jerusalem, where pilgrims flocked from all over Europe seeking  
salvation as they anticipated the thousandth anniversary of 
Christ's crucifixion in 1033 -- and perhaps the end of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And imperial seclusion in Japan as chronicled by Sei Shonagon,  
a lady-in-waiting in the royal court, in her diary ``The Pillow 
Book.'' A splendid sanctuary of friskiness that makes the Playboy 
Mansion seem like a flophouse, here no one ever seemed to get a 
full night's sleep -- or be burdened with a full night's bedfellow. 
Declares ``The Pillow Book'': ``One's attachment to a man depends 
largely on the elegance of his leave-taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Millennium'' will continue each Sunday, devoted to a  
successive hundred years with a loosely applied theme (Century of 
the Scythe, Telescope, Furnace, Globe). It concludes Dec. 12 with, 
natch, the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, a special Web site (CNN.com/1000) will offer  
supplementary material for viewers whose curiosity is piqued -- and 
how could it not be? -- by glimpses of Genghis Kahn, those enormous 
sailing vessels of Admiral Zheng, the exquisite churches carved 
from an Ethiopian mountainside, or Pierre de Maupertuis, who almost 
300 years ago led an expedition to the Arctic Circle to determine 
Earth's precise shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know our own history best,'' says Isaacs, acknowledging  
that narcissism and proximity distort one's view of the past. ``But 
'Millennium' tells of other histories, of people all over the world 
who in the last thousand years influenced those around them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, ``Millennium'' adds up to 50 illuminating sketches.  
</P>
<P>
	But does it add up to anything more sweeping? Can any grand  
conclusions about humankind be reached? 
</P>
<P>
	``This was never intended to be a series that drew a line  
through things,'' Isaacs cautions. Nonetheless, he can point to 
three concepts binding these 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	First, science overtakes religion as an explanation of how the  
world works. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second, you see the balance of world interest and cultural  
energy moving from the East to the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, third, the world's piecemeal knowledge of itself becomes a  
general awareness. Once, few people knew what life was like over 
the next mountain or beyond the sea. But at the end of the 20th 
century, you not only know of the existence of others globally, you 
also know what they're doing. And, increasingly, you're doing the 
same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Like watching CNN.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`LOVE &AMP; MONEY': Allison (Paget Brewster) is a pretty, shy young  
woman who teaches kindergarten. She's also a wealthy heiress who 
resides in a Manhattan penthouse with her spoiled sister, her 
ne'er-do-well brother and their veddy snobby, billionaire parents 
(played by David Ogden Stiers and Swoosie Kurtz). But then Allison 
pursues a relationship with Eamon, the building's handsome super 
(Brian Van Holt), who lives down in the basement with his doorman 
father (Brian Doyle Murray). Premiering Friday at 8:30 p.m. EDT on 
CBS, ``Love &AMP; Money'' will clearly be a romance with many ups 
downs. But viewers are urged to find a better address.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accuses GOP on Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the House opened a fractious debate on  
federal regulation of managed care health plans, President Clinton 
today accused Republicans of ``legislative gamesmanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a Rose Garden appearance, Clinton said the House majority,  
acting at the behest of the insurance industry, set rules for 
debate that were ``filled with enough poison pills and legislative 
sleights of hand to practically guarantee the defeat of this 
bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Clinton spoke, Democrats were complaining that the  
Republicans were not allowing amendments that would cover the cost, 
estimated to be several billion dollars over several years. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said that without  
the ability to provide for payment of the additional cost, many 
Democrats would not support the party proposal, assuring its 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton picked up that theme, saying that ``a bipartisan  
majority is poised to pass this bill, but now they are being 
blocked by legislative tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people deserve more than partisan posturing and  
legislative gamesmanship on an issue this vital,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., responded that Democrats raised this  
concern over how to pay for the bill at the last minute. 
Republicans, he said, had granted every major request over the 
rules of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats have moved the goal post again,'' Goss said.  
</P>
<P>
	The central debate, now in its second year on Capitol Hill, is  
how to give frustrated patients new rights in dealing with health 
maintenance organizations and other managed care plans, which often 
impose restrictions in order to control costs and eliminate 
unnecessary care. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats got some Republican support for a broad bill and  
appeared to have enough support to pass over the objections of 
Republican leaders. But the prohibition on amendments to cover the 
cost endangered those prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt also sought to inject a little presidential politics  
into the debate. He released a letter to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
the GOP front-runner, asking that he urge congressional Republicans 
to support the Democratic bill, which is similar to a Texas HMO 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you can educate your leadership on the importance of  
enacting meaningful reforms,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	By beginning debate with the tax bill, GOP leaders hope to shift  
attention to those without any insurance at all. They argue that 
the Democratic approach would increase costs and prompt businesses 
to drop coverage, leaving more Americans uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the severe poor who don't have health care. There are  
government programs that reach out (to them),'' House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Tuesday, sounding the GOP's central 
theme. ``It's working people today, who are working for small 
businesses or who run their own shop or they go from job to job, 
who need the ability to get health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders planned to bring the tax bill to the floor for  
debate first, with a vote expected today. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill includes popular tax breaks for people buying health  
coverage on their own and for long-term care insurance. But it also 
includes a provision opposed by many Democrats that would allow 
more medical savings accounts, which let people opt out of the 
current health insurance market and buy high-risk plans on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would give small businesses the option to  
buy health insurance under federal rather than state regulation -- 
exempting them from state mandates that bigger self-insured 
companies now avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	After that vote, the House was to move to the HMO issue,  
beginning with a bill backed by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and 
Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., and supported by the White House. With 
backing from some 20 Republicans, ultimately, it is expected to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill would give patients a host of new rights in dealing  
with their health insurance companies. It would make it easier to 
go to an emergency room or see a specialist and would give patients 
the chance to take their complaints to independent panels. Most 
controversially, it would give patients who are still not satisfied 
the right to sue an HMO in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Three alternative GOP bills will be offered, but none appeared  
to have enough support to pass. The leading alternative, crafted by 
Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John Shadegg, R-Ariz., gives 
patients the right to sue, but only in federal courts -- where 
damage awards are typically smaller -- and only under limited 
circumstances. Hastert and other Republican leaders planned to back 
this legislation, reasoning it was preferable to the 
Dingell-Norwood version, but they were not actively encouraging 
other Republicans to do the same, Hastert said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have a choice and now the House will work its will,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even if the broader bill passes the House, it must be  
reconciled with a much more limited version already approved by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	With polls showing strong support for HMO restrictions,  
Democrats were positioning themselves as protectors of the patient 
and the doctor, out only for the best care.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Critical of Coast Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fatigue and hypothermia contributed to a fatal  
sailboat crash off the South Carolina coast in December 1997, but 
so did the Coast Guard's failure to respond to initial calls for 
help, according to a report by federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contributing to the loss of life in this accident was the  
substandard performance of U.S. Coast Guard Group Charleston in 
initiating a search-and-rescue response to the accident,'' the 
National Transportation Safety Board said in its review of the 
wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Cornett, his two teen-age sons and a nephew died after  
his vessel, ``The Morning Dew,'' crashed into a jetty on their way 
to Florida. NTSB investigators said Cornett's ``failure to 
adequately assess, prepare for and respond to the known risks of 
the journey into the open ocean'' most likely caused the crash. 
Cornett was severely fatigued and suffering from hypothermia, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard received an initial distress call at 2:17 a.m.  
on Dec. 29, 1997. The officer monitoring radio calls heard only 
part of the call because he was away getting coffee. He radioed 
back several times but failed to get a response. The officer, who 
said he never heard the word ``mayday,'' was the only person on 
duty aside from his supervisor, who was asleep on another floor. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB investigators, in a report approved Tuesday, said the  
officer should have been in a proper position to hear the radio 
call and taken into account the time of the call and the stormy sea 
conditions. He should have then replayed a recording of the radio 
transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also criticized the Coast Guard for failing to  
launch a search when, about four hours later, it received a 
transmission from a passing ship reporting that its crew had heard 
calls for help from the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The supervising officer ``disregarded clear indications of a  
marine distress situation when he took no action in response to the 
report,'' the NTSB said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard failed to realize the connection between the two  
calls until much later, after inquiries by a local newspaper 
seeking radio call logs and other information. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB member John Goglia described shortfalls uncovered by the  
investigation ``just mind-boggling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Gabriel Kinney III, a Coast Guard spokesman, said the  
agency is using the Morning Dew wreck as a ``learning experience'' 
for search-and-rescue efforts. He would not comment on the NTSB 
report until Coast Guard authorities have a chance to review its 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll certainly be willing to discuss our view of them at that  
point,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB regulators also recommended the Coast Guard:  
</P>
<P>
	--Implement a policy of sharing information about its  
search-and-rescue missions promptly with appropriate local and 
federal investigative agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Improve its training for radio officers to help sharpen their  
judgment and ability to make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Update its communications equipment, most of which dates from  
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	--Act immediately to provide all search and rescue centers  
equipment to allow easy replay of recently recorded radio 
transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB chairman Jim Hall said he also has asked Transportation  
Secretary Rodney Slater to give the NTSB the right to review 
accidents involving the Coast Guard ``in the same manner that we do 
for aviation or railroad or highway accidents.'' The agency has 
been seeking Congressional approval to allow complete, independent 
marine investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Libby Cornett, Cornett's widow, said she was pleased with the  
NTSB report but said she fears it won't be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one has said who is going to make sure the Coast Guard will  
do all this,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Fla.'s Coles Will Miss Miami Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Wide receiver Laveranues Coles missed  
Florida State's practice Wednesday and will not play in the 
top-ranked Seminoles' game against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles and Peter Warrick, a top Heisman Trophy candidate, were  
questioned by police in connection with an alleged theft scheme in 
which police said a clerk sold clothing to customers for far less 
than it was worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither player has been charged with any crime.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bobby Bowden said he would make a decision on Coles'  
future with the team on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, also a wide receiver, attended practice for the second  
straight night Wednesday. Bowden has not said whether Warrick will 
play Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-American senior from Bradenton has 36 catches for 508  
yards and four touchdowns for the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, a senior from Jacksonville, said Tuesday that he and  
Warrick answered investigators' questions about the purchase of a 
tan hat and four shirts with a total estimated value of $244, 
according to a police report. According to the report, the players 
bought the merchandise Sept. 29 for far less money. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players were described by police as possible ``witnesses or  
suspects,'' in the case.

<HEADLINE> Rams' Hakim Solid on Return Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams thought they knew what kind  
of prize they had when Az-Zahir Hakim returned two punts for 
touchdowns in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they're sure.  
</P>
<P>
	Hakim had an 84-yarder last week for a touchdown last week in a  
35-7 rout of the Bengals and caught three touchdown passes. From 
now on he expects ``the good teams, the smart teams,'' to avoid him 
at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If teams are going to keep on kicking to me, I've got to keep  
on taking them back,'' Hakim said. ``Hopefully I can still 
contribute and take some more punts back to the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakim's four TDs tied the team record, last accomplished by  
Harold Jackson in 1973. He's the first NFL player to score four 
touchdowns in a game since Corey Dillon of Cincinnati Dec. 4, 1997, 
and his 147 punt return yards is the second-highest total in team 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Az was spectacular,'' coach Dick Vermeil said. ``The kid is  
very courageous, very confident, and he knows he can do it. He is a 
threat every time he touches the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakim, a fourth-round pick in the 1998 draft, is one of many  
weapons at wide receiver along with the finally healthy Isaac 
Bruce, Torry Holt and Ricky Proehl. He has 10 catches for a 
15.8-yard average and those three touchdowns, including a 
51-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you want me to say about him?'' quarterback Kurt  
Warner said. ``The guy is special, he's phenomenal. He's capable of 
doing that each and every week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakim said he's special mainly because he's part of a special  
offense. The Rams are No. 4 in the NFL, averaging 394.7 yards, 
after ending last season 27th. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know whose week it's going to be this week,'' Hakim  
said. ``They have to try to stop us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where Hakim really sticks out is in the return game, a big  
problem area for the Rams last season. He replaced Eddie Kennison, 
a former first-round pick who fell off and was shipped to New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite little previous punt return experience, Hakim returned  
two for scores against San Diego in an exhibition. Vermeil said he 
could have scored another touchdown against the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil also said having that dangerous a player is a huge boost  
to the other 10 players on the field blocking for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a return team knows they have a guy back there that can  
put it in the end zone or in good field position, they just go 
harder,'' Vermeil said. ``They just do things better, because their 
blocks and their effort are meaningful to them, and the reward is 
greater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakim recovered his own fumble on his 84-yard return, perhaps  
throwing off the coverage. He also fumbled on one of his two 
preseason returns, not that either was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to do that on purpose,'' Hakim said. ``It kind  
of fools the defense, and everything works out well for me.''

<HEADLINE> Thatcher Arrives At Tory Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKPOOL, England (AP) -- Amid thunderous applause mingled with  
embarrassment at her latest attack on Britain's European partners, 
former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took center-stage today at 
the Conservative Party's annual conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Lady Thatcher, the most famous and successful Tory leader since  
World War II, smiled and waved, flanked on the podium by the 
defeated party's current leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, she planned to give a speech urging the  
release of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet -- her 
first speech at a conference rally since she was ousted in a party 
revolt in November 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, a judge excused Pinochet from appearing in court Friday  
to hear a decision on his extradition to Spain after a doctor 
testified that the 83-year-old general suffered two small strokes 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause Thatcher is espousing -- Pinochet's release -- is as  
likely to chill the party's more liberal wing as her trenchant 
opposition to closer integration with the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my lifetime, all of the problems have come from mainland  
Europe and all of the solutions have come from the English-speaking 
world,'' Thatcher, 74, said at a reception for Scottish Tories on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an evident reference to World War II, where British and  
American allies fought side by side. 
</P>
<P>
	Thatcher's comments ``create the impression that Britain and  
British opinion is somehow prejudiced and anti-European -- and that 
can only damage our national interest,'' said Malcolm Rifkind, 
foreign secretary in the Tory government defeated by Prime Minister 
Tony Blair's Labor Party government in 1997. He spoke today in a 
British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
	On Pinochet, her views also are controversial.  
</P>
<P>
	The general has been held in Britain for nearly a year fighting  
an attempt by Spain to extradite him to stand trial for allegedly 
committing human rights abuses during his 17-year rule in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thatcher considers him a good friend who helped her when she  
went to war with Argentina in 1982 over the Falkland Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Stirring controversy and strong passions has almost always  
marked Thatcher's political career. Her 1979-1990 premiership 
spelled the demise of Britain's trade unions and set a political 
agenda that moved the now-governing Labor Party to the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Thatcher arrived in this north England resort Tuesday following  
reports that she criticized Conservative leader William Hague. 
</P>
<P>
	He took over from her successor John Major following the Tories'  
crushing electoral defeat by Labor in May 1997, and has failed to 
turn around the Tories' dire ratings among the British electorate. 
The party trails Labor by some 20 percentage points in recent 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's terrific,'' Thatcher said, with Hague by her side. ``He  
has the best-organized conference. It's the prelude to victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thatcher was sure of a big audience in a movie theater hired for  
her meeting today. But elsewhere, the signs of the Tories' poor 
shape were evident. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 8,000 people, including guests, exhibitors and journalists,  
were attending the conference, compared with 20,000 at Labor's 
annual meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
	And the traditional party of business attracted only 79  
commercial exhibitors, while 200 showed up for the Labor gathering.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urged To Deregulate Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- As American and Japanese officials began talks  
Wednesday on opening up their markets to outsiders, U.S. Ambassador 
Thomas Foley called on Japan to deregulate its telecommunications 
industry and make it easier for competitors to enter it. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley, outlining recommendations in an annual U.S. report on  
Japanese economic reforms, said a more open telecom industry in 
Japan would create jobs, stimulate investment and spur new 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Japan to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of the  
industry, ``which would establish a regulatory system that makes 
promotion of competition its primary objective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, said the effort to  
deregulate should be a ``two-way'' process, ministry officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo pointed to U.S. anti-dumping measures as well as ``Buy  
American'' laws as examples of where the United States needs to 
modify its own regulations, an official said on customary condition 
of anonymity. Anti-dumping measures seek to stop foreign companies 
from selling products at below-production costs in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	In its study, the United States also calls for broader  
competition and specific reforms in industries including medical 
devices and pharmaceuticals, financial services, housing and 
energy. The study lays out the U.S. position in advance of an 
annual U.S.-Japan report on deregulation expected in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The lucrative Japanese telecommunications industry has long been  
an area of concern for U.S. trade officials. The industry is 
dominated by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., the world's second 
largest telecommunications company after AT&AMP;T Corp. of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government announced plans in 1996 to break up NTT,  
which long had a virtual monopoly on local phone services. And 
Washington and Tokyo reached an agreement this summer to give 
foreign companies a better shot at competing for sales to NTT and 
its successor companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. report, however, said Japan needs to go further.  
</P>
<P>
	``The telecommunications market in Japan is burdened by a legacy  
of laws, regulations and monopolistic business practices that fail 
to support the needs of a competitive market,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington urged Japan to draw up regulations to prevent  
anti-competitive behavior, free new entrants from excessive red 
tape and provide access to NTT's facilities, among other steps.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Mechanics OK Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- US Airways mechanics voted to accept a new  
contract, averting a strike against the nation's sixth largest 
airline, the union announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace  
Workers said the five-year contract was approved by a 3-1 margin of 
ballots cast Tuesday at local union offices across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement addresses the concerns raised by the membership  
after the previous agreement was rejected, and is an example of 
what the solidarity and determination of our members and the 
negotiating committee can provide,'' said union vice president 
Robert Roach, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval of the contract by the union's rank and file had been  
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the mechanics voted down one potential agreement, and a  
strike deadline was just four days away when federally mediated 
talks reached another deal Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had continued to threaten to strike US Airways within  
48 hours if the revised agreement was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	About 7,500 mechanics, airplane cleaners and other maintenance  
workers for US Airways, based in Arlington, Va., are covered by the 
new contract, which promises immediate bonuses and raises for all. 
</P>
<P>
	Experienced US Airways mechanics earn about $23 an hour.  
</P>
<P>
	The airline, meanwhile, won the right to use a limited number of  
part-time workers on crews that clean aircraft between flights. A 
key difference between the first, rejected contract and the one 
union members approved was a lower cap on the number of part-time 
workers allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the company faces a significant loss for the third  
quarter, this new agreement is a major milestone on our path toward 
shedding our noncompetitive cost structure,'' said US Airways 
President Rakesh Gangwal.

<HEADLINE> Injured Chargers Missing Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The pressure is on for the San Diego Chargers  
to keep backup quarterback Erik Kramer healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Jim Harbaugh, nursing a bruised throwing elbow and two  
cracked ribs, didn't practice Wednesday, although there's a good 
chance he'll be available for Sunday's game at Detroit. Also 
sidelined was Mikhael Ricks, the second-year wide receiver who is 
the team's emergency quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	And third-stringer Ryan Leaf, still rehabbing his surgically  
repaired right shoulder, is at least two weeks away from being able 
to go in and simply hand off to a running back, should it come down 
to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Jim was hurt and Erik was blocking on the reverse the  
other day it was a very interesting situation,'' coach Mike Riley 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer didn't get hurt blocking in the third quarter of Sunday's  
21-14 win over Kansas City, but Ricks injured his neck running the 
reverse and said he's been experiencing numbness in neck and upper 
left arm. He's listed on the injury report as questionable. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, who threw two touchdown passes Sunday, took all the  
first-string snaps Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh, knocked out of the game in the first quarter, is  
listed as probable. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh said his ribs were ``sore, but better than I thought  
they'd be. I think I'll be able to play, whether they need me to 
start or to back up Erik.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh threw about 20-30 passes on the side Wednesday and said  
he hopes to practice on Thursday. ``I can't stand around at 
practice. It hurts more than my ribs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley wasn't so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``From what I saw today, I think it will be hard tomorrow, which  
is our big work day. I think he'll be ready to do some stuff for us 
on Friday. Then we'll make a determination on the game after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that if nothing else, Jim will be healthy enough to  
play in the game if needed,'' Riley said. ``Then Erik would 
obviously start if that was the case. And then we've got to talk 
about if Mikhael Ricks then isn't ready to play, what we would 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, receiver Chris Penn might be the emergency QB. Or,  
Riley joked, ``It might be snap the ball deep to Terrell Fletcher 
and let's go, the old Wing T, maybe.''

<HEADLINE> NAACP Accuses Cracker Barrel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NAACP says Cracker Barrel denies promotions  
to black employees, keeping most of them in ``back of the house'' 
jobs in the kitchen, out of customers' sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Kweisi Mfume, president of The National Association for the  
Advacement of Colored People, announced Tuesday that the civil 
rights organization has joined the lawsuit and asked for class 
action status. 
</P>
<P>
	The racial discrimination lawsuit claims Cracker Barrel denies  
blacks desirable jobs, promotions, training and management 
positions. The suit also alleges that Cracker Barrel tolerates, and 
sometimes supports, racist comments and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed in July in the Rome division of the U.S.  
District Court on behalf of 12 current and former employees, five 
of whom worked in a Dalton Cracker Barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	A companion case, also filed in the Rome court, claims Cracker  
Barrel does not pay servers minimum wage for performing non-serving 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Cracker Barrel, a 391-restaurant chain based in Lebanon, Tenn.,  
denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Norm Hill, senior vice president of human resources, said the  
company -- with 40,000 employees -- has strict equal employment 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we cannot yet discuss the details of all the claims that  
have been made since these charges are so new, we are confident 
that what will become clear is that the claims are way off base and 
present a highly distorted picture of our company,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991 the company fired several employees based on a policy  
banning homosexual workers. The policy was rescinded after 
gay-rights groups protested. 
</P>
<P>
	The racial discrimination lawsuit claims Cracker Barrel denies  
blacks desirable jobs, promotions, training and management 
positions. The suit also alleges that Cracker Barrel tolerates, and 
sometimes supports, racist comments and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs want the court to require Cracker Barrel to  
restructure its hiring and paying procedures, reimburse attorneys' 
fees and pay employees back wages.

<HEADLINE> Fears Grow in Colo. for Lost Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUSTIC, Colo. (AP) -- Searchers and dog teams fanned into the  
rugged wilderness near Poudre Canyon today as the search for a 
3-year-old boy entered its fifth day. 
</P>
<P>
	No signs of Jaryd Atadero have been found since he vanished  
while walking with family and friends Saturday morning along a 
trail in the 9,000-foot mountains west of Fort Collins and about 75 
miles northwest of Denver. Jaryd was running up the trail to hide 
behind boulders and trees so he could jump out from his hiding 
place and say ``Boo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A searcher Tuesday afternoon took the boy's father, Allyn  
Atadero, 41, up the trail to the spot where his son was last seen 
by members of the hiking group. 
</P>
<P>
	A dejected Atadero emerged from the trail about an hour before  
nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't lost hope,'' he said, choking back tears, ``but it's  
a major task still, and I think I may never ever see my son 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, sparkling Indian summer skies lent no help to rescuers  
searching the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are checking under every rock and every log -- and making  
sure we look everywhere the little boy could be,'' said Larimer 
County Sheriff Jim Alderden in explaining why the search area would 
be enlarged. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said the possibility of an abduction had been  
considered but it remains ``an extremely remote possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is puzzled and frustrated, we should have found him  
by now,'' Alderden said.

<HEADLINE> Pele's Son Convicted of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The son of Brazilian soccer great Pele  
was convicted of murder early today for participating in a street 
car race which resulted in the death of a passing motorcyclist. 
</P>
<P>
	Edson Cholbi do Nascimento, 29, received a six-year sentence to  
be served under a work release program, which means he must sleep 
in prison but can leave during the day to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento and Marcilio Jose Marinho de Melo, 25, -- who also was  
convicted and received the same sentence -- were accused of racing 
their cars in Santos, a town 48 miles southeast of Sao Paulo, when 
they struck and killed 50-year-old retiree Pedro Simoes Neto. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Melo's car was the one that hit Neto, Nascimento was  
found guilty for taking part in the race in October 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the verdict, Nascimento's lawyer, Marlon Machado  
filed an appeal claiming that some of the witnesses had ``obviously 
lied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so obvious, that the judge reminded one of them that he  
was testifying under oath,'' Machado said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he thought some witnesses would lie, Machado said:  
``Probably to show Brazil and the rest of the world that impunity 
will not be tolerated in Santos and that even the son of a famous 
and wealthy personality could be sent to jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But in this case they helped convict two innocent people.'' he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Superior Tribunal of Justice of the state of Sao  
Paulo probably will rule on his appeal by August 2000. If the 
appeal is successful, a new trial would be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento and Melo will remain free until the appeal is judged.  
</P>
<P>
	Machado tried to convince the jurors that Simoes Neto was killed  
in an accident and not because of a car race. 
</P>
<P>
	Globo News showed videotape of Nascimento denying he had  
anything to do with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I witnessed an accident that happened in front of me,''  
Nascimento told the judge. ``My only involvement was as a 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Nascimento nor Pele were available for immediate  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agencia Folha news agency quoted Nascimento as saying: ``We  
should congratulate the prosecutor because he managed to condemn 
two innocent people without proof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento, a reserve goalie for eight years on the Santos team  
-- Pele's former club -- announced his retirement from professional 
soccer in June.

<HEADLINE> Angry DH Skips Workout, Leaves Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Red Sox designated hitter Reggie Jefferson  
reportedly skipped Tuesday's mandatory workout and left the team 
because he was angry about being left off the postseason roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Herald, quoting a source close to the player,  
reported today that Jefferson had packed his bags and left 
Cleveland. Jefferson did not comment before departing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe, also citing a source it did not identify, said  
Jefferson and Boston general manger Dan Duquette were involved in a 
shouting match at the team hotel on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In place of Jefferson, the Red Sox decided to keep infielder Lou  
Merloni on the 25-man roster because of concerns over recent 
injuries to shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and third baseman John 
Valentin. Reliever Tom Gordon was also told he made the roster for 
the best-of-5 series against the Cleveland Indians, which begins 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The roster could be changed between rounds if the Red Sox  
advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-handed Jefferson is 7-for-16 in his career against  
Cleveland's Game 1 starter, Bartolo Colon.

<HEADLINE> EU Probing Totalfina-Elf Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators decided  
Wednesday to launch an extended antitrust probe into Franco-Belgian 
oil giant Totalfina SA's proposed $52 billion purchase of French 
rival Elf Aquitaine SA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merger ... raises serious doubts as to its compatibility  
with (EU) competition rules,'' a statement by the EU executive 
Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the takeover could create dominant positions in France  
on the markets for the wholesale distribution of fuels, the retail 
distribution of fuels on motorways, the production and sale of 
liquefied petroleum gas and the supply of jet fuels to airports in 
Toulouse and Lyon in France. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU decision had been widely anticipated given the scale of  
the deal which will create the world's fourth largest oil group and 
France's largest company. 
</P>
<P>
	An extended investigation gives the European Commission's  
regulators another four months to determine if the deal infringes 
EU rules on fair business competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Totalfina said the Commission's decision ``in no  
way affects the timetable'' for the takeover bid. Totalfina's share 
swap offer is due to close Oct. 15, with results published Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Totalfina chairman Thierry Desmarest met last week with EU  
Competition Commission Mario Monti to discuss the takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	London's Financial Times reported Wednesday that Desmarest  
offered to spin off highway gasoline stations, oil pipelines and 
liquid petroleum gas interests in order to allay the EU's 
competition concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper reported the offer fell short of the Commission's  
demands and the companies will likely have to commit to further 
divestment's in order to secure EU approval for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Commission cleared two giant oil mergers -- one  
between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., and the other between BP Amoco 
PLC and Atlantic Richfield Co. - after the companies agreed to sell 
business in areas where they were seen gaining anticompetitive 
positions.

<HEADLINE> Country Singer's Murder Trial Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UVALDE, Texas (AP) -- Johnny Rodriguez acted in self defense when  
he shot and killed a longtime friend last year, his attorney told 
jurors Wednesday in opening statements at the country singer's 
murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, 47, who had a series of Top Ten hits in the 1970s,  
shot Israel Borrego on Aug. 29, 1998, in his mother's home of 
Sabinal, about 60 miles west of San Antonio. The singer, who faces 
a life prison term if convicted, says he thought Borrego was an 
intruder. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Tony Hackebeil told jurors Rodriguez had invited  
Borrego to a late-night drinking party at a house across the street 
from the home of Rodriguez's mother. He indicated no motive but 
said the shooting occurred while Borrego was cooking breakfast for 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not have good reason to do it,'' the prosecutor said.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Jay Norton told jurors Rodriguez found the door  
of his mother's home unlocked at 4 a.m. and believed Borrego was a 
burglar. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sees a shadowy figure. He sees a silhouette. He sees a man  
in his house,'' Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norton said Rodriguez reached for a pistol in a couch cushion  
and fired one shot that hit Borrego in the leg. The 26-year-old 
died several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense also painted the victim as a hostile figure who  
wasn't invited to the party. Norton said Borrego had a bad 
reputation and a felony conviction for burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez had his first Top Ten hit in 1972 with ``Pass Me By  
(If You're Only Passing Through).'' He moved to the top of 
Billboard's Country Hit List with ``You Always Come Back (to 
Hurting Me)'' and again when he wrote and recorded ``Ridin' My 
Thumb to Mexico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen of his albums and singles landed in the Top  
10. But his career suffered when he began to abuse drugs and 
alcohol, Rodriguez has said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has freed himself of drug addiction.  
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Tovar, another of Rodriguez's longtime friends and the  
man at whose home the party was held, also was charged with murder 
but that charge was dropped Friday.

<HEADLINE> GOP Proposes Tax Alternatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One million average taxpayers could avoid the  
complex alternative minimum tax and a business research tax break 
that expired this summer would become permanent under a proposal 
Wednesday from a key Republican senator. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-year, $28.7 billion draft measure also would renew  
several other expiring business tax breaks through June 2004 and 
make permanent a deduction employers can take for educational 
expenses they pay for workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., outlined  
the proposal at a closed-door meeting of the panel. There is almost 
universal support on Capitol Hill for the so-called ``extenders'' 
bill -- the House GOP has a less costly version -- but vast 
disagreement on how to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, for example, strongly support making permanent the  
research and development tax credit that ended June 30 -- a top 
priority for high-tech industry and manufacturers. And neither 
party's lawmakers want an estimated 1 million taxpayers to face 
higher alternative minimum taxes just for claiming breaks such as 
the $500 per child tax credit on their federal returns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats, led by President Clinton, are resisting any tax  
package that would spend projected budget surpluses, as Roth's bill 
would in four of the five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threshold question is whether it's going to be fully paid  
for,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats were discussing an alternative that would extend  
the R&AMP;D credit and the AMT protection for two years, but others 
favor making the research credit permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's expensive. I hope we can find a way to pay for it,'' said  
Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic options to offset the costs included closing  
corporate tax shelters, renewal of a Superfund environmental 
cleanup tax and limits on foreign tax credits, said Finance 
Committee sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth is proposing only to offset the fiscal 2000 cost of $1.7  
billion by increasing estimated tax payment requirements for people 
earning $150,000 or more. In addition, companies would be prevented 
from claiming the research credit until Oct. 1, 2000, when the 2001 
fiscal year begins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has threatened to veto the bill if it  
spends the surplus before Social Security and Medicare are 
safeguarded for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the measure  
could prove too popular to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president wants to veto the R&AMP;D tax credit ... go right  
ahead. His days are numbered anyway,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth's bill also includes five-year extensions for credits  
businesses can claim if they hire workers from certain 
disadvantaged or ethnic groups and those coming off welfare. The 
House version has 30-month extensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure includes a five-year extension of a credit for  
electricity produced by wind and certain kinds of biological 
material -- including a poultry waste provision sought by Roth for 
Delaware's chicken producers. These provisions are not in the House 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Both bills would extend an oil and gas investment deduction and  
an exemption for foreign corporate income from banking, insurance 
or finance.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Offense Still Has Work To Do </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers are coming to  
Buffalo with the best defense in the AFC. That should worry the 
Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Drowned by the celebration over the Bills defense following  
their victory over the Dolphins were grumblings about the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's ground game would not rattle a teacup, emerging  
superstar Eric Moulds all but disappeared before catching a 
touchdown pass in the fourth quarter in Miami, and Doug Flutie 
seemed to be settling into mediocrity after lifting the team to the 
playoffs last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's not going to be perfect,'' Bills coach Wade  
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	And where has Andre Reed gone? The future Hall of Fame receiver  
and one of the team's three remaining players from the four Super 
Bowl teams of the early 1990s? Remember him? 
</P>
<P>
	Reed did not have a single catch in Buffalo's 23-18 win over  
Miami, and he's not happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be involved in the offense a little bit more, but  
it's not up to me,'' Reed said Wednesday. ``I need to be involved 
more. I haven't been involved the last two weeks. Really, I haven't 
been involved for four weeks. I'd like to make some plays, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Buffalo's defense picked off Dan Marino twice and returned  
a fumble recovery for a touchdown, nobody noticed how quiet the 
offense really was. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their defensive dominance, the Bills were outgained by  
the Dolphins, 293 yards to 250. Flutie, the sixth-rated passer in 
the AFC behind division rivals Drew Bledsoe of New England and 
Peyton Manning of Indianapolis, completed 12 of 25 passes for 186 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	He found only four receivers and relied most on tight end Jay  
Riemersma, who had four catches. Moulds, who began with a 
career-high 10 catches for 147 yards in the season opener against 
the Colts, had three each in the next two games and four against 
the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly the kind of numbers Moulds was aiming for after last  
season, when he broke Reed's single-season team record with 1,368 
yards receiving and caught nine touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Steelers could be another story.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bills' running game has been under a microscope since  
training camp. Much was made of the Dolphins' paltry rushing total 
of 59 yards, but Buffalo managed only 73, including Flutie's 29 
yards scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Antowain Smith, who led the Bills with 1,124 yards rushing last  
season, totaled 36 yards on 12 attempts against the Dolphins. He 
has 220 yards this season, and is on track to fall short of 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But center Jerry Ostroski isn't worried. ``As long as we win the  
game, that's all that counts,'' Ostroski said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Phillips points to Buffalo's 80-yard drive in the fourth  
quarter against Miami, keyed by Flutie's passes to Moulds for 40 
yards and to Kevin Williams for 23, and capped by a 6-yard TD toss 
to Moulds. 
</P>
<P>
	And if the Bills aren't worried about their offense, Pittsburgh  
coach Bill Cowher is. ``They looked pretty good on Monday night,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Probes Dismissed Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Two members of Alabama's athletic  
department didn't break any NCAA rules when they had their traffic 
tickets fixed, but that may not be the case for receiver Shamari 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Robbins, the university's NCAA compliance officer, said  
Wednesday the school was investigating the circumstances 
surrounding a speeding ticket Buchanan received in April that was 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation coincides with Gov. Don Siegelman's order for  
state agencies to find out if any employees have been involved in 
ticket fixing. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Alabama assistant football coach Jeff Rouzie and  
associate athletic director Mal Moore also admitted to having 
tickets fixed for them between 1992 and this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to lie about it,'' Rouzie, a linebackers coach,  
told the Birmingham News. ``It's like paying taxes -- you don't want 
to pay any more than you have to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acting Alabama Department of Public Safety Director Col. Mike  
Sullivan resigned under pressure Friday after Siegelman confronted 
him about documents obtained by reporters indicating his office was 
involved in fixing tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan has been the personal security escort for the Alabama  
head coach at games for more than a decade. He has declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins said Tuesday she hoped to have Buchanan's case resolved  
by the end of the week. Buchanan was held out of last week's game 
at Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins also questioned cornerback Reggie Myles and one other  
player about tickets they received in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Having a ticket dropped does not necessarily mean something  
improper occurred, but it could be an NCAA violation if a ticket 
was fixed by Sullivan or others. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA rules prohibit players from receiving extra benefits.  
Robbins said Rouzie and Moore did not fall into that category. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama is under NCAA probation until 2004 due to past  
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama coach Mike DuBose called the controversy over the ticket  
issue ``silly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine ... there's people all over the world (doing it),''  
DuBose said. 
</P>
<P>
	State court records show that at least eight current and recent  
Crimson Tide players have had traffic tickets, mostly for speeding 
violations, dropped in district courts across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who was a quarterback for coach Bear Bryant and later  
worked as an assistant for him, did not pay fines for a speeding 
ticket he received in 1992 and two more in 1997. He said that in 
each case he was traveling close enough to the speed limit that he 
thought the tickets might be reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
	Rouzie, an Alabama defensive lineman in the early 1970s, was  
cited for speeding four times between 1994 and 1999, and all were 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't concerned about the cost of the fines, but if I can  
get help to keep my insurance rates down, I'm going to get it,'' 
Rouzie said. ``If it's illegal, I'm truly sorry. That was not my 
intention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said he ``never dreamed'' that Sullivan would lose his job  
over the handling of speeding tickets.

<HEADLINE> Alternative Healing for Arthritis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Patients taking alternative medicine  
treatments for arthritis are much more likely than previously 
thought to be discussing the alternative therapy with their 
physicians, according to a new study. In addition, very few are 
afraid their doctors will disapprove. 
</P>
<P>
	``The literature would have you believe that most patients won't  
tell the doctor,'' said Dr. Jaya K. Rao, lead author of the study 
of more than 200 arthritis patients in six different clinical 
settings in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the study found that many patients were concerned about  
potential interactions between conventional medicines and 
alternative treatments, such as herbs or large doses of vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
	``People would want to know, `Is this going to interact with the  
therapies that I'm taking?','' said Rao, whose findings were 
published in the Sept. 21 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, 
a Philadelphia-based medical journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert C. Atkins, the founder of the Atkins Center for  
Complementary Medicine and an advocate of alternative medicine, 
said he doubts that patients would be as open about talking to 
their doctors about alternative treatments for other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception is, `My oncologist wouldn't want to hear  
anything about alternative treatments for cancer,''' Atkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbs sold in health-food stores to treat arthritis are being  
used widely, he said. ``When it's something that has gained fairly 
widespread acceptance, they're all too willing to talk about it,'' 
Atkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Janson, the president of the American College for  
Advancement in Medicine in Laguna Hills, Calif., agreed with 
Atkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cancer is somehow more of a hot-button issue for doctors  
because there is very little that does treat it well,'' including 
alternative medicine, Janson said. He said conventional treatments 
work well for a few types of cancers but for many types, no 
treatment is a good cure. 
</P>
<P>
	But Janson said that is no reason for conventional doctors to  
speak ill of alternative treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't have anything better to offer, you really should  
be cautious about making remarks that demean the other treatment,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rao's study examined 232 patients who saw rheumatologists at six  
different clinical settings in Indianapolis: a municipal hospital 
that cares for the poor, a veterans' hospital, a fee-for-service 
specialty-care practice and three private rheumatology practices. 
It found that about two-thirds of the patients had used some form 
of alternative medicine at least once. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what most surprised us was that 56 percent of the  
two-thirds were using it at the time of the survey,'' Rao said. 
Another surprise was that many were using multiple forms of 
alternative medicine. The study found that 24 percent had used at 
least three different forms of alternative treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those who did not tell their doctor about the alternative  
treatments, only 15 percent said it was because they feared the 
doctor would disapprove, the study found. It also found 55 percent 
said the doctor did not ask and 49 percent said they meant to tell 
the doctor but forgot. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who did tell their doctor, 71 percent said their  
doctors told them it was acceptable to keep using the alternative 
treatments, while 14 percent said their doctors told them to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that college-educated patients were more  
likely to use alternative treatments than those without degrees. 
Rao said she did not know for certain why this would be so, but 
said, ``They might have more access to other kinds of 
information.'' For example, more educated people might be reading 
more about alternative treatments on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Atkins said it was also his experience that more educated people  
turn to alternative medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very intelligent and knowledgeable decision to  
scrutinize what all of your options are,'' Atkins said, adding that 
college-educated people are more likely to have that intelligence

<P>
	One limitation of the study was that it did not examine the  
attitudes of people who rely exclusively on alternative healing and 
avoid physicians altogether. Rao said she did not know of any 
studies conducted on such people.

<HEADLINE> Prisoner Escaped in Vat of Hog Slop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A convicted killer is suspected of two  
more deaths during a prison escape that began when he crawled into 
a huge barrel of hog slop that was later towed away, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth D. Williams was back behind bars Wednesday. He is the  
prime suspect in two deaths that happened during the day and a half 
he was loose. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old convict escaped Sunday morning after climbing  
through an 18-by-16-inch opening into the 500-gallon barrel in a 
prison kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	The table scraps were later moved to a prison farm, Corrections  
Department spokeswoman Dina Tyler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was stuff inside. Water, vegetables. You know, hog  
slop,'' Tyler said. The tank didn't have a grate then. It does now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our initial indication, from the investigation, is that he  
apparently had some help from within,'' Gov. Mike Huckabee said 
Wednesday night. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Knee prints found in a ditch on the prison farm indicated  
someone was trying to keep from being seen, Tyler said. ``By 
cutting across the field and following the tree line you can get to 
the highway without being noticed that much,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four miles from the prison, farmer Cecil Boren, 57, was shot to  
death and robbed Sunday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was driving Boren's truck and had several of the man's  
guns when he rammed a water truck in southwestern Missouri on 
Monday, officials said. The driver, Michael Greenwood, 24, of 
Springfield, Mo., was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was captured shortly after the crash and was returned  
to Arkansas on Tuesday after waiving extradition. Charges have not 
been filed in either Boren's or Greenwood's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was sentenced to life in prison three weeks ago for the  
1998 kidnapping of two college students on their first date. The 
woman was killed and the man was injured.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Object to WorldCom Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc.'s bold $115 billion plan to  
take over Sprint Corp. and unite the nation's second- and 
third-largest long-distance companies met immediate resistance from 
a top federal regulator who asked ``How can this be good for 
consumers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom and Sprint, however, insist their deal, the richest  
corporate buyout ever, would strengthen competition across the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	WorldCom, as the combined company will be known, could offer  
customers local and long-distance service, as well as mobile phone, 
paging and Internet products, all for one, flat-rate monthly fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators, however, point to WorldCom's control of 36 percent  
of the $110 billion U.S. long-distance market, second only to AT&AMP;T 
Corp.'s 43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competition has produced a price war in the long-distance  
market. This merger appears to be a surrender,'' William E. 
Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said the companies ``will bear a heavy burden to show  
how consumers would be better off'' as a result of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to FCC approval, the deal also faces antitrust  
scrutiny from the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	His concerns were echoed by consumer groups and rival Baby Bell  
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The static coming out of Washington had many people, including  
investors, wondering if the deal would fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's shares unexpectedly fell $2 to $58.87 1/2 Tuesday on the  
New York Stock Exchange, despite MCI WorldCom's offer of $76 a 
share in stock. MCI WorldCom's stock slumped $3.68 3/4 to $67.93 3/4 a 
share on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard J. Ebbers, president and chief executive of MCI  
WorldCom, defended his deal during a New York news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understood from day one it is our burden of proof to show  
this is pro-competitive,'' he said. ``The chairman (of the FCC) 
told us he would keep an open mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The long-distance market in the United States is expected to get  
new entrants as Baby Bells, such as Bell Atlantic Corp., get the 
green light from regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to promote  
competition in local and long-distance markets and cable 
television. But in the past three years, new technology has changed 
the competitive landscape, and started a wave of mergers and 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can now make a telephone call that is carried over the  
Internet, receive e-mail messages over their wireless phones and 
watch movies on their computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like many of the recent events in our industry, this merger  
would have seemed improbable a few years ago,'' Ebbers said. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom topped a competing $100 billion offer from  
BellSouth Corp. to win control of Sprint. MCI WorldCom, based in 
Clinton, Miss., sweetened its offer rather than risk losing 
Sprint's 4 million wireless customers and 1.7 million paging 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebbers, 58, will be president and chief executive of the new  
WorldCom. William T. Esrey, 59, chairman and chief executive of 
Kansas City, Mo.-based Sprint, will be chairman of WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	For Ebbers, it is the second stunning takeover in two years. His  
upstart WorldCom acquired what was then MCI Communications in 1998, 
beating out foreign rival British Telecommunications PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's deal is structured so that Sprint shareholders will  
get $76 worth in MCI WorldCom's stock for each Sprint share as long 
as MCI WorldCom shares trade between $62.15 and $80.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of Sprint PCS, the stock that tracks the  
performance of Sprint's wireless business, will exchange their 
shares, on a 1-for-1 basis, for shares in WorldCom PCS. They also 
will receive 0.1547 of a share of MCI WorldCom stock, worth $10.51, 
based on Tuesday's closing price. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom also will assume $14 billion in Sprint debt and  
preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom will have 10 seats on the board of the new company,  
while Sprint will have six. The companies hope to complete the deal 
in the second half of next year.

<HEADLINE> Walkout Ends at British Ford Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Workers returned to their jobs Wednesday at the  
largest Ford Motor Co. plant in Britain after walking out to 
protest what they said was racism and bullying by fellow employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Factory managers and union officials were holding talks in an  
effort to defuse tensions at the Dagenham factory in Essex, said an 
official of the Transport and General Workers' Union who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The spontaneous strike by at least 800 employees began early  
Tuesday and continued with the participation of evening-shift 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	It halted production of Ford Fiesta models bound for sale in  
Europe, Latin America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact is that 1,200 vehicles would normally have been  
produced yesterday,'' said Anne-Marie Chatterton, a spokeswoman for 
Ford Motor Co. Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees resumed work Wednesday at about 8:00 a.m. local time,  
said Chatterton, who added that the cause of the walkout had not 
yet been confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials said the walkout was sparked by a series of  
incidents at the factory just east of London. An Asian worker 
claimed last month that he had been subjected to racist abuse and 
Ku Klux Klan graffiti, and last week a white foreman allegedly 
pushed an Asian shop steward. 
</P>
<P>
	Union representatives have asked the government's Commission for  
Racial Equality to launch a formal investigation into what the TGW 
official called a culture of racism at the plant. The TGW 
represents more than half of the plant's 4,500 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chatterton countered that Ford has an equal opportunities policy  
at Dagenham. 
</P>
<P>
	The costs from the work stoppage were not available, she said.

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Rise 1.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to U.S. factories vaulted ahead in  
August on the strength of higher demand for airplanes and 
electronics in another sign of a resurgence in manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.3 percent gain in factory orders was the 12th increase in  
the past 15 months, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
Analysts had generally expected factory orders to rise 0.6 percent. 
Even that would have been brisk. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a pace that ensures significant production increases  
for the rest of the year and into 2000,'' said economist Joel 
Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, along with other recent manufacturing data, shows  
``that manufacturing is really healing from the global downturn 
from the past year or so,'' said economist Cliff Waldman of Waldman 
Associates in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	With overseas economies in recovery, demand for U.S.  
manufactured goods should continue to pick up through the end of 
the year, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost every indicator for the factory sector is firming,  
which suggests accelerating factory activity in the months ahead,'' 
said Merrill Lynch senior economist Stan Shipley. 
</P>
<P>
	As Asian and Latin American economies recover from the global  
financial crisis that began in Thailand in 1997, overseas' demand 
for U.S. manufactured goods is improving and competition from 
cheaper imports is easing. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the National Association of Purchasing Management  
reported that manufacturing grew more than expected in September, 
the eighth consecutive month of growth. Also last week, the 
government said that orders for big-ticket manufactured goods such 
as airplanes and cars rose a stronger-than-expected 0.9 percent in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong factory orders report comes one day after the Federal  
Reserve decided not to raise short-term interest rates while 
leaving the door open for an increase later this year. The Fed has 
raised rates twice this year to slow the economy and keep inflation 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 100 points in  
early afternoon trading in response to a firmer bond market and 
optimism about third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	A jump in orders for airplane and aircraft parts contributed to  
a 4.8 percent increase in orders for all transportation products in 
August, the fourth monthly gain in a row. That was up from a 2.1 
percent gain the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Even excluding the volatile transportation category, factory  
orders would have risen a solid 0.8 percent in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, a category  
that includes household appliances, grew by 0.8 percent in August, 
down from an 8 percent increase the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in overall factory orders occurred despite a 2.1  
decrease in orders for industrial machinery and equipment, the 
sector that includes computers. That followed a hefty 10.5 percent 
gain in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for primary metals such as steel lost a little ground in  
August, falling 1.0 percent after rising 3.4 percent the month 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items expected  
to last three years or more -- rose 1.2 percent in August, following 
a 4.3 percent gain in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for nondurable goods such as fuel grew by 1.5 percent,  
with orders for petroleum, coal products, chemicals and paper 
registering the biggest increases. In July, nondurable-goods orders 
went up 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Intel Sells Half Its Chips Over Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Computer chip giant Intel Corp., which is loudly  
urging companies to conduct more business over the Internet, has 
aggressively taken its own advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel chief executive Craig Barrett says it's selling a stunning  
$1 billion a month in chips through Web sites it sets up for 
customers such as computer makers -- nearly half the company's 
roughly $30 billion in annual sales -- and will sell virtually all 
its chips this way within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major corporations also are selling billions of dollars in  
products and services across the Internet to business customers as 
a way to cut costs, boost sales and keep customers loyal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Intel's move is strikingly appropriate, given its aggressive  
Internet posture. The company is pushing to become a major supplier 
of chips to makers of servers and networking devices, the high-end 
computers that power the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	By practicing what it preaches, Intel makes a credible argument  
that businesses stand to boost productivity and efficiency by 
replacing existing supply systems based on paper forms and faxes. 
</P>
<P>
	To press that view, Barrett has been touting the Web's explosive  
potential at technology trade shows, declaring that business over 
the Internet is poised to grow into the trillions of dollars as 
companies, suppliers and customers link up to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest Web growth will be among companies that link up to  
each other, suppliers and customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real bulk of e-business is going to be what's underneath  
the tip of the iceberg,'' Barrett said Wednesday in an interview 
after a speech at the Internet World trade show. ``It will change 
the way we do business with our customers and our suppliers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To round out its product lineup, Intel has been snapping up  
makers of networking and communications equipment, buying eight 
this year alone. On Tuesday, Intel paid $500 million for Internet 
equipment maker IPivot Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has little choice but to  
spread beyond its traditional strength in selling chips as the 
brainpower of personal computers. Prices of PCs have plummeted in 
recent years in a big threat to Intel's famously strong profits, 
compelling the company to seek out new growing markets.

<HEADLINE> State Takes Over HMO Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- State regulators assumed management on  
Wednesday of the Rhode Island assets of financially struggling 
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care to protect the HMO's customers and 
perhaps find a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means a likely end to Harvard Pilgrim's nearly  
decade-long presence in Rhode Island. In addition, it sets the 
stage for New England's largest health maintenance organization to 
sever ties with a part of its operation that Massachusetts 
regulators feared was becoming a drag on the overall company. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Schumpert, director of the Rhode Island Department of  
Business Regulation, said the state's decision was prompted by a 
Sept. 22 meeting between regulators and Harvard Pilgrim. 
</P>
<P>
	At that meeting, Massachusetts-based Harvard Pilgrim said it  
would no longer continue to fund the operations of the Rhode Island 
branch as of Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Harvard Pilgrim said it was thinking of  
selling part of its Rhode Island operation to cover huge financial 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday, the insurer said it ``is simply not in  
a position to continue to fund the deficits incurred in Rhode 
Island.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The not-for-profit HMO's Rhode Island branch had losses of $22  
million last year -- 40 percent of the overall company's reported 
$54 million in losses. Yet the company's estimated 145,000 members 
in Rhode Island and parts of Southeastern Massachusetts represent 
just 10 percent of its overall membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Raymond, a spokesman for Harvard Pilgrim, said losses in  
Rhode Island have accelerated this year and show no signs of 
easing. That put the state chapter at odds with a turnaround plan 
announced by the company during the summer to wipe out red ink. 
</P>
<P>
	It also sparked concern among Massachusetts regulators, who made  
it clear, without issuing any directives to the company, that they 
are concerned about that issue, Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their concern, he said, was simple: ``The Massachusetts  
(corporation) shouldn't be subsidizing Rhode Island'' operations or 
absorbing its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Newhouse, a John D. MacArthur professor of health policy at  
Harvard University, said the company's decision could help it free 
up cash for other needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may not be for profit, but they are also not for loss,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island regulators recently hired a consultant to examine  
Harvard Pilgrim's financial straits. The consultant determined that 
the net assets of Harvard Pilgrim's Rhode Island branch were not 
enough to meet minimum state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today it (Harvard Pilgrim) has cash and is paying its bills.  
Will they continue to be able to do that? We don't know that -- it's 
a concern,'' Schumpert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumpert said the state's action does not automatically mean  
Harvard Pilgrim is going out of business in Rhode Island. He said 
the best possible scenario is for Harvard Pilgrim to sell its 
branch here to a buyer who would continue and enhance services now 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
	If that doesn't happen, he said the worst-case scenario would be  
moving Harvard Pilgrim subscribers to other insurers. Harvard 
Pilgrim is the state's third-largest health insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island regulators and the company said there should be no  
disruption in services to Harvard Pilgrim members while the state 
supervises transactions involving the local chapter.

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Missouri Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today angrily criticized  
Senate Republicans for killing the nomination of a Missouri judge 
who is black, saying the party-line vote strengthens the impression 
``that they treat minority and women judicial nominees unfairly and 
unequally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators defeated the nomination of Ronnie White, the first  
black jurist on the Missouri Supreme Court, on a 54-45 vote after 
complaining of a handful of votes to reverse the death penalty. It 
was the first time the full Senate has voted down a judge nominated 
by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued a toughly worded statement on the vote Tuesday  
night and then repeated his criticism before cameras today in the 
Rose Garden. In both instances, he called the vote ``a disgraceful 
act of partisan politics'' by Republicans. ``Once again,'' Clinton 
said, ``this creates a real doubt about the Senate's ability to 
fairly perform its constitutional duty to advise and consent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, by voting down the first African American judge  
... to serve on the Missouri State Supreme Court, the 
Republican-controlled Senate is adding credence to the perception 
that they treat minority and women judicial nominees unfairly and 
unequally,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also said that some Republicans who had voted in  
the Judiciary Committee to recommend White had switched sides when 
the nomination came up on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The deeply partisan vote disrupted seeming progress on  
long-stalled nominations to the federal courts, although the Senate 
later confirmed two judges, one a close friend of Judiciary 
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the other a top Justice 
Department official backed by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, senior Democrat on the Judiciary  
Committee, said he hoped the country ``has not reverted to a time 
in its history where there was a color test on nominations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Charles Shumer, D-N.Y., added the vote will ``create  
division and animus in this country of ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am offended by that statement,'' Senate GOP Whip Don  
Nickles, R-Okla., said of Leahy's comments. ``Many people on our 
side didn't know what color Mr. White was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argued that law enforcement groups couldn't stomach  
White's record in opposing the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the law enforcement community raises a red flag about a  
judicial nomination, as they did in this case, the Senate should 
listen,'' said Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., who led opposition to 
White. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the recent lobbying campaign by Missouri law officers  
was sparked by a sheriff who said he acted after reading news 
accounts, two months ago, of Ashcroft's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The nomination fuels an issue Ashcroft will use in next year's  
campaign against Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan, who appointed White 
in 1995. The senator has condemned Carnahan's decision, at the 
pope's request, to commute the sentence of another death row 
inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft's fellow Missourian, Republican Sen. Christopher Bond,  
voted against White's nomination despite frequently expressing 
support and shepherding White through committee. Bond had never 
actually committed himself to voting for White. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the vote, Democrats chastised GOP leaders for not  
voting on minority and women nominees. In particular, Democrats 
want votes on two nominees to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, 
which covers California and other Western states: Richard Paez, a 
Mexican-American who is a district judge in Los Angeles, and Marsha 
Berzon, an appellate attorney in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who heads the Hispanic  
caucus in the House, said it was ``disgraceful and a slap in the 
face to Latinos and women'' that Paez had been waiting nearly four 
years, and Berzon nearly two, for a Senate vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the nomination issue was Republican criticism of the  
Ninth Circuit's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an extremely liberal activist circuit,'' said Sen. Jeff  
Sessions, R-Ala. ``Let's get this rogue circuit back into line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said that of 19  
judicial nominees confirmed this year before Tuesday, four have 
been women, one black and four Hispanics. ``Their record and the 
kind of judge that the men and women would make is the only thing 
that has been a factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, on a 69-29 vote, did approve Associate Attorney  
General Raymond Fisher -- the Justice Department's No. 3 official -- 
to a seat on the Ninth Circuit. Votes on Fisher and White occurred 
in part because Democrats had threatened to block action on Ted 
Stewart, chief of staff to Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt and Hatch's 
friend. Stewart was approved by a 93-5 vote as a U.S. District 
Judge for Utah.

<HEADLINE> Trump Taj Mahal Fined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort was  
fined nearly $300,000 Wednesday for violating state regulations by 
letting high rollers, who collectively had lost millions on credit 
wagers, keep commissions due the casino. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the fine imposed by the New Jersey Casino Control  
Commission, $237,199, was for baccarat dealers failing to charge 10 
``premium players'' the vigorish. The vigorish is a 5 percent 
commission that must be collected on winning hands baccarat players 
bet with the house; otherwise, the casino would hold no advantage 
over players on such bets. 
</P>
<P>
	According to commission documents, between Sept. 4, 1996 and May  
6, 1998 the Taj Mahal allowed 10 wealthy gamblers, during a total 
of 17 gambling visits, to check out without collecting commissions 
totaling $542,490. State law requires casinos to collect the fee 
before shuffling the cards to refill the dealer's dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissions, ranging from $1,150 to $107,600, were not  
settled for months, in some cases nearly two years, when the state 
was already investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Taj Mahal spokeswoman Kim Butler said casino officials ``had  
hoped for a better understanding of the business issues involved. 
However, we respect the commission's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taj executives admitted during hearings and in documents that  
some players with unpaid vigorish were allowed to return and gamble 
again without paying the outstanding commission. Taj officials 
maintained they tried to collect the commission, but said some 
players pressed to pay it ``just got up and left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Clark, executive vice president of casino operations,  
testified that the 10 gamblers would bring with them or have credit 
lines ranging from $500,000 to $10 million. He said they were 
``hugely important'' to the casino and the state -- because of tax 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also imposed a civil penalty of $60,000 on the  
Taj for violating its own, commission-approved procedures in 
handling a cash complimentary given to a patron who lost $350,000 
bet on credit on Sept. 19, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Police Raid Russian Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian police were checking today the financial  
records of a prominent Moscow bank they raided as an investigation 
into alleged money laundering by Russians through a U.S. bank 
widened. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from Moscow's Economic Crime Fighting Division, along  
with tax police, raided Sobin Bank late Tuesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's state-owned ORT television showed police searching the  
bank's offices, but the network crew on the scene was arrested for 
allegedly not having permission to film the raid. 
</P>
<P>
	The raid at Sobin Bank came as U.S. federal prosecutors charged  
that $7 billion from Russia was illegally funneled through accounts 
at the Bank of New York in one of the largest money laundering 
cases in U.S. history, according to an indictment disclosed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people, including a former bank vice president, and three  
companies were charged with channeling the money -- believed tied to 
Russian organized crime -- in the first criminal charges to be 
brought in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobin Bank has a close relationship to Russia's government,  
handling the State Customs Committee's accounts. Its shareholders 
include two other major banks and Energiya, which builds booster 
rockets for Russia's space program. 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not give any details about the results of the raid,  
or say what they were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has agreed to cooperate with U.S. investigators in the  
money laundering investigation, though it has appeared reluctant to 
launch a thorough probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prosecutor General's office now says it intends to closely  
scrutinize Russian banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are also examining Moscow's Flamingo Bank, which  
allegedly had $430,000 and the equivalent of another $120,000 in 
rubles without proper documentation, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Confirms Davis Cup Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- John McEnroe is already paying  
dividends as the U.S. Davis Cup captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi said Wednesday he will play in next year's Davis  
Cup, quite a turnaround for the French and U.S. Open champion who 
said last March that he wouldn't participate after his friend and 
team doctor George Fareed was dropped from the squad. 
</P>
<P>
	But McEnroe altered Agassi's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be the best captain ever so far,''  
Agassi said at the Swiss Indoors. ``He'll help a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll bring a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of energy, a lot of  
experience. It's an advantage to have someone on your team with 
this kind of fighting spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Agassi, the No. 1 player in the world, could  
become even more important because Pete Sampras has a serious back 
injury, and his status for February's first round is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw for the 2000 Davis Cup competition is scheduled for  
today in London. The United States will find out its first-round 
opponent for competition Feb. 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is one of eight seeded teams. The others are  
Germany, Britain, Spain, Australia, France, Russia and Slovakia. 
The Americans will face one of the eight non-seeded countries: 
Austria, Czech Republic, Italy, Netherlands, Zimbabwe, Belgium, 
Brazil or Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe played on 12 Davis Cup teams, including five champions.  
He still holds six U.S. Davis Cup records and compiled an overall 
record of 59-10. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't just McEnroe's Davis Cup success that swayed  
Agassi. It also was the fact the U.S. Tennis Association allowed 
the team to have some say in the choice of captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, the most important thing was how the decision was made  
so the players had say-so in some of the more important areas such 
as who the captain is,'' Agassi said. ``And I know with John, the 
team will always make decisions as a unit, which is something you 
always hope for in the Davis Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding speculation McEnroe might play in the Davis Cup  
doubles matches, Agassi was diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's addicted to competition,'' Agassi said, laughing. ``It  
would be a new thing for a coach to be a player, but John is 
objective enough to have the best team out there.''

<HEADLINE> WWII Laborers Seek Remuneration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of negotiations, German companies  
are coming to the table with an offer on how much compensation 
they're willing to pay Nazi-era slave laborers. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of labor camp survivors and several governments  
began assembling this morning in a State Department conference room 
for two days of talks aimed at determining compensation for as many 
as 2.4 million people forced into labor to aid Germany's World War 
II military machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Department officials said the meeting, which sometimes has  
included as many as 90 people around the table, would also break up 
into smaller groups during the day to talk about other details of 
plans for setting up a private business foundation and a government 
foundation to settle victim's claims. 
</P>
<P>
	But the spotlight was on the exact amount of money 16 German  
companies would contribute to compensate survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of the talks, survivors launched a newspaper ad  
campaign Monday and held a news conference Tuesday to push for what 
they call a quick and just compensation settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors said the ad campaign will continue through the talks.  
</P>
<P>
	``The corporations who exploited us and who, in genocidal  
partnership with the SS, murdered our friends and relatives have 
grown rich. ... They are worth countless billions,'' Rudy Kennedy, 
a Holocaust survivor from London, said Tuesday at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were treated like animals,'' said an ad about Ford Motor  
Co. and its wartime German subsidiary, Ford Werke AG. It ran 
Wednesday in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bayer (haggled) over the purchase price of 150 female  
prisoners on whom to test a sleeping medication,'' said an ad on 
the pharmaceutical company that ran in Tuesday's Times. ``Bayer 
found $80 per woman too high a price. They ultimately bought them 
for less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charges are not new, but their presentation in full-page ads  
came as survivors and their attorneys attacked a reported 
compensation offer from 16 German companies as ``a disgrace,'' ``an 
insult'' and ``peanuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney in the negotiations threatened to walk out of the  
talks if industry's offer today is too low. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't step up to the plate and start negotiating ...  
with real money that is representative of their ability to pay, we 
are going to walk away from these meetings,'' said attorney Mel 
Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss said that in months of negotiations, the German companies  
have never given a specific figure of how much they would pay. 
Instead, he said, survivors have relied on newspaper reports and 
rumors for an idea of what might be offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss quoted such a report Tuesday in The Washington Post that  
said compensation of $3.8 billion, or $200 per forced labor 
survivor, is being contemplated. He called that offer a ``paltry 
amount.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reached by phone in Boston, Wolfgang Gibowski, spokesman for the  
German business initiative, said the $3.8 billion figure was wrong 
but would not divulge the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, at the Washington new conference, Weiss also declined  
to say how much survivors are demanding but said it was ``far in 
excess'' of the $20 billion reported elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, leading politicians in Germany pressured German  
businesses to reach an agreement quickly. The German government's 
envoy to the talks, Otto Lambsdorff, pointing to the ad campaign, 
also warned that failure of the talks could damage relations with 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambsdorff said this week that he would be bringing a final  
offer to the table during the talks starting today at the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Reinert, a spokesman at Bayer headquarters in Leverkusen,  
Germany, said Bayer was absorbed during the Nazi era into the IG 
Farben pharmaceutical and chemical conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bayer rejects legal responsibility for whatever may have  
happened under the Nazi dictatorship and at IG Farben,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, Bayer is aware of a humanitarian responsibility and  
therefore is taking part in negotiations aimed at creating a 
foundation for the victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Dearborn, Mich., a Ford spokesman said the company is doing  
research to learn what happened at Ford operations after they were 
placed under government control during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford is part of the global community and is dedicated to  
supporting humanitarian initiatives because it's the right thing to 
do,'' said Jim Vella, Ford global news director.

<HEADLINE> FIFA OKs Out-of-Competition Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUGGE, Belgium (AP) -- FIFA said Wednesday that  
out-of-competition drug tests will start for European soccer teams 
next spring, to be followed by worldwide random testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The credibility of our game is at stake,'' FIFA president Sepp  
Blatter said. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA and UEFA representatives worked out practical details of  
starting the random testing in the month prior to next year's June 
10-July 2 European Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a rule, we should have our first tests on the 16 teams as  
they prepare for Euro 2000,'' FIFA's medical chief, Dr. Michel 
D'Hooghe, said. After that, FIFA drug teams will be able to arrive 
at short notice in any country for such out-of-competition testing. 
He said testing can be done unannounced at training, training camp 
or exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our decision to implement out-of-competition controls on a  
large scale shows that we are determined to close every loophole we 
detect,'' Blatter said. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA had approved the system in principle last year, but found  
it difficult to put into practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brugge meeting also assessed the problems involving the use  
of blood testing, but found it rife with judicial and practical 
implications. ``There is no scientific justification or evidence 
for taking blood samples for doping analysis,'' a FIFA statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal problems also arose. ``Athletes cannot be forced to  
undergo blood tests for doping controls with their informed 
consent,'' the statement said. ``Consequently, no sanctions could 
be imposed if a player tested positive but had not consented to 
have his blood tested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Big question marks remain,'' Blatter said.  
</P>
<P>
	But by approving random out-of-competition tests, FIFA is  
backing one of the International Olympic Committee's main anti-drug 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA, however, remains the biggest force opposing minimum  
two-year sentences for athletes using steroids and other major 
performance-enhancing drugs, a key part of the IOC anti-drug 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer has been largely free of major drug scandals so far, with  
the exception of the 1994 World Cup, when Argentina's Diego 
Maradona was thrown out of the competition for using a cocktail of 
illegal substances. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Hooghe has long called for out-of-competition testing,  
especially after assessing reports on the use of sophisticated 
muscle-building anabolic steroids that leave no trace in the body 
by the time the competition starts. 
</P>
<P>
	At present, random testing is left to local authorities and the  
practice is rare. French players were required to submit to 
unannounced tests before the 1998 World Cup and it created an 
outrage. All tests were negative. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Dec. 12 draw for the Euro 2000 competition, each of the  
16 nations participating in the championships will have to sign up 
to the out-of-competition program.

<HEADLINE> Philly Mayor Race Is Neck-and-Neck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With four weeks remaining until Election  
Day, Republican Sam Katz and Democrat John F. Street are tied in 
the race for Philadelphia mayor, according to a new poll released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz, a businessman, is seeking to become Philadelphia's first  
Republican mayor in half a century, while Street, a former City 
Council president, would be the city's second black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	If the election were held today, Katz would get 39 percent of  
the vote and Street would get 38 percent, according to the Keystone 
Poll conducted by the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at 
Millersville University. More than one in five voters were still 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz has gotten crossover endorsements from former Democratic  
candidates Happy Fernandez and John White Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has seven Democrats for every two Republicans.  
Forty percent of the city's 1.4 million residents are black. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, 37 percent of the respondents identified crime  
and drugs as the most important issue facing the city, followed by 
education at 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 361 registered Democrats, 101 registered  
Republicans, and 58 independents and members of other parties was 
taken Friday through Monday and has an error margin of plus or 
minus 4.3 percentage points. It was conducted for the Philadelphia 
Daily News and Fox News, Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cop Sentenced for Murder in Md. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- A former Baltimore police officer who  
shot his pregnant mistress more than 20 times, then turned the gun 
on her 5-year-old daughter, was given two life sentences without 
parole Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Edward Thompson escaped the death penalty by agreeing to  
plead guilty to both counts of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mentioning Vicky Austin by name, Thompson, 28,  
acknowledged that he ``made a mistake,'' but he said ``that woman'' 
was also to blame because she enraged him by constantly calling his 
home and hanging up, haranguing him to pay child support and 
threatening to expose him to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Austin, an exotic dancer, was eight months pregnant with  
Thompson's child. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson apologized in court Wednesday for killing Ms. Austin's  
daughter, Jessica Morgan. ``I guess she was at the wrong place at 
the wrong time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because I might not show remorse on the outside, it  
doesn't mean I don't have it inside,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's mother said during the sentencing hearing that her  
son was a veteran of the Gulf War, had graduated near the top of 
his class from the Baltimore Police Academy and was named Officer 
of the Month in September 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Austin's mother, Linda Austin of Davie, Fla., also testified  
and told Thompson: ``You have given us a life sentence of pain and 
suffering. May you suffer in hell 'til your dying day.''

<HEADLINE> Davis Finally Shows at Pacers Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Forward Dale Davis, who missed the  
Indiana Pacers' first two practices, reported to training camp 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who averaged 8.0 points and 8.3 rebounds last season, did  
not show up for the team's Media Day Monday or the opening of camp 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis Star quoted sources close to Davis as saying  
his absence was related to his contract, and that he had received 
``bad advice'' from friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has four years remaining on his contract, which calls for  
him to be paid $4.94 million this season, $6.175 million next year, 
$7.01 million the year after that and $8.055 million in its final 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Davis nor his agent, Dan Fegan, could be reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also reportedly was angry that his former agent, Steve  
Kauffman, neglected to file for free agency before a June 25 
deadline. But Kauffman told the newspaper that the matter had been 
settled, and that Davis ``didn't want to opt out'' over it.

<HEADLINE> Expert Says FBI Fired in Waco Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An expert retained by a House committee has  
concluded that videotape of the 1993 Waco standoff shows the FBI 
fired shots on the siege's final day, contrary to the bureau's 
insistence its agents did not fire a single round. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Waco Special Counsel John Danforth has been briefed  
by another expert who reached a similar conclusion that the 
government and Branch Davidians exchanged gunfire that day. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials on Wednesday repeated their position. ``There has  
been no evidence developed to date to indicate that any FBI agents 
fired any rounds during the standoff at Waco,'' said FBI spokesman 
Tron Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations of government gunfire during the 51-day standoff  
have circulated for years. The issue was revived by a report 
Wednesday in The Washington Post in which Carlos Ghigliotti, who 
has been hired by the House Government Reform Committee to review 
siege footage, said he determined the FBI fired shots on April 19, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I conclude this based on the groundview videotapes taken from  
several different angles simultaneously and based on the overhead 
thermal tape,'' Ghigliotti said. ``The gunfire from the ground is 
there, without a doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghigliotti said the tapes also confirm the Davidians fired  
repeatedly at FBI agents during the assault, which ended when 
flames raced through the compound. About 80 Branch Davidians 
perished that day, some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghigliotti, who did not return calls Wednesday from The  
Associated Press, did not assert that any casualties were caused by 
FBI gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
	His review was based on videotapes shot by media crews and audio  
from an infrared aerial surveillance tape recently released by the 
FBI. Ghigliotti has not seen all of the footage compiled by the FBI 
nor done an official analysis for the committee, FBI and 
congressional officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghigliotti, who has performed thermal imaging analysis for the  
FBI, is scheduled to go to the FBI on Friday to review the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee chairman said the findings  
are ``troubling, but we think it is premature to make any final 
determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to go off half-cocked,'' Rep. Dan Burton,  
R-Ind., said. ``As soon as we get all the necessary information, we 
will hold hearings and present the information to the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghigliotti's views coincide with those of a retired Defense  
Department thermal imaging analyst who, in a 1997 documentary about 
Waco, said infrared surveillance footage shot by an FBI plane 
offers definitive proof that government forces unleashed a barrage 
of automatic weapon fire on the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has explained the light bursts on the infrared footage  
as reflections of sun rays on shards of glass or other debris that 
littered the scene, a view shared by some thermal imaging experts 
who reviewed Waco footage for the Post in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Allard, who was a supervisor at the Army's night vision  
lab at Fort Belvoir, Va., has been hired as an expert in the 
Davidian survivors' wrongful-death lawsuit. He said the infrared 
footage reflects ``the government pouring machine-gun fire into the 
building and the Davidians firing here and there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allard was among the plaintiffs' experts who briefed Danforth in  
Houston on Tuesday about their findings. Danforth, a former 
Republican senator from Missouri, was appointed last month by 
Attorney General Janet Reno to re-investigate Waco's unanswered 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	In his briefing for Danforth, Allard said, he explained why he  
discounts FBI and Justice Department claims that the bright bursts 
captured by the ``Nightstalker'' surveillance plane represent solar 
flashes on shards of glass or other debris around the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's impossible for the Waco (forward-looking infrared) to  
detect solar radiation because the equipment they used is simply 
not sensitive enough to detect it,'' Allard said.

<P>
	Nitrous oxide is emitted from large industrial plants. The  
subcommittee voted 10-0 to issue the subpoena for the document, 
which is related to the United Nations Economic Commission for 
Europe's Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	The document ``is necessary for the committee to confirm that  
the Environmental Protection Agency has sufficient legal authority 
for implementation of the convention,'' Upton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department -- responding to oral and written requests -- has  
only given the subcommittee a version of the document that has 
certain sections blacked out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The State Department's basis for withholding the document is  
that the (document) contains `sensitive discussions of an internal, 
deliberative nature and also contains information pertinent to our 
ongoing discussions with Canada on amendments to the U.S.-Canadian 
air quality agreement,''' Upton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee is sensitive to those negotiations, he said,  
but the State Department has not asserted any legal basis for 
keeping the full document from subcommittee members.

<HEADLINE> Boss Ross Faces Chargers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- It used to be Bobby &AMP; Bobby during the San  
Diego Chargers' heyday earlier this decade. Now it's Bobby vs. 
Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
	More specifically, Bobby Beathard's football team against Bobby  
Ross' team, the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday at the Silverdome, Ross will face the Chargers for the  
first time since he was forced out as coach nearly three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's another game. It really is,'' Ross said Wednesday  
in a conference call with San Diego reporters. ``People will try to 
read things into that and that sort of thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course they will, and for a pretty good reason. Ross was a  
fan favorite long before he coached the Chargers to their lone 
Super Bowl. And things haven't exactly been the same since he and 
general manager Beathard had their ugly divorce 12 days after the 
1996 season ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously there are some people on that other side of the  
field that I respect an awful lot,'' Ross said. ``After the 
ballgame, if they chose to do so, I'll certainly be very happy to 
say hello to them and see how them and their families are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross might have a warmer conversation with some of his former  
players than with his former bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great rapport, Bobby Ross and I, a mutual respect,''  
said All Pro linebacker/part-time tight end Junior Seau, one of 
just 15 Chargers players left from Ross' tenure ``What he has done 
for me and my career is never going to be forgotten. Obviously, he 
gave me a trip to the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seau said it's going to be weird to see Ross on the other  
sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be that we'd be fighting for that one goal and now  
we're fighting each other. I'll have to do a double-take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``Obviously, I know I can give you a feel of what  
he's going to go over this week. He'll probably have my picture on 
a dart board. He's definitely going to come after me. That's a 
given.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will Ross also have Beathard's picture on the same dart board?  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no comment on that,'' Seau said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers never had a losing season under Ross, who was 50-36  
in five years, including two AFC West titles and three playoff 
appearances overall. Since he left, the Chargers are 11-24 and have 
finished last in the division twice. Mike Riley is their third head 
coach in that span. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the overall demise of the Chargers, this isn't one of  
Beathard's favorite topics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything I said would probably be taken the wrong way by  
somebody,'' Beathard said. ``So I just won't say anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tension between Ross and Beathard began sometime after the  
Super Bowl loss to San Francisco in January 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	They disagreed over drafts, the way some players were used -- or  
not used -- and, ultimately, over Beathard's insistence that Ross 
fire his coordinators, Ralph Friedgen and Dave Adolph. Having been 
a military man, loyalty was important to Ross. He wouldn't budge, 
and on Jan. 3, 1997, he and his whole staff were gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The official announcement was that Ross resigned. His flashes of  
anger during his farewell news conference suggested he had help 
making the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, there were a lot of circumstances that dictated  
what happened,'' club president Dean Spanos said Wednesday. ``It 
was unfortunate. I think everyone would have liked to see the 
situation resolved. We had two people who agreed on what the final 
outcome would be, but not how to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spanos tried to referee the dispute.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just really believed that these two people were not able to  
see eye-to-eye and it wasn't going to work out,'' said Spanos, who 
ended up backing Beathard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross, who has final say over personnel matters in Detroit, said  
he's over any bitterness from his San Diego exit. 
</P>
<P>
	He just wishes he could have told the players goodbye.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked to have been able to look them in the eye  
and said something,'' Ross said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Puts Uninsured in Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opening debate over patient protections in the  
era of managed care, House Republicans are aiming to put the 
uninsured front and center, pushing a package of tax breaks that 
has little to do with HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The central debate, now in its second year on Capitol Hill, is  
how to give frustrated patients new rights in dealing with health 
maintenance organizations and other managed care plans, which often 
impose restrictions in order to control costs and eliminate 
unnecessary care. A broad bill backed by Democrats appeared to have 
enough GOP support to pass over the objections of Republican 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats complained today that the rules proposed to govern  
the HMO debate endanger their bill. The legislation, while quite 
popular, is expected to cost several billion dollars over several 
years, and the proposed rules do not allow for amendments to pay 
the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., predicted today that this  
would cost a ``sizeable number'' of Democratic votes and put the 
entire legislation in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House sent the same message. ``The rule is loaded up  
with land mines and booby traps that are designed to make sure we 
never get a patients bill of rights,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said 
today. President Clinton planned to address the issue himself later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt also sought to inject a little presidential politics  
into the debate. He released a letter to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
the GOP front-runner, asking that he urge congressional Republicans 
to support the Democratic bill, which is similar to a Texas HMO 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you can educate your leadership on the importance of  
enacting meaningful reforms,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	By beginning debate with the tax bill, GOP leaders hope to shift  
attention to those without any insurance at all. They argue that 
the Democratic approach would increase costs and prompt businesses 
to drop coverage, leaving more Americans uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the severe poor who don't have health care. There are  
government programs that reach out (to them),'' House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Tuesday, sounding the GOP's central 
theme. ``It's working people today, who are working for small 
businesses or who run their own shop or they go from job to job, 
who need the ability to get health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders planned to bring the tax bill to the floor for  
debate first, with a vote expected today. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill includes popular tax breaks for people buying health  
coverage on their own and for long-term care insurance. But it also 
includes a provision opposed by many Democrats that would allow 
more medical savings accounts, which let people opt out of the 
current health insurance market and buy high-risk plans on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would give small businesses the option to  
buy health insurance under federal rather than state regulation -- 
exempting them from state mandates that bigger self-insured 
companies now avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	After that vote, the House was to move to the HMO issue,  
beginning with a bill backed by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and 
Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., and supported by the White House. With 
backing from some 20 Republicans, ultimately, it is expected to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill would give patients a host of new rights in dealing  
with their health insurance companies. It would make it easier to 
go to an emergency room or see a specialist and would give patients 
the chance to take their complaints to independent panels. Most 
controversially, it would give patients who are still not satisfied 
the right to sue an HMO in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Three alternative GOP bills will be offered, but none appeared  
to have enough support to pass. The leading alternative, crafted by 
Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John Shadegg, R-Ariz., gives 
patients the right to sue, but only in federal courts -- where 
damage awards are typically smaller -- and only under limited 
circumstances. Hastert and other Republican leaders planned to back 
this legislation, reasoning it was preferable to the 
Dingell-Norwood version, but they were not actively encouraging 
other Republicans to do the same, Hastert said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have a choice and now the House will work its will,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even if the broader bill passes the House, it must be  
reconciled with a much more limited version already approved by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	With polls showing strong support for HMO restrictions,  
Democrats were positioning themselves as protectors of the patient 
and the doctor, out only for the best care. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republicans were hammering the issue of the  
uninsured. They came armed with a new report this week that the 
number of uninsured Americans rose to 44.3 million last year, 
meaning one in six people were without coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobbyists on all sides of the issue also have been gearing up  
for this week's debate, running a series of TV and radio 
commercials. And their influence was dramatized Tuesday as Hastert 
attended a fund-raising breakfast with about 15 health care 
lobbyists who paid $1,000 apiece to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton quickly jumped on the issue. ``I'd like to ask them  
about sitting down with America's families instead,'' he said 
Tuesday at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert defended the previously scheduled meeting and tried  
to turn the tables. ``Mr. President, I hope you will say no to 
helping trial lawyers,'' he said in a statement, ``and say yes to 
helping the 44 million Americans who want health-care coverage.''

<HEADLINE> Indians 3, Red Sox 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Indians' Game 1 postseason jinx ended as  
soon as Pedro Martinez left the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Fryman's RBI single with one-out in the bottom of the  
ninth inning gave Cleveland a 3-2 win over the Boston Red Sox, who 
may have lost their ace Martinez for the remainder of the AL 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians had lost eight straight series opening games, dating  
back to the division series against Boston in 1995 before Fryman's 
clutch bases-loaded base hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, baseball's most dominant pitcher this season, pulled a  
back muscle and had to leave the game after the fourth inning. He 
is listed as day-to-day and Boston manager Jimy Williams said the 
right-hander would be re-examined by doctors on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a break with Pedro getting hurt,'' said Fryman, who  
spent most of the season on the disabled list with a serious knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you face Pedro, he's tough. He's the best pitcher I  
ever faced. You look up there in the sixth inning and you don't see 
him out there, it gives you a little pick-me-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox, who had counted on Martinez giving them the lead in  
the series, will turn to Bret Saberhagen in Game 2 Thursday against 
Cleveland's Charles Nagy. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians starter Bartolo Colon struck out a season-high 11 in  
eight innings, and Paul Shuey picked up the win with a perfect 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Thome hit a game-tying two-run homer off Derek Lowe in the  
sixth for the Indians, who also got spectacular defensive plays 
from David Justice, Roberto Alomar and Omar Vizquel. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomar Garciaparra homered for the Red Sox, who despite  
dominating the regular-season series against Cleveland have now 
lost four straight playoff games to the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, who replaced Martinez in fifth, got the loss. He hit Manny  
Ramirez in the back with a 2-2 pitch to open the ninth, and Rheal 
Cormier relieved. One out later, pinch-hitter Wil Cordero singled 
to right in his first career postseason at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sexson, who had 116 RBIs this season, pinch-hit for David  
Justice and was walked on four pitches by Garces. Fryman, who was 
on the DL twice this year with a torn ligament in his right knee, 
then slapped a 1-2 pitch to left for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman, who could hardly walk a month ago, was mobbed by his  
teammates as he rounded first. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was one of the things that I used as motivation,'' Fryman  
said of his rehabilitation from the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Stanley had three of Boston's five hits and Garciaparra had  
the other two. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, 5-0 in his career against Indians, including a win in  
Game 1 of the '98 division series, had little trouble with 
Cleveland's lineup in the first four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed three hits and twice retired Ramirez, the majors' RBI  
leader, to end an inning with a runner in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth, he retired Justice on a grounder to the right  
side, covering first on the play for the putout. He appeared to be 
OK as he left the field, but when Boston manager Jimy Williams 
called Boston's bullpen to get Lowe throwing, it was obvious 
Martinez was coming out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were excited,'' Thome said. ``Pedro was pitching a real  
good game. ``To get him out of the game like that, it livened us 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as tough as Martinez had been on the Indians this year, Lowe  
was just as nasty. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland was just 1-for-30 against the right-hander with  
Roberto Alomar's single in an April 24 giving the Indians their 
only baserunner. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe coasted through the fifth and got two outs in the sixth  
before Ramirez hit a grounder to third that John Valentin fielded 
cleanly. However, his throw was in the dirt, and Ramirez was safe, 
ending a streak of 31 straight Indians retired by Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome wasted no time, crushing Lowe's next pitch 434 feet to tie  
it 2-2, and giving the Indians their first momentum of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	In the seventh, Justice caught Troy O'Leary's drive against the  
wall in left and quickly got the ball back into the infield as the 
Indians doubled up Garciaparra who was halfway to third when the 
ball was caught. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra said Tuesday he wasn't fully recovered from being  
struck on the right wrist with a pitch against Baltimore late last 
month. But he looked fine on his first swing of the series, hitting 
a 2-1 pitch from Colon over the wall in center. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Garciaparra's sixth homer this season against the  
Indians, who planned to pitch around him when possible. 
Garciaparrra, who led the AL with a .357 average, was even tougher 
on Cleveland, batting .451 with nine extra-base hits and 17 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra led off the fourth with a double, and one out later  
scored on Mike Stanley's single to left. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Thome's homer was his 13th in the postseason, tying him  
with Ramirez for fourth on the career list. Only Reggie Jackson 
(18), Mickey Mantle (18) and Babe Ruth (15) have more. ... 
Garciaparra went 5-for-15 with three homers and 11 RBIs against 
Cleveland in the '98 division series. ... Hargrove said Jaret 
Wright would pitch out of the bullpen in Game 2 if necessary. 
Wright, who started the series opener last year, could start Game 
4. ... The Indians are 12-22 in the regular season against Boston 
since 1997 after going 11-1 in '96. ... Nagy, who pitched eight 
innings of four-hit ball to win Game 3 in Boston last year, is 7-1 
in his career against Boston. ... Boston has lost 17 of 18 playoff 
games since taking a 3-2 lead in the 1986 World Series against the 
New York Mets.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Bomb Suspect Taunted Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- After taunting investigators and savoring his  
role as a suspect, a former crime lab technician was arrested in a 
series of bombings that spread fear in the Northern California city 
of Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodney Blach, 53, faces 11 charges, including attempted murder  
using a destructive device. 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not say what led them to suspect Blach or what  
motivated the four bombings and two attempted bombings that 
occurred over a three-day period last year in Fremont, 30 miles 
south of San Francisco. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 18-month investigation, authorities searched Blach's  
homes three times before his arrest and took a handwriting sample. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it. I am animated. I am alive,'' he told The Argus, a  
Fremont newspaper, back in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Blach, who was a chemical engineer with the Chicago Police  
Department crime lab from 1974 to 1979, said he planted keys in his 
San Diego home and taped notes with clues beneath his desk and a 
shaving cream can to see if investigators could find them. 
</P>
<P>
	Blach lived in the Fremont neighborhood where the bombings  
occurred. He moved to San Diego last year after he became a 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	One bomb ripped a 10-foot hole in the roof of Police Chief Craig  
Steckler's home and set the front porch on fire. The same 
afternoon, Steckler's predecessor found an explosive in a brown 
paper bag on his front walk. Authorities defused that bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Two pipe bombs also damaged newly constructed homes and another  
explosive went off at a water tank. Police detonated the sixth 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they found no explosives Tuesday while  
searching Blach's home. 
</P>
<P>
	In the May interview with The Argus, Blach's wife, Penny  
Coppernoll-Blach, said he seemed to thrive on being the focus of 
the investigation. She said her husband told her Fremont police 
were trying to frame him because of his efforts to expose 
corruption and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her husband has not worked since 1979 when he left his  
police lab job to become a ``citizen investigator.''

<HEADLINE> Braves 5, Astros 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Kevin Millwood is no longer an afterthought to  
Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz. After Wednesday, he 
deserves to be mentioned right along with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching one of the greatest postseason games in baseball  
history, Millwood threw a one-hitter -- facing only two batters 
above the minimum -- to give the Atlanta Braves a critical 5-1 
victory over the Houston Astros, evening the first-round series at 
one game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, pitching in the postseason for the first time, allowed  
a second-inning homer to Ken Caminiti but that was all. It was the 
first complete-game one-hitter in the postseason in 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed a big win today,'' the 24-year-old Millwood said.  
``It was probably the biggest game I have pitched in my career, so 
I would have to say it was my best performance ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No kidding.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was working,'' he said. ``My fastball was good. My  
curveball was good. My slider was good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, 18-7 during the regular season, didn't pitch at all  
the last two postseasons while the Braves were knocked out in the 
NL championship series -- even though he won 17 games in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves couldn't pass him by this year. Millwood stepped up  
to become the Braves most consistent starter while Maddux, Glavine 
and Smoltz -- with seven Cy Youngs among them -- went through 
assorted struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I slept pretty good last night,'' Millwood said. ``I thought  
it was going to be kind of tough to get to sleep, but I think some 
of the nervous energy I worked up during the day kind of wore me 
out. I slept good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And pitched even better, throwing the first complete game  
one-hitter in the postseason since Game 2 of the 1967 World Series. 
Boston's Jim Lonborg beat the St. Louis Cardinals 5-0, allowing a 
double to Julian Javier with two outs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Glavine and Mark Wohlers combined on a one-hitter for the  
Braves against Cleveland in Game 6 of the 1995 World Series. The 
were two other combined one-hitters in LCS play. 
</P>
<P>
	``A stronger game has not been pitched against us all year  
long,'' Houston manager Larry Dierker said. ``We really only hit 
two balls hard the whole game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Braves desperate for a victory after losing the first  
game 6-1 Tuesday, Millwood retired 15 batters in a row after 
Caminiti's homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The streak was broken when third baseman Chipper Jones booted a  
grounder with one out in the seventh, but the error didn't bother 
his pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood got the next two batters on grounders. The Braves broke  
open a 2-1 game with three runs in the bottom half on Brian 
Jordan's sacrifice fly and run-scoring singles by Ryan Klesko and 
Andruw Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-5 series shifts to the Astrodome, where the next two  
games will be played Friday and Saturday. If a fifth game is 
needed, it would be at Turner Field on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us confidence going into Houston,'' Jordan said. ``I  
mean, momentum has switched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan and Klesko flip-flopped in the batting order, a move that  
paid off with two RBIs from Jordan, hitting fourth instead of 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko, dropped from the cleanup spot, had three hits, scored  
twice and drove in a run. 
</P>
<P>
	But everyone was overshadowed by Millwood, who flirted with a  
no-hitter several times during the regular season, allowing only 
two hits in four separate starts. 
</P>
<P>
	He went at least six innings in every start after June 28.  
Overall, Millwood finished second in the NL to Arizona's Randy 
Johnson with a 2.68 ERA and led the majors by allowing a .202 
average to hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a dominant pitcher,'' Jordan said. ``We needed a big  
game from our pitcher and he came up with a big game for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves got to Houston starter Jose Lima in the first inning,  
with Gerald Williams scoring on Jordan's two-out, broken-bat 
single. Lima might have been flustered by a visit from third-base 
umpire Bruce Froemming before the very first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Froemming noticed a stain on the right hip of Lima's uniform and  
walked over to check it out. The umpire appeared to touch the spot 
with a finger before allowing Lima to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have been checking the side of my pants all year,'' said  
Lima, who said the stain was simply dirt. ``I don't have to cheat 
to win ball games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lima, 21-10 during the regular season but 0-2 against the  
Braves, went 6 2-3 innings, allowing four runs and nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti, who hit a three-run homer in the ninth inning Tuesday  
to seal Houston's victory, burned the Braves again in the second 
inning. On a 1-2 pitch, Millwood tried to sneak a fastball over the 
inside corner, and it wound up in the right-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be his only mistake.  
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Perez's sacrifice fly in the sixth broke a 1-1 tie. Andruw  
Jones had the key hit in the inning, a double that broke his 
0-for-20 slump in division series play. It was Atlanta's first 
extra-base hit of this series. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The crowd of 41,913 was larger than Game 1, but still the  
second-smallest in Atlanta postseason history. ... The Braves broke 
a four-game home losing streak in the playoffs. ... Only once in 
the 1990s have the Braves won a postseason series after losing the 
first game -- in 1991, Atlanta defeated Pittsburgh 4-3 in the NL 
championship series after losing Game 1. Since then, the Braves are 
0-4 when they've lost the opener. ... Bill Spiers did not start for 
Houston after going 2-for-4 in Game 1. Stan Javier took his place 
in right field and went 0-for-4. ... Millwood said he has pitched 
only one other postseason game in his career, pitching eight 
shutout innings for Class-A Durham in 1996.

<HEADLINE> French Tobacco Companies To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- France's Seita is merging with Spain's Tabacalera  
tobacco company in a $3.3 billion deal that would create a powerful 
new tobacco group and the leading manufacturer of cigars worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Seita and Tabacalera hope the new company, to be called  
Altadis, will be better able to compete with international tobacco 
conglomerates, Seita said Tuesday in announcing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is the latest in a wave of European consolidation  
that has touched the banking, oil, and pharmaceutical industries, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would rank fourth in the world among tobacco  
companies behind Philip Morris Cos., British American Tobacco PLC 
and Japan Tobacco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabacalera was offering 19 shares for 6 Seita shares, and Seita  
shareholders will also receive an exceptional dividend of $4.71 per 
share once the deal goes through. 
</P>
<P>
	Seita and Tabacalera will each have a 50 percent stake in the  
merged firm, as neither government was willing to cede control to a 
foreign partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the combined company will be listed on the Madrid and  
Paris stock markets. The headquarters of the new group will be in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they had decided to merge because of their  
common interests and cultures, and because of the strength of the 
French and Spanish tobacco markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Altadis will have a market share of 47.5 percent in Spain and  
34.8 percent in France, based on 1998 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company would be the world's largest manufacturer of cigars,  
producing 3 billion units per year, with a world market share of 
24.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies said the merger should be in place by the end  
of December. The merger will be referred to competition authorities 
in both the European Union and the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	Seita and Tabacalera had confirmed on Monday that they were in  
the advanced stages of merger talks, and shares of both companies 
rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Seita has been seeking foreign linkups since it was privatized  
in 1995. The French government still has a minority stake. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger talks follow a March agreement that Seita and  
Tabacalera signed to share marketing and distribution channels in 
Europe. The two companies also had joined forces in an unsuccessful 
bid for the international tobacco business of RJR Nabisco Holdings, 
which ultimately sold the business to Japan Tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the only regulatory problems facing Tabacalera and  
Seita would be from antitrust authorities in the United States. The 
group's combined cigar business would dominate a fragmented market 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The new group will have a presence in 20 countries.  
</P>
<P>
	Seita and Tabacalera said their joint cigarette division will  
now concentrate on increasing sales in European markets, largely by 
developing existing brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Cesar Alierta Izuel, current chairman of Tabacalera, and Seita  
chairman Jean-Dominique Comolli will be named co-chairmen of the 
newly-merged group. Comolli will be responsible for the cigarette 
division while Alierta will take charge of cigars and distribution.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chides Hastert Fundraiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One day before a closely watched vote on  
health care, House Speaker Dennis Hastert attended a fund-raising 
breakfast Tuesday with industry representatives who gave $1,000 
apiece to his political war chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to ask them about sitting down with America's  
families instead,'' President Clinton chided from the White House 
as he sought to build support for legislation granting patients the 
right to sue their health insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, who opposes the bill, defended his previously scheduled  
meeting and sought to turn the tables on the White House. ``Mr. 
President, I hope you will say no to helping trial lawyers, and say 
yes to helping the 44 million Americans who want health-care 
coverage,'' the Illinois Republican said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	One lobbyist who attended the fund-raiser said Hastert made no  
effort to rally the group to support or defeat any particular HMO 
bill. The lobbyist, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 
discussion about the HMO bill was less about substance than it was 
about what specifically would come to the floor and in what 
sequence. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the cross-town exchange between Clinton and Hastert  
underscored the wide philosophical and political gulf between the 
two parties on health care at a time when government statistics 
show the number of uninsured continues to increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House, most Democrats and some Republicans are  
supporting legislation to strengthen patients' hands in dealing 
with their managed care companies. Among prerogatives would be the 
ability to sue for damages when prescribed care was denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans counter that such provisions will merely raise the  
cost of insurance and prompt some employers who now offer insurance 
to their workers to drop it. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a likely setback on that measure, the GOP leadership is  
proposing a companion bill that provides numerous tax breaks to 
make health insurance more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
	Their ``access'' bill also includes a provision opposed by many  
Democrats to expand a current small program allowing medical 
savings accounts. Another would give small businesses the option to 
buy health insurance under federal rather than state regulation. 
That would exempt them from state mandates that bigger self-insured 
companies avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the severe poor who don't have health care,'' Hastert  
told reporters. ``There are government programs that reach out. 
It's working people today, who are working for small businesses or 
who run their own shop or they go from job to job, who need the 
ability to get health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert pledged a ``fair and open debate of the health-care  
issue'' Wednesday when the legislation reaches the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate will come against a backdrop of a fresh government  
report that estimates 44.3 million Americans, one in six, had no 
health insurance coverage in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau survey found the number without coverage grew  
by nearly a million, but overall population growth kept the rate 
about steady -- 16.3 percent in 1998, compared with 16.1 percent in 
1997. In 1996, 15.6 percent lacked coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polls show the issue is high on the public's list  
of priorities, and GOP leaders have struggled for months in a 
narrowly divided House to keep control of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert held the fund-raising breakfast for his political action  
committee a few blocks from the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said it was scheduled several weeks ago. There was no word  
on whether there was consideration of rescheduling the event given 
the close proximity to the House's debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've listened to everybody in the health-care business for a  
long time,'' the speaker told reporters in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	``The die is cast already on what the health legislation is  
going to be. So there's no influence there whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An invitation to the event was issued in the name of officials  
of Cigna, Blue Cross-Blue Shield and Aetna. 
</P>
<P>
	John Feehery, Hastert's spokesman, noted that the insurance  
industry opposes some of the provisions contained in the GOP 
measure designed to increase access to insurance. ``They don't like 
the competition,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Woman To Be Minister at Age 81 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLINGBORO, N.J. (AP) -- Louisa Groce has spent her entire life  
in the church. 
</P>
<P>
	She began teaching Sunday school when she was just 12 years old,  
sang in the choir and even considered becoming a nun. Over the 
years, she has served on the church council and even run her own 
parish as a lay minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, at age 81, Groce is embarking on a new spiritual mission.  
She has answered a call to become the first octogenarian and oldest 
person ever ordained by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It says to me that God had a plan all along,'' Groce said. ``I  
wasn't aware of the plan, but God had it. I'm a living witness to 
the power of God if you will let him lead you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her journey into the history books of the 5.2 million-member  
Lutheran denomination began as a child in west Philadelphia, where 
she attended a predominantly black Missouri Synod Lutheran church. 
</P>
<P>
	As a young woman, she wanted to become a nun, but was prohibited  
because she did not attend a parochial school. Back then, she 
believed it would be difficult for her to become a pastor in the 
conservative Missouri Synod as a black and a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Six decades later, Groce refuses to view her age as another  
obstacle to church service. Concerned about being stereotyped, she 
never disclosed it until recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``The minute you begin to think you're going downhill you do,''  
Groce said during a recent interview at her home. ``I don't have 
any limitations right now. For what I want to do now I'm just 
starting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Groce graduated from the Lutheran Theological Seminary in  
Philadelphia in May and took her final step toward ordination on 
July 11. That day she delivered a call sermon to a northern New 
Jersey congregation that immediately elected her as its pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	Once accepted by the congregation, Groce began a ministry at  
Redeemer Lutheran Church in Jersey City at an age when most pastors 
have long since retired. Philip Krey, dean of the seminary, 
mentioned Groce's unique calling in a Lenten sermon, noting that 
``she is older than Abraham (was) when he left for the promised 
land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unusual for anyone of retirement age to have become  
ordained in our church,'' said Mark Staples, a spokesman for the 
Lutheran seminary. 
</P>
<P>
	Groce expects parishioners to have concerns about her health and  
how many years she will be able to serve. Asked how long she will 
pastor, she replied unhesitatingly, ``As long as God gives me 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A petite woman, Groce is full of energy and maintains an active  
lifestyle. She exercises regularly and does not smoke, drink 
alcohol or take medication -- not even an aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not feeling old,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	Groce is accustomed to tackling challenges. A single mother, she  
taught school in Philadelphia for 30 years and raised five 
daughters, working a second job at night to send them all to 
college. She instructed juvenile delinquents and special education 
teachers in Antioch College's Philadelphia program for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	She finds solace at times of trouble in her favorite hymn,  
``Lead Me, Guide Me,'' and in scripture, Psalm 46: ``God is our 
refuge and strength ... '' 
</P>
<P>
	When she retired, Groce devoted her energies to the church. She  
was active in the Camden Lutheran parish as a lay associate and 
then became a lay minister at Emmanuel Lutheran Church in south 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	She eventually enrolled in the Philadelphia seminary -- not to  
become a pastor -- but simply to learn more about the Bible. She was 
stunned when Bishop Roy Riley of the New Jersey Synod invited her 
in 1996 to consider ordination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called him and I said, `Do you know how old I am?'''  
recalled Groce. 
</P>
<P>
	She underwent a stringent review by a candidacy committee before  
being certified for the seminary. She was placed on an alternative 
study track because of her credentials and extensive background in 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is most noticeable about Louisa is not her age -- it is  
her faithfulness and her willingness to follow her Lord into 
discipleship,'' Riley said. ``She is just a remarkable person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Groce is the second Lutheran pastor in her family. Her younger  
brother is a retired pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be awesome,'' Groce said, her eyes welling with tears.  
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, she has modestly downplayed her accomplishments,  
saying, ``I don't really see the big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``None of this is my doing. It's all due to the glory of God.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in  
trading Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures surged late in the trading session as a rally in  
soyoil futures gave strength to the overall market. The rise was 
limited by the good weather in the U.S. soybean crop growing 
region, a boon for harvest activity. The mild conditions are 
expected to continue into the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices finished fractionally higher in quiet  
trading, with many traders staying on the sidelines as they await 
the U.S. Agriculture Department's crop production and supply and 
demand reports to be released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn prices received a lift from light farmer selling. Gains  
were limited by the brisk pace of the corn harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices ended on a mixed note after falling in  
early trading. Losses were limited by commercial buying and the 
strength of the soybean market. Wheat futures continue to suffer 
from huge wheat stocks and poor export business. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was a 1/4 cent lower at $2.64 1/4 a  
bushel; December corn was 1 1/4 cents higher at $2.04 3/4 a bushel; 
December oats were 1 3/4 cents higher at $1.11 3/4 a bushel; November 
soybeans were 5 1/2 cents higher at $4.89 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and hog futures were lower and pork belly futures were  
higher in trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was led lower by live cattle futures, which were hurt  
by reports Russia is not interested in buying beef because of high 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle were .55 cent lower at 69.20 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle were .53 cent lower at 82.37 cents a pound; 
December live hogs were .72 cent lower at 44.70 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were .37 cent higher at 61.22 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Deal Makes Gordon Team Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, N.C. (AP) -- Jeff Gordon signed a contract Wednesday  
to stay with Hendrick Motorsports for the rest of his Winston Cup 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal also gives him an equal share of the ownership of his  
car with team founder Rick Hendrick and a more active management 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always had hoped Jeff would race for me forever,'' Hendrick  
said at a news conference at the team's complex in suburban 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrick said the contract, which takes effect Jan. 1, had been  
discussed for several months. The agreement came less than a week 
after Ray Evernham, Gordon's crew chief and mentor, left Hendrick 
Motorsports. He was released from a contract that extended through 
2006. 
</P>
<P>
	Since joining Hendrick, the 28-year-old Gordon has won 48 races  
and three of the past four Winston Cup championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an unbelievable day for me,'' he said. ``I'm so  
excited about this, and I've been excited about this. I feel like 
I've been a partner since I started racing here at the end of 1992. 
I guess today it's just on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I have a great deal more to offer this team than just  
driving the car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Jeff Gordon Inc., a company owned by  
Gordon, will continue to manage the licensing activities of his No. 
24 car and will negotiate future sponsor relationships for the 
team. Financial terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon debuted in the Winston Cup series in the last event of  
the 1992 season and has started 217 races. His first victory came 
in the 1994 Coca-Cola 600. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrick Motorsports also fields the No. 5 and No. 25 Winton Cup  
teams and a Craftsman Truck Series team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This in no way affects our commitment to any of our teams,''  
Hendrick said of the agreement with Gordon. ``In fact, I think it 
will pull our operations closer together.''

<HEADLINE> Student Body President Is Felon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Some University of Missouri-St. Louis students  
want a new student president after finding out the man they elected 
last spring is a convicted felon. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day students voted him their leader, Darwin Butler,  
35, entered guilty pleas to two felonies. He admitted to stealing a 
credit card and using it to try to purchase a computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	He was allowed to stay in school under a work-release agreement.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was none of their business,'' Butler said in an interview  
Tuesday night with KDNL-TV. ``And you never know, there's 12,000 
students at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, now I can't be 
the only one who done something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students are calling for Butler to resign. The university's  
student court is also considering bringing impeachment proceedings 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disgraced he's representing me that way,'' student Greg  
Althardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all students are lining up against Butler.  
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in the past, happened in the past,'' Lashaundia  
Lewis said. ``Everybody makes mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butler said he planned to fight impeachment proceedings and  
would even seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Criminals run this country, criminals always,'' he said.  
``When those three boats came over, one of the boats had criminals 
on it.''

<HEADLINE> Eagles' Reid Aware of Team's Flaws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Eagles coach Andy Reid broke a  
cardinal rule of coaching Wednesday: Never admit you read the 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	As pressure mounts from his team's 0-4 start, Reid went out of  
his way to say that he's not trying to hide just how bad the Eagles 
are. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure that this is understood,'' Reid said  
during a briefing with reporters. ``I've been very honest with you 
as far as we are not playing good football. I am not satisfied a 
bit about the way we are playing football at this point. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I give the negatives out, it's also my obligation as a  
football coach to give out the positives that I can find. Please 
don't misconstrue that as covering things up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid was evidently responding to a newspaper column in which he  
was accused of trying to sugarcoat the Eagles' struggles. On 
Monday, Reid said several times that the offense was improving, and 
that he'd measure progress ``when we score a touchdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles haven't scored an offensive touchdown in 15 quarters  
and are 30th out of 31 teams in the NFL's offensive rankings. Only 
the Cleveland Browns, who had to start from scratch and build 
through expansion last year, are worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm being as honest as I possibly can with you, as I am with  
the team,'' Reid said. ``I'm obviously harsher on the team than I 
am at a press conference. But, the mere fact that we are not 
playing good football, please understand that it is being 
addressed. That is not being overlooked. Understand that I am not 
happy a bit about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, Reid repeated a phrase that irked some reporters  
and fans when he uttered it on Monday a day after the Eagles' 16-15 
loss to the New York Giants. He mentioned a couple of bright spots 
from the loss and said, ``It's a stretch, I know. I'm stretching.''

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A.L. ``Doodle'' Owens, who wrote dozens  
of country music hits for stars like Charley Pride, George Jones 
and Moe Bandy, died Monday from a heart attack. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens' hits include ``Wine Colored Roses'' for Jones, ``Johnny  
One Time'' for Brenda Lee and ``Hank and Lefty Raised My Country 
Soul'' for Stoney Edwards. Owens got the nickname ``Doodle'' as a 
child because he crawled backwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, a native of Waco, Texas, moved to Nashville in 1965,  
after being encouraged by singer Ray Price. With Frazier, he 
co-wrote two No. 1 hits for Pride in 1969, ``(I'm So) Afraid of 
Losing You Again'' and ``All I Have to Offer You (Is Me).''

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Retired state Supreme Court Justice Frank  
K. Richardson, a conservative dissenting voice on the liberal court 
of the 1970s and early 1980s, died Tuesday at age 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was appointed to the court in 1974 by Gov. Ronald  
Reagan, who had named him to a state appellate court in Sacramento 
three years earlier. He retired in 1983 and spent the next two 
years as chief lawyer for the U.S. Interior Department, then headed 
by William Clark, a former state Supreme Court colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Clark, also a Reagan appointee, regularly dissented from  
rulings by the court under Chief Justices Donald Wright and Rose 
Bird that increased protections for criminal defendants, expanded 
consumer rights and strengthened environmental restrictions against 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote the majority rulings that upheld Proposition 13, the  
1978 tax-cut initiative, and Proposition 8, a prosecution-sponsored 
1982 initiative that restricted some criminal defenses.

	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Amalia Rodrigues, the Portuguese singer  
whose passionate performances of the country's brooding 'fado' 
music took her from Lisbon taverns to worldwide fame, died 
Wednesday at her home. She was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodrigues' personal secretary, Leonel Henriques, told the news  
agency Lusa that she was found dead in her bed, adding she had felt 
unwell in previous days. The singer had suffered two heart attacks, 
in 1979 and 1980, and increasing health problems caused her to 
retreat from public life in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Antonio Guterres announced three days of national  
mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	Amalia da Piedade Rebordao Rodrigues, known popularly as Amalia,  
became known at home as the ``Ambassador of Fado'' for taking 
Portugal's sad and haunting traditional music out of Lisbon taverns 
and placing it on a world stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Her interpretations of 'fado' -- which means ``fate'' or  
``destiny'' -- gave the world a glimpse into the depths of the 
Portuguese character. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fado'' lyrics are sentimental and melancholic, centering on  
longing, sadness and fatalism, while the guitar accompaniment 
combines the influences of Arab, African and Portuguese cultures.

	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Dr. Sydney E. Salmon, a nationally  
recognized cancer scientist, clinician and founding director of the 
Arizona Cancer Center, died Wednesday of complications from 
pancreatic cancer. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	He was considered one of the most nation's most influential  
cancer researchers, whom his successor, Dr. Daniel Von Hoff, called 
``a remarkable cancer visionary and great leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon made a number of early influential findings, including  
the first reproducible human tumor cloning and the use of 
chemotherapy following tumor removal, said Dr. David Alberts, 
associate dean for research at the cancer center and a protege of 
Salmon's. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, he was named to the National Cancer Advisory Board.

<HEADLINE> FCC OKs Ameritech-SBC Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ameritech Corp. and SBC Communications cleared  
the final hurdle Wednesday in their bid to reunite two offspring 
from the old Bell system into the nation's largest local phone 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission gave its approval to the  
$74 billion deal, subject to conditions requiring that the 
companies open their markets to rivals and enter new markets to 
compete with established local phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the final step for the merger, which earlier won  
approval from the Justice Department and state regulators. The 
combined business, which will keep the SBC name, would control 57 
million, or one-third, of the nation's local phone lines spread 
across 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the most momentous merger we have ever approved,'' the  
FCC's chairman, Bill Kennard, said in an interview. ``These 
companies are tearing down the Berlin Wall of local monopoly to 
liberate their competitors and also liberate themselves to enter 
other markets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC adopted 30 conditions to ensure the deal would serve the  
public interest. The new SBC must enter 30 new markets within 30 
months to compete with established local phone companies. The 
company is required to provide deep discounts on key pieces of 
their networks to rivals who want to lease them. 
</P>
<P>
	The business also must establish a separate subsidiary to  
provide advanced telecommunications services such as high-speed 
Internet access. At least 10 percent of its upgraded services would 
go toward low-income regions. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions ``are unprecedented in their detail, their  
clarity and their enforceability and the vigor with which they 
inject competition in these monopoly markets,'' Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the San Antonio-based SBC and Chicago-based  
Ameritech were relieved to see an end to the arduous 18-month 
review, but would have preferred fewer strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have no conditions or fewer conditions, but I'm  
sure we can operate with these,'' SBC's chairman, Edward Whitacre 
Jr., said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions include stiff fines. The companies could face up  
to $1.2 billion in penalties for failing to meet the new market 
deadline and could pay another $1.1 billion for not meeting 
performance standards related to opening up their markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't ever plan to pay a dollar,'' Whitacre said. ``I think  
we can certainly meet those standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre pledged that consumers would soon see the benefits of  
the union with packages of services and accelerated roll-out of 
high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also is poised to seek federal permission to provide  
long-distance service to its local phone customers, after getting a 
signal Wednesday from Texas regulators that it had met a list of 
statutory requirements to do so, Whitacre said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new SBC eventually wins FCC permission to provide  
long-distance service to its local customers, the three 
long-distance leaders could face a formidable rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be a very strong company,'' said Rex  
Mitchell, a telecommunications analyst with Banc of American 
Securities in San Francisco. The proposed merger between MCI 
WorldCom and Sprint is likely to make regulators more receptive to 
the new SBC's entering the long-distance market, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI, Sprint and AT&AMP;T opposed the deal, arguing that the  
concessions offered by SBC-Ameritech were accompanied by too many 
limitations. They also are concerned about FCC enforcement of the 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without swift and effective enforcement, we would face an  
unacceptable risk that the merged company could block local 
competition in order to protect its monopoly customer base,'' said 
MCI's chief policy counsel, Jonathan Sallet. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups believe the merger conditions do not go far  
enough to protect the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states in the proposed merger are Arkansas, California,  
Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	All five commissioners voted to approve the deal, but two  
dissented in part on the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The SBC-Ameritech union leaves just four remaining Bells out of  
the seven created in the breakup of the original American Telephone 
&AMP; Telegraph Co., which provided both local and long-distance phone 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, SBC closed at  
$51.81 1/4, up 87 1/2 cents, while Ameritech was up $1.31 1/4 to $68.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Heat Up War of Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a sign of increasingly hostile relations  
with Congress, President Clinton accused Senate Republicans of ``a 
disgraceful act of partisan politics'' Wednesday and criticized 
House Republicans for ``partisan posturing and legislative 
gamesmanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In reply, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott shot back that  
Clinton ``should be ashamed'' of his charges and was ``out of 
order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp exchange marked an escalation of the bitter fight  
between Clinton and the Republican majority in Congress that tried 
unsuccessfully to drive him from office on impeachment charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the feud has worsened, with Clinton's veto of  
the Republicans' $792 billion tax cut and disagreements on issues 
from education spending, gun control and judicial nominations to 
foreign aid, campaign finance reform and a nuclear test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the angriest outbursts of his presidency, Clinton said  
the Senate was guilty of ``a disgraceful act of partisan politics'' 
in defeating the nomination of Ronnie White for a federal judgeship 
in Missouri on a party-line vote. White is the first black jurist 
on the Missouri Supreme Court, had been supported in the Judiciary 
Committee by Republicans Orrin Hatch of Utah and Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania and had won testimonials from Sen. Christopher Bond, 
R-Mo. All three senators voted against White on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The president leveled his charges in a written statement late  
Tuesday and then repeated them in the Rose Garden before cameras on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the vote ``creates a real doubt'' about the  
Senate's ability to act fairly. Further, Clinton said, ``the 
Republican-controlled Senate is adding credence to the perceptions 
that they treat minority and women judicial nominees unfairly and 
unequally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said women nominees  
take an extra 60 days on average to be confirmed in comparison with 
men. ``If you're a minority,'' he said, ``it's 65 days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, in a statement, said Clinton ``should be ashamed of his  
accusation that Judge Ronnie White was rejected because of his 
race. These are baseless charges which I deeply resent. The 
president has impugned the integrity of the Senate and the process 
by which nominees are considered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said White's record had overwhelming opposition from the  
law enforcement community in Missouri and nationwide and ``was so 
bad that his was the first judicial nomination in the 6 1/2 years of 
the Clinton presidency rejected by the full Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also criticized House Republicans for trying to derail  
an administration-backed bill to allow patients to sue managed care 
health insurance companies. He said they were using legislative 
maneuvers to kill the bill without a direct vote on the merits of 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people deserve more than partisan posturing and  
legislative gamesmanship on an issue this vital,'' the president 
said. Republicans said they had given the Democrats the rules they 
wanted for debate. 
</P>
<P>
	On another front, Clinton accused Senate Republicans of trying  
to shortchange debate on a treaty to ban nuclear testing worldwide. 
``After two long years of inaction, one week is very little time 
for considered action,'' the president said. The Senate is to vote 
Tuesday, but Lott and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., 
are discussing a possible postponement.

	COLLEGEVILLE, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves guards Anthony  
Peeler and Terrell Brandon returned to practice after missing time 
because of a freak injury and an apparent allergic reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler missed the first of two practices Tuesday because he was  
hurt while receiving room service at the team's hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler sustained a gash just below his right knee that needed  
six stitches when he tried to get out of the way of a server and 
stumbled into the glass edge of his whirlpool Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was dark, so that didn't help,'' Peeler said. He returned  
for Tuesday night practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon was back at practice after missing Monday's workout  
because of respiratory problems, apparently from an allergic 
reaction to medication for muscle cramping. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon was given sodium pills Sunday night after becoming  
dehydrated and started having cramps at the end of practice. He 
woke up Monday with tightness in his chest and had trouble 
breathing.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Rape of Miss World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- An Israeli court convicted a travel  
agent Wednesday of assaulting Linor Abargil in Italy, two months 
before the Israeli woman was crowned Miss World. 
</P>
<P>
	Abargil said she hopes the high-profile case will encourage  
other sexual assault victims to come forward. ``I want to scream 
out loud to every woman to complain, to tell the police,'' Linor 
Abargil, 19, said after the ruling by the Tel Aviv District Court. 
``Don't be afraid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defendant, Shlomo Uri Noor, an immigrant from Egypt,  
complained that he did not get a fair trial because he is ``not 100 
percent Israeli.'' Noor, who faces up to 30 years in prison, said 
he would appeal the conviction. Sentencing hearings are scheduled 
to begin November 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Abargil, who is the reigning 1998 Miss World, went public with  
the rape charges after Noor was arrested in Israel in January, 
saying she hoped her example would encourage other women to report 
sexual assault to the police. 
</P>
<P>
	But during the trial, Abargil appeared to waver, crying several  
times and describing the cross examination by Noor's lawyers as a 
``second rape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court on Wednesday reprimanded Noor's attorneys, saying the  
questioning was unnecessarily rough and humiliating. 
</P>
<P>
	Abargil, an Israeli, was in Milan, Italy, a year ago auditioning  
for modeling jobs when she asked Noor, who runs a travel agency 
there, to arrange a flight back to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Noor told her there were no flights from Milan to Israel and  
offered to drive her to Rome where she could catch a plane. During 
the ride, Noor pulled the car into a thicket and raped her at 
knifepoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Because both Noor and Abargil are Israeli citizens, the court  
decided the case could be tried in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 64.69 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher in early trading today,  
responding to a rebounding bond market and optimism about 
third-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 64.69 at 10,465.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 7.71 at 1,309.06 , and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 27.16 at 2,862.83. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors were looking forward to third-quarter  
earnings reports that are starting to trickle in. The market seemed 
to be following its recent pattern of punishing companies that meet 
but don't surpass analyst expectations -- aluminum producer Alcoa 
met earnings forecasts, but fell 1 7/8 to 62 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors rewarded Pepsico for beating expectations. Pepsi was  
up 1 to 32 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet search engine Yahoo! is scheduled to report earnings  
after the market closes. Yahoo was down 3/8 to 173. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimism about earnings was tempered by the Federal  
Reserve's decision Tuesday to leave interest rates alone for now 
but lean toward a rate hike in the coming months. Analysts said 
that move will only add uncertainty to market, as investors will 
speculate how the central bank will react to economic reports over 
the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks had rallied Monday amid expectations the Fed would leave  
rates unchanged, but the policy shift dampened hopes that the Fed 
wouldn't try to slow the economy any further to combat inflation. 
The central bank has pushed rates higher twice since June. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds plunged Tuesday on the Fed's announcement, but were up  
today, lowering the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond from 6.17 
percent to 6.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 119.4 million 
shares, up from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was up 1.22 at 427.23.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.6 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.2 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
up 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise Sharply; Dow Up 150.58 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today as investors cast aside  
interest rate concerns and turned upbeat about third-quarter 
earnings. Financial and Internet issues once again led the gains. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 150.58 at 10,550.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 20.28 at 1,321.63, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 47.47 at 2,847.14. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors were focused on third-quarter earnings  
reports which have begun to trickle in. 
</P>
<P>
	For companies that reported earnings earlier today, the market  
followed its recent pattern of rewarding firms that beat analyst 
expectations and punishing those that meet but don't exceed 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsico, up 1 15/16 to 33 3/8, was rewarded for surpassing Wall  
Street's expectations, although its beverage sales suffered because 
of higher prices. Rival Coke, a Dow component, rose 3 1/2 to51 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Aluminum producer and Dow component Alcoa fell 2 1/16 to 62 1/16  
after meeting forecasts but reporting a drop in shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet search engine Yahoo!, up 1/8 to 173 3/16, was scheduled  
to report earnings after the market closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimism about earnings comes after weeks of worry about  
what the Federal Reserve would do with interest rates. The Fed 
decided Tuesday to leave interest rates alone for now but lean 
toward a rate hike in the coming months. Although the Fed's 
announcement initially led to heavy selling, investors were more 
relaxed today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market spent six weeks wretching its hands about interest  
rates, and though it didn't get exactly what it wanted, it's now 
behind us,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis for 
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank has pushed rates higher twice since June and  
worries about another increase helped depress stocks down for much 
of the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think the market is oversold and think they can pick up  
some bargains,'' said Eugene G. Mintz, financial markets analyst at 
Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also helped by a recovery in bonds, which plunged  
Tuesday on the Fed's announcement but were stabilizing today, 
lowering the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond to 6.16 percent 
from 6.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express, up 4 9/16 to 145, and Hewlett Packard, up 5  
3/16 at 88 13/16 helped push the Dow higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Online autioneer Ebay, up 8 7/16 at 150, and Priceline.com, up 7  
at 71 1/8 propelled the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-8 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 709.43 million 
shares, down from Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was up 2.18 at 428.19.

<HEADLINE> Study: Obesity Can Shorten Lifespan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A study of more than 1 million Americans provides the most  
convincing evidence yet that simply being overweight can cut your 
life short. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, the largest ever done on obesity and mortality, found  
that overweight people run a higher rate of premature death. And 
this was true even among people who didn't smoke and were otherwise 
healthy during their middle years. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was conducted by the American Cancer Society and  
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	It settles once and for all any lingering questions about  
whether weight alone increases the risk of death and disease, said 
Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Harvard University endocrinologist and 
preventive-health specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence is now compelling and irrefutable,'' Manson said.  
``Obesity is probably the second-leading preventable cause of death 
in the United States after cigarette smoking, so it is a very 
serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study found an especially clear association between excess  
weight and a higher risk of dying from heart disease or cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike a similar study last year that suggested being  
overweight is less of a problem as people grow older, this study 
found many more deaths among overweight people of all ages, 
especially those over 75. 
</P>
<P>
	More adults and children are overweight than ever before, with  
55 percent of American adults weighing more than they should.

<P>
	``The message is we're too fat and it's killing us. We need to  
come up with ways as a society to eat less and exercise more,'' 
said American Cancer Society epidemiologist Eugenia Calle, lead 
author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson said: ``It's going to take a coordinated campaign to turn  
this around, at the community level, at the environmental level, 
with changes in the food industry and marketing industry, having 
more bike paths and sidewalks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black women were found to be the only exceptions to the rule.  
The study found the most obese black women did not have a 
significantly higher risk of premature death than slender black 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	That poses a fascinating scientific riddle, said June Stevens, a  
University of North Carolina professor of nutrition. ``Although I 
had seen this in several other studies, I wasn't ready to believe 
it was true,'' she said. ``Now I'm thinking maybe this is true, and 
we need to figure out why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Stevens and Manson said the study probably understates  
the risks of obesity for black women. 
</P>
<P>
	They pointed out that slender, non-smoking black women have a  
higher risk of death to begin with than their white counterparts, 
probably because they have less access to health care than white 
women and more undetected disease. That makes it appear that weight 
alone doesn't play a big role in death rates among black women. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be really unfortunate if we became more complacent  
about obesity in blacks than in whites,'' Manson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied participants in the national Cancer  
Prevention Study II from 1982 through 1996. The average age at 
enrollment was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers calculated each subject's body mass index, or  
BMI, a ratio of weight to height, and tracked them for age and 
cause of death. The results were adjusted for age, education, 
physical activity, alcohol use, marital status, use of aspirin as a 
blood-thinner, consumption of fats and vegetables, and use of 
estrogen supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	Among healthy, non-smoking white men and women and black men,  
the researchers found a gradually increasing risk of death 
beginning with a BMI of 25, which is 150 pounds for a 5-foot-5 
woman and 174 pounds for a 5-foot-10 man. 
</P>
<P>
	The fattest white men, with a BMI of 40 or more -- 278 pounds on  
a 5-foot-10 frame -- were 2.58 times more likely to die than their 
healthiest peers, men of the same height weighing 153 to 170 
pounds. White women with a BMI of 40 or greater -- 240 pounds for a 
5-foot-5 woman -- were twice as likely to die as their counterparts 
who weighed 132 to 148 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Thin men and women also had higher death rates, but it was not  
clear whether their low weight was a cause or an effect of disease.

<HEADLINE> Aussie Olympic Ticket Sales Are Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In Australia these days, the phrase heard most  
often about next summer's Olympics is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	Top price for tickets to the swimming finals is $455. There are  
no more available. Naturally, the track and field finals are sold 
out. Rowing, cycling and field hockey, too. And don't even ask 
about basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The best seats at the opening ceremony cost $1,382, but don't  
try buying them, either. They're also long gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than one year from the start of the 2000 Games, the Sydney  
Olympic Organizing Committee is scrambling to fulfill ticket 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are oversubscribed,'' Michael Knight, president of the  
Sydney organizers, said Wednesday. ``We budgeted $220 million from 
the domestic market. We have up-front orders for $340 million. We 
can't satisfy all that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The organizers were criticized by the International Olympic  
Committee for making ticket prices too high. What they did was make 
high-end tickets more expensive in an effort to subsidize low-end 
tickets. So those shut out of $1,382 opening ceremony tickets might 
consider the 10,000 seats priced at a more economical $105. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how poor, you can get to an Olympic event,'' Knight  
said. ``There are 1 1/2 million tickets between $10 and $19. They are 
subsidized by the dearer tickets. There's a balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the games approach, Knight admits to some apprehension.  
</P>
<P>
	``People keep saying, `You're all set,''' he said. ``That's what  
makes me nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, though, Sydney does seem all set. Almost all venues are  
completed and many have already been used for major events as a 
pre-Olympics test. The same is true for a vast transportation 
system put in place after Sydney officials saw some of the troubles 
experienced by Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight is not about to promise the best this or the best that.  
He knows from the experience of Atlanta organizing chief Billy 
Payne that kind of pledge can backfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Billy Payne, but I don't consider him a role model,''  
he said. ``The last thing we should do is blow our trumpet. Our job 
is to deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the last pieces to fall in place for Australian  
organizers is sponsorship dollars. Their budget still has $140 
million to go. Knight thinks the final figure will fall short of 
that target. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably raised the bar too high,'' he said. ``We've got  
$800 million in sponsorship. That's staggering for a country of 100 
million people. The tendency was to keep revising the target 
upward, beyond what was achievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining sponsorship income will fall short of $140 million  
but exceed $50 million. And that's fine with Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been prudent,'' he said. ``If we were to err, we wanted  
to err on the conservative side. If your thinking is overly 
optimistic, you'd better not count on spending it. That's what we 
did.''

<HEADLINE> How To Calculate Body Mass Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists use a body mass index figure to determine who they  
say is overweight and obese. To determine body mass index, multiply 
weight in pounds by 703. Then divide that result by height in 
inches squared. 
</P>
<P>
	Examples:  
</P>
<P>
	--A person, male or female, who is 5-feet-1 and weighs 132 pounds  
would have a body mass index of 25 and be considered overweight. At 
158 pounds, the person would have a BMI of 30 and be considered 
obese. 
</P>
<P>
	--A person 5-feet-4, 145 pounds would have a BMI of 25. At 174  
pounds, the BMI would be 30. 
</P>
<P>
	--A person 5-feet-7, 159 pounds would have a BMI of 25. At 191  
pounds, the BMI would be 30. 
</P>
<P>
	--A person 5-feet-10, 174 pounds would have a BMI of 25. At 209  
pounds, the BMI would be 30. 
</P>
<P>
	--A person 6-feet-1, 189 pounds would have a BMI of 25. At 227  
pounds, the BMI would be 30.

<HEADLINE> Climber Lowe Killed in Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- He was regarded as the world's greatest  
mountain climber, a man of such prodigious strength and endurance 
that others called him ``Lungs with Legs.'' He single-handedly 
rescued several climbers in Alaska, and even guided his 10-year-old 
son to the top of the Grand Teton. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Lowe met his match on a peak in the Himalayas on Tuesday,  
and there he will remain for eternity. 
</P>
<P>
	The legendary 40-year-old Montanan was swept to his death along  
with another climber in an avalanche on the world's 14th-highest 
mountain, the 26,291-foot Shishapangma in Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedition members said by satellite telephone that his body  
will be left buried there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know Alex had expressed the desire to be left, if this were  
ever to happen to him on a mountain,'' said John Wilcox, president 
of the film company that was recording the expedition. 
</P>
<P>
	Any attempt to recover the bodies would be too dangerous, Wilcox  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, film crew member David Bridges and other expedition  
members were scouting out routes at about 19,000 feet when they saw 
a slab of snow break free 6,000 feet above them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all ran like hell once they saw it coming,'' Wilcox said.  
``The two other guys (Lowe and Bridges) didn't make it clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's death stunned other high-altitude climbers, some of whom  
had believed that he was just about invincible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it hard to believe that Alex could ever be killed,''  
said Gordon Wiltsie, a National Geographic photographer and a close 
friend. ``This is just a cruel reminder that the mountains are 
bigger than any person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe had made difficult climbs all over the world, including  
Nepal's Kwangde and Kusum Kanguru, and twice reached the summit of 
Mount Everest. In Peru, he climbed the southwest buttress of 
Taulliraju. He was a member of North Face's ``Dream Team'' -- the 
best-known climbers in the country -- and was under contract to test 
and promote North Face outdoor gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside magazine described him in its March cover story as the  
best mountain climber in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an amazing guy,'' said Gary Bocarde, a veteran guide on  
Alaska's Mount McKinley. ``He was real humble. Some people go for 
the Seven Summits and all these chalk-it-up kind of climbs. He 
wasn't that kind of climber. He was more a climber's climber 
instead of a peak bagger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a year when six climbers died on Mount McKinley, Lowe  
was involved in several rescues. 
</P>
<P>
	``He literally, single-handedly saved several people,'' said  
J.D. Swed, chief mountaineering ranger for the National Park 
Service in Talkeetna, Alaska. ``He picked one guy up who had frozen 
hands and feet and couldn't move and was literally inches from 
death. Alex put him on his back and carried him'' to a clearing at 
19,600 feet where a helicopter could land. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Outside magazine, Lowe played down his  
heroics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those things you do because you have to do it,  
one of those Herculean things where you get a lot of adrenaline 
going and you just do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe was married to a Bozeman artist and fellow climber,  
Jennifer Leigh Lowe. They had three children -- Max, 10; Sam, 6; and 
Isaac, 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe reached the summit of the Grand in Grand Teton National  
Park this summer with Max -- which he called one of his proudest 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiltsie said the Himalayan peak was an appropriate resting place  
for Lowe: ``I think that moments before this happened, he was 
probably immensely excited and happy.''

<HEADLINE> Metabolife Maker Targets ABC News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The maker of a dietary supplement is launching a  
pre-emptive strike against ABC News in advance of a ``20/20'' 
segment it believes will show the company in a negative light. 
</P>
<P>
	Metabolife International Inc. is posting on the Internet a  
videotape of an interview that its CEO, Michael Ellis, conducted 
with ABC News and is spending at least $1.5 million in advertising 
to call attention to it. 
</P>
<P>
	A full-page ad directing people to a Web site with the interview  
ran in today's edition of The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm concerned about is that the whole story won't be out  
there,'' Metabolife's CEO, Michael Ellis, said today. ```20/20' 
may, and I'm not saying they will, have a different agenda on how 
they want this story to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An ABC spokeswoman confirmed ``20/20'' is working on a story  
that examines health claims made by Metabolife for its products. It 
has no scheduled air date. 
</P>
<P>
	``They clearly think this is as important an issue as we do, or  
else they wouldn't have been devoting all these resources to 
rebutting a piece that they haven't seen yet,'' said Eileen Murphy, 
ABC News spokeswoman. ``It seems curious to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis said a ``20/20'' representative called to talk to  
Metabolife 10 days after the company filed a defamation lawsuit 
against WCBV-TV, an ABC affiliate in Boston, for a story it ran 
about potential harmful side effects to its products. 
</P>
<P>
	Metabolife fears the ``20/20'' story may be in retaliation for  
the lawsuit, Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said WCBV's story was one of the reports that persuaded  
ABC to take its own look into Metabolife. But, she said, it was 
``completely and utterly false'' that the assignment was made out 
of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's interview with Ellis was conducted in an auditorium before  
more than 300 Metabolife employees and their guests, and was 
videotaped by Metabolife. Ellis said this was done because he had 
so many requests from employees to see the interview, and was not 
an attempt to intimidate ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said ABC agreed to conduct the interview before an  
audience because the network believed it was important to get 
Metabolife's side of the story.

<HEADLINE> Nevada Power Plant To Cut Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Owners of a coal-burning power plant that  
environmentalists say is a major source of haze in the Grand Canyon 
have agreed to install pollution control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement among the owners of the Mohave Generating Station  
in Laughlin, Nev., the Grand Canyon Trust and the Sierra Club was 
being filed today with federal court in Phoenix. It proposes 
installation of smokestack scrubbers, a filter system and new 
burners for the plant's boilers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be one of the largest cleanups of one of the  
old coal-powered plants in the West,'' said Rick Moore, air quality 
program officer for the Grand Canyon Trust. ``This plant regularly 
belches enormous plumes of soot and smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Salt River Project, a major Arizona utility,  
announced completion of a $420 million cleanup project at a second 
coal-burning plant accused of polluting the canyon, the Navajo 
Generating Station near Page. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of these plants are examples of corporations stepping up  
to the plate and taking care of their environmental 
responsibilities,'' Moore said. ``Cleaning up these two plants is 
definitely going to improve visitors' experiences at the Grand 
Canyon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mohave, located in Laughlin, Nev., 75 miles from the Grand  
Canyon, is the last large power plant operating in the Southwest 
without equipment to control sulfur pollution, said Chris Leshock, 
a coal consultant with Research Data International in Boulder, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the two power plants, air pollution affecting the  
canyon also is believed to come from Los Angeles, Las Vegas and 
other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups contend the 28-year-old Mohave plant  
routinely exceeded federal emissions standards for emissions of 
sulfur dioxide, which combines with other atmospheric chemicals to 
form haze. 
</P>
<P>
	Improvements at the plant are designed to cut sulfur dioxide  
emissions by at least 85 percent and to reduce nitrogen oxides and 
soot. The project could cost $300 million and is to be finished by 
April 1, 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grand Canyon Trust and the Sierra Club filed suit in 1998  
trying to force a cleanup. A judge will have 45 days to review the 
proposed consent decree being submitted today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mohave plant is owned by Southern California Edison, the Los  
Angeles Department of Water &AMP; Power, Nevada Power Co. and the Salt 
River Project in Phoenix. It produces 1,580 megawatts of energy 
each year -- enough to serve up to 1.5 million households in 
California, Arizona and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, the plant burns about 6 million tons of coal. That  
emits about 40,000 tons of haze-creating sulfur dioxide, 10,000 
tons of soot and 20,000 tons of nitrogen oxide, the pollution that 
stains the air brown over many large cities.

<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Fire apparently caused by a space heater  
tore through a single-story wood-and-brick home, killing a mother, 
her three young children and a 7-year-old relative. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor, Vincent Clark, said he heard a woman's screams  
around midnight Tuesday, looked outside and saw smoke. He called 
his cousin, grabbed a baseball bat and went next door. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his cousin pounded on the front door but could not get it  
to open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took my baseball bat and broke the door,'' Clark said.  
``Then I kicked it wide open. ... The fire and smoke rushed me and 
I couldn't get in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives identified the victims as Yolanda Ortiz and three of  
her children: Rosa, 1; Blanca, 2; and Mauro, 4. Also killed was 
Eric Laureles, 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Among four people who escaped was Eric's mother, Cathia  
Laureles. 
</P>

	Memphis Fire Marshal H.J. Pickett said a preliminary  
investigation determined a kerosene space heater started the fire. 
He also said investigators found no smoke detector in the home.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Alfonzo a Quiet Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- On the list of the New York Mets' big names, he's  
way behind the likes of Mike Piazza, Robin Ventura, John Olerud and 
Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet before he's finished, Edgardo Alfonzo could be better than  
them all. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Mets' unlikely playoff run, the 25-year-old Venezuelan  
has been the unquestioned hero. He homered in the first inning of 
New York's Monday night wild-card playoff triumph in Cincinnati. He 
homered in the first inning off Randy Johnson in Tuesday night's 
8-4 NL playoff victory over Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he finished off the Diamondbacks with a grand slam just  
inside the left-field foul pole off reliever Bobby Chouinard in the 
ninth. It was a 3-1 pitch, and Alfonzo had a pretty good idea what 
he was going to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get behind in the count, he just started throwing  
fastballs,'' Alfonzo said. ``He didn't walk to walk me. He was just 
throwing me fastball to see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happened was a fastball right where Alfonzo wanted it, a  
gift he hit just inside the foul pole down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alfonzo's a good hitter,'' said Arizona's Luis Gonzalez, who  
should know one when he sees one. ``I played with him in winter 
ball before. He's coming through in the clutch for them. It seems 
like he's doing everything you can do in baseball to help a team 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already in his sixth season with New York, Alfonzo is just 25  
years old, so the future seems so bright. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last few years, Edgardo Alfonzo has been a fabulous  
baseball player who has kind of a star quality,'' said Mets manager 
Bobby Valentine, in a playoff game for the first time. ``He's 
gaining confidence, and with confidence you get performances like 
you saw tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo blends into the background behind his more flashy  
teammates. When the Mets signed Ventura as a free agent, Alfonzo 
moved from third base to second base without complaint, then played 
the position as if he'd been there all his life. He did not make a 
fielding error at second all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo batted .304 with 191 hits, a club record 123 runs and  
108 RBIs, all career highs. On Aug. 30 in Houston, he was 6-for-6 
with three home runs, a double, six runs scored and five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's the prime catalyst as the Mets came back from the edge  
of oblivion a week ago to tie the Reds, then beat Arizona to take 
the inside track in the best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to have a little patience at home plate,'' Alfonzo said,  
``until I see a good pitch to hit and be on time with my legs, with 
my leg kick, be on time. I think that's a big thing for me right 
now. Every time I go to home plate, I have an idea of what I'm 
going to do.''

<HEADLINE> Play Showcases Unsatisfied Writers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A writer's lot is not a happy one.  
</P>
<P>
	So sighs Irish playwright Brian Friel in ``Give Me Your Answer,  
Do!'', his uneasy domestic drama that contrasts two artists, one 
full of integrity but debt-ridden and stymied by writers' block for 
the past 20 years; the other a prolific popular success but equally 
unsatisfied. They are friends and rivals, each wishing for a piece 
of the other's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Friel's play, which the Roundabout Theater Company opened  
Tuesday, may not be at the level of ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' or 
``Translations.'' It talks itself into corners. Yet the work has 
its haunting moments, particularly in this beautifully acted 
production directed with care by Kyle Donnelly. 
</P>
<P>
	Friel focuses on Tom Connolly, a struggling author who had a  
burst of glory in his 20s. Now, more than two decades later, he 
finds himself in growing financial difficulty and unable to write. 
Tom lives in increasing isolation in Ballybeg, County Donegal, in a 
crumbling structure remarkably similar to the old manse in 
``Aristocrats,'' another Friel family play. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom spends time visiting his autistic daughter, who has been  
committed to an institution. As the lost writer, John Glover 
perfectly captures the man's bitterness and sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Kate Burton underplays his alcoholic wife with great effect.  
Tom's helpmate is a sardonic woman who grudgingly helps her husband 
but resents everything that didn't happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom stands in forlorn contrast to Garret Fitzmaurice, a  
prosperous novelist portrayed with zest by Gawn Grainger. This 
robust man arrives with his equally jocular wife (Helen Carey) for 
a visit. Behind their gaiety, there is a desperate sniping not 
unlike the little wars being fought by Tom and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Friel's slight story spins on a question of money. An American  
university has offered Garret a sizable amount of cash for his 
collected papers. Now, it may do the same for Tom, depending on 
what an appraiser -- presented here as a nervous, insecure man (the 
wonderful Michael Emerson) -- thinks of the work. 
</P>
<P>
	Fluttering around the edges of this drama are Tom's in-laws: the  
wife, a retired doctor, whose crippling arthritis will soon doom 
her to a wheelchair, and the husband, a spright of a fellow given 
to bouts of kleptomania. Lois Smith invests the elderly woman with 
a commonsense that eludes most of the other characters, while Joel 
Grey exudes considerable charm as her hubby, who plays the piano in 
local hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Tom's considerable flaws, Friel clearly favors the man  
over Garret. Tom lives life on the edge, emotionally, financially, 
creatively. He may not be successful, but he is not any more 
unhappy than his seemingly satisfied counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
	Friel frames the play with Tom's visits to his mentally  
disturbed daughter, a haunting performance by Woodwyn Koons. These 
meetings are where Tom's imagination really soars -- making up 
fanciful stories for an offspring, who, perhaps, will never hear, 
much less understand, them. Then again, she might. Friel seems to 
be saying it is a chance every writer must take.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Rakes In $2.3B in Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Harvard University raked in a stunning  
$2.3 billion over a five-year fund-raising campaign, setting a 
record for university philanthropy and surpassing its own $2.1 
billion goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the campaign went public in 1994, 172,000 donors have  
given money to their alma mater. The fund-raising campaign, which 
has boosted Harvard's endowment to $14.4 billion, concludes Dec. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rare year when Harvard does not raise more support than  
any other institution to start with,'' said David Morgan, a vice 
president at the Council for Aid to Education, a New York-based 
research group. ``It would probably be impossible for any other 
institution to surpass Harvard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, for example, Harvard raised about $463 million,  
followed by Stanford's $313 million, Morgan said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Capital campaigns like the one Harvard is now wrapping up are  
intensified fund-raising programs over a period of time. About a 
dozen schools nationwide are in the midst of campaigns to raise 
more than a billion dollars, including Columbia, with a goal of 
$2.2 billion, and Duke, with a $1.5 billion goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard's total may seem mammoth, but other schools raise more  
money on a per student basis. Last year, Harvard ranked 18th on a 
dollar-per-student ratio, bringing in about $24,800 per student, 
Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Institute of Technology -- the highest-ranking  
undergraduate university on the list -- took in $49,300 per student.

<HEADLINE> Many Factors in NFL Team Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Houston won a football franchise Wednesday  
because it had one plan, lots of money and a legion of zealous 
fans. Los Angeles didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL was determined to put a team in the nation's  
second-largest television market, but when the final showdown came, 
Los Angeles was hamstrung by conflicting proposals, a lack of 
public money, limited city and state support and fans who didn't 
seem to care. 
</P>
<P>
	A Houston group led by businessman Bob McNair will pay a $700  
million franchise fee to the NFL and $310 million for a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money talks, it sure talked this time,'' said billionaire Eli  
Broad, who with real estate magnate Ed Roski led the effort to put 
a team at the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group, headed by Hollywood superagent Michael Ovitz and  
supermarket billionaire Ron Burkle, initially proposed a stadium in 
Carson, then switched their support to the Hollywood Park racetrack 
in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite talk about joining forces, the two groups never did.  
</P>
<P>
	Broad and Roski were front-runners until things blew up over  
public money at an NFL owners meeting in July in Chicago. Ovitz 
seemed to be the favorite as recently as last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the shocking bid by McNair, clinching the bid for  
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bid $500 million for the franchise,'' Broad said. ``There's  
just so much that makes sense. Our bid would have required a $300 
to $400 million additional investment in a stadium. The entire cost 
would have been close to $1 billion. Even at that amount, it was 
hardly a good investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Levin, a spokesman for Ovitz, seconded those comments.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a responsibility to our partners, our lenders,  
ourselves to construct a deal that at the end of the day, garnered 
a modicum of return that made sense, and at these levels, it was 
far from making sense,'' he said. ``It came down to the money, and 
a responsibility to a deal that makes sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A disappointed Mayor Richard Riordan said he was confident Los  
Angeles would have a team in the future, but he hopes it won't be 
the Raiders, who have been trying to get out of their lease in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Raiders owner Al Davis has long maintained Los Angeles is still  
his territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope Al Davis isn't with them,'' Riordan said when  
asked how he felt about the Raiders returning. ``(If) they traded 
Al Davis to Houston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At times, it appeared fans could care less if there was a team  
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	While admitting a higher percentage of fans care in Houston than  
in Los Angeles, Broad said, ``If you multiply 20 percent of the 
people interested in a market of 16-to-18 million people compared 
to, say, 40 percent in a market of 5 million, you come up with a 
higher number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has been without an NFL team since the Rams and  
Raiders left after the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen teams come and I've seen them go,'' said 41-year-old  
Henry Parker, who shook his head when asked if he cared about 
Houston's victory. ``If we got a team just to say we got a team, 
that isn't enough. It's not worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas blamed Bill Chadwick, Gov.  
Gray Davis' point man in summer negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor got involved because Exposition Park, where the  
Coliseum is located, is on state-owned land. At the meeting in 
Chicago, a state-backed proposal was rejected because the NFL 
wanted public money. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a week later, Chadwick resigned out of frustration.  
</P>
<P>
	``Things began to go sideways after that meeting,''  
Ridley-Thomas said. ``The point was, you don't force the issue. 
(The NFL) was trying to keep the deal going forward. I think 
Chadwick's handling of the deal has to be described as inept at 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chadwick said he respects Ridley-Thomas, but added, ``The state  
wasn't going to subsidize the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky was also critical of the  
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be an idiot not to believe that the NFL all along  
wasn't using Los Angeles as a lever to drive the price of the 
Houston franchise up. I think the NFL took Los Angeles for a 
ride.''

<HEADLINE>  Miami's Collins Promoted to Starter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins rookie running back Cecil  
``The Diesel'' Collins will make his first start Sunday at 
Indianapolis in place of Karim Abdul-Jabbar, who was demoted to 
third string Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cecil gives us a chance to get some big plays,'' coach Jimmy  
Johnson said. ``We want to let him get into a rhythm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big plays were rare for Abdul-Jabbar, a starter since his rookie  
season in 1996. His longest run last year was 18 yards, and in his 
three full seasons, Miami ranked 19th, 29th and 24th in the NFL in 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie J.J. Johnson will spell Collins on Sunday, and  
Abdul-Jabbar might be inactive, coach Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to play the two young guys,'' the coach said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Karim is a valuable player to us. He may not be getting action  
right now, but as I told him, we're going to need him before this 
year is over. He's got a real good attitude about it. He 
understands the situation. He's obviously disappointed, but he's a 
professional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lineup change was based on potential rather than production,  
because all three running backs have struggled. Abdul-Jabbar has 
rushed for 95 yards on 28 carries, a 3.4 average, and Collins has 
gained 92 yards on 31 carries, a 3.0 average. 
</P>
<P>
	But Collins has been recovering from a sprained ankle, and he  
showed flashes of brilliance in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of talent,'' Johnson said. ``I want to put guys  
in there who are going to make plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, limited to six games in college because of drug and  
legal problems, slipped to the fifth round in the April draft. He 
has avoided controversy with the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just looking forward to contributing any way I'm asked,  
whether it's as a starter or a backup,'' he said. ``I've learned a 
lot by playing as much as I have the first few games, and I think 
I'm ready for this opportunity. I'm just going to go out and play 
as well as I can.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Greets Bronx Well-Wishers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's not a phrase you hear in the Bronx every  
day: ``Hey, good buddy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that was how Texas Gov. George W. Bush greeted well-wishers  
Wednesday as he strolled around an Italian food market and ate a 
pizza-and-pasta lunch with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George 
Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is a city where the popularity of a Republican is the  
exception, not the rule. But the GOP presidential candidate and his 
sidekicks were mobbed by folks who clamored to shake his hand and 
wish him luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, good buddy!'' the Texan said to Natala Chiodo, a  
diminutive older man with a heavy Italian accent. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiodo, an admirer of Bush's mother Barbara, responded: ``Your  
mother's a dolly!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Chernesky, 18, said she was excited to see Giuliani but  
comes from a Democratic family and actually prefers Vice President 
Al Gore over Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Gore,'' she said, adding: ``This is going to be my  
first year to vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the market, Bush sampled food, chatted with vendors and  
called out ``Mucho gusto concerte!'' -- Spanish for ``nice to meet 
you'' -- to Marcia Hernandez, a Dominican immigrant picking up 
groceries to bring to a nearby senior center where she works. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yo tambien!'' (``Me too!'') she called back.  
</P>
<P>
	Pataki and Giuliani have a rocky personal relationship, but they  
put aside their differences to accompany Bush on a three-borough 
tour of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Republican Party is unified,'' Bush said, standing with  
Pataki and Giuliani at an earlier stop at a Queens job placement 
center for welfare recipients. ``Standing behind me are the pillars 
of the Republican Party in New York, people who put their minds to 
winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush added: ``I believe I have a chance to win the primary in  
New York on March 7. Should I become the nominee, I have a chance 
to win New York'' in the general election in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also elaborated on remarks he made Tuesday in which he  
chided his party for focusing too much on the economy at the 
expense of social problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was making the case that the conservative philosophy is the  
compassionate philosophy,'' Bush said. ``I was making the case that 
all the time we are talking about numbers and economics, we are 
also talking about what we believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can elevate people out of poverty. I'm talking from the  
heart, and I hope the Republican Party can appreciate it,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there was room in the GOP for the conservative views of  
presidential rival Pat Buchanan, Bush said: ``He ought to go out in 
New Hampshire and Iowa and lay out his views. I'm confident the 
Republican Party will reject it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush added: ``I look forward to whipping him.''  
</P>
<P>
	Later, Bush attended a $1,250-a-plate fund-raiser at a Somerset,  
N.J., ballpark on behalf of Republican legislative candidates. 
Bush, a former managing partner of the Texas Rangers, joked that 
his reception was ``a little warmer then my Texas Rangers received 
last night,'' referring to their 8-0 playoff loss to the New York 
Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Alcoa earnings rise 19 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Although aluminum shipments dropped during  
Alcoa's third quarter, the company reported a 19 percent rise in 
earnings on the strength of lower production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest aluminum producer said today it earned  
$259.1 million, or 69 cents a share, compared to $217.7 million or 
61 cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met the expectations of analysts surveyed by First  
Call/Thomson Financial. But the stock market, likely disappointed 
by the drop in shipments, sent Alcoa's stock down $3.44 to $60.69 
in midday New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues fell 1.4 percent to $4.05 billion from $4.1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa said it shipped 1.1 million metric tons of aluminum in the  
current third quarter compared to 1.13 million metric tons a year 
ago. The company said the effect of that shortfall on its earnings 
was offset by productivity improvements throughout its 
manufacturing system. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the fiscal year, Alcoa earned  
$720.2 million, or $1.91 per share, up from $634.7 million, or 
$1.83 per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales came to $12.07 billion, up from $11.14 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa is in the process of merging with No. 3 aluminum producer  
Reynolds Metals Inc. The deal would create a company with about 
$21. billion in annual revenue. But Alcoa's position as the world's 
leading producer of aluminum and alumina, is threatened by another 
deal, between Zurich-based Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup), Pechiney of 
France and Alcan Aluminum of Canada, which would create a company 
with about $21.6 billion in revenue.

<HEADLINE> President Bush Letters Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Letters, for George Bush, are like handshakes  
for any other politician -- something to be doled out generously and 
with a firm, personal touch, however fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president has always been a man of letters -- long,  
searching ones to his family, short breezy ones to friends, little 
notes of courtesy to the merest of acquaintances. He is said to 
have the ``Himalayas of address books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now a mountain of Bush's correspondence has come into public  
view with the release of ``All the Best.'' His collection of 
selected letters and diary entries stands in place of the memoirs 
Bush says he will never write. 
</P>
<P>
	The correspondence ranges from hair-raising letters home from  
the Pacific theater in World War II, when he was shot down, to a 
rumination a year ago on what it's like to fish as an old man (``if 
I turn fast, I wobble''). 
</P>
<P>
	And it is one of the early entries in a coming bonanza of Bush  
family biographies that could leave readers feeling am-Bushed. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest are focused on his eldest son George W., the Texas  
governor and Republican presidential aspirant, and include an 
autobiography the governor's press secretary has been polishing up. 
Two competing biographies are expected this fall, and two more 
books on the family early in the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years ago it was President Bush, not his son, who was  
sizing up the possibility of facing Al Gore in a presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	``An attractive guy, but he says he is a worse speaker than I,''  
Bush says of Gore in a diary entry in the book. ``Poor guy's in 
real trouble if he's worse than I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month later he added brightly, as if doing a party list:  
``Bill Clinton, a very nice man, may get into the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly bitter and at times despondent as the 1992 campaign  
wore on, he told speechwriter Peggy Noonan in one note that Clinton 
is ``better at facts-figures than I am. I'm better at life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost everyone who crosses paths with Bush gets a personal note  
from him. The Marine who dropped his rifle during a precision drill 
got one, saying, ``Don't worry about anything -- you did A-OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders who cracked down on pro-democracy students in  
1989 got several. ``Dear Friend,'' Bush began in a letter to Deng 
Xiaoping, appealing for clemency for the demonstrators. It ended: 
``If there is to be a period of darkness, so be it; but let us try 
to light some candles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was to get one almost on the eve of  
the air war to drive his forces from Kuwait. But Bush says the 
letter, bearing the obvious warning that ``We stand at the brink of 
war,'' was left on a table in Geneva when Saddam's envoy refused to 
bring it home. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the book, Bush:  
</P>
<P>
	--Admits being ``plagued with the image of body bags'' in the  
lead-up to the Persian Gulf ground war. ``Everybody who opposed the 
war raised body bags, body bags, and it gets to my heart. ... But 
I've got to push forward,'' he says in his diary. 
</P>
<P>
	--Says he kept a file on aides who fell asleep in meetings and  
named it the Scowcroft Award, because national security adviser 
Brent Scowcroft often drifted off. Bush credited Veterans Affairs 
Secretary Ed Derwinski with ``very firm eye closure and a 
remarkable recovery gambit. ... He nodded vigorously whenever in 
his slumber he heard the end of a sentence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Says he considered stopping the longtime practice of having  
presidents accompanied everywhere by the ``football,'' the black 
briefcase carried by a military aide that contains the codes to 
launch nuclear weapons. Aides vetoed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	--Says presidents are asked for their preferred funeral  
arrangements. Bush asked to have his Navy identification number put 
on a plain gravestone and the words ``He loved Barbara very much'' 
inscribed in reference to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	--Identifies May 31, 1991, as the date when a U.S. president  
turned to a personal computer to send a note to another world 
leader. It was a brief note to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but 
Bush made what he calls a ``historic typo,'' addressing the note: 
``Dear Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's selective use of letters and diary entries presents a  
largely sunny view of his political career. He declares that 
despite the criticism he took for making Dan Quayle his running 
mate, ``I never regretted my choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in a 1997 biography of Bush, historian Herbert S. Parmet  
quoted the president as writing in his diary, soon after picking 
Quayle: ``It was my decision, and I blew it, but I'm not about to 
say that I blew it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all its upbeat tone, the collection is suffused with sadness  
over the death of the Bushes' daughter, Robin, nearly 4, from 
leukemia in 1953. Several years later he wrote to his mother about 
the void in his house of four boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need someone who's afraid of frogs,'' he wrote. ``We need  
someone to cry when I get mad -- not argue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a little one who can kiss without leaving egg or jam  
or gum. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Meets With Reform Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Reform Party Chairman Russell Verney said today he  
welcomed a discussion with Pat Buchanan about a possible run for 
the party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney said he was set to meet with Buchanan today.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big decision for him,'' Verney said. ``Should he choose  
to come to the Reform Party, it's an enormous commitment and 
investment that has to be made. We have a fair, open democratic 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a Republican presidential candidate, has said he will  
decide this month whether to bolt the GOP and seek the Reform Party 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, in Dallas for a book tour, said today that he doesn't  
plan to seek a meeting with Reform Party founder Ross Perot while 
in the city. Perot has not endorsed a presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he had already talked with some Reform Party  
officials and was seeking a meeting with Verney. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are looking at clearly is to give the American people  
a choice at the polls,'' he told TV station WFAA today. ``I think 
the two parties in Washington are really in bed with each other. I 
think the American people need a real choice in 2000. That's the 
only reason I would run.''

<HEADLINE> Telescope Reveals Galaxy Bulges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The millions of stars bulging out amid the  
massive spiral galaxies whirling through space are beginning to 
reveal some details of how these star groups formed, NASA reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bulges of the more tightly wound spiral galaxies  
formed early in the life of the universe, according to a team led 
by Reynier Peletier of the University of Nottingham in England. 
</P>
<P>
	A second team, led by C. Marcella Carollo of Columbia University  
in New York, concluded that galaxies with small bulges and long 
bars or lines of stars that bisect the nucleus grew more recently 
and through different processes. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers say the central bulge stabilizes a galaxy's  
development and largely controls the ebb and flow of star birth in 
the core. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hubble telescope allows astronomers, who had previously been  
able to study only the bulge at the center of our own galaxy, to 
peer deep inside the bulges of other galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
	Carollo's team said the central bulge in the galaxies they  
studied probably formed early in the history of the universe, but 
was later fed by gas flowing into the galaxy's core, caused by 
instability in the surrounding disk of stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The gas fueled the birth of new stars, and the bulge grew, with  
bright star clusters populating the center. They found both young 
and old stars in the bulge. 
</P>
<P>
	Peletier's researchers studied the center of 20 spiral galaxies  
that have large bulges. They concluded that elliptical bulges of 
stars formed over a relatively brief period very early in the young 
universe, either through the collapse of a single cloud of hydrogen 
or the merger of primeval star clusters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bulges of early spiral galaxies are old, and at least the  
outer parts of their disks are considerably younger,'' Peletier 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups used Hubble telescope to study more than 200  
neighboring galaxies, out to a distance of 100 million light years. 
A light year is the distance light travels in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Using visible light and infrared cameras, they were able to  
determine the stars' true colors. Older stars tend to be redder, 
but space dust can interfere with color perception from Earth. The 
Hubble space telescope permitted the researchers to look past that 
dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Peletier's report is scheduled for publication in Monthly  
Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and Carollo's work will 
appear in Astrophysical Journal.

<HEADLINE> Agassi To Play in Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- After vowing never again to play in  
the Davis Cup, world No. 1 Andre Agassi has changed his mind, 
saying today he would represent the United States in their first 
round match in February. 
</P>
<P>
	With Pete Sampras still injured and uncertain to be available,  
Agassi will anchor U.S. hopes to win the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Agassi said he would never again participate in Davis  
Cup competition after friend and team doctor George Fareed was 
dropped from the squad. 
</P>
<P>
	But he apparently had a change of heart after John McEnroe was  
appointed coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be the best captain ever so far,''  
Agassi said at the Swiss Indoors. ``I think he'll help a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll bring a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of energy, a  
lot of experience. I think it's an advantage to have someone on 
your team with this kind of fighting spirit.''

<HEADLINE> New Ads Highlight Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three environmental groups began an $8  
million, six-week TV and newspaper advertising campaign Wednesday 
to try to ``jump start'' public discussions about global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads represent the largest commitment of money on a single  
issue in such a short time period by any environmental coalition, 
said Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Physicians  
for Social Responsibility said they planned to spend another $3 
million for a longer-range ``grassroots'' campaign on climate 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-second ads, to run in about 200 cities in prime time, say  
signs of a warming earth are already evident and there is a need 
for action to address the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to start fixing global warming now,'' conclude two  
of the spots. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nearly two years since the Clinton administration helped  
negotiate the climate accord in Kyoto, Japan, ``there's been little 
forward progress'' in reducing the heat-trapping gases many 
scientists believe will cause the earth's climate to change, Clapp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Global warming already ``is a clear and present danger to  
Americans,'' he said in an interview, complaining that the Clinton 
administration has not given it a high enough profile and the 
public hasn't focused on it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Glenn Kelly, executive director of the Global Climate  
Coalition, an advocacy group that opposed the Kyoto climate accord, 
said the ads will ``only further confuse the public on what is a 
very serious issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many scientists believe the atmospheric buildup of heat-trapping  
gases, especially carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, 
will cause a warming of the earth and significant climate change 
over the next 50 to 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kyoto accord would require industrial nations to reduce  
their release of these so-called ``greenhouse'' emissions by 2012 
to below what they were in 1990. U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have 
increased by about 11 percent since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	While President Clinton signed the Kyoto agreement, he has not  
sought its ratification because of widespread opposition in the 
Senate. Critics say it will cost too much to implement while 
developing countries will be allowed to let greenhouse emissions 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental groups contend the problem must be addressed  
and the public should be made aware of the potential consequences 
of inaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact of global warming is likely to be quite severe,''  
said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. He and other 
environmentalists argue the technology exists to curtail energy use 
and cut carbon emissions without economic disruption.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Curfew Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. military lifted a four-year curfew today  
that barred service members from the center of the city of Okinawa, 
a ban imposed to curtail fights and drunken rowdiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The curfew imposed in October 1995 came a month after three  
servicemen raped an Okinawan schoolgirl on another part of that 
southern island. 
</P>
<P>
	The rape, for which the men were convicted, raised an uproar  
among residents of the island, 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. curfew was meant to curb the rise in  
violent misconduct by service members, mostly Marines, near Kadena 
Air Base and was unrelated to the rape, Marines spokeswoman Capt. 
Tanya Murnock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The curfew was lifted as of 1 a.m. today because service  
members' behavior had improved, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Misbehaving American service members have periodically soured  
relations between U.S. forces and local communities here. There are 
47,000 members of the U.S. military stationed in Japan under a 
mutual security treaty.

<HEADLINE> Carter Presses for Hearst Pardon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former President Carter, who commuted Patty  
Hearst's prison sentence two decades ago, is urging President 
Clinton to pardon the newspaper heiress. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been a model citizen in every way,'' Carter told the Los  
Angeles Times in a story published today. ``The fact is she 
deserves the pardon. Her oldest daughter has just entered college. 
And all this time, Patty has not been able to vote, she's not been 
a full-fledged American citizen. And I think she's one special 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Carter has had several discussions with Clinton,  
Vice President Al Gore and Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst Shaw, who now uses her married name, was kidnapped by the  
radical Symbionese Liberation Army on Feb. 4, 1974, when she was a 
19-year-old college student. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father, William Randolph Hearst Jr., publisher of the San  
Francisco Examiner, made numerous attempts to pay ransom for her 
return. But Hearst Shaw ultimately joined her abductors, assuming 
the name Tania and denouncing her wealthy parents. Two months after 
the kidnapping, she was photographed carrying a carbine during a 
SLA holdup of a San Francisco bank. 
</P>
<P>
	She was captured by the FBI in 1976 and sentenced to seven years  
in prison for her part in the robbery. She had served 21 months 
when Carter commuted her sentence in January 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst Shaw, now 45, married her former bodyguard, Bernard Shaw,  
and they live in Connecticut with their daughters, Lydia, 14, and 
Gillian, 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Since her release from prison, she has become a celebrity,  
appearing in John Waters two movies and several television sitcoms, 
writing novels and doing charitable work. 
</P>
<P>
	She declined comment on Carter's efforts.  
</P>
<P>
	``She wants to express her gratitude for President Carter's  
confidence in her,'' her attorney, George Martinez, said. ``She is 
quite moved by his support. He has been her refuge in a sea of 
misunderstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter's spokeswoman, Carrie Harmon, today confirmed the Times  
story, but said Carter had no additional comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that President Carter has felt strongly  
about for a long time and communicated with the Bush administration 
about as well,'' Ms. Harmon said.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Ticket Scandal Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A speeding ticket given to the  
governor's chief of staff was dismissed without ever making it to a 
judge, the latest revelation in a scandal that has cost the top 
state trooper his job and placed three top aides on suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Hamrick's ticket from Autauga County was dismissed just  
after the 1998 election in which his boss, Don Siegelman, defeated 
Gov. Fob James. 
</P>
<P>
	The court clerk who dropped the $128 ticket against Hamrick said  
doing favors on traffic tickets is commonplace. ``There's no big 
deal about it,'' Fred Posey said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor Saturday suspended three other aides in his office  
as part of the widening scandal that also prompted the resignation 
Friday of Public Safety Director Mike Sullivan, head of the state 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents show the three Siegelman aides contacted the public  
safety director's office about the traffic tickets. The aides have 
not commented. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman has ordered every constitutional officer, state  
agency, commission and board to investigate any cases in their 
offices of ``interfering'' with traffic tickets, which can be 
prosecuted as a misdemeanor offense. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Seth Hammett and Senate President Pro Tem Lowell  
Barronhave said they would await the outcome of Siegelman's 
investigation before doing anything. 
</P>
<P>
	A University of Alabama assistant football coach and an  
athletics department official have acknowledged using their 
influence to get traffic tickets dismissed, The Birmingham News 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to lie about it,'' linebackers coach Jeff Rouzie  
told the News. ``It's like paying taxes -- you don't want to pay any 
more than you have to. It's been going on here since the 1970s, and 
probably at every other place you can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rouzie and the university's associate athletic director, Mal  
Moore, said Sullivan had helped them with traffic tickets from 1992 
to this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's NCAA compliance officer on Tuesday questioned  
team members whose tickets over the last several years had been 
dropped in Alabama courts. Player involvement could constitute a 
violation under a section prohibiting players from receiving extra 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Posey said he could not recall agreeing to ``nol pross,'' or  
drop, the ticket that Trooper Tim Pullin gave Hamrick on Sept. 27, 
1998, because ``we have nol prosses all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ticket was issued after the trooper stopped Hamrick's BMW Z3  
roadster and charged him with traveling 78 mph in a 55-mph zone. 
The ticket was dismissed on Nov. 19, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no evidence this is improper,'' said Carrie Kurlander,  
the governor's press secretary. ``This ticket is not evidence of 
anything improper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Posey, who has been circuit court clerk in Autauga County for  
more than 50 years, said he frequently throws out tickets. ``That's 
the system and that's the way it has always been,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Posey said the ``media has gone crazy'' since The Associated  
Press asked the governor last week about documents that show favors 
with traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Autauga County District Judge Phillip Wood, whose office is  
across the hall from Posey at the Prattville courthouse, said his 
office has never dropped a ticket as a favor. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``I get a lot of requests from folks.''

<HEADLINE> Mass Transit To Get First Y2K Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transportation officials are uneasy about the  
readiness of mass transit systems for the year 2000, because huge 
New Year's Eve celebrations will send thousands of revelers toward 
public transportation just minutes after computers make the date 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	If a Y2K bug paralyzes subway nervous systems or the electrical  
supply that runs trains in cities such as Boston, New York and 
Washington, operators will have virtually no time to make repairs 
or warn incoming riders. 
</P>
<P>
	French officials will stop all trains and subway cars in France  
between 11:55 p.m. and 12:15 a.m. to ``respond to the anxiety'' of 
passengers, said a statement issued Monday by SNCF, the national 
train company. 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. operators, such as the Chicago Transit Authority, will  
conduct similar pauses. Federal officials think it's a prudent 
step. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than take any risk, they feel five minutes out of their  
schedule, with each train stopping in the station, would be a 
useful precaution,'' Mortimer Downey, deputy transportation 
secretary, said last week at a congressional hearing about the 
readiness of transportation systems for millennium change. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Year 2000 problem poses a special problem for mass  
transit because it will strike at the intersection of two 
unavoidable realities: the test of Y2K computer fixes at precisely 
the moment some transportation systems will be taxed by 
larger-than-usual crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	Some older computers were programmed to recognize dates in  
two-digit format, so the question emerges what will happen when 
1999 -- recognized by those computers as simply ``99'' -- changes to 
2000. Computers may malfunction and think the clock has been set 
back to 1900 instead of forward to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	At that moment, New Year's Eve parties will be reaching their  
climax. Crowds urged to use public transportation as a way to avoid 
traffic will head for the nearest bus, subway station or railroad 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington officials expect up to 800,000 riders that night on  
their Metro subway system, many of them attracted to the Lincoln 
Memorial for a millennium party hosted by entertainer Will Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston is expecting 2 million for its First Night celebration,  
an increase of 500,000 people from a normal year, while Times 
Square in New York is expected to be a mecca for millennium buffs. 
</P>
<P>
	A Federal Transit Administration survey found that of 550  
federally funded operators -- including bus, subway and commuter 
rail providers -- all but four said they are either Y2K compliant or 
have contingency plans. The remaining four, all in Puerto Rico, 
either did not respond or responded incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
	Major subway operators insist they and their equipment suppliers  
have done all the tests they can do. Privately, some say they're 
not sure about the reliability of their electricity suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have a number of technical people available. However,  
we've been assured by our contractors and subcontractors that they 
have met all the challenges to ensure a smooth transition,'' said 
Tom Kelly, spokesman for New York's Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came through the 9-9-99 with no problem, and people said  
that might be an issue,'' said Cheryl Johnson, a Washington Metro 
spokeswoman. Analysts had feared that Sept. 9, with its lineup of 
9's, would seize computer brains. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak and commuter railroads also insist their trains are  
ready, but many have their own Achilles heel: they operate on 
tracks owned by freight railroads. The four largest freight lines 
in the country -- Burlington Northern Santa Fe, CSX, Norfolk 
Southern and Union Pacific -- won't report their Y2K readiness until 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Rail experts say the public should not worry, since older subway  
cars and many locomotives are not computerized. Equipment such as 
grade crossing signals is tripped not by time and date information 
but by mechanical switches thrown by an approaching train. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet last month, Washingtonians got a hint of their subway's  
vulnerability. For the first time in 20 years, a computer that 
monitors every train in the Metro system froze just before the 
start of the morning rush hour. It caused delays of up to 50 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro officials said the problem was not Y2K-related.

<HEADLINE> Global Warming Fight May Cost Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Fighting global warming could cost the United States and other  
industrialized nations much less money than most analysts have 
predicted, researchers reported today in the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are supposed to be  
reduced under an international agreement called the Kyoto Protocol. 
The cost has been widely debated and many nations have not ratified 
the protocol, with critics fearing it may be too expensive or 
disputing the causes of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies of the cost have focused almost exclusively on  
reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the cost of complying may be up to 60 percent less than  
previously estimated when efforts are made to reduce all six types 
of gases covered by Kyoto, according to the new analysis by John 
Reilly and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Reilly calculated the cost of meeting the Kyoto requirements in  
two ways: by reducing only carbon dioxide and by cutting all six 
kinds of greenhouse gases in the least costly manner. 
</P>
<P>
	He found that the United States would have to spend $68 million  
a year if the country focused solely on carbon dioxide vs. $42 
million a year using the alternative approach. The costs were 
calculated using 1995 dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the lower figure is too high, said Daniel Lashof, a global  
warming expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council who did 
not participate in the study. The analysis does not anticipate 
future developments in pollution control technology or big 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that could be achieved 
rather cheaply overseas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Glenn Kelly, executive director of the Global Climate  
Coalition, a business group, said the technology does not exist yet 
for the study results to be applied. ``We're looking at economic 
theories and it is overly optimistic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are serious questions about our ability to measure these  
gases, not just carbon dioxide,'' Kelly said.

as it did in past years, the magazine's editors picked a winner and 
a few runners-up. Then they built into their Web site 
(www.money.com) an interactive method of entering your own 
criteria. The site measures your needs against what those 300 metro 
areas offer and gives you an in-order list of cities to love. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we didn't rank the 300 cities? We felt people would  
be better served by picking a city best suited to them,'' said 
Patti Strauss, Money's public relations director. ``The Web has 
been a part of the story for a couple of years. On the Web site, 
you can rank the criteria that are most important to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what put San Francisco -- and Rochester, Minn., in the  
small-city category -- in first place? 
</P>
<P>
	``San Francisco has wonderful things to offer,'' Strauss said.  
``We know housing is very expensive, there's the threat of 
earthquakes -- but basically you have so many things we feel far 
outweigh that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine says the city and environs rank in the top 5  
percent for air quality, offers first-rate museums, sports, and 
more restaurants per resident than any other city in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, it's the city's wide range of recreational  
opportunities -- great places to swim, sail, hike and ski are easy 
to reach -- that clinched it,'' Money said. 
</P>
<P>
	But those things aren't important to everyone. Money's  
searchable Web database lets you find your ideal in two ways -- a 
short form and a lengthy search form that asks detailed questions 
on a wide variety of items. 
</P>
<P>
	You get 15 questions on weather, including your ideal  
temperature, rainfall, snowfall and altitude above sea level. There 
are five questions on economic factors, five more on housing and 
health, two on crime and 13 on leisure activities, among other 
criteria. 
</P>
<P>
	After you file in all the blanks, the database will find the  
cities among the 300 that best meet your needs. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't hard to find officials to applaud Money's choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``Money Magazine confirms what we San Franciscans have known all  
along,'' Mayor Willie Brown crowed Wednesday. ``This is the best 
city in America for one reason -- its people. This is the greatest 
collection of people ever found in any one city. I know that after 
40 years. They're compassionate, progressive and adventurous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Money did point out the city's flaws -- the threat of  
earthquakes, a high student-to-teacher ratio and ``the 
extraordinary cost of living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not surprising to me that Money has selected San  
Francisco, but it's also ironic, because San Francisco increasingly 
is becoming a better and better place to live for people who have 
money,'' said Gabriel Roth, city editor of The San Francisco Bay 
Guardian, an alternative weekly that's highly critical of how the 
city is run. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth sees a city in which officials consciously cater to new  
residents ``earning six figures.''

<HEADLINE> Many Olympic Events Sold Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Knight, minister of the Sydney Olympics,  
opened the box marked fragile with appropriate care. 
</P>
<P>
	``This,'' he said, ``is the torch.''  
</P>
<P>
	In 11 months, it will be ignited, the symbolic start of the 2000  
Games. And take it from Knight. Sydney will be ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting close,'' he said. ``It's getting to the nervous  
part. People keep saying, `You're all set.' That's what makes me 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want people paralyzed by fear, but I don't want people  
complacent, either. Call it constructive anxiety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, so good for the Australian organizers. About the only  
problem they've experienced is a shortfall in predicted sponsorship 
income. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably raised the bar too high,'' he said. ``We've got  
$800 million in sponsorship. That's staggering for a country of 100 
million people. The tendency was to keep revising the target 
upward, beyond what was achievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining sponsorship income will fall short of the budgeted  
$140 million, but exceed $50 million. And that's fine with Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been prudent,'' he said. ``If we were to err, we wanted  
to err on the conservative side. If your thinking is overly 
optimistic, you'd better not count on spending it. That's what we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the sponsorship shortfall was fallout from the IOC  
bribery scandal. Knight said that at the height of that affair, 
Sydney wrote off $50 million in sponsorship targeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no point in knocking on doors,'' he said. ``We made  
cuts to balance. We've turned the corner on that. The IOC went 
through a serious reform process. It was not a revolution, but it's 
taken a lot of the sting and heat out. The focus is returning where 
it belongs -- on the athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In every other area, the Organizing Committee is flourishing.  
All the major venues are complete and some have already been used 
for major events as a test for the Olympics. The same is true for a 
vast transportation system put in place after Sydney officials saw 
some of the troubles experienced by Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, Knight's biggest problem is how to satisfy a huge  
demand for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are oversubscribed,'' Knight said. ``We budgeted $220  
million from the domestic market. We have up-front orders for $340 
million. We can't satisfy all that. We had more people sending 
money in one year out than Atlanta did. It's tremendously 
gratifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So some people who planned on seeing the swimming finals might  
be going to a preliminary round instead. And others planning on 
watching the 100-meter dash in track and field might see a relay 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The finals of most things are gone,'' Knight said. ``In some  
sports, you can't even buy tickets to heats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney organizers were criticized by the IOC for making  
ticket prices too high. What they did was make high-end tickets 
more expensive in an effort to subsidize low-end tickets. So those 
shut out of $1,382 Opening Ceremony tickets might consider the 
10,000 seats priced at a more economical $105. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how poor, you can get to an Olympic event,'' Knight  
said. ``There are 1 1/2 million tickets between $10 and $19. They are 
subsidized by the dearer tickets. There's a balance.''

<HEADLINE> DJ Cloaks Race in His Voice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The bumpin' in the background from a Tupac Shakur  
song is Chris Clark's cue. He puts on his headphones, and his head 
starts bobbing to the beat of the gangsta rap. 
</P>
<P>
	He pulls up the microphone and waits for the host of the Hot  
97.5 morning show on WHTA-FM to ask: ``What's up, Crash D?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ooooh, lookout south side,'' Clark howls, ``traffic's backed  
up ALLLLL the way to my mama's house in Miami -- 75, 85, 400 from 
the north, still tight 'til you get inside the perimeter. Good news 
tho' -- the Connector northbound, that wreck in front of the Ted, 
SEE YA, is outta the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To most listeners of the urban station in this city of  
perpetually jammed traffic, Clark's slang-filled traffic reports 
fit perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
	What some may not realize is that Clark is white. As soon as  
he's off the air, the homeboy mannerisms disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	With a push of a button and he's back on the air for another  
15-second spot, this time as Crash Clark on 99X, WNNX-FM, where 
Nine Inch Nails and Stone Temple Pilots are among the preferred 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy-five southbound at Highway 5, a cement mixer is off to  
the right. Things are pretty heavy in the area. Get it? Cement 
mixer, heavy? Ha ha ha! I slay me,'' Clark bellows, sounding like a 
preppy Ivy Leaguer. ``You've got new trouble in Cobb County, 
Chastain near 75, two separate wrecks, one in each direction -- go 
figure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disc jockeys have juiced up their on-air personas for decades,  
and many are careful to preserve their identities. For example, it 
wasn't until Wolfman Jack played himself in the 1973 movie 
``American Graffiti'' that America saw the face and the black beard 
with a white stripe that went with the well-known voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Many early listeners mistakenly assumed he was black.  
</P>
<P>
	``It took the Wolfman from a cult figure to the rank of American  
flag and apple pie,'' the late DJ once said of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, 33, isn't at that level. He began his stint with WHTA  
four years ago during Freaknik, an annual gathering of black 
college students that can clog downtown streets for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But his straight-laced persona -- which he uses on an all-sports  
station, Christian radio and a public access station -- didn't quite 
fit in with the hip-hop disc jockeys at WHTA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys at Hot 97 were like `Oh, no. We've got to convert you  
into a brotha' and they started teaching me some of the little 
phrases and words. They changed Crash Clark to Crash Daddy, then 
shortened that to Crash D,'' Clark said. ``I went with it. I 
figured all my years of growing up in Miami are finally paying off. 
Hangin' out with da' boyz in the 'hood I'm all good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark says the Crash D role has nothing to do with race but is  
just an attempt to appeal to an urban market and fit in with the 
radio station's DJs. And the feedback from rush-hour drivers thus 
far has been mostly positive. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all are impressed or amused.  
</P>
<P>
	Lolita Compton, a 41-year-old administrative assistant from  
suburban Austell, said she thinks Clark's character is insulting to 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand the necessity. I just need to hear the  
traffic report,'' she said. ``It doesn't make me listen more 
because he speaks with an ethnic flair. It's as if (black) people 
on the south side can only understand that kind of lingo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But WHTA morning show host Ryan Cameron, whose listeners are  
mostly blacks age 18 to 35, said Clark's character has been a huge 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our show is very quick, very fast paced and he has a great  
wit,'' Cameron said. ``That's more of the appeal than anything. He 
does a hipper traffic report. When he's not here the other people 
are just so deadpan that people can't stand it. I can't stand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Listeners like Michael Rookard, 33, of Douglasville suspected  
Clark was white. Now that he knows, Rookard said he finds Clark's 
attempt at speaking slang humorous. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me at all,'' he said. ``I just need to know  
is traffic real heavy, do I need to take an alternate route. I'm 
just looking for information.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Spent $13M on Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department's landmark antitrust  
trial and earlier legal actions against the Microsoft Corp. have 
cost $13.3 million over the past decade, the department said 
Wednesday in its first public accounting. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure includes about $7 million investigating and suing  
Microsoft in the trial pending before U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson, described as among the most significant business 
lawsuits in decades. The first phase of a two-part verdict could 
come this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts described the $7 million as paltry compared with the  
expense of other major antitrust cases, where costs easily can run 
$750,000 each month. Justice opened the current case in June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's really rather modest for a case that has been as hard  
fought as this one has, with the caliber of lawyers and economists 
they've put on,'' said Tyler Baker, a Dallas antitrust lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc., for example, spent $20  
million over 10 months unsuccessfully fighting antitrust enforcers 
to allow its merger in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department last year asked Jackson to force  
Microsoft to reimburse its legal costs, but the agency typically 
doesn't request attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they succeed on the merits ... it wouldn't be uncommon for  
the judge to order Microsoft to reimburse the costs,'' said Joe 
Sims, a Washington antitrust lawyer and former senior Justice 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency acknowledged it has paid outside experts for advice  
on how to punish Microsoft if the company lost the case, but 
refused to identify them or their pay. It included the pay among 
$2.2 million spent in the current trial on such experts. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also revealed it has spent $194,140 for public  
relations, including $147,381 for publishing court documents and 
other information about the case on its Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	The government disclosures came in response to a written demand  
from Sen. Slade Gorton, a Republican from Microsoft's home state of 
Washington. The figures did not include money spent by the 19 
states suing the company along with Justice; attorneys general in 
those states have denied requests for such information. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, the world's largest software company with $19.7  
billion in sales this year, hasn't disclosed its own legal fees. It 
declined comment Wednesday. But the company's financial records 
showed ``general and administrative expenses,'' including lawyers' 
fees, of $689 million for this business year, ended June 30. That's 
up 59 percent from last year's $433 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is also involved in high-profile litigation against  
Sun Microsystems Inc. in California and against Caldera Inc. in 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	In the federal antitrust case, Microsoft is using both in-house  
lawyers and attorneys from New York-based Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell. In 
financial papers, Microsoft blamed its increases in administrative 
expenses partly on ``higher legal fees, litigation costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fees for Justice attorneys are significantly lower. Lead  
lawyer David Boies, hired from private practice, initially agreed 
to half his $250 hourly rate, then agreed to a $104,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure (the government's bill) is a small fraction of what  
Microsoft paid its lawyers in that period,'' said Kevin Arquit, a 
New York antitrust lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims agreed: ``If you're defending the antitrust equivalent of a  
capital murder case, you're not likely to be pinching pennies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Zuck, director of the Association for Competitive  
Technology, a trade group that includes Microsoft, said the 
government's spending bodes ill for the nation's high-tech 
industry: ``If ... it's this cheap to do it, we could be awash in 
lawsuits and really grind the industry to a halt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government opposed Microsoft's merger with Intuit Inc. early  
in the 1990s and negotiated a consent decree with the software 
giant in a related antitrust lawsuit in 1995.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Bill To Protect Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Giving child protective services and welfare  
workers greater access to some court records would make it easier 
to determine whether children are safe in their homes, House 
members say. 
</P>
<P>
	House members voted 425-2 Tuesday to provide more access to  
criminal conviction information and protection orders based on 
child or domestic abuse. Republican Reps. Helen Chenoweth-Hage of 
Idaho and Ron Paul of Texas voted against the bill. The Senate has 
not yet acted on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Money for the change would come from federal grants to provide  
equipment and training for closed-circuit television and 
videotaping of children in criminal child-abuse cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children should be focused on school, Little League, piano  
lessons -- not reeling from punches or cowering from adults,'' Rep. 
Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, sponsor of the legislation, said during 
debate on the House floor. ``As a former prosecutor and judge, I 
have seen firsthand the manifestation of child abuse in the 
criminal behavior of adults,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would increase the amount of federal money set  
aside for child abuse and domestic assistance programs in the 
federal Crime Victims Fund from $10 million to as much as $20 
million. The fund is drawn from forfeited assets, forfeited bail 
bonds and fines paid to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would expand the permitted uses for federal  
crime-fighting and anti-drug grants to include enforcing 
child-abuse and neglect laws and funding programs designed to 
prevent child abuse and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect reports that  
2,000 children die each year as a result of abuse or neglect. 
</P>
<P>
	------

<HEADLINE> Settlement Over Saipan Sweatshops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Five clothing retailers including Ralph  
Lauren and Donna Karan on Wednesday agreed to settle a class-action 
lawsuit over poor working conditions at sweatshops in the U.S. 
territory of Saipan. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies join four other retailers that have already agreed  
to pay for independent monitoring of Saipan's garment industry in 
an effort to comply with American labor laws and international 
human rights treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	Litigation is pending against factories in Saipan and several  
other U.S. companies including The Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and 
Wal-Mart, said Al Meyerhoff, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nine of the nation's premier fashion houses have agreed to do  
the right thing in Saipan,'' Meyerhoff said. ``The other retailers 
have some explaining to do why they don't agree to this plan to 
clean up intolerable factories in Saipan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement requires the approval of a federal judge.  
</P>
<P>
	The companies agreeing to the terms on Wednesday were Ralph  
Lauren, Phillips-Van Heusen, Bryland L.P., Donna Karan 
International and The Dress Barn Inc. The retailers who agreed to 
the settlement in June were Nordstrom Inc., J. Crew Group Inc., 
Cutter &AMP; Buck Inc. and Gymboree Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder ruled  
that the case would be transferred to Honolulu. Some defense 
lawyers had argued the case should be heard in Saipan, while 
Meyerhoff countered that an impartial jury would be difficult to 
find there. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement calls for retailers to establish a fund to  
finance the independent monitoring program, provide money to the 
workers, create a public education campaign and pay attorneys' 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers will be protected from what Meyerhoff described as  
indentured servitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Young women are often recruited from China, the Philippines,  
Bangladesh and Thailand with promises of good wages and agree to be 
brought to Saipan for a fee, sometimes as high as $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The women then agree to pay off that fee with their wages, he  
said. The settlement requires factory owners to ensure that 
employees have not paid a recruitment fee and to pay the fee if 
workers have been brought to them through recruitment fees. 
</P>
<P>
	About 14,000 sweatshop workers, mostly young women, are  
currently on the island, but the class-action lawsuit represents 
about 50,000 women, including past workers, Meyerhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Representative of the five companies agreeing to the settlement  
Wednesday did not return phone messages after business hours or 
were unreachable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Saipan is a 13-mile-long Western Pacific island in the Northern  
Marianas. Labor activists claim that 32 Saipan factories -- mostly 
owned by Chinese, Japanese and Korean subcontractors -- stamp 
clothing with ``Made in the USA'' tags, which makes consumers 
believe the items were made in compliance with U.S. labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northern Marianas, seized from Japan in World War II,  
negotiated a commonwealth relationship with Washington that left 
control of immigration and minimum wages in local hands. It also 
exempted Saipan's exports from U.S. duties and quotas that limit 
imports.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stocks closed mixed on Wednesday, with  
Tokyo, the largest market in the region, boosted by hopes of a 
bigger economic stimulus package. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 112.27  
points, or 0.63 percent, to 17,896.42. The average closed up 20.44 
points, or 0.12 percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about the Japanese government's economy-boosting  
package helped lift prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi reshuffled his Cabinet on  
Tuesday and kicked off a three-party coalition government, 
retaining economic ministers who have played a key role in bringing 
the battered Japanese economy to the verge of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Shizuka Kamei, the policy chief of the ruling party, said he  
expects the government's new stimulus package to include 13 
trillion yen (U.S. $121 billion) in total spending. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar bought 107.36 yen late  
Wednesday, up 0.76 yen from its level of 106.60 yen late Tuesday in 
Tokyo and also above its level of 106.41 yen overnight in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares gave up big early gains and finished only  
slightly higher as traders found little substance in the annual 
policy address by Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Tung 
Chee-hwa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index closed up 19.09 points, or 0.1 percent, at  
13,017.98. Blue chips had been up by 1.5 percent earlier, following 
Tuesday's gain of 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders had been speculating that Tung might introduce measures  
to boost property sales, but they found little new in his speech so 
they began selling shares -- particularly property companies -- late 
in the session as Tung continued speaking on live television. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean share prices soared, with the key index  
skyrocketing 5.5 percent on aggressive buying by foreigners amid 
falling concerns over tax probes into the major conglomerates known 
as chaebol. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index gained 43.76 points, to  
835.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Jitters eased after Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman  
Lee Hun-jai said there will be no new probes into allegations of 
stock price manipulation and tax evasion at Hyundai Group. Rumors 
of a new investigation pushed the market down by 3.3 percent 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai shares closed down on selling by foreign  
institutions. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index lost 3.85 
points, or 1.0 percent, to end at 395.09. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares ended sharply higher on expectations  
of a compromise between major political forces in the special 
electoral assembly. The Composite Index finished up 22.498 points, 
or 4 percent, at 588.749 points. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares finished higher, but relinquished  
most of their early gains. The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock 
Exchange Composite Index rose 0.6 percent, or 3.96 points, to close 
at 714.19. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Prisoner Escaped in Vat of Hog Slop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A convicted killer crawled into a  
500-gallon barrel of hog slop in a prison kitchen and escaped while 
the mush of table scraps was being towed to a prison farm, 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth D. Williams was back behind bars Wednesday and is the  
prime suspect in two deaths that occurred during the day and a half 
he was on the run. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old convict escaped Sunday morning when the table  
scraps were being moved, Corrections Department spokeswoman Dina 
Tyler said. The tank didn't have a grate then. It does now. 
</P>
<P>
	Knee prints found in a ditch on the prison farm indicated  
someone was trying to keep from being seen, Tyler said. ``By 
cutting across the field and following the tree line you can get to 
the highway without being noticed that much,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four miles from the prison, farmer Cecil Boren, 57, was shot to  
death and robbed Sunday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was driving Boren's truck and had several of the man's  
guns when he rammed a water truck in southwestern Missouri on 
Monday, officials said. The driver, Michael Greenwood, 24, of 
Springfield, Mo., was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was captured shortly after the crash and was returned  
to Arkansas on Tuesday after waiving extradition. Charges have not 
been filed in either Boren's or Greenwood's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was sentenced to life in prison three weeks ago for the  
1998 kidnapping of two college students on their first date. The 
woman was killed and the man was injured.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nuclear Industry Spotlighted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two nuclear accidents in less than a week  
halfway around the world came as America's nuclear industry has 
been largely free of embarrassments and, in fact, has successfully 
pushed for less federal regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The question looming among industry executives and federal  
regulators is whether the incidents in Japan and South Korea will 
have an impact on a U.S. industry that many believe already is in 
its twilight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shouldn't have any impact,'' insists Steve Kerekes, a  
spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, the nuclear power 
industry trade group. ``For more than a decade now we have been 
achieving steady, consistent gains in safety and operating 
performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some industry watchdog groups say the events in Japan and  
South Korea -- though themselves very different -- sent ominous 
message and warnings about the safety of nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	``They reinforce the reality that the root cause of nuclear  
accidents is human error. It always has been and always will be,'' 
says Michael Mariotte, director of the Nuclear Information and 
Resources Service, a watchdog group often critical of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	He argues that the incidents, in which human error led to  
workers -- and in the case of Japan also the public -- being exposed 
to radiation, raises renewed questions about ``a nuclear culture 
that says we're not going to have any problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Japan incident at a nuclear fuel processing plant was by far  
the most serious. Errors by workers, who apparently fail to follow 
regulations, led to an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction at the 
plant, exposing dozens of people to radiation and forcing the 
evacuation of hundreds of others. Three workers were seriously 
injured from radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Korea, 22 workers were exposed to a small amount of  
radiation when radioactive water spilled while a pump valve was 
being repaired. The water was contained inside the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. nuclear safety officials are monitoring both incidents, but  
are most interested in the Japan ``criticality'' accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what impact it's going to have on any of the  
United States (fuel) plants. We're just going to look at what 
happened and if anything like it could happen here,'' said Mindey 
Landau, a spokeswoman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuclear experts noted that U.S. power plants are designed  
differently than the Korean plant, which is a Canadian ``Candu'' 
reactor. The incident in Japan involved apparent negligence in 
processing uranium much more highly enriched than the uranium 
processed for power reactors in U.S. fabrication plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some of the nuclear industry's critics suggest the  
Japanese case may raise questions as to whether the Japanese 
industry was adequately monitored by regulators, and to what extent 
industry should be trusted to self-regulate no matter what country 
it's in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until last week Japan and South Korea were considered nations  
with modern nuclear programs. You didn't see the U.S. nuclear 
industry looking down on these countries,'' said Mariotte. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japan and South Korea accidents came as the NRC is revamping  
the way it monitors and regulates the U.S. nuclear industry, making 
many changes that the industry for years has sought. While NRC 
officials insist that safety will not be compromised, some nuclear 
critics have voiced concern that the agency may end up relying too 
heavily on industry self-regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the change, less attention will be given to plants  
with good operating and safety record and NRC focus will be on 
specific areas of greatest risk to plant safety. The new system is 
being tested in a pilot program at nine power plants and may be 
expanded to all plants perhaps as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
	NRC and industry officials say the incidents in Japan and South  
Korea should not have any impact on the NRC's adoption of the 
planned regulatory changes. To equate the two, says Kerekes, the 
industry spokesman, ``is to compare apples and oranges.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Appoints New Campaign Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, who continues to  
reshuffle his struggling presidential campaign, has selected Donna 
Brazile to be his new campaign manager, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile replaces Craig Smith, a longtime aide to President  
Clinton who did not want to move to Tennessee with the campaign. 
Smith will head Gore's transition to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile's appointment was to be announced by Gore today at a  
ribbon-cutting ceremony at his new Nashville, Tenn., headquarters, 
said two campaign officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile is one of the Democratic Party's most experienced  
grass-roots organizers. The appointment of Brazile, who is black, 
helps diversify Gore's inner circle, which has been criticized for 
being top heavy with white males. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile, who is in her early 40s, is former chief of staff and  
political adviser to Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington, D.C.'s 
delegate to the House. She is an adjunct political science 
professor at the University of Maryland, a member of Democratic 
National Committee and longtime associate of the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile designed voter-campaign assessment program for the  
Democratic House campaign committee, which helped increase minority 
voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Orleans native, she holds an undergraduate degree from  
Louisiana State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile resigned as deputy national field director for Michael  
Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign after making comments 
about the personal life of his Republican opponent, then-Vice 
President George Bush. Bush is the father of George W. Bush, the 
GOP front-runner in the 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, and media adviser, Carter  
Eskew, retained their jobs in the transition to Tennessee. Gore 
ordered the move to shake up his campaign after rival Bill Bradley 
of New Jersey caught him in polls and money-raising. He replaced 
his pollster, Mark Penn, and plans to thin out his campaign staff.

<HEADLINE> Parents Plead Innocent on Infant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A couple accused of lying to investigators  
about the disappearance of their 5-month-old daughter pleaded 
innocent today in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve and Marlene Aisenberg are charged with conspiracy and  
lying about the Nov. 24, 1997, disappearance of daughter Sabrina. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark A. Pizzo set a tentative trial date  
sometime in December and an Oct. 15 hearing on a potential conflict 
of interest for one lawyer to represent both husband and wife. ``I 
strongly encourage you to get separate counsel,'' Pizzo told the 
Aisenbergs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aisenbergs were arrested Sept. 9 at their new home in  
Bethesda, Md. They moved to Maryland last spring from Brandon, a 
suburb 15 miles south of Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	In an indictment last month, investigators said they had taped  
conversations between the parents discussing Sabrina after her 
disappearance. Mrs. Aisenberg stated the baby was dead and she 
blamed her husband, according to the charges. The couple also 
allegedly talked about what to tell authorities and about faking a 
kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	No body has been found and investigators said they still don't  
know where the child is or what happened to her. 
</P>
<P>
	While the case remains a missing-person investigation,  
authorities say they fear the baby is dead, though the Aisenbergs 
have not been charged with murder or kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Aisenberg, 36, is charged in five counts; Mrs. Aisenberg, also  
36, is charged in six counts. If convicted he would face a maximum 
of 25 years in prison and a $1.25 million fine and she would face 
up to 30 years in prison and a $1.5 million fine.

<HEADLINE> Mets Try for 2-0 Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The New York Mets sent left-hander Kenny Rogers  
to the mound Wednesday night to try to take a 2-0 lead in their NL 
divisional series with the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks, an 8-4 loser in Tuesday night's opener,  
countered with Todd Stottlemyre, the intense right-hander who came 
back from a partially torn rotator cuff to pitch again without 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, in the postseason for the first time since 1988, were  
flying high after a 5-0 wild-card playoff victory at Cincinnati 
Monday night, then an 8-4 victory over Randy Johnson and the 
Diamondbacks on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Edgardo Alfonzo had three home runs in the two victories. He  
homered in the first inning on Monday and Tuesday, then capped his 
performance with a grand slam off reliever Bobby Chouinard for the 
winning runs against the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a week ago, New York was on the brink of elimination from  
any postseason possibilities after losing seven in a row. But the 
Mets caught the Reds at the finish and showed no sign of fatigue 
despite the emotional win in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was 5-1 with the Mets since being acquired from Oakland  
on July 23. New York was 10-2 in games Rogers has started. 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre (6-3) tore 70 percent of his rotator cuff in a game  
in San Francisco May 17 and was out for three months. He is 
believed to be the first pitcher to come back from such an injury 
without surgery. Instead, he underwent intense rehabilitation to 
strengthen his upper body, especially the muscles around the 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre, son of former New York pitching great and current  
Yankees' pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre, was 2-2 since his return 
on Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second consecutive late start for the series. The  
first pitch was at 11:10 p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Cable TV Chief Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leo J. Hindery Jr., who heads AT&AMP;T Corp.'s huge  
cable television operations, is leaving the company. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T announced today that Hindery, 51, was going to ``pursue  
other interests'' but would continue as a strategic adviser on 
cable issues to AT&AMP;T's chairman and chief executive C. Michael 
Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	As head of the cable division, Hindery also directed AT&AMP;T's  
developing efforts to break into the local telephone market by 
offering phone service over cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindery had been president of Tele-Communications Inc., the huge  
cable TV company acquired by AT&AMP;T in a deal announced in mid-1998 
and closed in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, AT&AMP;T has also reached a deal for another big cable  
TV company, MediaOne. That deal is expected to close early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The two cable purchases will make AT&AMP;T the largest cable TV  
system owner in the U.S. with more than 24 million subscribers as 
well as being the largest provider of long-distance phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Adele Ambrose, a spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T, said Hindery's departure  
``was a mutual decision that has evolved over several months'' and 
denied that he had been forced out. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Armstrong said AT&AMP;T's plans to roll out new  
cable services remain on target, including plans to offer phone 
service over cable lines in eight cities by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel E. Somers, senior executive vice president and chief  
financial officer of AT&AMP;T, will temporarily assume responsibility 
for AT&AMP;T's cable operations while a search begins for a permanent 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining AT&AMP;T in 1997, Somers was chairman and CEO of Bell  
Cablemedia PLC, a cable television and communications company in 
the United Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Up Late Watching Mets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- No wonder some of the Yankees looked a little  
sleepy Wednesday. They stayed up late to watch the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a good chance of doing some great things in the  
playoffs,'' Darryl Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Does that mean Subway Series?  
</P>
<P>
	``It's too early right now to think about that,'' Strawberry  
said. ``We have our work cut out and they have their work cut out. 
So far, so good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was 0-for-2 with a walk as the Yankees opened the  
postseason with an 8-0 rout of Texas on Tuesday night. Then he 
watched the Mets' 8-4 win at Arizona, a game that ended at 2:05 
a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Mets' first postseason appearance since 1988, when  
they lost Game 7 of the NL championship series 6-0 at Los Angeles. 
Strawberry was 0-for-4 in that one, a game that seemed like a very 
long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've accomplished a lot; they've accomplished a lot,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte, the Yankees' Game 2 starter, turned on a TV when  
he got home and saw Edgardo Alfonzo's tiebreaking grand slam in the 
ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so tired, I couldn't hold my eyes open,'' Pettitte said.  
``As soon as he hit the home run, I turned the TV off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He, too, didn't want to think about a Subway Series just yet.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have a great team. I think they have a great shot at  
getting to the World Series,'' Pettitte said. ``We have two teams 
to worry about before we get to the World Series. That's a little 
down the road right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees general manager Brian Cashman decided against tuning in.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was listening to them on the radio driving home last  
night,'' he said. ``I planned on watching it, until I got home last 
night and I saw my daughter, Grace, in bed with my wife. I couldn't 
turn on the TV, so I had to wait until this morning to find out 
about Alfonzo's grand slam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman admitted Subway Series thoughts run through his mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a scary team,'' he said. ``I'm sure those National League  
opponents they're going to have to go through, they're not 
comfortable facing them.''

<HEADLINE> Schools Giving Depression Surveys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- There are no right or wrong answers for this test.  
No studying required. Students don't have to give their names. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, however, could have serious implications.  
</P>
<P>
	In all, 1,100 Holliston High School students are scheduled to  
take a depression survey Thursday, joining a a growing number of 
schools participating in National Depression Screening Day. 
Organizers hope the surveys will lead to help for the 5 percent to 
8 percent of high school students estimated to be clinically 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 500,000 and 800,000 American teen-agers experience  
clinical depression each year, said Dr. Douglas Jacobs, who founded 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Depression is a difficult diagnosis to make among teen-agers  
because the symptoms -- irritability, low self-esteem and poor 
performance -- ``get confused with the angst of being a teen-ager,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the screenings won't automatically pinpoint which students  
may need help. Because the questionnaires are anonymous, the 
impetus falls on the student to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is we're going to have an inventory come back  
saying this kid is suicidal, this kid is going off the chart on 
this and we're not going to know who that kid is,'' said Holliston 
school psychologist Donna Moilanen. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 3,000 sites across the country are participating in this  
week's screening, the ninth annual. While hundreds of college 
campuses offer the screenings, only a few high schools take part. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, nine high schools, including Holliston, three middle  
schools and three school districts are participating in California, 
Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Canada, according to the 
National Mental Illness Screening Project, which administers the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Students answer 27 questions -- Do they feel hopeless? Have  
trouble concentrating? Feel sad? Contemplate suicide? -- on a scale 
of zero to 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Students tally up their points themselves after being told that  
scores of 20 or higher may indicate depression. The questionnaire 
is accompanied by names and telephone numbers they can call for 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	A high number doesn't automatically equal depression, said  
Moilanen, who expects about 10 percent of students will score in 
that range. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means there's cause for concern and we need to sit down and  
get that student some help,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average age of depression onset has been dropping over the  
years, and now hovers around 30, down from 40 several decades ago. 
An estimated 17 million to 20 million Americans suffer from 
depression each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Holliston decided to partake in the screenings after seeing the  
results of a state behavior survey taken by its students last year. 
Nearly one-quarter of the students said they had experienced 
suicidal thoughts, and 12 percent said they had tried to kill 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15- to  
24-year-olds nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	While societal stigma against depression is easing among adults,  
it remains taboo among teen-agers, said Carol Glod, who studies 
teen-age depression at McLean Hospital in Belmont and teaches the 
subject at Northeastern University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teen-agers and parents of teen-agers are very concerned about  
depression, but it's still a bad word,'' she said. ``No kid wants 
to say they're depressed and no parent wants to say `My child has 
an illness that's psychiatric.'''

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker: Move Farmers From Coast / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUMTER, S.C. (AP) -- A South Carolina state senator wants the  
federal government to eliminate disaster aid for farmers who build 
on flood plains. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to help, but we don't need to help them toward a  
disastrous event,'' said Sen. Phil Leventis, a Democrat. ``And if 
they build in a flood plain, it will happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leventis said he wants to discourage growth in low-lying areas  
that flood often. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding in coastal North Carolina from Hurricane Floyd ``has  
created a public health and environmental crisis,'' Leventis said 
in a letter to South Carolina's congressional delegation this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The concentrated animal production facilities and factory hog  
and poultry operations in North Carolina have created major health 
hazards because flood water has washed away litter piles, waste and 
animal carcasses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hundreds of millions of gallons of manure have mixed with  
flood waters,'' Leventis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least 500,000 hogs and more than 4 million chickens and  
turkeys have drowned,'' he said. ``More may be dying of starvation, 
as their owners cannot reach their barns to feed them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the large confined animal feeder operations are far  
enough from the coast to avoid a direct hit from a hurricane, but 
flooding still is a problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be foolish indeed for us to provide federal money to  
rebuild in areas that aren't adequate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leventis said he does not want to deny flood victims federal and  
state aid for repairs, but wants better planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they've experienced a disaster, but by the same token,  
it just doesn't make good sense to spend relief money on an effort 
just to go back in the future and make the same repairs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Leventis worked with the South Carolina Coastal  
Conservation League and the Southern Environmental Law Center to 
create similar legislation in South Carolina that set boundaries 
for farmers to protect the state from costly disasters.

<P>
	``It is in large part because of this law, areas of our coast  
are not in the same tragic situation that communities in the North 
Carolina coastal plain find themselves today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has become more important as the level of flooding has  
increased in recent years, he said. More development has made it 
harder for water to drain.

	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- A Kansas agriculture expert thinks farmers  
should consider growing alternative crops such as canola and white 
wheat because they often gain in popularity during times when 
commodity prices are low, as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Johnson, dean of Kansas State University's College of  
Agriculture, told the state's Special Committee on Agriculture that 
producers and processors are enthusiastic about a new variety of 
canola that is suitable for growing in Kansas. He noted that the 
United States now imports about 90 percent of its canola from 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing white wheat could give Kansas farmers a competitive  
advantage over other farmers in the Plains, who mostly produce red 
wheat, Johnson said. He noted that international markets favor 
white wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is promise of a small price increase for Kansas  
producers,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Ali's Daughter Making Boxing Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A new Ali era will begin Friday night. Well,  
sort of. 
</P>
<P>
	Laila Ali, the Greatest's daughter, will launch her pro boxing  
career at the Turning Stone Casino at Verona, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Her debut will come 29 years and 6 days after Muhammad Ali's  
heavyweight career ended on a stool in a Las Vegas ring after a 
10-round battering by Larry Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Ali had one more fight, a 10-round loss to Trevor  
Berbick on Dec. 11, 1981, at Nassau, Bahamas, but the real ending 
was against Holmes in an ill-advised bid to become heavyweight 
champion for a fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the master of illusion,'' a svelte Ali said before the  
Holmes fight. In fact, Ali was a 217-pound shell. 
</P>
<P>
	When his legion of fans talk about Ali, of course, it is the not  
the Ali who fought Holmes, but the Ali who floated like a butterfly 
and stung like a bee, who put bully Sonny Liston in his place, who 
roped-a-doped menacing George Foreman and who coauthored with Joe 
Frazier a three-chapter story of skill and courage. 
</P>
<P>
	He also beat the establishment -- refusing induction into the  
military during the Vietnam War in 1967 and having his conviction 
overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding like an echo from the past, 21-year-old Laila Ali says,  
`If I want to do something, I just do it, I really don't care what 
anybody has to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10, 168-pound Laila, who will box April Fowler (0-1)  
in a four-round bout, also says that because she is Muhammad Ali's 
daughter ``that I naturally have boxing skills that most people 
probably don't have when they start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Score one for youthful exuberance.  
</P>
<P>
	Laila Ali, who runs her own nail salon in Los Angeles, started  
boxing as exercise and then decided about a year ago she wanted to 
do it for real. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's Syndrome, has not  
turned against the sport that made him famous, and Laila says he 
supports her 100 percent. As a father, however, he is skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	`I just love how it feels,'' she says of boxing.  
</P>
<P>
	So does her father -- how it feels to be hit with Frazier's left  
hook or Earnie Shavers' right, how it feels when your legs become 
rubbery and your breath feels like fire in your throat. 
</P>
<P>
	Laila said she knows she is going to get hit and bruised, but  
that she's just going to have to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
	How long remains to be seen. At least, one old follower of her  
father's career hopes Laila's career is successful -- and short. 
</P>
<P>
	Laila is one Ali's eight children -- seven daughters and Muhammad  
Ali Jr. None of the others has shown any interest in following in 
dad's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	She is one of two daughters Ali had with Veronica, the third of  
his four wives. 
</P>
<P>
	The main even Friday night will be a 10-round bout between  
Donovan ``Razor'' Ruddock and Jose Ribalta, two heavyweights whose 
best days are behind them.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Stays Away from Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Already two days late, Latrell Sprewell  
should arrive soon for training camp. Whether he does so in a 
timely fashion remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Knicks went through their first day of two-a-day  
practices Tuesday while Sprewell decided to stay on the West Coast 
and wait out the verdict in his civil trial in California. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not present in court, however, when a jury ruled that he  
must pay $105,000 to two people who were injured in a car accident 
that he admittedly caused. The jury did not award any punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``My reaction is he shouldn't have to pay anything,'' teammate  
Chris Childs said. ``It was just a matter of someone trying to get 
some money off a professional athlete again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he got off and is able to go on with his life. To go  
through what he's been through the last couple of years, whenever 
he gets here it's understandable by his teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Scott Layden didn't say whether he expected  
Sprewell to catch a red-eye flight across the country so he could 
make it to Charleston by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will continue holding two-a-day practices through  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's agent originally told the Knicks he would join the  
team following closing arguments in the trial, which came Monday. 
But Sprewell then decided to wait for the jury to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we just hope he's here soon, and hopefully we'll hear  
soon what his plans are,'' Layden said following practice Tuesday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's agent, Robert Gist, did not return numerous phone  
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was sued by Arnulfo Perlas, 55, and Irma Feliciano, 54,  
of Antioch, Calif., whose car overturned when Sprewell tried to 
drive his Mercedes-Benz back onto a freeway from an exit lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell pleaded no contest to reckless driving and was  
sentenced to 90 days in jail, which he served under electronic home 
detention in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs asked for $450,000 in actual damages, plus two  
months of his $9 million salary for the upcoming season in punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's attorney said the plaintiffs were trying to make  
minor injuries seem major and asked the jury to award $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlas was awarded about $75,000 for economic and non-economic  
damages. Feliciano was awarded $30,000, mostly in economic damages.

<HEADLINE> Family Seeks Damages From Humana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- It was just two weeks before  
Christmas when the letter arrived at Mark and Barbara Chipps' 
house: Insurance would no longer cover the extensive therapy their 
4-year-old daughter needed for her cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can sum it up in probably one word -- devastating,'' Mark  
Chipps said Wednesday during a news conference at the office of his 
lawyer, Ted Leopold. ``We even talked about taking Christmas gifts 
back to pay bills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has been four years since that notice from Humana Inc., and  
the Chipps claim they're still trying to get health maintenance 
organization to pay. On Tuesday, they will go to court and try to 
force Humana to pay some expenses and to get additional money for 
what they say was an emotional ordeal that hurt their child's 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	Palm Beach Circuit Judge James Carlisle already found Humana  
liable for breach of contract, fraud and bad faith after the 
company failed to respond to repeated court orders to turn over 
documents. An appeals court in August upheld the default order 
against the HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana claims a much different version of events.  
</P>
<P>
	The company says it paid for more than what was required under  
its contract with Chipps and only removed Caitlyn from the special 
case management coverage -- which paid for the additional therapy -- 
when she showed great improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This family and this lawyer are litigious,'' said Humana  
spokeswoman Pam Gadinsky. ``There's no claim that Caitlyn suffered 
an adverse outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits against HMOs have taken center stage recently as  
Congress debates legislation to expand patients right to sue HMOs 
for hurting their care and a handful of high-powered trial 
attorneys says they're preparing class-action suits against several 
major health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Caitlyn, now 8, grew embarrassed and squirmed out of her chair  
and out the door during the news conference after her parents began 
speaking about her condition. She is a second-grader in a 
mainstream elementary school but has special assistance. She also 
requires hours of therapy and exercises each week. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father said he met with Humana representatives when his  
employer, Palm Beach County, decided to change insurance companies 
in January 1994. He was assured all the coverage Caitlyn had with 
the previous company would be covered under Humana, Chipps said. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, they got the letter.  
</P>
<P>
	Chipps says he believes Humana representatives lied to him to  
get him onto their coverage, knowing all along they didn't plan to 
keep paying for all of Caitlyn's bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a dollar figure placed on her, and it wasn't cost  
effective anymore for them to insure her,'' Chipps said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadinsky said the Chipps were told they could appeal. But the  
Chipps sued instead, and Chipps conceded Wednesday he did not try 
the company's appeal process. 
</P>
<P>
	Caitlyn was off the case managed plan for 10 months, during  
which time her mother said her progress deteriorated; she would 
lose her balance, fall into walls and crawl rather than walk, 
Barbara Chipps said. The Chipps said during that time they spent 
more than $15,000 out of pocket to pay for Caitlyn's treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	After the lawsuit was filed, Humana put Caitlyn back on the case  
managed care plan.

<HEADLINE> NetAid Builds Powerful Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internet site that will run during this  
weekend's NetAid charity concerts is a technological marvel, one 
that organizers boast is the world's most powerful Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	It could mark a milestone in the evolution of the Web as a  
broadcast medium. 
</P>
<P>
	How powerful is it? If the site, at www.netaid.org, were a  
virtual bus transporting listeners on the Internet who couldn't 
attend Saturday's concerts in New York, London and Geneva, it would 
be a rocket-propelled Greyhound with 10 million seats. 
</P>
<P>
	But to be successful, the site must dramatically surpass the  
Internet's recent disappointing failings when huge numbers of 
consumers rush the same Web sites simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	A virtual lingerie fashion show earlier this year by Victoria's  
Secret, hyped during the Super Bowl and in national newspaper ads, 
frustrated millions who couldn't watch because of technical 
problems or saw only grainy, jerky video. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Web sites strained when millions turned online for copies  
of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's graphically explicit report 
on President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's performers will include Sheryl Crow, Puff Daddy,  
Sting, David Bowie, Jewel and The Black Crowes. The charity 
concerts, to be broadcast on MTV, VH-1 and the BBC as well as 
across the Internet, are aimed at eliminating global poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said the NetAid site, fueled by 1,500 powerful server  
computers in 90 locations worldwide, will use a relatively new 
``distributed network model'' that will automatically direct each 
viewer's Web browsing software like a traffic cop toward empty 
lanes on a data highway. 
</P>
<P>
	In extreme cases, the technology also will invoke a ``velvet  
rope'' to prevent more listeners from visiting the Web site than 
its capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we start to get overloaded, rather than letting people in  
and degrading performance, we'll be turning people away,'' said 
Larry Lang, a vice president for Cisco Systems Inc., which 
coordinated the concerts with the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching on the Internet won't be the same as on television: The  
video on a computer screen will be roughly 2 inches in size with 
low-quality audio, and the transmission across the Web means a 
broadcast delay of about 1 minute. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear whether the Web site will even approach its limits.  
Engineers said they can handle 10 million simultaneous viewers of 
the concert broadcast, and 60 million ``hits'' to the site every 
hour, a figure 10 times higher than peak online visits during the 
last Olympics. By contrast, the Victoria's Secret fashion show was 
able to accommodate 500,000 simultaneous viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco expects several hundred million people worldwide to watch  
the concerts on television and cable. It predicted that about 20 
percent of viewers will heed calls during the broadcast to visit 
the Web site to make contributions or volunteer time or supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet site will run for months afterward as a charity  
swap-meet, linking needs by charity agencies worldwide to equipment 
and expertise that visitors might offer. A farmer in Iowa, for 
example, might offer advice about raising pigs in Africa; a 
retiring dentist might send his dentistry tools to a village in 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to use the Web to transform an audience into  
participants,'' said Marty Kagan, Cisco's program manager for 
NetAid. ``How do you do more in a world where you have all these 
new tools available to you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	While organizers hope for a flood of traffic to the Web site  
during the concert and in the days afterward, they're painfully 
aware of the high-tech nightmare that could result from a 
simultaneous crush of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our worst fear,'' according to an internal Cisco document,  
``is someone like U2's Bono telling a radio audience of adoring 
fans in 120 countries: 'On the count of three, I want you all to go 
to the Web site and donate one dollar. One, two....'''

<HEADLINE> Pension Suprlus Is Paper Tiger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The high-volume duel between President Clinton  
and Congress over Social Security obscures a crucial reality: 
Protecting its huge surpluses, as both have pledged to do, would 
not directly bolster the pension system at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security collects more each year in payroll taxes and  
interest than it pays in benefits. By law, Social Security gives 
the excess cash to the Treasury Department and gets Treasury bills 
in return. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to that internal government transaction, the amount of  
Treasury bills held by the Social Security system is unaffected by 
whether the Treasury Department then uses the cash to retire the 
national debt or spends it to clean hazardous waste sites or pay 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Using Social Security's surplus cash to lower the $5.6 trillion  
national debt unquestionably helps the program in an important, 
indirect way. Reducing the debt tends to lower interest rates, 
strengthen the economy and improve the government's fiscal 
condition. And that should help when Social Security hits its next 
crunch: The retirement of the 76 million baby boomers, beginning in 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite what both sides' rhetoric seems to imply, spending  
the Social Security surplus instead of using it to reduce debt 
would not steal from some fictitious kitty from which either 
current or future recipients are paid. 
</P>
<P>
	No one doubts that most of this year's projected $147 billion  
Social Security surplus will be used to reduce debt. At stake in 
this year's budget fight is whether part of it -- perhaps $10 
billion to $40 billion -- will be used instead for federal spending, 
ranging from hiring teachers to purchasing warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	That is clearly a lot of money. But if it is spent instead of  
used to reduce debt, it would have a virtually undetectable impact 
on the long-term growth of the U.S. economy, which currently 
surpasses $8 trillion in size. 
</P>
<P>
	Most experts say that while using the surplus to pay down debt  
is wise, it won't solve Social Security's real long-term problem: 
More retirees and fewer workers, whose payroll taxes cover 
retirees' benefits. What will ultimately be needed are changes in 
the system's benefits and revenues, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	The political fight has caught the attention of Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who last week said policy-makers should be 
focusing more on expanding the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm terribly concerned that everyone keeps talking about  
solving the Social Security problem by how they are moving around 
budgetary funds,'' he told business leaders in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	But that hasn't stopped both parties from touting their promise  
to protect Social Security. The vow has taken on a life of its own, 
with politicians worried that grabbing the surpluses risks enraging 
its 44 million elderly and disabled recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to assure the hardworking taxpayers of this country  
... that this Republican Congress will not schedule a bill that 
raids their Social Security,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as Friday, Clinton said he wanted to ``not dip into  
the Social Security surplus any more.'' The day before, he hinted 
he was open to a bipartisan deal to spend some of the Social 
Security money, though ``both parties need to agree on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans ignored that offer.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts across the political spectrum say the rhetoric is  
misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're doing is coming up with nice sounding words that  
are basically meaningless,'' said David John, senior policy analyst 
for the conservative Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solvency of the Social Security trust funds is not  
directly affected at all'' by whether part of the program's surplus 
is spent, said James Horney, senior fellow with the liberal Center 
on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this year, both parties routinely used Social Security  
surpluses for decades to help pay the government's bills. Even so, 
Social Security's assets -- in the form of Treasury bills -- have 
grown steadily, hitting $887 billion this year and a projected $2 
trillion by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	The pledge to protect Social Security has proven particularly  
troublesome lately for House Republicans. Their search for other 
savings led them to propose delaying income support payments to 
working poor families, which even top GOP presidential contender 
George W. Bush attacked as unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the political risks and technical difficulties  
involved, Social Security's problems probably won't be seriously 
addressed until after next year's presidential and congressional 
elections.

<HEADLINE> AFL-CIO Endorsement of Gore Crucial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Vice President Al Gore went confidently  
after the AFL-CIO endorsement in February, it was a prize meant to 
give him a leg up against whoever survived the GOP's multicandidate 
presidential primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the tighter race is Gore's -- against Bill Bradley --  
Gore allies say it is even more crucial that AFL-CIO President John 
Sweeney deliver on his promise to ``take a run at an endorsement'' 
during the federation's meeting next week in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	But whether Sweeney will deliver remained an agonizingly open  
question. Teamsters President James Hoffa stood ready to resist, 
while labor and political operatives close to the wrangling said 
they believed Gore would overcome such a rebuff. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore allies, trying perhaps to lower the stakes by lowering  
expectations, put his odds at 50-50. In a move that could help tip 
the scales, President Clinton planned to meet privately with Hoffa 
on Thursday in New York and also to speak at a dinner honoring the 
Teamsters president. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony to how up-in-the-air the federation's imprimatur  
looms: Neither Gore nor Bradley formally was invited to address the 
AFL-CIO convention, but both were quietly advised to be in 
California next week and keep open space on their schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken a position that it's too early,'' said Teamsters  
political director Mike Mathis. ``This is not an anti-Al Gore 
thing. But there's still so much gray area out there on worker 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Egged on by a Bradley lobbying effort that several union leaders  
rated as more aggressive and effective than Gore's belated 
outreach, officials at the United Auto Workers, Machinists, Food 
and Commercial Workers, and International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers also have signaled some reservations to backing Gore this 
early. Holding out, they argue, could perhaps extract firmer 
pro-union positions from the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Other unions are in the position of the Airline Pilots  
Association, which just began to solicit candidate information for 
its members. Leaders in those unions fear stepping out ahead of 
their rank and file, and possibly alienating those needed for phone 
banks and other field work in the Democrats' broader 
general-election assault on Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, several of those leaders who have questioned an early  
endorsement of Gore have indicated to Sweeney that they would be 
willing to support the vice president at the convention if Sweeney 
pushed for a vote, according to officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Urgently wishing for a boost, Gore traveled to Nashville, Tenn.,  
today to open new outside-the-Beltway headquarters that he hopes 
will help his campaign fight back against Bradley's surge in the 
polls and his edge in building a bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious that the news has not been good for (Gore) lately  
and, while I think that the timing of Bradley's spurt here has been 
advantageous for Gore because it came three months too early, he 
still needs good news,'' said Chicago-based Democratic consultant 
David Axelrod, who has ties both to Gore and the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	To walk away from next week's convention without the  
long-sought, long-promised endorsement ``would be a setback'' for 
Gore, Axelrod said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore already has banked endorsements from a dozen or more state  
and local unions. And with timing meant to prod the AFL-CIO, the 
American Federation of Teachers endorsed Gore on Tuesday, as did 
the 50,000-member International Association of Washington State 
Machinists. 
</P>
<P>
	More than one of the union officials interviewed said Sweeney  
and AFSCME president Gerald McEntee, chairman of the federation's 
political committee, painted themselves into a corner by promising 
Gore an October endorsement vote after the political committee 
debated the question in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Sweeney and McEntee are close to the Clinton-Gore  
administration. But Sweeney also is somewhat wedded to the 
bottom-up leadership style he promised his own constituents when he 
was elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``This all boils down to John Sweeney and whether he will push  
it through,'' said Mathis. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Sweeney nor McEntee returned calls for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney has not tipped his hand either way. When his political  
committee met last week, he told members he was ``letting this 
drive itself,'' said one union official. Others said Sweeney was 
pressing union presidents for their support in private phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going through a process,'' Sweeney told The Washington  
Post. ``There are some people who think we should take a little 
longer.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Surge: Dow Ends Up 187.75 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared Wednesday as investors cast aside  
interest rate concerns and turned upbeat about third-quarter 
earnings. Financial and Internet issues once again led the gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 187.75 to 10,588.34.  
The Dow has rebounded nearly 375 points, or 3.7 percent, since last 
Wednesday, when it reached 10,213.48, its lowest point since April 
9. The index is now up 15.3 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose, although advancing stocks  
only narrowly beat decliners. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 
24.05 to 1,325.40, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 57.54 at 
2,857.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors were focused on third-quarter earnings  
reports which have begun to trickle in and expected many of them to 
be strong. 
</P>
<P>
	For companies that reported earnings Wednesday, the market  
followed its recent pattern of rewarding firms that beat analyst 
expectations and punishing those that meet but don't exceed 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of PepsiCo rose 1 3/4 to 33 3/16 after surpassing Wall  
Street's expectations with strong sales in its Frito-Lay snacks and 
Tropicana juice businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Aluminum producer and Dow component Alcoa fell 2 1/8 to 62 after  
meeting forecasts but reporting a drop in shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	After the market closed, Internet search engine Yahoo! reported  
earnings that surpassed analyst estimates. The stock had risen 2 
7/16 to 175 3/4 in anticipation of good news. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimism about earnings comes after weeks of worry about  
what the Federal Reserve would do with interest rates. The Fed 
decided Tuesday to leave interest rates alone for now but lean 
toward a rate hike in the coming months. Although the Fed's 
announcement initially led to heavy selling Tuesday, investors were 
more relaxed today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market spent six weeks wringing its hands about interest  
rates, and though it didn't get exactly what it wanted, it's now 
behind us,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis for 
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank has pushed rates higher twice since June and  
worries about another increase helped depress stocks for much of 
the last month. The Dow fell more than 1,100 points from its 
all-time closing high of 11,326.04 on Aug. 25, before regaining 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think the market is oversold and think they can pick up  
some bargains,'' said Eugene G. Mintz, financial markets analyst at 
Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express, up 6 1/32 to 246 1/2 and Hewlett Packard, up 5 1/2  
to 89 1/2, helped lead the Dow higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Online auctioneer Ebay, up 10 1/2 to 151 11/16, and Priceline.com,  
up 8 1/2 to 72 3/4, were leaders in the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume of all listed shares totaled 1.08 billion shares, down  
from 1.15 billion in Tuesday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.75 to 429.76.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.6 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was up 1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Brister's Back As Broncos' Starter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos switched quarterbacks again, as  
coach Mike Shanahan today replaced Brian Griese with veteran Bubby 
Brister. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think this is the best thing for our football team  
right now,'' Shanahan said. ``We think this is going to give us a 
chance to win now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, 37, was the heir apparent to replace the retired John  
Elway. But on Aug. 30, after four of Denver's five preseason games, 
Shanahan benched Brister in favor of the Griese, who threw just 
three passes as a rookie last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos went 0-4 under Griese, along the way losing standout  
linebacker John Mobley and league MVP Terrell Davis to 
season-ending knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, what can we do to give us the best chance to  
get out of this slump?'' Shanahan said. ``Brian played well on 
Sunday and we had a chance to have four touchdowns in the first 
half. But the bottom line is, we didn't get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister vowed to get the team back on track.  
</P>
<P>
	Griese, 24, said he was surprised by the decision but added, ``I  
understand that we're 0-4 and something needs to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griese now becomes the backup, and veteran Chris Miller remains  
No. 3.

<P>
	COLLEGEVILLE, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves guards Anthony  
Peeler and Terrell Brandon returned to practice after missing time 
because of a freak injury and an apparent allergic reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler missed the first of two practices Tuesday because he was  
hurt while receiving room service at the team's hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Peeler sustained a gash just below his right knee that needed  
six stitches when he tried to get out of the way of a server and 
stumbled into the glass edge of his whirlpool Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was dark, so that didn't help,'' Peeler said. He returned  
for Tuesday night practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon was back at practice after missing Monday's workout  
because of respiratory problems, apparently from an allergic 
reaction to medication for muscle cramping. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon was given sodium pills Sunday night after becoming  
dehydrated and started having cramps at the end of practice. He 
woke up Monday with tightness in his chest and had trouble 
breathing.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Attacks Giuliani on HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Invitations are in the mail for a Hillary  
Rodham Clinton ``birthday celebration'' that is expected to raise 
at least $1 million for her Senate campaign committee, a spokesman 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the first lady launched her first direct attack on  
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her expected opponent in the 
Senate race, accusing him of avoiding the issue of whether patients 
should be able to sue their HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rudy Giuliani has never made health care reform a priority,''  
said Howard Wolfson, spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory 
committee. ``Now it's time for him to address this critical issue. 
Does he fully support a patient's right to sue, or just his own?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who is expected to seek the Senate seat from New  
York being vacated next year by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, ``supports HMO reform and a patient's right to sue,'' 
Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from the Giuliani camp.  
</P>
<P>
	The criticisms by the first lady, who is on a weeklong trip  
through Europe, came as the House of Representatives began debating 
legislation that would give patients new rights, including the 
right to sue their health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has passed a more limited version of the bill.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who directed President Clinton's failed attempt to  
overhaul the nation's health care system in his first term, has 
made it clear that she expects to make health care a major issue of 
the Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the birthday ``Broadway for Hillary'' event will be  
held at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts in Manhattan on 
Oct. 25, the day before the first lady's 52nd birthday, and is to 
be hosted by Rosie O'Donnell and Nathan Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket prices range from $250 to $1,000 each, for which  
supporters will see a Broadway-like production featuring Sandy 
Duncan and Joel Grey. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who raise at least $10,000 for the event get to join Mrs.  
Clinton at a private reception before the show. Those who raise at 
least $25,000 will join her afterward for dinner at the Russian Tea 
Room.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urged To Deregulate Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- As American and Japanese officials began talks on  
opening up their markets to outsiders, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Foley 
called on Japan to deregulate its telecommunications industry and 
make it easier for competitors to enter it. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley, outlining recommendations in an annual U.S. report on  
Japanese economic reforms, said a more open telecom industry in 
Japan would create jobs, stimulate investment and spur new 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Japan to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of the  
industry, ``which would establish a regulatory system that makes 
promotion of competition its primary objective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, said the effort to  
deregulate should be a ``two-way'' process, ministry officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo pointed to U.S. anti-dumping measures as well as ``Buy  
American'' laws as examples of where the United States needs to 
modify its own regulations, an official said on customary condition 
of anonymity. Anti-dumping measures seek to stop foreign companies 
from selling products at below-production costs in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	In its study, the United States also calls for broader  
competition and specific reforms in industries including medical 
devices and pharmaceuticals, financial services, housing and 
energy. The study lays out the U.S. position in advance of an 
annual U.S.-Japan report on deregulation expected in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The lucrative Japanese telecommunications industry has long been  
an area of concern for U.S. trade officials. The industry is 
dominated by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., the world's second 
largest telecommunications company after AT&AMP;T Corp. of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government announced plans in 1996 to break up NTT,  
which long had a virtual monopoly on local phone services. And 
Washington and Tokyo reached an agreement this summer to give 
foreign companies a better shot at competing for sales to NTT and 
its successor companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. report, however, said Japan needs to go further.  
</P>
<P>
	``The telecommunications market in Japan is burdened by a legacy  
of laws, regulations and monopolistic business practices that fail 
to support the needs of a competitive market,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington urged Japan to draw up regulations to prevent  
anti-competitive behavior, free new entrants from excessive red 
tape and provide access to NTT's facilities, among other steps.

<HEADLINE> Rock Beat: Michael Goodroe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The one-man band has gone digital. Now  
the question is whether he goes global. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Goodroe can sit and talk for hours about all the  
musicians he worked with, learned from and got breaks from along 
the way. But right now, the former Motels bassist is working only 
with ... Michael Goodroe. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodroe reminisces about the wild ride the Motels took in the  
1970s and '80s. Much of it was great, he says, but the group 
ultimately found itself pulling in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
	That's no problem for Goodroe today. The multitalented  
Albuquerque native has written, sung, produced and done the jacket 
graphics for his own CD, ``Flesh and Blood.'' He plays all the 
instruments -- guitar, bass, drums, keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
	And unless he solidifies a great distribution deal in Hollywood,  
he may do his own sales, as well, over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In 10 years with the Motels, which Goodroe joined in 1976, he  
played bass, co-wrote five songs with lead singer-songwriter Martha 
Davis, and -- ``I never sang a note.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now after four intensive years of singing lessons and club  
appearances, Goodroe can sing. He has a deep, gravelly baritone 
that sounds like a washing machine switching cycles. He hits his 
notes, and the overall effect is gritty and cool, not unlike that 
of Lou Reed or Leonard Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to reinvent myself every five years,'' Goodroe said in  
an interview at his Albuquerque home, which includes a digital 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's one thing Goodroe learned in his years before and  
during his run with the Motels, he says, ``I learned to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He studied with guitarist Tonk Edwards in Denver in 1974-75 and  
played bass with Edwards' trio for a year. Then, he took lessons 
from Mothers of Invention bassist Tom Fowler in Los Angeles in 1976 
before getting the 11th-hour call, literally, to audition for 
Martha Davis and the Motels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said it's 11 o'clock. I'm afraid I've had a bottle of wine.  
She goes, 'We've had two bottles of wine.''' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 10-year ride with the Motels, he said, ``I felt like  
a passenger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are eight gold records to show for it hanging on his  
studio wall. He says Davis graciously gave him co-writing credits 
on five songs -- ``Careful,'' ``Bonjour Baby,'' ``Crybaby,'' 
``Tables Turn'' and ``My Love Stops Here'' -- even when his 
contribution was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	The peak, as he looks back, was the ``Careful Tour,'' named for  
that hit single and album. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of screaming ``punked out'' teen-agers packed a  
circus-style tent in Rome for a concert sponsored by the Communist 
Party of Italy. The debris that filled the air was so thick, the 
energy levels of the crowd so intense, the band was afraid to go on 
stage for its encore, ``Only the Lonely,'' but they went anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole time they're going, 'Mo-tels! Mo-tels! Mo-tels!' --  
4,000 of them. The hairs on the back of my head are just standing 
up, and I say, 'This is exactly why you do this. This is why it's 
so addictive.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodroe figured if he could learn to play bass well enough to  
help earn eight gold records, he could learn to sing. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has only good things to say about Goodroe.  
</P>
<P>
	``The guy is really talented -- I'm a huge fan of his,'' she said  
by phone from her home in Ventura, Calif. ``He writes great songs. 
He has a wonderful voice. If Michael puts his mind to something -- 
look out, world. If he does decide to market himself, it's very 
possible (he will succeed). We're living in great times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Motels still play club dates, Davis says, but ``mostly I've  
been writing and recording. I have my own digital studio, as well, 
and have been writing like a fiend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodroe works in the Special Chemistry Laboratory at Lovelace  
Medical Center by day, playing clubs in Albuquerque by night to 
burnish his voice. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardest thing, he said, is training his ear to hear when he  
goes sharp or flat and training his voice to avoid sharping and 
flatting. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to learn not to fool yourself,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Once convinced he was ready, he took six months to make the CD  
with ``many, many retakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of how it fares, he says, it's a beginning -- and he  
stays independent, free of agents, managers and the compromises 
that record companies may require. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got my toys, and I'm happening,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Ailing Pinochet Excused From Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A judge on Wednesday excused Gen. Augusto Pinochet  
from appearing in court later this week after a doctor testified 
the former Chilean dictator had suffered two small strokes in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Loxton said the 83-year-old Pinochet suffered the  
first stroke on Sept. 9 and the second on Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet had been scheduled to attend Bow Street Magistrates  
Court on Friday, where a ruling is expected on Spain's request to 
extradite him to face torture allegations. But Deputy Chief 
Magistrate Ronald Bartle ruled he did not have to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon has accused Pinochet of  
orchestrating a campaign of terror against political opponents 
during his 17 years of power. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean government report has acknowledged that  
3,197 people were killed or disappeared after Pinochet toppled 
elected Marxist president Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup. 
Pinochet relinquished power in 1990, and became a senator for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put him in the witness box would run the risk of him being  
very ill,'' Loxton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loxton said he could not provide definitive evidence that  
Pinochet suffered a stroke because Pinochet has a pacemaker, which 
prevents him from undergoing a magnetic resonance scan. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Pinochet showed signs of dizziness and short-term  
memory loss in follow-up examinations. When shown a paper clip, the 
general was unable to name it, Loxton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is wobbly, urinating frequently, unsteady and his  
short-term memory is very poor,'' Loxton said. 
</P>
<P>
	British lawyers acting on behalf of Spain challenged Loxton's  
report, and said Scotland Yard's Dr. Peter Dean would have liked to 
examine Pinochet. Pinochet is under no obligation to submit to 
outside doctors for examination, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Pinochet's Oct. 11 arrest in London on the Spanish  
warrant, he has only appeared in court once. During his appearance 
at his initial arraignment, he was in a wheelchair and said he did 
not accept the authority of the British courts. On occasion, 
Pinochet has allowed television cameras into the rented mansion 
southwest of London, where he is under police guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Loxton said Pinochet walks with a cane around the yard of his  
London residence for five or ten minutes daily, accompanied by a 
Chilean doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pinochet's supporters have said in recent weeks that the  
general's health has deteriorated and he is very depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartle is expected to rule Friday on whether Pinochet should be  
sent to Spain for extradition. If Bartle rules against Pinochet, 
his lawyers are expected to launch an immediate appeal.

<HEADLINE> Idle Grateful for Python Breakup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- While fans may have been heartbroken when Monty  
Python broke up in 1983, Eric Idle says he was thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am exceedingly grateful. I have had a wonderful time over  
the past 16 years and I would like to thank them all personally for 
it,'' Idle said, responding to questions from readers of The 
Independent newspaper, which published the answers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Could Idle be joking?  
</P>
<P>
	After all, he is promoting a new book, ``The Road to Mars,'' and  
he is participating with the other surviving Pythons in a 30th 
anniversary special this weekend on the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
	One reader asked Idle why he agreed to participate in providing  
new material for the special, after once saying the group would 
never reunite. 
</P>
<P>
	He replied: ``I have discovered I really don't mind doing Monty  
Python, providing none of the others are around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent quoted an unidentified spokeswoman for Idle as  
saying her boss was trying to be funny.

1932, has introduced a total of 595 award winners over the decades. 
It calls its familiar red, white and blue logo on seed packets ``a 
promise of gardening success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the National Garden Bureau, a 79-year-old nonprofit  
organization receiving donations from seed companies, has sent to 
garden writers a preliminary list of 27 ornamentals and seven 
vegetables that will be featured as new varieties in catalogs and 
seed packets in the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, there are plenty of choices for gardeners liking to try  
new things. But rest assured the catalogs will still provide 
abundant old varieties for people attached to heirlooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Now for a look at the All-American flower selections as  
described by the organization: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cosmic Orange, the cosmos, attains a height of 12 inches in  
full sun and produces bright orange 2-inch blooms all summer, 
thriving on minimal care. It is basically pest and disease free. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Melody Pink, the dianthus, was bred specifically for use as a  
cut flower with long stems desirable for fresh bouquets. It has 
one-inch flowers with a serrated petal edge, giving it a lacy look. 
It is quite tolerant of heat and cold. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Soraya, the sunflower, is eye-catching because of unusual  
orange petals rather than golden ones and has a chocolate brown 
center. The plants are self-supporting and may reach a height of 5 
to 6 feet in full sun. There are 4-to-6-inch blooms with long stems 
good for cut flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Fiesta del Sol, the tithonia, is a dwarf Mexican sunflower  
featuring abundant orange daisy flowers 2 to 3 inches across. It 
thrives in summer heat and humidity and reaches a height of 2 to 3 
feet. It is basically pest free; not even deer like its hairy 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Stardust Orchid, the vinca, has bluish purple and white blooms  
borne above glossy dark green foliage. It is recommended for 
gardeners who want a long show of flower color with minimal care. 
</P>
<P>
	And the veggies:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Savoy Express, the cabbage, is billed as possibly ``the  
earliest cabbage on the block,'' maturing in about 55 days from 
transplanting. With relatively small and compact heads, it can be 
grown at close spacing about a foot apart. The savoyed, crinkled 
leaves have a sweet flavor good for coleslaw. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mr. Big, the pea, gets its name from consistently large pods,  
sometimes two per node, that are easy to shell. The vine reaches 2 
to 3 feet in height and needs vertical support. Maturing in about 
60 days, the peas are described as delicious, with ``no need for 
butter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Blushing Beauty, the bell pepper, runs through color changes  
from ivory to pink to red, hence its name, and is ``sweet at any 
color.'' It can be harvested 72-75 days from transplanting. It's a 
compact plant reaching a mature height of 18 inches and is suited 
to container growing. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Indian Summer, the sweet corn, features yellow, white and red  
or purple kernels which ``actually intensify as the ear cooks.'' 
It's a supersweet variety that requires isolation from other corn 
pollen. Maturity comes in about 80 days. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> West Virginia Fugitive Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Authorities on Wednesday arrested a man in  
West Virginia and another near Dallas in one of Texas' most 
sensational unsolved crimes: the slaying of four teen-age girls at 
an Austin yogurt shop nearly eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 6, 1991, the girls were shot in the head in an apparent  
robbery at the I Can't Believe It's Yogurt! shop where two of them 
worked. The store then was set on fire in a crime that horrified 
the community because of its random brutality and the youth of the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin police refused to comment on the arrests, or on broadcast  
reports that two other men had been arrested in the Austin area. 
They scheduled a mid-afternoon announcement about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In Charleston W.Va., police Maj. Pat Epperhart said Robert Burns  
Springsteen Jr., 24, was arrested Wednesday morning at a home in 
the city. Springsteen was charged in Texas with capital murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Epperhart said Springsteen's neighbors in Charleston told police  
he had been bragging about the murders. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lewisville, near Dallas, the police department said Austin  
police and Texas Rangers had also made an arrest there. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen was believed to have been in West Virginia since  
leaving Austin in 1992, Epperhart said. He said he did not know 
what Springsteen had been doing since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The four victims were Eliza Hope Thomas, 17; Amy Ayers, 13;  
Jennifer Harbison, 17; and Sarah Harbison, 15;, Jennifer's sister. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second anniversary of the killings, Austin police said  
they had investigated more than 5,000 leads without an arrest. 
Their investigations took them down several dead ends. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, a man in Mexico reportedly confessed to the killings  
and was sentenced to prison for an unrelated murder. The man later 
recanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also speculated that a killer by the name of  
Kenneth Allen McDuff may have been involved, because he was 
convicted of abducting and murdering a young Austin woman at a car 
wash. McDuff was executed in 1998 without shedding any light on the 
yogurt shop case.

<HEADLINE> Nikkei Higher in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices opened higher early Thursday  
following a big rise on Wall Street. The dollar was lower against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 89.54 points,  
or 0.50 percent, to 17,985.96 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
The average closed up 112.27 points, or 0.63 percent, the previous 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 107.28 yen, down 0.08 yen from its  
level of 107.36 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its 
level of 107.51 yen late in New York on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices moved broadly higher with  
mining, precision instruments, and brokerage issues taking the 
lead. Blue chip exporters such as Sony, Toyota, Bridgestone, and 
Canon all rose moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of short-covering is going on, especially after players  
went short on the cash and futures markets yesterday,'' said 
Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo 
Securities. He was referring to players rushing to buy back shares 
after having sold them the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 187.75  
points, or 1.8 percent, to close Wednesday's session at 10,588.34. 
Stocks rose on a rebounding bond market and optimism about 
corporate earnings. 
</P>

first section climbed 6.04 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,518.57. 
The TOPIX closed up 2.47 points, or 0.16 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was marginally lower after  
rising sharply the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency was bought back late Wednesday after falling  
earlier in the day on warnings from the U.S. Federal Reserve about 
further interest rate increases, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 114.90 yen, down 0.38 yen  
from its level of 115.28 yen late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>

to 1.7150 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.6950 percent. Its 
price fell 0.17 point to 99.87.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Players Seek Forgiveness  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) -- Tom Lehman and two American Ryder  
Cup teammates are seeking forgiveness at golf's most hallowed site: 
the Old Course at St. Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
	But after reading Wednesday's British papers, Lehman, Payne  
Stewart and Mark O'Meara know the controversy surrounding their 
Ryder win hasn't been forgotten. Not in Europe, at least. 
</P>
<P>
	``What better place to come and set things straight than St.  
Andrews,'' said Lehman, speaking just a 9-iron away from the famous 
stone clubhouse of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club -- the venerable 
custodian of the game's rules and manners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's of concern to me that my reputation has been somewhat  
damaged,'' said Lehman, whose behavior was called ``disgusting'' by 
European assistant captain Sam Torrance when the American led a 
charge across the 17th green in a premature victory celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never walked on anybody's line,'' said Lehman. ``I'm not a  
monster. I'm not a rogue. I'm not a hooligan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman, who will lead the Americans in the 16-nation Dunhill Cup  
when it begins Thursday, said he'd talked to Torrance and ``sent 
letters to the people I want to deal with directly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of the letters that I wrote and the phone calls I  
made was that we can leave friends. I definitely don't think it's 
worth losing friendships over a golf tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to let you know the Americans and myself are very  
much aware of the honor and courtsey of golf, the history of 
golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and O'Meara, lauded in the British press for being  
gracious in victory, blamed a handful of fans for problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably 80 to 100 of those 30,000 were not true golf fans ...  
and they treated the Ryder cup as they would treat going to a 
football game, or a basketball game or a hockey game,'' Stewart 
said. ``They don't understand the etiquette that's involved in the 
game of golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it was horrible the way everybody was treated,'' O'Meara  
admitted. ``Because of eight or 20 or 12 fans, you don't label all 
Americans, the whole Ryder Cup as being a disgrace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman called some of the partisan cheering ``inevitable'' as  
the U.S. rallied on the final day for the biggest comeback in Ryder 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``To expect anybody not to react to the crowd, and vice versa,  
is unrealistic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very sorry for running out on the 17th green, we're very  
sorry if ... you thought we haven't respected you (European 
players). It was never the intention to show any lack of respect or 
lack of courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in the excitement of the day, the excitement of the  
moment, things just spilled out. ... We can't do anything about it, 
we don't feel good about it, we just have to go on and get over 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is seeded No. 1 in the tournament followed by  
No. 2 Spain -- with Ryder stars Jose Maria Olazabal, Miguel Angel 
Jimenez and Sergio Garcia -- followed by two-time defending champion 
South Africa and Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans face New Zealand in Thursday's first round. Other  
pairings: Sweden vs. Italy, Scotland vs. Paraguay, Australia vs. 
Japan, South Africa vs. China, England vs. India, Spain vs. France 
and Ireland vs. Zimbabwe. The final is Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Young Directors Featured at Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new wave has emerged at this year's New York  
Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``After years of losing steam, independent American directors  
seem to have come roaring back,'' said Richard Pena, chair of the 
selection committee for the two-week festival, which ends Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Harmony Korine, 25 years old, is represented with ``Julien  
Donkey-Boy.'' Kimberly Peirce, 31, was selected for ``Boys Don't 
Cry.'' Twenty-nine-year-old Spike Jonze, a music video director, 
makes his feature film debut with the off-the-wall ``Being John 
Malkovich.'' Kevin Smith, also 29, is back with the controversial 
``Dogma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No prizes are given here, but the competition would be  
fascinating for the most unconventional movie. ``Dogma,'' a satire 
of religion, has been attacked by the Catholic League for Religious 
and Civil Rights. In ``Being John Malkovich,'' Manhattan office 
workers inhabit the actor's body. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boys Don't Cry'' is based on a true story about a Nebraska  
girl who passes for a boy. ``Julien Donkey-Boy,'' filmed in New 
York City, is a grainy, impressionistic study of a schizophrenic 
and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for any young director to try and make a new  
kind of film,'' Korine said. ``I need to create images that no one 
else has done. I don't believe in traditional narrative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The festival might easily have featured better known U.S.  
directors, with such New York fixtures as Woody Allen, Martin 
Scorsese and Jim Jarmusch all releasing new films. But Scorsese 
didn't have a print ready and Jarmusch and Allen didn't offer their 
movies to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Woody had the opening night feature in New York last year and  
when we learned that they had (Pedro Almodovar's) `All About My 
Mother' for opening night this year it seemed anticlimactic to 
offer his new movie,'' said Michael Barker, co-president of Sony 
Pictures Classics, which is distributing Allen's ``Sweet and 
Lowdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As one of the smaller major festivals, and in its 37th year, New  
York does have a long, personal history with favored directors. 
Almodovar, who has been included here often, on opening night 
referred to the festival committee as ``family'' and dedicated his 
new movie to an outgoing member, Wendy Keys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still levitating,'' Keys, stepping down after 34 years,  
said a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Established filmmakers this year come from outside the United  
States: Spain's Almodovar, Britain's Mike Leigh, Canada's Atom 
Egoyan, Portugal's Manoel de Oliveira, Egypt's Youssef Chahine, 
Iran's Majid Mahidi, Finland's Aki Kaurismaki, New Zealand's Jane 
Campion. 
</P>
<P>
	A notable returnee is director Leos Carax, who in 1992 screened  
one of the great follies of the decade, ``Lovers on the Bridge.'' 
Starring Juliette Binoche, Carax's film was then the most expensive 
French production ever and was so overwhelmed by publicity about 
its budget that only recently was it released commercially in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leos is a kind of high-wire act,'' Pena said. ``And like any  
high-wire act there are sometimes little slips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three Belgian films are featured, including the drama  
``Rosetta,'' winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Retrospectives 
include ``The Edge of the World,'' an early film by Michael Powell, 
and the silent horror classic ``The Man Who Laughs.'' The festival 
also offers one endurance test: Emir Kusturica's ``Underground,'' 
first shown here in 1996 and expanded from its original three hours 
to five hours and 12 minutes. 

</P>
<P>
	Festival highlights:  

</P>
<P>
                            *''Dogma''    	
</P>
<P>
	Atheism, the old saying goes, indicates intelligence -- up to a  
point. Kevin Smith's cheeky, scatological send-up of Catholicism is 
the kind of movie that works best for those who haven't read their 
Bible. Starring Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as killer angels and 
Linda Fiorentino as their mortal enemy, the film bases its message 
on an old complaint: If God is so great, then why did he make the 
world so terrible? Heaven on Earth, the naughty filmmaker should 
have learned, isn't part of the Christian promise. 
</P>
<P>
	But fans of ``Clerks'' and other Smith comedies should enjoy his  
new film; ``Dogma'' is gospel for slackers. Smith works in plenty 
of good jokes, a few stupid ones and leaves us one great moment of 
political theater: Janeane Garofalo outsmarting picketers at an 
abortion clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                       *''The Color of Heaven''    	
</P>
<P>
	The plot's as old-fashioned as D.W. Griffith. A clever, blind  
Iranian boy is unwanted by his father, who dreams of remarrying and 
thinks his son will get in the way. The boy is crushed, the father 
(divinely?) punished and both barely get out alive. The average 
filmmaker would make all this insufferable but Majid Majidi, 
director of an overlooked masterpiece (``The Father'') and an 
overrated art-house hit (``Children of Heaven'') pulls if off for 
the same reasons Griffith did: because he believes in this story, 
down to the last tear from the child's heavenly eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                         *''Boys Don't Cry''    	
</P>
<P>
	The setting's as modern as a trailer park; the spirit's as old  
as Shakespeare. In Kimberly Peirce's unforgettable debut feature, 
based on a true story, Hilary Swank stars as a Nebraska teen-ager 
who passes for a boy and drives the girls wild. Chloe Sevigny plays 
the love of his/her star-crossed life. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference between tragedy and melodrama is sometimes just a  
matter of how it's played. Sevigny's character is all heart and 
wonder, an ordinary kid who won't let go of the most beautiful 
fantasy she'll ever have. And Swank is a great actress portraying 
an even greater one. Her character is a romantic in love with her 
own performance, a hustler who convinces you she's a boy even when 
the evidence is right before your eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                       *''Felicia's Journey''    	
</P>
<P>
	Some monsters frighten even themselves. In Atom Egoyan's  
graceful, surprising drama, Bob Hoskins stars as a nice bloke with 
a serious mommy complex and a helpless yen for dispatching girls to 
the afterlife. Like Norman Bates, the villain gets his comeuppance. 
But, like Norman Bates, he makes it to a different kind of 
afterlife -- movie history. Nothing can kill the sight of him 
studying old videos of his mother, or, in a passage lifted from 
Hitchcock's ``Suspicion,'' carrying a glass of poisoned cocoa to 
his young would-be victim. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                      *A Visitor From the Living    	
</P>
<P>
	The monsters here are real. Claude Lanzmann, director of the  
epic Holocaust documentary ``Shoah,'' is back with an hour-long 
interview filmed 20 years ago but not released until now. The 
subject is Maurice Rossel, a sophisticated Swiss doctor and a Red 
Cross official during World War II. It was his job to inspect the 
Nazi ``show camp'' Theresienstadt, a barbaric facility cleaned up 
for international visitors: Dr. Rossel was among the conned. 
</P>
<P>
	With questions as precise and as pointed as a chisel on clay,  
Lanzmann inquires how Rossel could have been so taken in, quoting 
approving passages from his report, responding with calm outrage 
when Rossel suggests the Jews share blame for their fate. ``Their 
passivity was hard to swallow,'' the doctor protests between urbane 
puffs of his cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent letter to Lanzmann, Rossel remarks that he feels  
``wiser now, or more insane, and it is the same thing.''That's one 
curse of the Nazis, who were certainly crazy and the opposite of 
wise. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                          *''The Letter''    	
</P>
<P>
	Portuguese director Manoel de Oliveira, born in 1908, is nearly  
as old as movies themselves. His latest is an updating of the 
17th-century novel ``La Princesse de Cleves,'' which he sets in 
modern-day Paris. Chiara Mastroianni stars as a young aristocrat 
whose desire for an international pop star so torments her she 
refuses to consummate the affair even after her husband dies. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveira treats this material in the best possible way, like a  
story he's known all his life but never tires of telling -- perhaps 
because he still learns something from it. The camera looks on 
patiently, sadly, humorously, condemning nothing but luck and the 
eternal war between spirit and flesh. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
                        *The Edge of the World    	
</P>
<P>
	This early feature by Michael Powell, who went on to direct  
``The Red Shoes'' and many other movies, has been restored more 
than 60 years after its first release. Filmed on location, it's a 
raw, beautiful work about a centuries-old Scottish island community 
driven from its home by weather and the modern world. 
</P>
<P>
	The performances are a bit rough, as if the actors were still  
learning their lines, but the cinematography reveals a master's 
eye. Like stars in the sky, the images appear and amass in your 
mind: stone and mist, ocean and grass, feet during a funeral march, 
the hands of knitters, a tired man in profile, a climber's rope 
stretched and then snapped.

	House Votes Health-Care Tax Breaks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled House approved a  
package of tax breaks Wednesday to help the uninsured afford health 
care coverage, overriding complaints from Democrats that the plan 
would be financed out of surplus Social Security funds. The vote, 
227-205, was largely along party lines. Democrats said the bill 
would rely on funds in the Social Security surplus to finance the 
tax breaks. It was a prelude to a clash over a White House-backed 
bill to strengthen patients' hands in dealing with their insurance 
companies.

	Expert Says FBI Fired in Waco Siege  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An expert retained by a House panel has  
concluded that videotape of the 1993 Waco cult standoff shows the 
FBI fired shots on the siege's final day, contrary to its denials. 
In The Washington Post, Carlos Ghigliotti, hired by the House 
Government Reform Committee to review siege footage, said he 
determined the FBI fired shots on April 19, 1993. ``I conclude this 
based on the groundview videotapes taken from several different 
angles simultaneously and based on the overhead thermal tape,'' 
Ghigliotti said.

	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Internet media company Yahoo! today  
reported third-quarter profits that exceeded the most optimistic 
Wall Street expectations as advertisers paid more to be seen on the 
No. 1 Web destination. For the three months ended Sept. 30, the 
Santa Clara-based company reported operating income of $40.41 
million, or 14 cents a share, compared to $6.92 million, or 2 cents 
a share, the same period a year ago. Net income was $14.9 million, 
or 5 cents a share, compared to $4.25 million, or 1 cent a share, a 
year earlier.

	Clinton May Delay Nuke Treaty  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today signaled he would  
accept a postponement of next week's Senate vote on a global 
nuclear test ban treaty rather than risk near-certain defeat. 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D., indicated they still hoped to work out some kind 
of deal. But conservatives, led by outspoken treaty foe Sen. Jesse 
Helms, R-N.C., demanded the president request the delay in writing 
and also promise not to seek action on it through the remainder of 
his presidency. The White House rejected that.

	70 Feared Dead in Train Crash  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Searchers working their way through a train  
carriage that was transformed into an inferno in a rush-hour 
collision said the death toll may exceed 70. Twenty-eight people 
are known to have died when the two commuter trains collided 
yesterday morning near London's Paddington Station. They are likely 
to be among the missing 70, but police have not yet identified the 
bodies recovered.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Antarctic ozone hole is smaller than last  
year, NASA scientists reported. The depleted opening high in the

	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFL today picked Houston over Los Angeles for  
its next expansion team, accepting a record $1.1 billion proposal. 
Houston businessman Bob McNair's bid, the richest ever, includes 
the $700 million entry price, plus a $310 million retractable roof 
stadium. Houston will begin play in 2002 in the AFC. NFL owners 
also voted to adjust the league alignment to eight divisions of 
four teams each.

<HEADLINE> Steeler Teammates Defend Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kordell, Kordell, Kordell.  
</P>
<P>
	One player is being blamed for an offensive breakdown that is  
threatening to ruin a second successive Pittsburgh Steelers season, 
and it's not the left guard or the right tackle or the tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why some of quarterback Kordell Stewart's teammates  
rushed to his defense -- too bad for him they're not rushing on 
offense -- and said it's time to quit singling out one player when 
many are at fault. 
</P>
<P>
	The insinuation: the more Stewart is criticized and chastised  
for everything that is wrong with the Steelers, the less likely he 
is to play himself out of his slump. 
</P>
<P>
	And what a slump it is -- Stewart has one touchdown pass and 11  
interceptions in his last eight starts, only two of which the 
Steelers (2-2) won. Up next on Sunday is Buffalo (3-1) and the 
AFC's third-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate they're giving it all to Kordell,'' said left  
tackle Wayne Gandy, who missed a block on one of the Steelers' two 
fourth-quarter safeties Sunday against Jacksonville. ``They should 
give it to the rest of us, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart wishes the booing would go away but said, ``They booed  
Neil O'Donnell and Mike Tomczak and Terry Bradshaw, and he won four 
Super Bowls here. I understand it goes with the territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gandy said, ``Don't get me wrong. They have a right to boo, and  
I understand it. I love our fans. They cheer us when we play well 
and boo us when we don't, but they always come back. And the only 
way we can stop the booing is to get the ball in the end zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive starters have done that only once since a  
season-opening 43-0 victory in Cleveland, a slump that is beginning 
to resemble that of last year's season-ending five-game losing 
streak. With little room to run, Jerome Bettis has yet to have a 
100-yard game; last year, he had two by now. 
</P>
<P>
	A Steelers defense that ranks first in the AFC has been unable  
to compensate for the shortcomings of an offense that has scored 
one touchdown in 10 quarters, none with the starters on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, it's not just Stewart who is adjusting to offensive  
coordinator Kevin Gilbride's new system. The offensive line, a 
Steelers strength for years, is struggling amid personnel changes 
(two new tackles) and injuries (left guard Alan Faneca, right 
tackle Chris Conrad). 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we haven't played up to the standards that Pittsburgh is  
accustomed to, but it's not been that bad,'' Gandy said. ``That's 
one of the first things I came to understand in the NFL, that if 
the running back isn't getting yardage, the offensive line gets the 
blame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart didn't have any trouble with his confidence or throwing  
in 1997, when he passed for 21 touchdowns and ran for 11. Of 
course, he was well-protected then by left tackle John Jackson, who 
since signed with San Diego, and he had the downfield threat in 
Yancey Thigpen that he currently lacks.

<HEADLINE> Article Leaves Broncos Seething </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Having lost more games in the season's first four  
weeks than all of last year, Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan 
appears to be in danger of losing control of his team. 
</P>
<P>
	In its Oct. 11 issue, Sports Illustrated quotes an unidentified  
Broncos player as saying, ``I hate to say it, but we're finished.'' 
The comment came in the locker room after Denver's 21-13 loss to 
the New York Jets on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports Illustrated writer Michael Silver said about 15 players --  
``virtually one at every position'' -- told him the season is all 
but lost as the Broncos (0-4) face the rest of the season without 
MVP running back Terrell Davis and an unyielding schedule over the 
final 12 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the players is identified in the article, prompting  
Shanahan to issue this edict to his team Wednesday morning: 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, I don't know if someone said that, but if someone feels  
like we're going to be 0-8 or we're going to wind up 3-13, please 
let me know. I'll send you out of here so quick. I don't care if 
want a bus ticket or a plane ticket. Just let me know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one stepped forward, Shanahan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Silver's story also describes a dinner scene where one player  
pointed to a row of microbrew vats and said, ``See that big tank on 
the right? That's where I'm headed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another player stood up, stuck a fork to his chest and yelled,  
``We're done,'' according to the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was terrible. It was a bad way of doing business between  
people who you were taking to dinner,'' Denver defensive end Alfred 
Williams said. ``I wouldn't expect any of my dinner conversations 
to come up in any newspaper, no matter what the situation was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver said Wednesday he understands why some players would be  
upset, but explained that he was trying to give readers an idea of 
how the Broncos are dealing with adversity in the wake of two Super 
Bowl championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying these quotes mean the Broncos will quit,''  
Silver said. ``I liken it to that feeling where you're falling off 
a cliff and just when you realize you're about to crash land, you 
have some fun in your free-fall. I don't take it literally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The explanation did not sit well in Denver's locker room. The  
fact that ``We're finished'' graces the magazine cover didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
	``The disturbing part is that's going to be the feeling  
throughout the country,'' fullback Howard Griffith said. ``The 
cover of that magazine pretty much says it all, and that's the way 
we're going to be portrayed. People are going to think the whole 
team feels that way, but that's not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos have given people little reason to believe they can  
become the first team in NFL history to start the season 0-4 and 
win a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to losing Davis to a season-ending knee injury,  
Denver is embroiled in a quarterback controversy that started when 
Shanahan benched Bubby Brister during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan on Wednesday reinstated Brister after Brian Griese  
failed to get a win in the first four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos also placed Davis on injured reserve and replaced  
him on the active roster with offensive lineman Evan Pilgrim. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' backup, Derek Loville, pulled up in practice Wednesday  
with a slight injury to his left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he felt a slight cramp, like a charley horse,''  
Shanahan said. ``He doesn't think it's too serious. We didn't want 
to push him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lamentable start to the 1999 season prompted Denver fans to  
lash out, booing Griese during the Jets game and leaving the 
stadium when the Broncos still had a chance to win in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Brister made an obscene gesture toward a group  
of taunting fans, and one spectator threw a metal object that hit 
cornerback Dale Carter just below his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting to realize that we can only depend on  
ourselves,'' Loville said. ``Our fans are acting crazy. We're 
getting hit from every angle. People in the media are taking jabs 
at us now. That's fine because there's going to come a time when 
we're back on top and everyone will be patting us on the back.''

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Tops Earnings Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Internet media company Yahoo! Inc.  
reported third-quarter profits Wednesday that exceeded the most 
optimistic Wall Street expectations as advertisers paid more to be 
seen on the No. 1 Web destination. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended Sept. 30, the Santa Clara-based  
company reported operating income of $40.41 million, or 14 cents a 
share, compared to $6.92 million, or 2 cents a share, the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are adjusted to reflect companies Yahoo! has  
acquired and a stock split. Including those charges, net income was 
$14.9 million, or 5 cents a share, compared to $4.25 million, or 1 
cent a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The operating results far exceeded expectations of 9 cents a  
share pegged by a survey of analysts by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	While Yahoo! has been consistently topping Wall Street  
expectations, the earnings even bested so-called whisper estimates 
-- unofficial estimates from traders and Internet investing sites -- 
which placed earnings at 12 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's earnings were released after trading had ended.  
Yahoo!'s stock finished up $2.43 3/4, or 1.4 percent, at $175.75 on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market in anticipation of good results. In 
after-hours trading, the company's shares shot up another 4 percent 
to $183.	   Yahoo! reported net sales of $155.1 million, up 134 percent from 
$66.3 million the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the quarter, we achieved record levels in terms of  
revenues, consumer audience, and advertising and merchant 
clients,'' said Tim Koogle, Yahoo's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! has been working to attract new users and advertisers by  
adding online bill payment, expanded shopping, auctions and banking 
access to its free e-mail and chat rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! said more than 105 million unique users worldwide visited  
its sites, helping it maintain its status as the leading Internet 
portal. Combined traffic on Yahoo!'s network increased in September 
to an average of 385 million page views per day, up from 310 
million in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The sites' popularity recently allowed Yahoo! to increase its  
advertising rates and sign new clients, including American 
Greetings, Conseco Insurance, Fila, Hard Rock Cafe, Kellogg's, 
Nordstrom, Office Max, Sega, Viagra and Internet grocer Webvan.

<HEADLINE> Gooden, Baerga Miss Playoff Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Dwight Gooden and Carlos Baerga, two veterans  
with plenty of playoff experience, were left off the Cleveland 
Indians' 25-man postseason roster for the first round against the 
Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Mike Hargrove also decided to add rookie Sean DePaula,  
Steve Reed and Paul Assenmacher to his bullpen, leaving off 
left-handers Mark Langston and Chris Haney. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, who had an inconsistent regular season (3-4, 6.26 ERA)  
was asked to travel with the club during the division series, which 
opens tonight, and was told by Hargrove that he might be added if 
the Indians make it to the AL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not that surprised,'' Gooden told the Plain Dealer. ``They  
said I might get added to the roster if we reach the second round. 
Stuff went on that I didn't agree with on the field, but that has 
nothing to do with how I feel about the club. I'm honored they 
asked me to stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden started Game 2 of the division series last October, but  
was ejected in the first inning along with Hargrove for arguing 
with plate umpire Joe Brinkman. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, 34, who never has won a playoff game, spent part of the  
year as the Indians' No. 5 starter and also worked out of the 
bullpen. On several occasions this season he was pulled from 
starts, twice missing a chance to oppose former teammate David Cone 
and the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga joined the Indians for the second time in his career in  
an August trade with San Diego when Cleveland was desperate for a 
backup third baseman after Travis Fryman injured a knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga batted only .228 with one homer and five RBIs in 22  
games. He was told the Indians wanted more speed on the roster and 
decided to keep outfielder Dave Roberts over him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's fair what they've done,'' said Baerga, an  
All-Star second baseman on the Indians' 1995 World Series team. 
``When you go to the playoffs you want to go with experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga would have given the Indians another left-handed batter  
against Boston's Pedro Martinez. Baerga is 7-for-10 in his career 
against the Red Sox' ace. 
</P>
<P>
	DePaula may be the biggest surprise. The right-hander began the  
season at Class A Kinston but has been impressive since being 
called up Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last 10 appearances, DePaula has allowed two runs and  
struck out 18 in 11 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Assenmacher had a dreadful regular season (8.18 ERA) but the  
14-year veteran was kept on the roster because of his postseason 
success. He is 2-0 with a 2.84 ERA in 35 postseason appearances.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Democrats Duel Over Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The partisan duel over Social Security  
continued Wednesday as the Senate signaled support for using 
across-the-board spending cuts to keep from tapping the pension 
program's surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	By 54-46, the Senate approved a non-binding, Republican  
resolution advocating unspecified, across-the-board cuts in all 13 
annual spending bills for the new fiscal year. Sen. John McCain, 
R-Ariz., a presidential contender, was the only senator to cross 
party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the Senate voted 54-46 to reject a Democratic  
alternative, with defections by Sens. John Edwards, D-N.C., James 
Jeffords, R-Vt., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. That non-binding 
measure said instead of across-the-board cuts, Congress should 
close tax loopholes and find other unspecified savings to pay for 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither vote advanced Congress' overdue spending bills for  
fiscal 2000, which began Friday. Rather, a battle for political 
positioning was under way, with Republicans casting themselves as 
champions of Social Security and Democrats accusing the GOP of 
seeking dangerous cuts in popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is to make absolutely certain we don't dip into  
or spend Social Security surplus money,'' said Senate Majority Whip 
Don Nickles, R-Okla., defending across-the-board cuts as a sensible 
way to prevent that if other savings cannot be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do my colleagues really want to go on record cutting  
education?'' asked Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., following that 
with anti-crime, health research, and other programs no politician 
wants to be seen as slashing. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid some internal grumbling, congressional Republicans --  
especially in the House -- are considering across-the-board 
reductions to keep from eating into Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans have been considering a 2.7 percent cut to  
achieve that. The White House budget office said it would really 
take a 9 percent reduction, and produced a five-page memo asserting 
that such cuts would have a ``severe impact'' on defense, education 
and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, President Clinton has signed only four of the 13 bills  
for fiscal 2000, vetoed one and threatened to veto five others. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House-Senate bargainers working on one of the most  
contentious spending bills were ready to roll back some 
House-approved cuts in NASA and housing -- if administration 
officials could provide savings to pay for them, said congressional 
participants who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget chief Jack Lew was talking to lawmakers about  
finding the savings. But the two sides had not yet agreed on dollar 
amounts to be restored or how the extra spending would be paid for, 
an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said if an agreement on savings was reached,  
lawmakers would provide 50,000 new rental housing vouchers for 
low-income families that Clinton has requested, the $13.6 billion 
he sought for the space program, and restore the national service 
Americorps program. 
</P>
<P>
	The House had approved none of the housing vouchers, voted to  
kill Americorps, and pared $900 million from Clinton's NASA 
request. White House officials have cited both in their threats to 
veto a $97 billion measure financing housing, veterans, environment 
and space programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were other disputes surrounding the bill that leave  
its fate uncertain. House-Senate negotiators were hoping to meet 
formally on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, Congress sent Clinton its sixth spending bill  
as the Senate voted 51-49 to approve a $12.6 billion foreign aid 
bill. Clinton has threatened to veto it because it provides $1.9 
billion less than he wants, including none of the $500 million he 
requested for Israel and the Palestinians to implement the Wye 
River peace pact between them.

<HEADLINE> More Damage Reported in Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The earthquake in Taiwan destroyed more  
than 44,000 homes, local governments say, a number four times 
larger than the central government's count, a statistics agency 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The central government planned to investigate the difference in  
the figures, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and 
Statistics said in a statement detailing the discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
	The central government says the Sept. 21 quake totally  
demolished 10,816 housing units. Local governments put the number 
at 44,344, the statistics agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the higher number is correct, it could mean more bad news for  
the island's banks, which face the threat of having to absorb the 
balance of uncollected mortgages from destroyed homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Local governments also reported that the quake partially damaged  
35,460 homes, nearly four times the figure of 8,333 homes reported 
by the central government, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7.6-magnitude earthquake killed 2,295 people and injured  
8,731, the government said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Phony Doctor Disfigured Clients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Beach Police say a man posing as a surgeon  
left at least three clients badly disfigured, including a man who 
wanted enhanced pectoral muscles but woke up with female breast 
implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinaldo Silvestre, 58, has been charged with practicing  
medicine without a license, assisted aggravated battery and 
administering narcotics without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time did he have a license to practice medicine  
anywhere,'' Miami Beach Police Capt. Charles Press said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ocean Health Center, where Silvestre worked for at least a  
year charging clients $3,000 to $4,000 for cosmetic surgery, has 
been closed and most of the equipment has been sold, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	They believe Silvestre may have left the country.  
</P>
<P>
	The operations Silvestre performed on champion bodybuilder  
Alexander Baez and at least two women resulted in gross 
disfigurement and severe physical and emotional pain, police said. 
Investigators said there may be other victims who are too 
embarrassed to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez said he went to Silvestre to have his chest muscles  
enhanced and instead awoke with the implants. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me everything was OK,'' said Baez, 47. ``I couldn't  
talk. They sent me home immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baez, Milady Pimienta and Jeanette Bernal have sued Silvestre  
for $1 million, attorney Spencer Aronfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aronfeld said that Ms. Bernal's breasts were mutilated and that  
veterinary anesthesia had been used on Baez, who woke up three 
times during the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic's anesthesiologist, Julio Montesdeoca, 56, and  
Silvestre's assistant and fiancee, Sophie Bozza, 51, were arrested, 
and police were searching for Silvestre.

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Javier Solana stepped down as NATO

European Union's foreign policy representative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to continue working with the same agenda --the  
agenda of security in Europe,'' Solana said at NATO headquarters on 
his last day in office. The former Spanish foreign minister is 
scheduled to begin his new EU post Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana will be replaced by Britain's defense secretary, George  
Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without any doubt, he will be a splendid secretary general. He  
has profound experience in defense matters, political matters,'' 
Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his farewell news conference, Solana recalled his often  
tumultuous time as NATO's top civilian official. He focused on the 
air campaign against Yugoslavia, which forced the retreat of Serb 
forces from Kosovo, and the entry into NATO of its first new allies 
from the old East bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana said the March 16 flag-raising ceremony at NATO  
headquarters to mark the entry of Poland, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic into the alliance had been one of the most memorable 
moments of his term. 
</P>
<P>
	``It represents the triumph of justice over history,'' Solana  
said at the time. The entry of the three eastern European countries 
raised the number of NATO countries from 16 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
	He also recalled visiting Kosovo Albanian refugees in Macedonia  
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``Less than a month later, I saw some of these people again in  
Kosovo, back in their homes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of refugees streamed into Macedonia and  
Albania during the conflict in Kosovo and many flooded back into 
their homeland after the fighting ended June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana said another high point was the signing of the  
Russia-NATO Founding Act of Mutual Relations, Cooperation and 
Security in May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, signed in Paris, was aimed at promoting closer  
cooperation between Russia and NATO on security issues to allay 
Moscow's concerns over the alliance's overtures toward eastern 
European nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are years that will be very difficult to forget. They  
have had a tremendous impact on my political and personal life,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana is no stranger to the EU, serving as Spain's foreign  
minister while his country held the rotating presidency of the EU, 
in the second half of 1994. He became NATO secretary-general in 
December 1995.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Most Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against most leading currencies  
in New York trading Wednesday as wary traders took profits ahead of 
a European central bankers meeting on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0697, down  
from $1.0743 late Tuesday and the British pound dipped to $1.6562 
from $1.6565. The dollar also was quoted at 107.51 Japanese yen, up 
from 106.41. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the European Central Bank will decide whether to  
raise short-term interest rates for the 11 nations that have 
adopted the euro. Britain is not part of the so-called ``euro 
zone.'' The central bank meets every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Many traders believe the European bank will not change interest  
rates, following the example of the Federal Reserve, which left 
rates unchanged Tuesday. But since the euro zone is a relatively 
new entity, currency traders were wary ahead of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of playing poker with someone you haven't played  
with before,'' said Marc Chandler, chief currency strategist at 
Mellon Bank. ``The market wanted to even up going into the ECB 
meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese purchases of dollars, meanwhile, helped boost the U.S.  
currency, said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange 
Analytics in Essex, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's the beginning of a tidal wave of Japanese  
savings moving back into the United States, but there's a little 
more buying,'' said Gilmore. ``People are still a little bit 
wary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4891 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4815, and 1.4693 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4718. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8282  
German marks, up from 1.8206; 6.1318 French francs, up from 6.1059; 
and 1,809.94 Italian lire, up from 1,802.36 lire.

<HEADLINE> Padres Claim Hasen As Infielder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Padres made several moves  
Wednesday, including claiming infielder Jed Hansen off waivers from 
the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen hit .203 with three homers and five RBIs in 49 games in  
his third big league stint. He has played second base and 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres also reinstated catcher Carlos Hernandez and  
left-hander Randy Myers to the 40-man roster from the 60-day 
disabled list, and reinstated right-hander Brian Boehringer from 
the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez (ruptured Achilles' tendon) and Myers (rotator cuff)  
both missed the entire season. Boehringer underwent shoulder 
surgery in August after going 6-6 with a 3.24 ERA in 33 games, 
including 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres outrighted right-handers Stan Spencer, Matt Whiteside  
and Isabel Giron to Triple-A Las Vegas. Right-hander Carlos Reyes 
was claimed off waivers by Philadelphia and left-hander Heath 
Murray was claimed by Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> States Push Up Against Y2K Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With less than three months to go, several  
states are pushing up against the Jan. 1 deadline in their scramble 
to ensure Y2K computer problems do not disrupt basic public 
services, officials said at a House hearing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials stressed that states generally have done a good  
job in either fixing computers or installing backup systems to 
prevent interruptions in such services as food stamps, Medicaid 
payments, unemployment benefits and child nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``But some state completion dates are so close to the turn of  
the century that the risk of disruption to their programs is 
substantially increased,'' said Joel Willemssen of the General 
Accounting Office, the investigative wing of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of American lives will be harshly disrupted if these  
vital programs fail,'' said Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman of 
the House Government Reform subcommittee that has followed the Y2K 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Many older computers read only the last two digits in a year and  
could malfunction if they mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 
1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agencies have been given high ratings in addressing  
computer problems in 43 ``high impact'' programs. But states are 
responsible for administering 10 of those programs, not one of 
which is expected to be fully compliant until year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Watkins of the Agriculture Department said Georgia will  
not have its Women, Infant and Children (WIC) nutrition program 
ready until December, and Maryland is to fix its child nutrition 
program in December. She said both states have backup systems and 
there will be no interruptions in service. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Hugler of the Labor Department said the District of  
Columbia will not fix its unemployment insurance program until the 
end of the year. California still has some work left to do on its 
unemployment benefits program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO, in a report issued Wednesday to the Senate Finance  
Committee, listed New Mexico, New Hampshire, North Carolina and the 
Virgin Islands as high risk in terms of having their Medicaid 
benefits systems ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama, Alaska, Massachusetts, the Virgin Islands and Puerto  
Rico were given high risk ratings for Medicaid information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little bit of disappointment that many of the  
providers have not taken this serious enough,'' said John Callahan 
of the Health and Human Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Benzen of the National Association of State Information  
Resource Executives, which represents 48 state chief information 
officers, said 43 member states accounting for more than 94 percent 
of the nation's population are now at least 75 percent compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the states with lower than 70 percent of their mission  
critical systems compliant were Alabama, Hawaii and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzen said it was hard to classify state performances because  
the situation is changing daily as states rush to complete work. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico, for example, which got a high-risk rating for its  
Medicaid system, said that while it had encountered problems in 
testing its computer upgrades, those problems had been resolved and 
they expected to get a low risk rating in the next review.

<HEADLINE> Nevadans Take on Federal Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- State and federal officials are fearing  
violence this weekend when hundreds of citizens with pickaxes and 
shovels try to reopen a road that has been kept closed to protect a 
threatened fish. 
</P>
<P>
	State Assemblyman John Carpenter plans to lead up to 1,000  
people to the Jarbidge River near the Idaho state line to rebuild 
the dirt road, which is in a national forest. The protesters claim 
the road has belonged to Elko County for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid the potential for an explosive confrontation is  
high,'' said Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute involves a 1.5-mile section of road that leads to a  
campground and outhouse in the Humboldt Toiyabe-National Forest. A 
flood washed the road out in 1995 and the Forest Service decided 
not to rebuild it because eroding soil could foul the river and 
threaten the bull trout, which is now protected under the 
Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials won't say how they intend to  
respond if the volunteers begin reconstructing the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they stop people, they'll never hear the end of it,''  
Carpenter said. ``This is an absolute peaceful work party. We don't 
advocate violence and never will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general asked Elko County officials to help  
stop the rebellion in Jarbidge, a historic mining town in a canyon 
so remote most Nevadans can't get there without driving north into 
the Idaho wilderness and then back south into Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Neil Harris said only that he will help keep the peace.  
</P>
<P>
	``To send a small contingent of federal law enforcement up there  
to issue citations or make arrests could cause the thing to become 
somewhat violent,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Desmond Tutu Awarded Sydney Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whose  
impassioned pleas and sermons helped end apartheid in South Africa, 
today was named the second winner of the Sydney Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1984 Nobel Peace laureate's award was announced by South  
African author Bryce Courtenay on behalf of Sydney University's 
Peace Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 prize and $33,000 will be presented to Tutu at a Sydney  
ceremony in November. Courtenay described Tutu as one of the 
century's foremost crusaders for peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``This small, diminutive man, is the general, the field marshal  
of peace, who stood on the front line and waged peace,'' Courtenay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a message read at a ceremony announcing the decision, Tutu  
said the struggle for peace with justice was a responsibility for 
people throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am thrilled and honored to be selected as a recipient of the  
Sydney Peace Prize, which symbolizes both peace with justice and 
human rights,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, its inaugural year, the Sydney Peace Prize was awarded  
to professor Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank in 
Bangladesh, which gives small loans to the poor to help them emerge 
from poverty.

<HEADLINE> Kidnappers Send Runner Into Exile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When Ronaldo da Costa trains, no one interrupts him to ask for  
an autograph. When he leaves his house, reporters don't follow. 
When he and his girlfriend go out for a pizza at night, no one 
bothers them. 
</P>
<P>
	Simple pleasures, maybe, but after the terrifying events of the  
last month, the world record-holder in the marathon appreciates 
them more than he ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have peace of mind,'' he said Wednesday through an  
interpreter. ``Nobody is stopping me in the streets to talk and 
talk and talk. The press is not following me everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most importantly, now that he lives in Boulder, Colo., no one is  
trying to kidnap him. Da Costa and his girlfriend fled Brazil two 
weeks ago after suspected kidnappers came looking for him three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have money in Brazil, it's not secure,'' said da Costa,  
who will race for the first time since the kidnapping attempts 
later this month in the Chicago Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Da Costa became an instant celebrity when he won the Berlin  
Marathon in a record 2 hours, 6.05 seconds, shattering by 45 
seconds Belayneh Densamo's record that had stood for 10 years. A 
Brazilian television crew flew to Berlin and accompanied him home 
and then flew him by helicopter to his rural hometown of 
Descoberto. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters followed him wherever he went, and he was on  
television all the time. Fans were constantly asking for a picture 
or autograph. He even got stopped when he was training. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very likable person,'' said his agent, Luis Felipe  
Posso. ``We went to Monaco last November, and after we checked into 
the hotel we went for a walk. There was a group of Brazilian 
tourists, and everybody recognized him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But violence, fueled by drugs and high unemployment, has soared  
in Brazil in recent years, and the newly popular da Costa was a 
natural target. A month ago, a friend called to tell him two big, 
strong-looking men were at the gate at da Costa's house in the 
small town of Sao Joao Neponuceno, asking for the runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The next night, after midnight, three armed men came looking for  
da Costa. The police were called, but no arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
	The following week, da Costa was in Rio de Janeiro for a race  
when his friend called again. The kidnappers were back. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrified, da Costa and his girlfriend flew to San Diego the  
next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't even bring training gear,'' Posso said. ``That's how  
scared he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Da Costa was so shaken by the kidnapping attempts he withdrew  
from the Great North Run, a half-marathon this Sunday in Newcastle, 
England. He could barely think about running, let alone a race. 
</P>
<P>
	He considered dropping out of the Chicago Marathon, too, even  
though the course for the Oct. 24 is perfectly suited for him. It's 
fast and flat, just like Berlin's, and course records have been set 
the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a week in San Diego, da Costa flew to Boulder and  
began training again. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind is clean, and I'm ready to go,'' he said. ``I think I  
can perform a good race, but I recognize I'm not in the same shape 
as I was before the kidnapping attempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Da Costa, who plans to stay in the United States, is  
uncomfortable talking about the kidnapping attempts. No one was 
ever arrested, and he worries about the family he left in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd like to just forget, push the memories out of his mind like  
a bad dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand why,'' he said. ``I'm very innocent. I'm  
trying to do my job, and somebody is trying to kidnap me. It is the 
biggest shock I've had.''

<HEADLINE> 'NSyn Mobbed at 'Secret' TV Shoot </HEADLINE>

<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Members of the boy band 'NSync were mobbed  
while on a supposedly secret shoot for the TV show ``Touched by an 
Angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Word wasn't supposed to get out that the band was making a quick

CBS executive Chris Ender said two disc jockeys at radio station 
KZHT told listeners the group was in town signing autographs and 
announced the set location.

	``It was a major inconvenience and definite cause for concern  
when more than 200 people show up unexpectedly on the set of a 
television show,'' Ender said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Sly, marketing manager at KZHT, denied the DJs revealed the  
location.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Software Malfunctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Glitches in software being installed to run the  
Nasdaq Stock Market's stock quote display system during after-hours 
trading sessions forced the temporary shutdown of three electronic 
trading networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Instinet, Island and Brass Utility, known as Brut -- three of the  
largest electronic communication networks, or ECNs -- were all back 
online early Wednesday afternoon after blackouts ranging from 2 1/2 to 
3 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A Nasdaq spokesman said the software meltdown caused delays in  
transfers of information on Nasdaq's SelectNet system, which is an 
electronic network that links all Nasdaq market participants. 
</P>
<P>
	When brokers and Nasdaq market makers tried to complete trades  
on the three affected ECNs via SelectNet, the orders came through 
late and were, in many cases, canceled or otherwise disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	The delays on SelectNet eventually forced the Nasdaq to remove  
stock price information related to the three ECNs from the Nasdaq's 
price quote display system, effectively shutting the ECNs down. 
</P>
<P>
	The blackouts began around 10 a.m. EDT. Island was back online  
at 12:37 p.m.; Instinet at 1 p.m., and Brut at 1:04 p.m., according 
to the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an issue today with the slowness of the SelectNet  
system. Thus, we reduced the volume of activity by removing several 
high traffic ECNs temporarily from the system, both voluntarily and 
at our request, to allow the rest of the market to operate 
normally,'' J. Patrick Campbell, the Nasdaq's chief operating 
officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The blackout didn't go over well with at least one of the ECNs.  
</P>
<P>
	Cameron Smith, Island's legal counsel, complained that Nasdaq  
withdrew Island's quotes from the Nasdaq's display system without 
Island's consent, causing Island to lose the 25 percent of its 
business that is channeled through Nasdaq's systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's troubling for us,'' Smith said. ``Because of the delays,  
we were denied trades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brut president Brian Hyndman said his ECN risked losing  
credibility with its customers. But he was philosophical about the 
blackout. ``We want Nasdaq to correct the problem so we can all 
move forward. It was really just a bump in the road,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instinet officials didn't immediately return calls seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, it's because of ECNs that offer extended hours  
trading sessions to their customers -- including the three that were 
hit Wednesday -- that the Nasdaq agreed to keep its quote display 
system open until 6:30 p.m., 75 minutes past the traditional 5:15 
p.m. closing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq officials said they expect to begin offering the extended  
quotes on Monday, pending approval from the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq announced last month that its systems that track stock  
prices and trading volume will keep operating longer to help 
provide more information to investors who trade after hours through 
electronic networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is significant because price and volume information on  
after-hour trades on all ECNs will become available at one central 
source for the first time. Currently, after-hours investors only 
can see trades conducted on the networks they use, although the 
ECNs have discussed creating a central information system.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 30  
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times, on underage drivers:  
</P>
<P>
	Those who griped about Washington's new .08 blood-alcohol limit  
will rub their eyes at the blood-alcohol limit for underage 
drivers: Blowing a .02 is enough to lose your license and ruin your 
driving record. 
</P>
<P>
	For most people, that's one drink or less.  
</P>
<P>
	This fall, state agencies are busy beefing up a media campaign  
about the state's tough underage drinking and driving laws, adding 
billboards, banners, school posters and newspaper ads. This is a 
necessary step for laws with such specific and lasting consequences 
for young drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers under 21 with a blood-alcohol content of .02 to .07 lose  
their license for 90 days. They also face higher insurance 
premiums, legal fees and fines. As a misdemeanor offense, it 
carries a maximum fine and jail time of $1,000 and 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who refuse the test lose their license for a year.  
</P>
<P>
	In King County alone, 661 drivers aged 16 to 20 have been  
arrested under the tough new standard since January. Washington 
state has the utmost responsibility to ensure its younger 
designated drivers know they're a traffic stop and a Bud away from 
the damning label of a drunken driver.

	Abdelaziz Bouteflika became president of Algeria without a  
popular mandate last April because all the other candidates 
withdrew on the eve of election day, charging prearranged fraud. He 
received a mandate of a sort earlier this month when 98 percent of 
the voters approved a referendum that asked a simple question: Do 
the Algerian people want peace? 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, there have been signs that a country that appeared  
lost to barbarity may be emerging from the dark. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But there can be no justification for the atrocities committed  
in the name of Islamic fundamentalism. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Only now is there a glimmer of hope that the horror may be  
ebbing. The referendum also gave popular backing to an amnesty law 
that allows militants who do not have blood on their hands to 
return to society. So far more than 300 fundamentalist radicals 
have taken advantage of the amnesty. ... Algeria may be coming out 
of its tunnel of terror.

Hurricane Floyd flooding: 
</P>
<P>
	Now that everyone from kindergarten kids to the president has  
seen the awesome power of eastern North Carolina's normally placid 
creeks and rivers, it is time to apply common sense to the 
rebuilding of that battered region. 
</P>
<P>
	Developers, homeowners, business people and government leaders  
alike need to keep uppermost in mind the sobering fact that a flood 
as enormous as the so-called ``500-year flood'' that followed 
Hurricane Floyd could come again next month or next year. ... 
</P>
<P>
	With that reality in mind -- and the sight and scent of miles of  
floodwaters reeking of raw sewage, oil, chemicals and dead animals 
to drive it home -- it makes no environmental, business or any other 
kind of sense to make the same mistakes again.

	Los Angeles Times, on the MCI WorldCom-Sprint Corp. merger:  
</P>
<P>
	The emergence of the telecom supercarriers poses the biggest  
challenge for regulators in the long run. Of immediate concern in 
the MCI-Sprint merger, aside from diminished competition in the 
long-distance market, is the new company's dominance of the 
Internet backbone, the network through which Internet services are 
delivered. Combined, the two companies would control about half of 
the Internet backbone assets. To preserve competition, the 
regulators might require Sprint to sell its Internet network. 
</P>
<P>
	Blockbuster telecommunications deals are changing the face of  
the industry. The new telecom giants must now convince the 
regulators that consumers' interests will not be lost in the 
shuffle.

	The Charleston Gazette of Charleston, W.Va., on population:  
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Population Fund has specified Oct. 12 as the estimated  
date when the human swarm will hit 6 billion -- having doubled since 
1960 and tripled in a single lifespan. Astounding. ... However, 
hardly anyone notices the exponential overbreeding. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Overpopulation ravages the environment, causing pollution and  
erosion, filling the air and water with contaminants, wiping out 
rain forests, exterminating wildlife, destroying fertile land, 
leading to hunger. Health deteriorates where human congestion 
spawns epidemics and malnutrition. Tens of thousands of 
malnourished children die daily. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, northward migration and other population changes  
rapidly are altering America. The Census Bureau predicts that the 
number of Americans will rise from 268 million today to 394 million 
50 years from now -- and 90 percent of the growth will be among 
minorities. ... 
</P>
<P>
	What effect will this ``browning of America'' have on the racist  
``patriot'' fringe which feels that the only genuine America is a 
lily-white America? Will armed neo-Nazi groups fade as minorities 
grow -- or will they turn more violent against what they perceive as 
a threat? We can't predict what right-wing extremists will do ...

	Chicago Tribune, on the nuclear testing treaty ban:  
</P>
<P>
	The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty now before the Senate would  
outlaw all underground testing of nuclear weapons and would 
restrain nuclear proliferation around the globe. It has been signed 
by 154 countries, including the U.S., Russia and China. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty would lock in America's enormous technological lead  
in nuclear weapons, while putting pressure on other nuclear states 
-- India, Pakistan and Israel, among others -- to sign on. It might 
also discourage potential nuclear states like North Korea or Iran 
from pursuing the bomb. ... 
</P>
<P>
	No treaty is perfect, but the potential benefits of this one far  
exceed its costs, and it is far too important to America's -- and 
the world's -- security to let partisan differences scuttle it. ... 
It would be a tragedy if the U.S. were to squander this chance to 
show leadership in a cause designed to make the world a safer place 
-- especially when it can be done at minimal cost to our own 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	Other nations, especially Russia and China, are waiting for the  
U.S. to make the first move before they ratify. But if we fail to 
show credible leadership, efforts at banning nuclear testing 
forever could falter. That would benefit no one, least of all 
Americans.

	Springfield (Ohio) News-Sun, on American stinginess:  
</P>
<P>
	Let us hope people take notice of what Jimmy Carter said in an  
interview on the occasion of his 75th birthday anniversary. Never 
one to comfort the comfortable, Carter observed with dismay that 
America has become ``the stingiest nation in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's putting it bluntly, but it's the truth. With the chasm  
between rich and poor nations expanding to Grand Canyon 
proportions, Washington has cut back spending for overseas economic 
development, and the trend toward official U.S. miserliness has 
only accelerated after the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering all the former U.S. foreign-aid clients who have  
turned into major trading partners, cutting foreign aid to the bone 
not only smacks of stinginess; it makes no sense from a practical 
standpoint either.

	It's not surprising that Europe has been tripped up lately by  
British beef, angry truckers and a few less hours of work a week. 
It shows that Europe has moved from the abstract to the concrete, 
from the experts to the citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	The period of great ideological confrontation is finished, or  
almost, and the primacy of certain member states is considerably 
reduced -- even if certain of their leaders want to keep giving an 
illusion of their strength. ... 
</P>
<P>
	We are seeing a new genre emerge in public affairs: precaution.  
Public opinion is very sensitive, so politicians prefer to warn us 
than to risk new scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	The French government has chosen this plan of action, by  
upsetting Britain, by standing up against Brussels. It has chosen 
instead to reassure its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	So we must learn to live in Europe, being worried about  
participating in the European market and at the same time careful 
to preserve our identities.

<P>
	Like the other nation states of the world, India is entangled in  
an exaggerated patriotism which leaves little room for tolerance. 
By giving a new mandate to the Hindu party, the majority of the 
billion citizens are trying to show their desire to be ``at home'' 
in this immense country, to the detriment of those who are 
different: Muslims and other ethnic or religious minorities who do 
not live the same way. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Even if poverty means that less than half of Indians watch  
television, globalization is a familiar term because of the 3,000 
daily newspapers published in the country. The media sets out the 
western criticisms of the ``particularities'' of this clayfooted 
giant, such as child labor or the social hierarchy.

</P>
<P>
	Policy-makers at the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central  
Bank and the Bank of England will this week decide what to do about 
interest rates. The Fed's decision is by far the most important for 
the world economy. It is also the most difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. inflation rate is undoubtedly set to accelerate. Oil  
and many commodity prices are up, while labor market conditions in 
the U.S. show signs of tightening. Economic recovery in Asia and 
Europe means that the benign disinflationary impact of the Asian 
crisis is now waning. There is a risk that the vulnerability of the 
U.S. to inflation could be increased by dollar weakness. ... 
</P>
<P>
	What is certain is that with the stock market off its peak and  
looking increasingly nervous, an interest rate increase now would 
carry a high risk of bringing it all down with a bump. A rise is

	An increase in military power and groundswell of patriotism in  
China arouse wariness among its neighbors. China's growing military 
power, with its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, is harmful 
to the relations between Japan and China - and to stability in 
Asia. And yet, needlessly emphasizing China's threat also heightens 
tension in this part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	It is important that China join the frameworks for building a  
new international order and for promoting trade. One should not 
overvalue China or look down on it as a `giant developing country.' 
It is important to view China as it really is and levelheadedly do 
business with it. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The future of the Earth cannot be discussed without regard to  
China. It should be understood that the global problems posed by 
the giant neighbor - which will grow still larger in the years 
ahead - will be a menace to the world.

<HEADLINE> Russian Forces Strike Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces battered Chechnya with  
airstrikes and artillery Wednesday as Moscow's top brass considered 
whether to push deeper into the breakaway region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians rained artillery shells on northwestern Chechnya  
and carried out bombing raids in the east, Chechen officials said. 
There was no immediate word on casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Russian forces may mount new  
offensives toward Grozny, the capital, and other towns. Russia has 
given few indications of its strategy, forcing the Chechens to 
spread out their forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything will depend on the situation,'' Sergeyev said.  
</P>
<P>
	He maintained the Russians were encountering only ``pockets of  
resistance.'' But Chechen leaders said there was heavy fighting in 
the face of the Russian advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya's Muslim clerics were expected to call for a ``holy  
war'' against Russia, Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek 
Makhashev told the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov declared Wednesday that he was  
taking direct command of the armed forces. Several powerful Islamic 
warlords oppose Maskhadov's government. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov also has declared martial law, and his government says  
the economy will be placed on war footing. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia stepped up its economic campaign against Chechnya, saying  
it would cut off electricity and withhold food shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Russia sent ground forces into Chechnya following  
weeks of heavy air attacks. Russian officials say their forces have 
seized a third of Chechyna -- the plains north of the Terek River. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians may halt on the Terek's north banks, where troops  
have been fortifying their positions. Moving across the river would 
bring the Russians into hilly territory and subject them to Chechen 
guerrilla attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia suffered a devastating defeat in the 1994-96 war with  
Chechnya. The latest fighting began after Muslim guerrillas based 
in Chechnya invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in 
August and September. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets of Grozny were largely deserted Wednesday. Some food  
markets were operating, but most men on the streets were in 
military uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The wing of a Russian Su-25 war plane that was shot down Monday  
was placed on a pedestal in Grozny's central square. The plane was 
one of two brought down by Chechen fighters in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy that this aircraft was shot down,'' said a woman  
who gave her name only as Rosa. ``It means the Russians can't bomb 
us with impunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have been bombing Chechnya for weeks, and many of  
the attacks have been concentrated in and around Grozny, destroying 
oil refineries, brick yards and suspected bases of Islamic 
militants. 
</P>
<P>
	The raids have prompted at least 125,000 civilians to flee, with  
most heading to the neighboring republic of Ingushetia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The local hospitals ... just cannot provide the sick refugees  
with medical aid,'' Ingushetia's President Ruslan Aushev told 
Interfax. ``Children sleep on the ground and have very few warm 
clothes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Minister of Nationalities Vyacheslav Mikhailov blamed  
the exodus on the Chechens. ``When the terrorists are using their 
own people as a shield to save themselves, hundreds and thousands 
of people begin to leave their homes,'' he said, according to 
Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia blames Chechnya-based militants for apartment explosions  
in Russia that killed some 300 people last month.

	TREVISO, Italy (AP) -- A Moldovian rider was thrown out of the  
World Cycling Championships for failing a blood test before today's 
elite men's time trial, the sport's governing body said. 
</P>
<P>
	Igor Bonciucov, who had a red blood cell count higher than the  
allowed level, is the first rider to be banned at the 
championships, which began Monday. He was among 12 cyclists from 
six countries tested today, the International Cycling Union said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ICU tested 26 riders Tuesday, and all passed.  
</P>
<P>
	Bonciucov was not among the favorites for the 31.4-mile time  
trial. He finished 33rd in the time trial at the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians, meanwhile, said that one of their entrants in  
Saturday's junior men's road race will be replaced because he 
failed a test administered by the team today. 
</P>
<P>
	Giacomo Garofoli is the second cyclist Italy has removed from  
its roster after a blood-and-urine test. 
</P>
<P>
	A high red blood cell count can be a signal of the use of the  
banned growth hormone EPO, but it also can occur naturally. 
</P>
<P>
	EPO, or erythropoietin, allows users to cram oxygen into the  
blood, enhancing their performance levels. It has been linked to 
the deaths of about 20 cyclists since the late 1980s.

<HEADLINE> New York in Baseball Turf Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a simpler time, baseball's postseason did not  
contain quite as many twists and turns. Maybe that's why New York 
managed to have so many Subway Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there are two difficult rounds to get through before New  
York's teams can think about tokens and Metro Cards and the renewal 
of what the city once thought was almost automatic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets and Yankees have an opportunity -- something New York  
has not experienced in 43 years -- to make their city the center of 
the baseball universe once more. Getting there will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate obstacles are Texas and Arizona. Get by those two  
and there will be two more. Still, the city has its eyes on the 
prize, the renewal of what once was a baseball tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a time when it seemed that no matter what else  
happened from April until October, the World Series would end up in 
New York. With three teams playing in town, the chances were 
awfully good. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been 13 World Series played entirely in New York. And  
in the decade from 1947-56, there were seven Subway Series 
involving the Giants, Yankees and Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the era of Willie, Mickey and the Duke, when three Hall  
of Fame center fielders set off street corner debates and became 
the inspiration for balladeer Terry Cashman's anthem, ``Talkin' 
Baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mays, Mantle and Snider weren't all those teams had going for  
them. There were miracle finishes -- Bobby Thomson's pennant-winning 
homer on Oct. 3, 1951, that thrust the Giants instead of the 
Dodgers into the Series, and the Yankees beating Boston on the 
final two days of the 1949 season to start Casey Stengel's dynasty 
of nine pennants in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees' dominance meant half of the World Series was  
virtually guaranteed to be in New York. Frequently, the other half 
wound up there, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The intracity rivalries began with three straight Subway Series  
between the Giants and Yankees from 1921-23. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees rented space in the Polo Grounds from the Giants and  
lost the first two Series. But with Babe Ruth hitting home runs at 
a record rate, they began outdrawing their landlords, and Giants 
boss John McGraw ordered them out. They constructed their own 
Stadium a short walk away and punctuated its opening season by 
beating the Giants in a World Series that didn't need a subway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won rematches with the Giants in 1936-37 with a  
young Joe DiMaggio doing much of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Dodgers stepped up to take their turn, facing the  
Yankees for the first time in 1941. Catcher Mickey Owen's muff on a 
last-out third strike opened the doors for a decisive Yankees rally 
in Game 4 and they finished Brooklyn off the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers and Yankees went at each other again in 1947 when  
Bill Bevens took a no-hitter into the ninth inning of Game 4, but 
lost it on the only hit he allowed, a pinch double by Cookie 
Lavagetto. The Yankees won in seven. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, the Yankees defeated the Dodgers again in five games.  
Tommy Henrich's leadoff homer in the bottom of the ninth inning 
broke up a scoreless duel between Brooklyn's Don Newcombe and New 
York's Allie Reynolds in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants nosed out the Dodgers in 1951, but the Yankees were  
not interested in extending the Thomson miracle and won in six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the Dodgers had assembled The Boys of Summer, a lineup  
that included four Hall of Famers -- Snider, Jackie Robinson, Pee 
Wee Reese and Roy Campanella. They lost Subway Series to the 
Yankees in seven games in 1952 and in six games in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in 1955, the Dodgers won their first World Series,  
helped by a one-handed catch by left fielder Sandy Amoros in Game 7 
as Johnny Podres pitched a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, the teams met again, a Subway Series featuring Don  
Larsen's perfect game -- the first and only no-hitter in World 
Series history -- and won by the Yankees in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Giants and Dodgers were lured to California, ending an  
era in New York baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were invented in 1962, but by the time they were good  
enough for postseason baseball, the Yankees were not. And when the 
Yankees returned to prominence, the Mets fell on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
	That reversal of fortunes lasted until this season. And now  
there's a chance it could be reversed, restoring a New York 
baseball tradition that evaporated a generation ago.

<HEADLINE> Phony Doctor Disfigured Clients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Beach Police say a man posing as a surgeon  
left at least three clients grossly disfigured, including a man who 
woke up with female breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinaldo Silvestre, 58, has been charged with practicing  
medicine without a license, assisted aggravated battery and 
administering narcotics without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time did he have a license to practice medicine  
anywhere,'' Miami Beach Police Capt. Charles Press told the Miami 
Herald in Wednesday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ocean Health Center, where Silvestre worked for at least a  
year charging clients $3,000 to $4,000 for cosmetic surgery, has 
been closed and most of the equipment has been sold, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	They believe Silvestre may have left the country.  
</P>
<P>
	The operations Silvestre performed on champion bodybuilder  
Alexander Baez and at least two women resulted in gross 
disfigurement and severe physical and emotional pain, police said. 
Investigators said there may be other victims who are too 
embarrassed to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez said he went to Silvestre to have his pectoral muscles  
enhanced and he woke up with female breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me everything was OK,'' said Baez, 47. ``I couldn't  
talk. They sent me home immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baez, Milady Pimienta and Jeanette Bernal have sued Silvestre  
for $1 million, attorney Spencer Aronfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aronfeld said that Ms. Bernal's breasts were mutilated and that  
veterinary anesthesia had been used on Baez, who woke up three 
times during the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic's anesthesiologist, Julio Montesdeoca, 56, and  
Silvestre's assistant and fiancee, Sophie Bozza, 51, were arrested, 
and police were searching for Silvestre.

<HEADLINE> Tampa May Host Soccer Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa has emerged as the frontrunner to host  
Major League Soccer's championship game next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfair to say it's a done deal, but we're very close,''  
said MLS commissioner Don Garber after touring the city's 
two-year-old Raymond James Stadium on Wednesday. ``We'd love to 
bring the game here, absolutely. We've got a little bit of work to 
just ensure that we get all of the detail points finalized. If 
we're able to get there, then we should be able to have our game 
here next fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	RFK Stadium in Washington D.C. is the other site under  
consideration to host MLS Cup 2000, tentatively scheduled for Oct. 
22, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our to lose,'' Tampa Bay Mutiny president and general  
manager Nick Sakiewicz said. ``We have the strongest bid, the best 
stadium and we have a motivated political and business community 
that wants it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several items, including ticket commitments, remain to be  
negotiated between the league and Tampa's MLS Cup 2000 Host 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Garber took part in media roundtable following his stadium tour  
and among the topics he discussed were: 
</P>
<P>
	-- MLS remains committed to adding two teams in 2001. Among the  
cities the league has talked with are Houston, Philadelphia, 
Atlanta, Charlotte and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league will soon announce an ownership change for D.C.  
United. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The future of the shootout will be determined in the next  
four-to-six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's MLS Cup will be held at Foxboro (Mass.) Stadium next  
month.

<HEADLINE> Bush Proposes National Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- As Republican presidential candidate George  
W. Bush calls for mandatory state exams to gauge school performance 
nationwide, a similar program in his home state of Texas has 
brought higher student scores, criticism and a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it (Bush's testing plan) is a horrible idea, given  
the history of the state of Texas'' with a state exam required for 
graduation, said Leticia Saucedo, staff attorney for the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization is representing in a lawsuit Hispanic education  
groups and some minority students who completed their school work 
but did not receive diplomas because they failed the statewide 
academic skills test required to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs argue that the ``exit test'' is invalid and  
discriminatory. State lawyers defend the exam as fair and say the 
gap between minorities and whites is narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills is given  
beginning in elementary school, only the exit test is being 
challenged in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	But others question whether the overall testing program drives  
the public school curriculum and thus narrows students' education 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has driven our scores up dramatically ... The other side of  
the coin is there's a price, and I think teachers have been feeling 
and parents are beginning to feel that price,'' said Jay Levin of 
the Texas State Teachers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a great emphasis placed on the testing in the overall  
academic program, and there's a lot of practice going on for the 
test, which I'm not saying is good or bad. In some situations, it 
does take away the ability to teach more critical thinking skills 
and analytic skills,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say testing is the best way to gauge whether schools  
are doing their job and that Texas' program has worked well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps the public know what they're getting for their money.  
That's important since they pay for it,'' said John Cole of the 
Texas Federation of Teachers, whose national affiliate endorsed 
Vice President Al Gore, a Democrat, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush on Tuesday proposed requiring states to design and  
administer annual tests to students in grades three through eight. 
States that fail to improve after five years would lose some of the 
federal money they receive for elementary and secondary education, 
while improving schools would be eligible for bonus funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, the mandatory test is a key part of the state  
accountability system for schools, which are rated based on student 
scores, dropouts and attendance. The system predates Bush but has 
been strengthened under his tenure as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The test was given this spring to more than 1.8 million Texas  
students in grades three through eight and those preparing to 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those, 78 percent passed all sections of the test. That's up  
from 73 percent last year, and from 53 percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the mere fact that we give a school district a grade  
based on how they're performing in terms of their students 
mastering the state's curriculum has been an enormous motivator for 
teachers, students and administrators,'' said Senate Education 
Committee Chairman Teel Bivins, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational  
Fund lawsuit, which is in mid-trial, Cole, of the Texas teachers 
association, said the state test should not be attacked for showing 
that students haven't mastered the material. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a little bit like saying you want to throw out the  
thermometer because it keeps showing some kids have a fever,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saucedo said her group is concerned about test results being  
used in a way that punishes students since the Texas system long 
has experienced unequal funding among schools and has a ``history 
of unequal educational opportunities among students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we've ever said we're against tests as an  
evaluation tool. Our problem is to use it in a punitive way. I 
think it harms students in the end more than it helps them,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Court Hears Minority Voter Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court pondered on Wednesday the  
federal government's power to squelch changes in state and local 
elections as discriminatory even when the new plans would leave 
racial and ethnic minorities no worse off. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration lawyer Paul Wolfson told the justices  
hearing arguments in a Louisiana case that targets of a key 
voting-rights law are ``not limited to an intent to make matters 
worse for minorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael Carvin, a Washington lawyer representing the Bossier  
Parish, La., school board, said the law seeks only to thwart a new 
plan if it abridges minority voting rights. ``If there is no 
change, it has not abridged the right to vote,'' he argued. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether the Voting Rights Act of 1965 authorizes  
Justice Department vetoes of election plans that are 
non-retrogressive. A three-judge federal court in the District of 
Columbia ruled that no such authority exists. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices' ruling, expected by late June, could affect many  
of the voting-rights disputes likely to arise after the 2000 census 
and ensuing reapportionment efforts. The decision will dictate how 
vigorously the government can invoke one part of the 1965 law. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate case, the justices heard arguments over Hawaii's  
policy of letting only people with Hawaiian blood elect leaders of 
a state program benefiting descendants of the islands' original 
residents. A white citizen of Hawaii says the provision amounts to 
unlawful racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision in that case also is expected by summer.  
</P>
<P>
	The Voting Rights Act's Section 5 requires federal pre-clearance  
of proposed electoral changes, and authorizes denials if the 
changes are deemed to have a discriminatory ``purpose or effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State and local governments covered by Section 5 have the burden  
of proving the changes are not motivated by racial or ethnic bias. 
Several justices commented Wednesday how difficult it can be to 
prove such a negative, and also how hard it is determining the 
motives of multimember governmental bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The parish school board for years has had its members elected to  
four-year terms from 12 different districts. About 20 percent of 
the parish's population is black, concentrated in two areas, but 
none of the 12 districts has a black majority. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 1990, no black ever had been elected to the school board.  
</P>
<P>
	After the 1990 census required a redrawing of the school board  
election map, the local NAACP chapter proposed creating two 
black-majority districts. The school board opted instead for a new 
map in 1992 with no such district, the same map that had been 
adopted by the parish's chief governing body, called the police 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the police jury's plan had received Justice  
Department pre-clearance, the school board's proposed redistricting 
plan did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers decided the plan would dilute minority voting  
strength because it would not maximize it. The Voting Rights Act's 
Section 2 is more stringent than Section 5 because it prohibits any 
voting practice that would dilute minority voting power. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1997 decision, the nation's highest court ruled that  
Justice Department lawyers cannot refuse to approve a proposal 
under Section 5 by deciding the change would violate Section 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said in that ruling that an election change has a  
prohibited Section 5 ``effect'' only if it would be retrogressive -- 
leaving minorities worse off than under a current system. Now it 
must decide whether the same is true for judging a proposed 
change's ``purpose'' under Section 5. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Louisiana case wended its way through federal courts,  
two black candidates were elected to the 12-member school board in 
1994 and were re-elected in 1998, along with a third black 
candidate.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Rakes In $2.3B in Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A five-year fund-raising campaign has  
netted Harvard a staggering $2.3 billion, setting a record for 
university philanthropy and surpassing Harvard's own $2.1 billion 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the campaign went public in 1994, 172,000 donors have  
given money to their alma mater. The fund-raising campaign, which 
has boosted Harvard's endowment to $14.4 billion, concludes Dec. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rare year when Harvard does not raise more support than  
any other institution to start with,'' David Morgan, a vice 
president at the Council for Aid to Education, a New York-based 
research group, said Wednesday. ``It would probably be impossible 
for any other institution to surpass Harvard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, for example, Harvard raised about $463 million,  
followed by Stanford's $313 million, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capital campaigns like the one Harvard is now wrapping up are  
intensified fund-raising programs over a period of time. About a 
dozen schools nationwide are in the midst of campaigns to raise 
more than a billion dollars, including Columbia, with a goal of 
$2.2 billion, and Duke, with a $1.5 billion goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard's total may seem mammoth, but other schools raise more  
money on a per student basis. Last year, Harvard ranked 18th on a 
dollar-per-student ratio, bringing in about $24,800 per student, 
Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Institute of Technology -- the highest-ranking  
undergraduate university on the list -- took in $49,300 per student. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard says its fund-raising machine is necessary to keep  
quality high at America's most famous university. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount raised ``is not that big, if you realize the size and  
scope of Harvard and what's entailed at Harvard,'' said Rita E. 
Hauser, a 1958 graduate of Harvard's law school who helped run the 
fund-raising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard has been criticized in the past for focusing too much on  
its endowment and spending too little on its students, faculty and 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard officials, however, said their campaign has allowed them  
to devote more money to students, including a 20 percent increase 
last fall in financial assistance for undergraduates.

	FCC OKs Ameritech-SBC Merger  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators today approved a merger  
between Ameritech Corp. and SBC Communications, a deal that would 
bring together two regional Bell companies to form the nation's 
largest local phone company. Approval by the Federal Communications 
Commission is the final step for the deal -- originally valued at 
$57 billion -- which already has been cleared by the Justice 
Department and state regulators. Through one of the largest mergers 
in U.S. history, now worth more than $70 billion, the combined 
business would control 57 million, or one-third, of the nation's 
local phone lines spread across 13 states. FCC Chairman Bill 
Kennard said: ``The commission has never approved a more 
comprehensive set of conditions to further competition in local 
markets.'' Ameritech shares were at 68, up 5/16. SBC was at 51 
13/16, up 7/8.

very serious and thorough review.'' Klein, who made the comments 
while in Brussels, Belgium, said he anticipated working with 
European Union antitrust officials on issues raised by the merger. 
At the FCC, regulators will look at the transaction to see whether 
the merged company serves the public interest. William Kennard, the 
Federal Communications Commission chairman, has called the deal ``a 
surrender,'' and said the companies ``will bear a heavy burden to 
show how consumers would be better off.''

will be funded through bank debt. American Cellular has about 
398,000 subscribers in New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, 
Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and 
Illinois. It operates under the Cellular One trade name, which is

	Germany Denies DaimlerChrysler Move

<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- The German government said today it had received  
assurances that DaimlerChrysler will keep its headquarters in 
Germany, even as news media stirred speculation that the automaker 
may be headed across the Atlantic to escape the country's uncertain 
tax future. Hilmar Kopper, chairman DaimlerChrysler's supervisory 
board, assured Finance Minister Hans Eichel that reports of a move 
are false, government spokeswoman Charima Reinhardt said. But 
conjecture about a possible persisted in the media. The 
mass-circulation Bild newspaper on Wednesday quoted an unidentified 
DaimlerChrysler manager as saying co-chairman Juergen Schrempp's 
``favorite is New York'' and that he wants a decision made by the 
beginning of next year.

	PepsiCo's Earnings Rise in 3Q  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- PepsiCo Inc.'s earnings rose 7 percent in the  
third quarter as improved results from its Frito-Lay snacks 
business and Tropicana juice business offset lower results from 
carbonated soft drinks. The results were a bit better than Wall 
Street had expected. The food and beverage concern based in 
Purchase, N.Y., earned $507 million, or 34 cents a share, on a pro 
forma basis in the three months ended Sept. 4, compared with $475 
million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier. Pepsico shares were 
at 33 3/16, up 1 3/4.

	Factory Orders Rise 1.3 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to U.S. factories vaulted ahead in  
August on the strength of higher demand for airplanes and 
electronics in another sign of a resurgence in manufacturing. The 
1.3 percent gain in factory orders was the 12th increase in the 
past 15 months, the Commerce Department said today. Analysts had 
generally expected factory orders to rise 0.6 percent. Even that 
would have been brisk. ``This is a pace that ensures significant 
production increases for the rest of the year and into 2000,'' said 
economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers.

	Insurance Catastrophe Claims Drop

	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. property and casualty insurers will pay  
about $2.1 billion to homeowners and businesses for property losses 
from seven catastrophic events in the third quarter of 1999, an 
industry group said today. That's down from $3.5 billion for 13 
catastrophic events in the second quarter. Most of the industry's 
catastrophic losses in the third quarter stemmed from storms and 
hurricanes, including Hurricane Floyd, which caused nearly $1.3 
billion in insured losses, said the New York-based Insurance 
Services Office Inc.'s Property Claims Services unit.

	Alcoa Earnings Rise 19 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Although aluminum shipments dropped during  
Alcoa's third quarter, the company reported a 19 percent rise in 
earnings on the strength of lower production costs. The world's 
biggest aluminum producer said today it earned $259.1 million, or 
69 cents a share, compared to $217.7 million or 61 cents a share in 
the same quarter a year ago. The results met analysts' 
expectations, but Alcoa stock fell anyhow, perhaps because of the 
decline in shipments. Alcoa was at 62, down 2 1/8. Revenues fell 1.4 
percent to $4.05 billion.

aggressively taken its own advice. Intel chief executive Craig 
Barrett says it's selling a stunning $1 billion a month in chips 
through Web sites it sets up for customers such as computer makers 
-- nearly half the company's roughly $30 billion in annual sales -- 
and will sell virtually all its chips this way within a year.

<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Asarco Inc. has accepted a sweetened buyout offer  
from Phelps Dodge Corp., setting up a three-way, $2.9 billion deal 
that will make Phelps Dodge the world's largest copper producer. 
Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. accepted a similar offer last week, 
breaking away from what had been the Englewood, Colo.-based 
company's plan to merge with New York-based Asarco. With Asarco's 
acceptance late yesterday, the deal merges three of the country's 
four largest copper companies.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Chrebet Practicing Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- When the New York Jets play the  
Jacksonville Jaguars on Monday night, star receiver Wayne Chrebet 
might be in the lineup. He has been listed as doubtful, but just 
the fact he returned to practice on Wednesday was a boost for the 
1-3 team. 
</P>
<P>
	Chrebet, who broke his left foot in the final exhibition game  
Sept. 3, was expected to miss at least six weeks, probably more. 
But earlier this week, he worked out for coach Bill Parcells, who 
was satisfied enough to give Chrebet the OK to practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice went ``OK,'' Parcells said. ``He didn't get a lot  
of reps, but he did OK. There was nothing unusual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having Chrebet back so soon might seem unusual.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to get back, so I dedicated myself to the  
treatment and to the physical therapy,'' Chrebet said. ``I was 
doing things on my own -- maybe that was stupidity on my part -- as 
soon as I could put weight on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill asked me what hurt the most, then he asked me to run  
pretty much what feels the worst. Of course, the first route, he 
asked for basically the same movement as when I broke it. And on 
wet turf after I didn't run for a month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Parcells actually sneaked up and kicked Chrebet in  
the ankle to test that injury. The coach didn't do anything like 
that this time, but he gave Chrebet enough of a workout to prove 
the receiver is ready for a full-scale practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is going to be cut and dry, not a complicated  
process,'' Parcells said of evaluating Chrebet's health, rustiness 
and, ultimately, his availability. ``All I have to do is see; can 
the player function and do what we ask? If the answer today is yes, 
how does he feel tomorrow? Did that practice not allow him to do it 
as well tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not rely on him; you have got to show me.''  
</P>
<P>
	What Chrebet has shown in his four NFL seasons has been  
exceptional. One of the league's best third-down receivers 
operating out of the slot, Chrebet averaged just over 70 catches a 
year and scored 18 touchdowns. He set a career high for yardage 
with 1,083 and scores with eight in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's passing attack ranks just 18th, and Chrebet's absence  
has hurt almost as much as the season-ending Achilles' tendon 
injury suffered by Vinny Testaverde in the opener. Keyshawn Johnson 
draws more double-teams and Dedric Ward, until last week, hadn't 
taken up the slack. The tight ends have either been injured or 
ineffective, and Leon Johnson, the top receiver out of the 
backfield, also was lost for the year in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Keyshawn Johnson, whose relationship with Chrebet could be  
termed cold -- to be kind -- admitted having Chrebet back would 
provide a lift. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you get a key player who is off your 53-man roster  
coming back, it's going to help your team to some capacity,'' said 
Johnson, who comes off his best game of the year in the team's 
first victory, at Denver. ``Offensively, defensively, with 
leadership, that's one individual you did not have for several 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it will change the way defenses are playing  
us, but if we get anybody back who can help us out, it helps 
tremendously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chrebet has a three-inch titanium screw in his foot and is  
wearing an orthotic to relieve some of the discomfort. But the 
biggest hurt has come from not being on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sundays are rough,'' he said. ``I went to the first game to  
see how well it was going and what the other guys were going 
through, and Vinny and Leon got hurt. And watching on TV has been 
horrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those spectating days might be over for Chrebet.

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Stover Hopes To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Matt Stover spent the entire summer  
fighting to keep his job as the Baltimore Ravens placekicker. 
</P>
<P>
	He prevailed, but now it appears he might be in for another  
skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
	By signing Joe Nedney to handle kickoffs, the Ravens made Stover  
a specialist with just one specialty: kicking field goals and extra 
points. It is a concise task that coach Brian Billick expects 
Stover to perform with near perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand what he wants from me, and so be it,'' Stover  
said Wednesday. ``My role is defined even more now. He wants me to 
kick field goals. That's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stover, now in his 10th season, survived a training-camp battle  
with Scott Bentley, who stood toe-to-toe with the incumbent until 
the final week before the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Stover, however, missed a pair of 54-yard field goal tries in  
the opener against St. Louis and was wide right on a 38-yarder last 
Sunday in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, he has encountered problems getting sufficient length on  
his kickoffs. Only one of his 17 kicks has resulted in a touchback, 
and his kickoff to the 13 in the waning minutes against Pittsburgh 
produced a 37-yard return that set up the game-winning field goal 
for the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stover, 31, has never shared the placekicking duties before. But  
the Ravens were concerned enough about his short kickoffs to claim 
Nedney on waivers from the Arizona Cardinals on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe is big and has a strong leg. We feel like the way our  
defense is playing, starting the other team on the 20 is a big 
advantage for us,'' Ravens vice president of personnel Ozzie 
Newsome said. ``There is always competition on a football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Stover doesn't have to worry about his job. He knows he  
can't afford to miss too many more 38-yarders, but he's hoping his 
lighter workload will work to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see how it can hurt me. I can only see how it will  
help me. I'll use it as a benefit,'' Stover said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nedney is a strapping 6-foot-5 veteran who beat the Ravens in  
1997 with a 43-yard field goal as time expired. He said he isn't 
intent on taking Stover's job, but is glad to be wanted after being 
inactive for two of the Cardinals' three games this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to get an opportunity to play,'' Nedney said.  
``Right now, the emphasis is getting the ball deep and helping out 
the coverage team. If they want me to do something else, then we'll 
go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid another competition, Stover must continue the accuracy  
he has displayed over the past decade. He's made 78.2 percent of 
his career field-goal attempts, including 92 percent from inside 40 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm one of the best in the league. My track record  
proves it,'' Stover said. ``My confidence will never be shattered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been challenged before, and I've always persevered. I  
look at this as another time for me to persevere and play well.''

<HEADLINE> Death Recommended for Child Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- A remorseless drifter who killed a  
9-year-old boy in a beach restroom should die for his crime, jurors 
recommended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Wilson, 21, who slashed Matthew Cecchi's throat, stabbed  
him in the back and left him to bleed to death, told jurors they 
should execute him because he would kill again. He smiled slightly 
as the verdict was read. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson killed the third-grade Oroville boy in November 1998 and  
said he would ``do it again in a second if I had the chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole purpose in life is to help destroy your society. You  
people are here as representatives of that society. As such, you 
should do everything in your power to rid the world of me. Execute 
me,'' Wilson told jurors during testimony in the penalty phase of 
his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of six men and six women deliberated for five hours  
over two days before reaching the verdict. Jury foreman Gene Wagner 
said outside the courtroom that ``if there was ever a case that 
deserved the death penalty, this one's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge John Einhorn will make the final decision  
at a sentencing hearing Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	He can choose the lesser penalty, but judges usually follow the  
recommendations of juries, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The same jury last week found that Wilson was sane when he  
killed Matthew in the restroom at Oceanside Pier, north of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson admitted during his arraignment that he murdered the boy.  
He said he smiled at him after following him into the restroom and 
then snuck up on him from behind as the boy stood at the urinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson of St. Croix Falls, Wis., claimed he was insane at the  
time, driven by hallucinogenic drugs and voices from God to kill. 
But his videotaped confession to police, which included his gleeful 
re-enactment of the killing and acknowledgment that murder was 
wrong, helped jurors to conclude he was sane. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury heard testimony from the boy's third-grade teacher and  
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Peck of Stanford Avenue School, described how she tried  
to comfort the boy's classmates and explain why he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Third-graders always ask why and that was a question I had no  
answer for,'' said Peck, who called Matthew a straight-A student 
and an extraordinary boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Cecchi recalled trying to comfort her son and to give him  
CPR as he lay bleeding. ``I put my hand on his hair and told him, 
'Hang in there baby. I love you,''' she said.

<HEADLINE> School Killing Survivor Dies Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- A teen-ager who survived a shooting spree  
last year at Thurston High School died in a hunting accident after 
being shot in the head by his 17-year-old brother, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Peek Jr., who was wounded during the May 1998 shootings  
that left two classmates dead, was killed Tuesday when Robert 
Peek's gun accidentally discharged, Lane County Sheriff Sgt. Byron 
Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were deer hunting about 25 miles east of Eugene.  
Robert phoned for help, but his 19-year-old brother was pronounced 
dead at the scene. Robert was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident is under investigation, Trapp said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both brothers were in the Thurston High cafeteria in Springfield  
when gunman Kip Kinkel entered on May 21, 1998, and began firing a 
semiautomatic rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	Two students were killed and two dozen others wounded in the  
attack, one in a series of high-profile school shootings around the 
country in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Peek, a 17-year-old junior at the time of the shootings,  
escaped serious injury when one of Kinkel's bullets was deflected 
by his backpack. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinkel, who was also charged with killing his parents before the  
school assault, pleaded guilty Sept. 24 to four counts of murder 
and 26 counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Peek family has filed a $250,000 lawsuit against Kinkel's  
estate, alleging his parents failed to control their son and failed 
to take reasonable steps to prevent him from obtaining weapons and 
ammunition.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Receives Frigates from U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan has received two new frigates from  
the United States, bolstering its ability to combat rival China's 
submarines, the navy said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair of retired U.S. ships arrived in the southern port of  
Kaohsiung on Monday, said a navy spokesman, speaking on customary 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knox class ships will primarily be assigned to track Chinese  
submarines and sink them during war. The vessels also carry 
ship-to-air missiles as a defense against any attack from 
warplanes, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the arrival of the new ships, Taiwan now has a total of  
eight of the warships on lease. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Taiwan has also bought six ultramodern La  
Fayette frigates from France, and has built seven Cheng Kung class 
frigates of its own based on the design of U.S. Perry class 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the United States doesn't have formal diplomatic ties  
with Taiwan, U.S. law requires Washington sell Taiwan weapons that 
will help defend the island from rival China. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan also hopes to buy destroyers from the United States  
equipped with advanced Aegis battle management radar systems as 
part of a defense umbrella against Chinese missiles.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Climber Feared Dead in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- Alex Lowe, described by Outside magazine  
as the best mountain climber in the world, is presumed dead with 
another climber in a Himalayan avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispatch from the American Shishapangma Ski Expedition, posted  
on the Web site MountainZone.com, said the climbers were struck by 
an avalanche on 26,291-foot Shishapangma in Tibet early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing and presumed dead was cameraman Dave Bridges. The  
search for both men was abandoned because of hazardous conditions 
on the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it hard to believe that Alex could ever be killed,''  
said Gordon Wiltsie, who climbed with Lowe. ``This is just a cruel 
reminder that the mountains are bigger than any person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, 40, of Bozeman, and Bridges, 29, of Aspen, Colo., were  
swept away along with Colorado climber Conrad Anker when the 
avalanche struck the climbers on the mountain's upper slopes, said 
Andrew McLean, the expedition leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Anker was ``pretty beat up'' but not seriously injured when he  
was found, McLean told MountainZone.com, an expedition sponsor, by 
satellite telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The expedition had as its goal not only climbing Shishapangma,  
the 14th highest mountain in the world, but also skiing down it. 
Bridges was part of a three-man film crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe was a celebrity in the mountain climbing community. He is  
on posters, in magazines and on television leading the way up slabs 
of granite. His 25-year career included climbs in five continents, 
and he twice reached the summit of Mount Everest. 
</P>
<P>
	He was called the best climber in the world in a March cover  
story in Outside magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	His is the latest high-profile death in the sport.  
</P>
<P>
	A rash of deaths on Everest in 1996 sent a chill through the  
climbing community. Eight mountaineers died on the 29,028-foot peak 
on May 10 alone, a tragedy described in the best-seller ``Into Thin 
Air'' by Jon Krakauer. 
</P>
<P>
	The following year, a noted Russian climber who survived the  
Everest tragedy, Anatoli Boukreev, died in an avalanche on the 
slopes of Mount Annapurna in the Himalayas.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cites Rights Violations Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China and six other countries were found by  
the State Department to have engaged in or tolerated ``particularly 
severe'' violations of religious freedom over the past year, 
according to U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining China on the list were Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Iraq,  
Serbia and Sudan, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under law, these countries could be subject to sanctions ranging  
from a wrist slap to economic penalties. But the point appeared to 
be moot since virtually all are under economic sanctions and lack 
normal relations with the United States in any case. The one 
exception is China. 
</P>
<P>
	The conclusions, made available to the Associated Press Tuesday  
night, came four weeks after the State Department issued its first 
annual report on the state of religious freedom worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Chinese government intolerance of unregistered  
religious activity has led in some areas to persecution of people, 
on the basis of religious practice, ``through harassment, prolonged 
detention and incarceration in prison or 'reform-through-labor' 
camps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report offers these evaluations on the other six:  
</P>
<P>
	Afghanistan -- Shiites suffered persecution and killing at the  
hands of the Taliban-led government in Kabul. Afghan police impose 
``severe physical punishment and imprisonment'' for deviations from 
codes of worship and dress,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burma -- The government arrests and imprisons Buddhist monks who  
promote human and political rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran -- Policies have been implemented to eradicate the Baha'i  
faith through prolonged imprisonment of Bahai's, confiscation and 
desecration of holy places and denial of the right to assemble. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq -- The government has conducted a campaign of murder,  
summary execution and protracted arbitrary arrest against religious 
leaders and adherents of the Shi'a Muslim population. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbia -- Authorities engaged in the killing, torture, rape and  
forced emigration of Kosovar Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Sudan -- Christians, practitioners of traditional indigenous  
religions, and Muslims who deviate from the official interpretation 
of Islam, are subject to killing, prolonged arbitrary detention or 
imprisonment, threats, violence and forced conversion to Islam.

<HEADLINE> Bradley: Gore Distracting Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bradley on Wednesday accused  
Democratic presidential rival Al Gore of using ``dartboard 
politics'' to distract voters from the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley refused to answer questions about statements the vice  
president has made implying that Bradley is quitter or less of a 
true Democrat because of the way he resigned from the Senate in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand what happens in a campaign -- someone makes a  
charge and then you're asked to make a charge,'' he said. ``I don't 
think the American people want the politics of the dartboard. I 
think they're tired of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's remarks came during a campaign trip to New Hampshire,  
where he will face Gore in a forum later this month. Gore has 
criticized Bradley for not accepting his challenge to debate 
earlier than that. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to respond to Bradley's characterization of Gore's  
``dartboard politics,'' the vice president's spokesman, Chris 
Lehane, said, ``Bill Bradley says he's a different kind of 
politician and wants a different kind of politics, yet it's Bill 
Bradley who's acting like a classic politician and ducking the 
debates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``In truth, it's Al Gore who's looking to break out of  
the old politics and raise the discourse and dialogue to a whole 
new level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his visit to the Manchester Community Health Center,  
Bradley also criticized Gore's plan to expand federal efforts to 
insure all children and incrementally extend coverage to uninsured 
adults. Bradley said his $65 billion plan to dramatically expand 
the federal health care system would get the job done sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big problems need big solutions,'' he said. ``I think his  
approach is much more incremental. It's a much slower path to get 
to the destination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's plan would allow Americans to enroll in the same  
health care coverage provided for members of Congress and federal 
employees. The poor would get subsidies, parents would be told to 
seek insurance for their newborns, the Medicaid system would 
largely scrapped and tax breaks would go to all Americans who pay 
insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Manchester center's staff told Bradley the help  
can't come soon enough. A quarter of their clients don't have 
insurance, staff members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Douglas Long said the center helps more than 4,000 people a  
year, but they still can't reach everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only have so many new patients we can take in each month,''  
he said. ``On the first of the month, we usually have a line of 
people waiting to register.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem is making sure patients get the followup care  
they need. Specialists are often unwilling to see patients without 
insurance, said Dr. Gavin Muir. 
</P>
<P>
	``I play social worker on some days. I keep calling until I find  
someone in a good mood that day,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> LPGA Lose Two Tournaments, Add One  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Two weeks after losing a tournament  
at its headquarters, the LPGA Tour on Wednesday released the first 
quarter of its schedule for 2000 that drops another Florida event 
but also adds a new tournament in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The HealthSouth Inaugural, which has kicked off the LPGA season  
the past two years in Orlando, will not be played next year because 
the tour and HealthSouth agreed not to renew its contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are exploring the possibility of and are optimistic about  
putting an event in Orlando in 2001,'' commissioner Ty Votaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	The LPGA previously lost the Titleholders Championship, played  
at its LPGA International course in Daytona Beach, because Mercury 
declined to renew its sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Safeco Corp. said it would discontinue  
sponsorship of its tournament in Washington state, the longest 
continuously sponsored event on the LPGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The LPGA Tour will make two trips to Hawaii. The Hawaiian Ladies  
Open will be played Feb. 24-27, the week before the Australian 
Ladies Masters. The new tournament is the Takefuji Classic in 
Hawaii, which will be the week after Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Only tournaments through the Nabisco Championships -- previously  
known as the Dinah Shore -- have been released. Votaw said the rest 
will be finalized shortly, but he wanted players and fans to 
starting planning for the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The major championship dates also have been set.  
</P>
<P>
	The LPGA Championship in Delaware will be played June 22-25,  
while the U.S. Women's Open at the Merit Club outside Chicago will 
be played July 20-23, the same week as the men's British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The du Maurier Classic, in what could be its last tournament  
with major status, is scheduled for Aug. 10-13 at the Royal Ottawa 
Golf Club in Canada.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tracking Food Aid to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman sought to  
assure lawmakers Wednesday that U.S. food aid to Russia will be 
used as intended, even as investigators disclosed the first 
evidence that some proceeds from earlier sales may have been 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is giving Russia 3 million metric tons of  
wheat, corn, pork and other commodities this year, worth an 
estimated $1 billion, and Russia has asked for 5 million more tons 
in 2000, Glickman told the House Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration wants to be very careful proceeding down  
the road with another request until the monitoring is as good as we 
can make it,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case under investigation involves $3.7 million in sales of  
food aid in 1993 and 1994, said Roger Viadero, the Agriculture 
Department's inspector general. The money was supposed to be spent 
on development projects, but some of it was transferred from a bank 
in Russia out of the country, Viadero said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to discuss the case further, but an official with a  
private organization that was to use the proceeds, the 
Washington-based Fund for Democracy and Development, said the 
questionable transfer involved about $1 million, half of which has 
been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're right in the middle of trying ... to get this money  
back,'' said Jack Heller, the group's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about U.S. food aid emerged this summer in connection  
with allegations about a massive money-laundering scheme involving 
the Bank of New York. Three people, including a former vice 
president of the bank, and three companies were charged with 
illegally channeling $7 billion through the bank's accounts. The 
money is believed to be tied to the Russian mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have been trying to determine the origin of those  
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no evidence any of the commodities in this year's  
shipment have been diverted, Glickman said, but he acknowledged it 
is difficult to track proceeds from sales of the food once they are 
put into the banking system. Russia is allowed to sell most of the 
donated commodities, but the money is to be deposited into a 
government pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way we're going to be foolproof'' in preventing the  
diversion of funds, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has significantly improved its monitoring of food  
shipments to Russia in recent months, said Viadero, USDA's internal 
watchdog. But given the problems in the Russian banking system, the 
controls are still not sufficient to guarantee the aid isn't being 
diverted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't give you any assurances and can make no assertions  
about what controls are in place or whether they are working,'' he 
told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA has bolstered its monitoring staff in Russia from three to  
eight and will be inspecting up to 20 percent of the food 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 percent of this year's aid has been shipped, and about  
10 percent of the proceeds that are supposed to be placed in the 
pension fund has been deposited so far. Russia has four months to 
put the money in the account, and much of the food has only been 
exported recently, USDA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's request for next year includes 1 million tons of  
milling wheat, 3 million tons of feed grains, and 1 million tons of 
soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department could alter the aid package to suit  
the needs of U.S. producers, and lawmakers are pushing Glickman to 
include pork and peanuts, among other commodities.

<HEADLINE> Philly Mayor Race Is Neck-and-Neck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The businessman trying to become the first  
Republican mayor of Philadelphia in 52 years is in a dead heat with 
his Democratic rival, with race becoming an important factor, 
according to a poll released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll showed Republican Sam Katz with 39 percent support and  
Democrat John F. Street with 38 percent. More than one in five 
voters were still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has seven Democrats for every two Republicans.  
</P>
<P>
	The poll also showed that race could be a decisive factor. More  
than 40 percent of Philadelphia's 1.4 million residents are black. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz, who is white, has the support of about two-thirds of white  
voters, while Street, who is trying to be the city's second black 
mayor, is backed by roughly the same proportion of black voters, 
according to the poll by the Center for Politics and Public Affairs 
at Millersville University. 
</P>
<P>
	Although neither candidate has made race an issue in the  
campaign, only 19 percent of white Democrats are backing Street, 
while just 33 percent of black Republicans are leaning toward Katz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Race is trumping party affiliation,'' said G. Terry Madonna,  
the poll's director. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 520 registered voters was taken Friday  
through Monday and has a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points. 
It was conducted for the Philadelphia Daily News and Fox News.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Democrats Duel Over Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The partisan duel over Social Security  
continued Wednesday as the Senate signaled support for using 
across-the-board spending cuts to keep from tapping the pension 
program's surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	By 54-46, the Senate approved a non-binding, Republican  
resolution advocating unspecified, across-the-board cuts in all 13 
annual spending bills for the new fiscal year. Sen. John McCain, 
R-Ariz., a presidential contender, was the only senator to cross 
party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the Senate voted 54-46 to reject a Democratic  
alternative, with defections by Sens. John Edwards, D-N.C., James 
Jeffords, R-Vt., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. That non-binding 
measure said instead of across-the-board cuts, Congress should 
close tax loopholes and find other unspecified savings to pay for 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither vote advanced Congress' overdue spending bills for  
fiscal 2000, which began Friday. Rather, a battle for political 
positioning was under way, with Republicans casting themselves as 
champions of Social Security and Democrats accusing the GOP of 
seeking dangerous cuts in popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is to make absolutely certain we don't dip into  
or spend Social Security surplus money,'' said Senate Majority Whip 
Don Nickles, R-Okla., defending across-the-board cuts as a sensible 
way to prevent that if other savings cannot be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do my colleagues really want to go on record cutting  
education?'' asked Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., following that 
with anti-crime, health research, and other programs no politician 
wants to be seen as slashing. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid some internal grumbling, congressional Republicans --  
especially in the House -- are considering across-the-board 
reductions to keep from eating into Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans have been considering a 2.7 percent cut to  
achieve that. The White House budget office said it would really 
take a 9 percent reduction, and produced a five-page memo asserting 
that such cuts would have a ``severe impact'' on defense, education 
and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, President Clinton has signed only four of the 13 bills  
for fiscal 2000, vetoed one and threatened to veto five others. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House-Senate bargainers working on one of the most  
contentious spending bills were ready to roll back some 
House-approved cuts in NASA and housing -- if administration 
officials could provide savings to pay for them, said congressional 
participants who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget chief Jack Lew was talking to lawmakers about  
finding the savings. But the two sides had not yet agreed on dollar 
amounts to be restored or how the extra spending would be paid for, 
an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said if an agreement on savings was reached,  
lawmakers would provide 50,000 new rental housing vouchers for 
low-income families that Clinton has requested, the $13.6 billion 
he sought for the space program, and restore the national service 
Americorps program. 
</P>
<P>
	The House had approved none of the housing vouchers, voted to  
kill Americorps, and pared $900 million from Clinton's NASA 
request. White House officials have cited both in their threats to 
veto a $97 billion measure financing housing, veterans, environment 
and space programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were other disputes surrounding the bill that leave  
its fate uncertain. House-Senate negotiators were hoping to meet 
formally on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, Congress sent Clinton its sixth spending bill  
as the Senate voted 51-49 to approve a $12.6 billion foreign aid 
bill. Clinton has threatened to veto it because it provides $1.9 
billion less than he wants, including none of the $500 million he 
requested for Israel and the Palestinians to implement the Wye 
River peace pact between them.

<HEADLINE> Daimler, Canada Union Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers and DaimlerChrysler AG  
have reached a contract agreement, less than two hours before 
13,800 union workers were to walk off the job. 
</P>
<P>
	CAW President Buzz Hargrove said at a news conference in Toronto  
that the deal reached late Tuesday was modeled on an agreement 
union members ratified last week with Ford Motor Co. of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an excellent deal,'' Hargrove said. ``I have absolutely  
no disappointment at all. After bargaining a long while, I know you 
don't get everything you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken McCarter, vice president for human resources of  
DaimlerChrysler Canada, expressed satisfaction with the agreement, 
which he said addressed the major issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers will begin meeting Friday to vote on ratification and a  
decision could be announced late Sunday, CAW spokesman John 
McClyment said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the United Auto Workers has set a deadline  
to reach an agreement with Ford. The UAW said Tuesday it would not 
extend its contract beyond 3:30 p.m. Friday, a sign talks could be 
intensifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks on a new contract to cover about 100,000 U.S. Ford  
employees were to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the Canadian deal, the two sides appeared to be at  
a standstill over four disputes related to union organizing and 
future work. The union had set a strike deadline of 11:59 p.m. 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the agreement between CAW and Ford, workers received a 3  
percent wage increase in each year of a three-year package, a 
$1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus, a lucrative retirement package and 
other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said the agreement with DaimlerChrysler also includes a  
$1,200 (Canadian) Christmas bonus and $800 in tuition fees for 
dependents. He said that under the agreement, 2,300 workers are 
eligible to retire immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove had said that the union could strike over disputes at  
DaimlerChrysler plants in Windsor and Ajax, Ontario, where work has 
not been assigned. He said the CAW had reached agreements at both 
those plants, including saving more than 70 jobs at the Ajax plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said DaimlerChrysler is committed to new investment  
worth $400 million (U.S.) at the truck plant in Windsor, which has 
2,000 workers. He said he expects more workers to be hired at the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said the union did not make any progress in its effort  
to force DaimlerChrysler to pressure a supplier, Magna 
International Inc., to recognize the union in Magna's plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're walking away empty handed on the Magna issue,'' Hargrove  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW now moves on to negotiations with General Motors of  
Canada Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Indians 3, Red Sox 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Indians' Game 1 postseason jinx ended as  
soon as Pedro Martinez left the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Fryman's RBI single with one-out in the bottom of the  
ninth inning gave Cleveland a 3-2 win over the Boston Red Sox, who 
may have lost their ace Martinez for the remainder of the AL 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians had lost eight straight series opening games, dating  
back to the division series against Boston in 1995 before Fryman's 
clutch bases-loaded base hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, baseball's most dominant pitcher this season, pulled a  
back muscle and had to leave the game after the fourth inning. He 
is listed as day-to-day and Boston manager Jimy Williams said the 
right-hander would be re-examined by doctors on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got a break with Pedro getting hurt,'' said Fryman, who  
spent most of the season on the disabled list with a serious knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you face Pedro, he's tough. He's the best pitcher I  
ever faced. You look up there in the sixth inning and you don't see 
him out there, it gives you a little pick-me-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox, who had counted on Martinez giving them the lead in  
the series, will turn to Bret Saberhagen in Game 2 Thursday against 
Cleveland's Charles Nagy. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians starter Bartolo Colon struck out a season-high 11 in  
eight innings, and Paul Shuey picked up the win with a perfect 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Thome hit a game-tying two-run homer off Derek Lowe in the  
sixth for the Indians, who also got spectacular defensive plays 
from David Justice, Roberto Alomar and Omar Vizquel. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomar Garciaparra homered for the Red Sox, who despite  
dominating the regular-season series against Cleveland have now 
lost four straight playoff games to the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, who replaced Martinez in fifth, got the loss. He hit Manny  
Ramirez in the back with a 2-2 pitch to open the ninth, and Rheal 
Cormier relieved. One out later, pinch-hitter Wil Cordero singled 
to right in his first career postseason at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sexson, who had 116 RBIs this season, pinch-hit for David  
Justice and was walked on four pitches by Garces. Fryman, who was 
on the DL twice this year with a torn ligament in his right knee, 
then slapped a 1-2 pitch to left for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman, who could hardly walk a month ago, was mobbed by his  
teammates as he rounded first. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was one of the things that I used as motivation,'' Fryman  
said of his rehabilitation from the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Stanley had three of Boston's five hits and Garciaparra had  
the other two. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, 5-0 in his career against Indians, including a win in  
Game 1 of the '98 division series, had little trouble with 
Cleveland's lineup in the first four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed three hits and twice retired Ramirez, the majors' RBI  
leader, to end an inning with a runner in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth, he retired Justice on a grounder to the right  
side, covering first on the play for the putout. He appeared to be 
OK as he left the field, but when Boston manager Jimy Williams 
called Boston's bullpen to get Lowe throwing, it was obvious 
Martinez was coming out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were excited,'' Thome said. ``Pedro was pitching a real  
good game. ``To get him out of the game like that, it livened us 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as tough as Martinez had been on the Indians this year, Lowe  
was just as nasty. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland was just 1-for-30 against the right-hander with  
Roberto Alomar's single in an April 24 giving the Indians their 
only baserunner. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe coasted through the fifth and got two outs in the sixth  
before Ramirez hit a grounder to third that John Valentin fielded 
cleanly. However, his throw was in the dirt, and Ramirez was safe, 
ending a streak of 31 straight Indians retired by Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome wasted no time, crushing Lowe's next pitch 434 feet to tie  
it 2-2, and giving the Indians their first momentum of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	In the seventh, Justice caught Troy O'Leary's drive against the  
wall in left and quickly got the ball back into the infield as the 
Indians doubled up Garciaparra who was halfway to third when the 
ball was caught. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra said Tuesday he wasn't fully recovered from being  
struck on the right wrist with a pitch against Baltimore late last 
month. But he looked fine on his first swing of the series, hitting 
a 2-1 pitch from Colon over the wall in center. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Garciaparra's sixth homer this season against the  
Indians, who planned to pitch around him when possible. 
Garciaparrra, who led the AL with a .357 average, was even tougher 
on Cleveland, batting .451 with nine extra-base hits and 17 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra led off the fourth with a double, and one out later  
scored on Mike Stanley's single to left. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Thome's homer was his 13th in the postseason, tying him  
with Ramirez for fourth on the career list. Only Reggie Jackson 
(18), Mickey Mantle (18) and Babe Ruth (15) have more. ... 
Garciaparra went 5-for-15 with three homers and 11 RBIs against 
Cleveland in the '98 division series. ... Hargrove said Jaret 
Wright would pitch out of the bullpen in Game 2 if necessary. 
Wright, who started the series opener last year, could start Game 
4. ... The Indians are 12-22 in the regular season against Boston 
since 1997 after going 11-1 in '96. ... Nagy, who pitched eight 
innings of four-hit ball to win Game 3 in Boston last year, is 7-1 
in his career against Boston. ... Boston has lost 17 of 18 playoff 
games since taking a 3-2 lead in the 1986 World Series against the 
New York Mets.

<HEADLINE> ValuJet Settles Crash Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- More than three years after ValuJet Flight  
591 crashed into the Everglades, the airline -- now renamed AirTran 
-- and its former maintenance contractor settled lawsuits blaming 
each other for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTran and the now-defunct SabreTech, in separate statements,  
announced they have reached a confidential out-of-court settlement 
of two outstanding lawsuits: one in which AirTran wanted SabreTech 
to be held responsible, and another in which SabreTech wanted 
AirTran found at fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were really just actions between the two companies and  
their insurers,'' SabreTech attorney Kenneth Quinn told The Orlando 
Sentinel for an article in Thursday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, AirTran received a cash payment. No other  
details, including the amount of the cash settlement, were made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company admitted any fault or liability in the May 1996  
accident. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Miami 
International Airport en route to Atlanta. All 110 passengers and 
crew on board were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say mislabeled and improperly capped oxygen  
canisters delivered by SabreTech employees had been loaded on 
board. Investigators concluded the canisters led to an explosion 
and fire before the plane went down.

<HEADLINE> Bolton Wants Judgment Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Bolton asked a federal appeals  
court to overturn a $5.4 million judgment against him for 
plagiarizing an Isley Brothers song. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer's attorney told the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
on Tuesday that neither his client nor Bolton's writing partner, 
Andy Goldmark, had heard of the Isley Brothers song before the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, a Los Angeles jury decided Bolton had stolen elements  
of the 1966 song ``Love Is a Wonderful Thing'' for his 1991 hit of 
the same name. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded Ron and Marvin Isley 66 percent of all past and  
future royalties from the single and credited the song with 28 
percent of the success of Bolton's album ``Time, Love and 
Tenderness.'' A special master in 1996 set the total amount at $5.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been five or six years of the most difficult  
experience of my entire life,'' Bolton said after Tuesday's 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel is expected to rule within two months.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Panos Will Have Neck Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo Bills guard Joe Panos will  
have surgery to repair a bulging disc in his neck on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo coach Wade Phillips could not say when or if Panos might  
return, but said it was possible it could be later this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Panos was injured lifting weights before training camp started  
in July and experienced stingers and loss of strength in his right 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Dusty Zeigler has played all four games in place of Panos at  
right guard. Zeigler lost his job as the starting center in 
preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Panos signed as a free agent last year after spending the first  
four years of his career with Philadelphia. He recovered from a 
knee injury to start all 16 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also for the Bills, Thurman Thomas remained sidelined by a liver  
contusion suffered in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Ruben Brown (hamstring), backup quarterback Rob Johnson  
(slight concussion) and tight end Jay Riemersma (groin) are all 
questionable, but should be ready for Pittsburgh on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Antoine Winfield is probable with a minor leg injury.

<HEADLINE> PepsiCo's Earnings Rise in 3Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- PepsiCo Inc.'s earnings rose 7 percent in the  
third quarter as improved results from its Frito-Lay snacks 
business and Tropicana juice business offset lower results from 
carbonated soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were slightly better than Wall Street had expected,  
and PepsiCo's shares climbed 5.6 percent, or $1.75 a share, to 
$33.18 3/4 in trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The food and beverage concern based in Purchase, N.Y., earned  
$507 million, or 34 cents a share, on a pro forma basis in the 
three months ended Sept. 4, compared with $475 million, or 32 cents 
a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected  
earnings of 33 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were calculated on a pro forma basis that assumed  
that recent deals like the public stock offering of 60 percent of 
its bottling interests in April and the purchase of Tropicana last 
year had occurred on the first day of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro forma revenue rose 6 percent to $4.6 billion from $4.3  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company warned Wall Street earlier that higher prices had  
dampened demand for its carbonated soft drinks. Pepsi-Cola is the 
nation's second largest soft drink company with brands like Pepsi, 
Diet Pepsi and Mountain Dew. 
</P>
<P>
	Its concentrate shipments to bottlers fell 2.5 percent, and  
operating profit tumbled 17 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	International soft drink profits were about the same as a year  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits from its Frito-Lay business rose 12 percent in North  
America and 10 percent internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	North American snack revenue rose 5 percent led by gains in its  
more profitbale brands like Doritos, Fritos and Cheetos. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits rose 54 percent at Tropicana led by a 12 percent rise in  
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, PepsiCo's pro forma earnings rose to  
$1.36 billion, or 90 cents a share, from $1.28 billion, or 84 cents 
a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $13 billion from $12.3 
billion a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve didn't raise interest  
rates this time, but Fed policy-makers left little doubt they are 
growing increasingly worried that the sizzling U.S. economy could 
generate inflation troubles down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Some private economists said they expect not just one but two  
more rate increases in coming months as the central bank tries to 
slow economic growth to a safer speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it is in the cards for a rate hike in November,  
and there is a chance we will see another rate hike early next year 
as strong growth continues,'' said David Jones, an economist with 
Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Warning Tuesday that it is remaining ``especially alert'' to any  
inflation dangers coming from the tight labor market, the Fed 
switched its policy directive, intended to signal future moves, 
from neutral to a tilt toward higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The growth of demand has continued to outpace that of supply,  
as evidenced by a decreasing pool of available workers,'' the Fed 
said in its statement. 
</P>
<P>
	With the nation's unemployment rate at a 29-year low of 4.2  
percent, some companies are having a difficult time finding 
qualified workers to fill vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
	Those conditions are leading some companies to woo workers with  
higher wages and benefits. While that's good news for workers, it's 
worrisome to the Fed because those increased costs could drive up 
prices and spark inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists believe the nation's unemployment rate in  
September, a figure being released Friday, could fall to 4.1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless there is an abrupt slowdown in labor market activity,  
the die appears to be cast for another rate hike,'' said Allen 
Sinai, chief economist at Primark Global Economics. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed policy-makers next meet to review interest rates on Nov. 16.  
The Fed's statement raising the prospect of worries over inflation 
pressure and its decision to switch its policy directive 
``re-enforces the probability of a third rate hike on Nov. 16,'' 
said First Union chief economist David Orr. ``We would put the odds 
at 60 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But much depends on what a slew of economic data out between now  
and then -- including two employment reports and several inflation 
reports -- says about the nation's economy and the prospects for 
inflation, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts said they believed a November rate increase could  
be followed by a fourth rate boost early next year, probably in 
January as the central bank continues moving to slow growth enough 
to ensure that tight labor markets don't start pushing wages and 
prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed is clearly more worried about inflation than they were  
in August,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in 
Minneapolis. ``The Fed recognizes that there is more work to be 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's warning sent stock prices on a wild roller-coaster  
ride during the final two hours of trading Tuesday, swinging from a 
gain of 106 points immediately before the Fed announcement to a 
124-point loss. The Dow then rebounded to finish the day down just 
0.64 point at 10,400.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks had posted a 128-point gain on Monday on hopes that the  
Fed would not raise rates and would maintain its neutral policy 
directive. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 30, the Fed, for the first time in two years, raised its  
target for the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge 
each other, by a quarter point. It followed that action with 
another quarter-point increase on Aug. 24, pushing the funds rate 
to 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial banks matched those increases with similar  
quarter-point increases in their prime lending rate, the benchmark 
for millions of consumer and business loans. The prime rate now 
stands at 8.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After the August increase, the Fed left its policy directive at  
neutral, saying it believed its two quarter-point rate hikes 
``should markedly diminish the risk of rising inflation going 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while economic growth slowed in the second quarter, many  
economists believe the economy grew at a brisk annual rate of 4 
percent or more in the just-completed third quarter. And they said 
the economy is likely to grow at a similar rate in the final three 
months of the year, far above the 3 percent rate many on the Fed 
believe is prudent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you would have to see very friendly inflation and  
growth numbers to avoid a rate hike,'' said MoneyWatch's chief 
economist Russell Sheldon.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Young Status Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young admitted Wednesday he has  
been bothered by post-concussion symptoms and all signs point to 
Jeff Garcia starting again for the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, who led the 49ers (3-1) to a 24-22 win over Tennessee in  
his first NFL start last Sunday, received most of the work with the 
first team during practice in preparation for Sunday's game at St. 
Louis (3-0). 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff is getting most of the snaps to get himself ready in case  
he's the starter. Steve is taking snaps here and there,'' coach 
Steve Mariucci said. ``Steve is feeling better than he did last 
week. He's practicing more than he did last week. But we've got to 
be ready with Jeff, just in case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, allowed to resume limited work after visiting his  
neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg, on Tuesday, and third-stringer 
Steve Stenstrom shared time running the scout team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers might wait until game time to name their starter.  
Offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg quipped that the answer to 
that question was still ``double-top secret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They've kept it from all of us. I'll probably have to read  
about it in the newspaper,'' Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who has another appointment Friday with Steinberg, hopes  
to gradually increase his workload throughout the week. Even if 
Steinberg clears him to play, Mariucci said he might hold him out 
as a precaution. There is also a possibility Young could be in 
uniform but serve as the second or possibly third quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat out Sunday's game against the Titans after sustaining his  
fourth concussion in three years Sept. 27 at Arizona on a hit by 
blitzing cornerback Aeneas Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who lay motionless on the field with his eyes closed for  
several seconds, said for the first time publicly that the force of 
the blow knocked him out cold. Previously, Young had insisted he 
was ``resting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some typical post-concussion stuff, headaches,  
grogginess, hazy stuff. You just kind of work through it,'' Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to make sure everything is healed and then be ready  
to go play football. I'm feeling better every day. I want to go 
practice. I don't know what (the neurologist) told the coach 
exactly. I just know we talked about the constant process of 
healing and that's what I'm most interested in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young reiterated he has no desire to retire.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hopefully the best judge, with the expertise that I have  
to rely on,'' Young said. ``You have to learn to just trust 
yourself mostly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia said he's ready to play if called on.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more confident and I feel my team is more confident in  
me,'' said Garcia, who threw for two touchdowns and ran for another 
in the win over Tennessee. ``If Steve is ready to go, I'm 
supportive of that. If taking another week off helps him, that's 
great for me. The only thing that matters is getting the victory, 
not who's in there when it happens.''

<HEADLINE> JJ Faults Marino in Loss To Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Don Shula used to respond to criticism of Dan  
Marino by saying if the Miami Dolphins' biggest concern was their 
quarterback, the team was in terrific shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Times change. Shula is no longer the coach, and Marino is no  
longer beyond criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Johnson delivered perhaps the harshest coaching critique  
of Marino's career Tuesday, criticizing his play in a 23-18 loss 
Monday night to the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Marino often threw to the wrong receiver, hurried  
some passes and held on to the ball too long on a costly fumble. 
The result was three turnovers, just one third-down conversion in 
14 chances and a defeat that dropped Miami to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino was at fault on all three turnovers, Johnson said, but  
pass protection breakdowns contributed to the quarterback's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan's got to make some better decisions,'' Johnson said.  
``When he's getting banged around, he made some poor decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the decisions a 17-year veteran is expected to  
make, Johnson said, ``We're going down an avenue I don't want to go 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the message was clear: Marino needs to play better. He was  
22-for-44 for 251 yards with one touchdown, two interceptions and 
two sacks, his first of the season. The Dolphins' only TD came on a 
4-yard drive following a 93-yard kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's comments were even harsher than in 1997, when he said  
following the season opener that he considered benching Marino. The 
latest criticism will likely strain the sometimes testy 
relationship between player and coach, but that is clearly not 
Johnson's concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's players had Tuesday off, and Marino was unavailable for  
comment. Following the game, he had a terse response when asked to 
assess his play. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you want to know about it?'' he said. ``If you lose,  
it's bad, and if you win, it's good. That's how I assess it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino's productivity has declined since a strong showing in the  
Dolphins' season-opening victory at Denver. In a 19-16 victory over 
Arizona, he threw two interceptions, and Miami scored just one 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the Dolphins must not allow Marino to get hit, and  
the coach implied that his 38-year-old quarterback's poor mobility 
has hamstrung the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can go maximum protection with Dan and only have three  
receivers, like we did with Denver,'' Johnson said. ``But people 
figure that out pretty soon and start doubling your receivers, so 
you've got no place to throw. You put five receivers out, and he's 
going to get hit. If he gets hit, his play drops down 
significantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge of protecting Marino will be compounded Sunday at  
Indianapolis (2-1), because tackle Richmond Webb bruised his left 
knee against Buffalo and is expected to be sidelined a couple of 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The pivotal play Monday was Gabe Northern's 59-yard touchdown  
return of a Marino fumble, putting the Bills ahead to stay in the 
second quarter. Johnson said Marino was partly to blame for the 
fumble, which occurred when he was blindsided on a third-down 
blitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan's got to release the ball,'' Johnson said. ``You dump it  
to the fullback. He held onto it a little bit long.''

<HEADLINE> Isaiah Rider Finally Shows at Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Isaiah Rider, who added to his lengthy  
list of troubles by missing the first day of training camp with the 
Atlanta Hawks, showed up today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider arrived at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga  
arena and was meeting with Hawks general manager Pete Babcock, team 
spokesman Arthur Triche said. 
</P>
<P>
	The guard, acquired in an August trade with the Portland Trail  
Blazers, was not immediately available for comment. There was no 
explantion for why he skipped the first day of camp or a mandatory 
media gathering in Atlanta Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks were practicing today and were to hold another workout  
tonight, when Rider was expected to practice with his new team for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Rider's arrival, Babcock left numerous telephone  
messages without hearing back from the player. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider's agent, Arn Tellem, told Babcock on Tuesday that he also  
was trying to track down Rider, but had not heard from him. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Rider missed the team bus to Chattanooga, where the  
team is practicing this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left a message for him this morning on his cell phone,''  
Babcock said during the team's opening practice Tuesday. ``(I told 
him) I hoped that he was OK, that if he needed any help to give us 
a call, we'd be happy to help. ... And I gave him my numbers, which 
he already has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider has had a troubled history during his six-year NBA career.  
He showed up late for his first pro practice with the Minnesota 
Timberwolves in 1993, and has been adding to his list of offenses 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	He has feuded with coaches, missed flights, been suspended by  
the league and convicted in court of marijuana possession, assault 
and illegal possession of cell phones. He also spent four days in 
jail for violating his probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks knew they were getting a player with a penchant for  
trouble when they traded Steve Smith and Ed Gray for Rider and Jim 
Jackson. But Rider's considerable talents -- he has averaged 18 
points and shown the ability to dominate offensively -- outweighed 
the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed that he wasn't there (Monday), but I wasn't  
surprised,'' Babcock said. ``We expected there to be some rocky 
moments. We didn't want it to start that way, but it has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks will fine Rider for his absence. Players are fined by  
the number of team activities they miss. By Tuesday night, Rider 
had accumulated six fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides missing two practices and a team dinner Tuesday, Rider  
missed three activities Monday -- the media session, the team dinner 
and a team meeting.

<HEADLINE> Steel Lawmakers Keeping Up Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel state lawmakers are so worried that  
American negotiators might capitulate at world trade talks that a 
few of them plan to voice their concerns outside the official 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will go to Seattle to ensure that the administration's  
position does not change on this important issue,'' Rep. Ralph 
Regula, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Regula, who heads the congressional Steel Caucus, said he and  
other caucus members want to make sure ``that administration 
officials do not allow any weakening of our trade laws'' when 
finance ministers from around the globe hold World Trade 
Organization talks Nov. 30 through Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Steelworkers of America has said it intends to send  
about 500 of its members as an outside-the-talks lobbying presence. 
Several steel company executives also said they plan to go to 
Seattle to lend their support to the Clinton administration's 
stated position of not wanting to open any negotiations on 
anti-dumping laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry R. Brown, senior vice president and general counsel for  
The Timken Co., urged Regula and other lawmakers to remain in 
Seattle throughout the WTO conference and meet frequently with 
negotiators, especially toward the end, ``to ensure no weakening in 
the U.S. position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress and the administration must not give one inch on the  
issue of opening up U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws 
for negotiation,'' said William J. Pendleton of Carpenter 
Technology Corp., based in Reading, Pa. ``We are a 
world-competitive industry facing an import problem based solely on 
unfair trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pendleton urged lawmakers to quiz U.S. representatives at the  
World Bank about a $98 million loan from its International Finance 
Corp. to a joint venture involving the world's largest producer of 
stainless steel, Germany's Krupp Thyssen, and China's Shanghai 
Pudong Steel. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is outrageous and completely unjustified,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Brown and Pendleton spoke with lawmakers as part of an industry  
briefing convened by the Steel Caucus as part of the lead-up to the 
WTO talks. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second briefing in as many weeks as lawmakers try to  
keep up pressure on the administration and give different segments 
of the steel industry a chance to describe how business has been 
since foreign imports began declining from last year's record 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials have repeatedly said their  
negotiators will oppose efforts to dilute anti-dumping laws during 
the WTO meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Organized labor has vilified the Clinton administration for  
fighting legislation to impose quotas on steel imports. That anger 
could become a problem for Vice President Al Gore as he competes 
with Bill Bradley for union support and endorsements as Democrats 
pick their presidential nominee.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Probe Laundering Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's tax chief pledged Wednesday to  
investigate banks and businesses suspected of massive 
money-laundering through the Bank of New York, but said the probe 
is complicated by loopholes in Russian laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have quite liberal legislation,'' said Tax Minister  
Alexander Pochinok. ``A large number of financial operations 
helping minimize taxes is allowed by law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it were my will, I would have radically changed the  
legislation, curbing the opportunities for avoiding taxes,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Pochinok's comments came a day after an indictment was unsealed  
in New York in which U.S. prosecutors charged that $7 billion from 
Russia was illegally funneled through accounts at the Bank of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first criminal charges issued in the probe, three Russian  
immigrants, including a former vice president for Bank of New York, 
and three companies were charged with illegally channeling funds 
through accounts -- money that may have some ties to Russian 
organized crime. The case is considered one of the largest 
money-laundering schemes in the U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Pochinok said that his ministry is looking for  
suspicious-looking transactions by Russian companies and banks. 
``Our task is to single out transactions that have violated either 
currency controls or tax legislation,'' he told The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest such action, late Tuesday Russian police and tax  
officials raided the office of Sobinbank, a prominent Moscow bank 
suspected of being involved in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobinbank has close links with the government, handling the  
State Customs Committee's accounts. Its shareholders include two 
other major banks and the RKK Energiya company, which built and has 
run the Mir space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are also examining Moscow's Flamingo Bank, which  
officials said was found to hold $430,000 and the equivalent of 
another $120,000 in rubles without proper documentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony by Sobinbank staff indicated that the money at  
Flamingo apparently came from Sobinbank, a spokesman for Moscow's 
anti-economic crime department, Filipp Zolotnitsky, told the NTV 
television network. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation also indicated that Flamingo had dealings with  
the Bank of New York, he said. ``The nature of these ties is being 
determined now. Presumably, we can speak of money laundering,'' 
Zolotnitsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police searched safe-deposit boxes at Sobinbank, especially  
targeting those that hadn't been rented out to customers -- a 
location that private banks sometimes use for keeping records of 
dubious transactions, said a senior investigator, Yevgeny 
Pozdnyakov. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower house of the Russian parliament recently proposed a  
bill aimed against money laundering, but President Boris Yeltsin 
has sent it back, saying it contradicts Russian law. Prime Minister 
Vladimir Putin said this week that the president has ordered the 
government to find a compromise with lawmakers and to finalize the 
bill as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering is the process of moving criminal gains through  
a series of bank accounts to make them look like legitimate 
business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has angrily fended off accusations in Western  
media that it has been reluctant to carry out a thorough 
investigation into the Bank of New York scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Pochinok insisted that the Russian probe is going as quickly as  
possible, and in turn charged that U.S. officials have been 
unwilling to share their information with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can see the whole chain of payments much better from  
their end, and we have to gather fragmented information here,'' he 
said. ``Why not share information with us on at least some 
suspicious transactions?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they don't trust us, or fear that we might ask for this  
money back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pochinok also joined other Russian officials who said that the  
Bank of New York scandal had led to discrimination against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now being used as an instrument of political pressure,''  
he said. ``The International Monetary Fund has refused to release 
the next disbursement of a loan, aggravating Russia's financial 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has delayed the next $640 million tranche of a $4.5  
billion loan to Russia, pending additional scrutiny into how 
previous loans have been used. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF loan is intended to refinance Russia's previous debts to  
the fund, and the money will simply be transferred from one fund 
account to another.

<HEADLINE> President Bush Letters Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Letters, for George Bush, are like handshakes  
for any other politician -- something to be doled out generously and 
with a firm, personal touch, however fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president has always been a man of letters -- long,  
searching ones to his family, short breezy ones to friends, little 
notes of courtesy to the merest of acquaintances. He is said to 
have the ``Himalayas of address books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now a mountain of Bush's correspondence has come into public  
view with the release of ``All the Best.'' His collection of 
selected letters and diary entries stands in place of the memoirs 
Bush says he will never write. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved the idea -- it meant my part was already done,'' Bush  
told an audience of 1,000 today at a promotional stop in Stamford, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	He choked up when reading a diary entry written hours after he  
lost the 1992 election to Bill Clinton. ``It's hard to describe the 
emotions of something like this. ... But it's hurt, hurt hurt and I 
guess it's the pride, too,'' Bush wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd howled when Bush, explaining that he does not plan to  
do a lengthy book tour, imitated comedian Dana Carvey imitating 
him. ``Nada. Not gonna do it,'' he said. ``I'm just not into the 
book signings, and it's not that I'm a bigger shot than that, it's 
just that I feel that I shouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The correspondence ranges from hair-raising letters home from  
the Pacific theater in World War II, when he was shot down, to a 
rumination a year ago on what it's like to fish as an old man (``if 
I turn fast, I wobble''). 
</P>
<P>
	And it is one of the early entries in a coming bonanza of Bush  
family biographies that could leave readers feeling am-Bushed. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest are focused on his eldest son George W., the Texas  
governor and Republican presidential aspirant, and include an 
autobiography the governor's press secretary has been polishing up. 
Two competing biographies are expected this fall, and two more 
books on the family early in the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years ago it was President Bush, not his son, who was  
sizing up the possibility of facing Al Gore in a presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	``An attractive guy, but he says he is a worse speaker than I,''  
Bush says of Gore in a diary entry in the book. ``Poor guy's in 
real trouble if he's worse than I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month later he added brightly, as if doing a party list:  
``Bill Clinton, a very nice man, may get into the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly bitter and at times despondent as the 1992 campaign  
wore on, he told speechwriter Peggy Noonan in one note that Clinton 
is ``better at facts-figures than I am. I'm better at life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost everyone who crosses paths with Bush gets a personal note  
from him. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders who cracked down on pro-democracy students in  
1989 got several. ``Dear Friend,'' Bush began in a letter to Deng 
Xiaoping, appealing for clemency for the demonstrators. It ended: 
``If there is to be a period of darkness, so be it; but let us try 
to light some candles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was to get one almost on the eve of  
the air war to drive his forces from Kuwait. But Bush says the 
letter, bearing the obvious warning that ``We stand at the brink of 
war,'' was left on a table in Geneva when Saddam's envoy refused to 
bring it home. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the book, Bush:  
</P>
<P>
	--Says he kept a file on aides who fell asleep in meetings and  
named it the Scowcroft Award, because national security adviser 
Brent Scowcroft often drifted off. Bush credited Veterans Affairs 
Secretary Ed Derwinski with ``very firm eye closure and a 
remarkable recovery gambit. ... He nodded vigorously whenever in 
his slumber he heard the end of a sentence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Says he considered stopping the longtime practice of having  
presidents accompanied everywhere by the ``football,'' the black 
briefcase carried by a military aide that contains the codes to 
launch nuclear weapons. Aides vetoed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	--Says presidents are asked for their preferred funeral  
arrangements. Bush asked to have his Navy identification number put 
on a plain gravestone and the words ``He loved Barbara very much'' 
inscribed in reference to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	--Identifies May 31, 1991, as the date when a U.S. president  
turned to a personal computer to send a note to another world 
leader. It was a brief note to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but 
Bush made what he calls a ``historic typo,'' addressing the note: 
``Dear Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's selective use of letters and diary entries presents a  
largely sunny view of his political career. He declares that 
despite the criticism he took for making Dan Quayle his running 
mate, ``I never regretted my choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in a 1997 biography of Bush, historian Herbert S. Parmet  
quoted the president as writing in his diary, soon after picking 
Quayle: ``It was my decision, and I blew it, but I'm not about to 
say that I blew it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all its upbeat tone, the collection is suffused with sadness  
over the death of the Bushes' daughter, Robin, nearly 4, from 
leukemia in 1953. Several years later he wrote to his mother about 
the void in his house of four boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need someone who's afraid of frogs,'' he wrote. ``We need  
someone to cry when I get mad -- not argue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a little one who can kiss without leaving egg or jam  
or gum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a girl. We had one once. ...''  
</P>
<P>
	Another daughter, Dorothy, was born in 1959.

<HEADLINE> Baby Jessica's Parents May Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLAIRSTOWN, Iowa (AP) -- Dan and Cara Schmidt, the Iowa couple  
who won the battle for Baby Jessica in 1993, are divorcing after 
seven years together. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Schmidt and Cara Clausen joined forces in 1991 in their  
effort to regain custody of their infant daughter, whom Cara had 
delivered while unmarried and put up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	They went to court in the month after the girl's birth to get  
her back. 
</P>
<P>
	The ensuing court battle was as bitter as it was long.  
</P>
<P>
	On the one side were the Schmidts, who named the girl Anna. On  
the other were Jan and Roberta DeBoer of Ann Arbor, Mich., who 
named the girl Jessica and retained custody of her as the contested 
adoption crawled through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution took 2 1/2 years while experts debated whether the  
child belonged with her biological parents or in the adoptive home 
where she'd grown up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schmidts won custody in August 1993 when supreme courts in  
Iowa and Michigan both sided with biology. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica became Anna and came home to the state she'd left in the  
first weeks of her life. By then, she had a little sister, Chloe, 
born five weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no contact between the DeBoers and Anna since.  
Anna is now 8 and a third grader; Chloe is 6 and in first grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt, 48, and Mrs. Schmidt, 37, declined to comment when  
reached by the Gazette of Cedar Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Snyder, executive director of Hear My Voice, a children's  
advocacy organization that DeBoer heads, said the DeBoers were not 
commenting on the situation at this point. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe in people's privacy. We've have no contact with the  
Schmidts,'' she said. ``Obviously we would never wish family 
difficulty on anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The DeBoers still live in Ann Arbor. They have a son, Casey,  
whom they adopted as an infant in June 1994.

<HEADLINE> SI for Women Plans Bimonthly Mag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After nearly three years of planning, Sports  
Illustrated for Women plans to begin publishing every other month 
starting in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced Tuesday, reflects the recent explosion  
of interest in women's sports bolstered by the popularity of the 
U.S. soccer team that won the women's World Cup this summer as well 
as the following for women's basketball and tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	It also reflects Time Inc.'s efforts to attract more readers and  
advertisers who recognize its long-running role in publishing 
Sports Illustrated. Time Inc. is the magazine arm of Time Warner 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sports Illustrated group already publishes Sports  
Illustrated for Kids, which is aimed at children 8 and older, and 
began testing a women's sports magazine under the title Sports 
Illustrated Women/Sport in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Two test issues were published that year, and three special  
issues have been published so far this year, with a fourth special 
issue due in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine is being designed for women ages 18 to 34 who both  
participate in sports and are sports fans. The cover price will be 
$3.50 an issue and a six-issue subscription will be offered for 
$11.94. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Bailey, who has been editor of the magazine since the  
tests began, said in a statement that Sports Illustrated for Women 
will ``cover the current landscape of women's sports in the 
tradition of Sports Illustrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she added it will also deal with health, nutrition and  
fitness and offer news about gear and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisers are being guaranteed that each issue will have  
circulation of 300,000 and will be asked to pay $21,000 for a 
full-page, four-color ad. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares with about $170,000 for an ad in Sports  
Illustrated which has a weekly circulation of 3.15 million, 
according to spokesman Rick McCabe. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports Illustrated's test of the market for a women's sports  
magazine coincided with Conde Nast Publishing's launch of a monthly 
magazine called Conde Nast Sports for Women in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	That magazine cut back its publishing schedule to once every  
other month in June 1998 when it also changed its name to Women's 
Sports &AMP; Fitness. 
</P>
<P>
	Its current guaranteed circulation is 475,000 per issue but  
delivered nearly 72,000 more than that for the first half of this 
year, according to spokeswoman Mistrella Egan. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Women's Sports &AMP; Fitness is raising its circulation  
guarantee to 650,000 an issue and will publish 10 issues a year 
starting next year.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigrants Found in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Immigration authorities have found 53  
Chinese men and boys hidden in the empty cargo holds and ballast 
tanks of a Singapore-registered freighter. 
</P>
<P>
	All were in good health, Coast Guard Lt. Jeanne Reincke said.  
Reincke said it wasn't known how long they had been there; they 
were found late Tuesday and early Wednesday after authorities 
received a tip. 
</P>
<P>
	All were detained by Immigration and Naturalization Services and  
likely will be deported unless they state a fear of political 
persecution, which could lead to a hearing before an immigration 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Charles Cashin said he did not know when  
or where the Chinese nationals were picked up or what cargo the 
ship was carrying.

<HEADLINE> Ovitz Couldn't Bring NFL To L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As a talent agent, Michael Ovitz has brokered  
some of the biggest deals in show business. His Midas movie touch 
was not enough to land an NFL team in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Money talked louder than Ovitz's Hollywood luster in the NFL's  
decision to award the 32nd expansion team to Houston on Wednesday. 
The $400 million to $500 million offer by Ovitz and his partners 
fell far short of the $700 million deal the league accepted from 
Houston businessman Bob McNair. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the economic criteria, $700 million wouldn't make sense  
for our lenders, our partners, for us,'' Ovitz spokesman Peter 
Levin said. Ovitz was unavailable for comment, Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz had a star-studded roster of backers who included Tom  
Cruise, Kevin Costner, Magic Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal. 
Supermarket billionaire Ron Burkle also was a principal in Ovitz's 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	At Creative Artists Agency, the talent firm he co-founded,  
Ovitz's client roster included Costner, Cruise, Robin Williams and 
Barbra Streisand. He was known for packaging talent deals for 
movies, helping to bring together the actors, writers and directors 
for such films as ``Forrest Gump'' and ``Interview with the 
Vampire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The celebrity team Ovitz packaged for the NFL bid may have  
captured the fancy of some league executives and owners, but it was 
no match for the hard cash Houston put up, said David Carter, an 
analyst for the Sport Business Group consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, that star quality may have overshadowed a competing  
offer from a group that proposed putting the new franchise in the 
Los Angeles Coliseum, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL certainly enjoyed the sizzle he brought to the  
process,'' Carter said. ``It gave him a leg up. The league looked 
forward to his presentations more than others because it had that 
Hollywood mystique to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at the end of the day, the only thing the NFL wanted was  
money,'' Carter said. ``It didn't matter whether Tom Cruise was 
involved. It didn't matter if there was going to be a revamped 
Coliseum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL defeat was the second big professional setback for Ovitz  
since he left as chief of Creative Artists Agency in 1995 to take 
over as president of Walt Disney Co. under Chairman Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz and Eisner had a quick falling out, and Ovitz departed a  
year later with a severance package worth about $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With his NFL efforts, Ovitz demonstrated the sort of nimbleness  
and tenacity he applied as a Hollywood superagent. Ovitz bobbed and 
weaved to adapt his plans, hoping to meet the league's 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his first pitch for a team in suburban Carson in May  
1998. Ovitz and Eisner wound up at odds again when the Disney 
chairman endorsed a proposal at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, the NFL tentatively awarded the expansion team to  
Los Angeles, and the league targeted the Coliseum plan over Carson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz joined Coliseum backers, but he floated a new proposal  
last week for a stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood after 
negotiations for the Coliseum stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	With a $310 million stadium tacked on to Houston's $700 million  
offer, though, the Los Angeles bidders could not compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ovitz's participation in the entire process may have made the  
NFL look longer and harder at L.A.,'' Carter said. ``They may have 
thought he was the chosen one to bring football back to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``His cache, his Rolodex, his connections were terrific, but the  
NFL liked a billion dollars a lot more.''

<HEADLINE> Report: UPS Ends Some Gun Deliveries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- United Parcel Service will stop delivering  
handguns through its ground service beginning Monday, sending gun 
companies scrambling to find alternatives to the world's largest 
package distribution company, a newspaper reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based UPS -- which handles the vast majority of firearms  
shipments -- is changing its policy to reduce the risk of guns being 
stolen en route, company officials told The Morning Call in 
Allentown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to protect ourselves from employees stealing and  
criminals stealing,'' UPS spokesman Bob Godlewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Handgun shipments have been stolen in the past, Godlewski said,  
although he would not say how many. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will continue to ship handguns by overnight air  
service, since such deliveries involve less risk than ground 
shipments that can take up to six days, Godlewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight delivery, however, costs about $25 more per gun -- or  
about four times as much for a complete shipment, said Jim 
Chambers, executive director of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition 
Manufacturers' Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we're trying to come to grips with. We're looking  
for alternative methods,'' Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS will continue to ship long guns, rifles and shotguns by  
ground. Godlewski said handguns are more of a target for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS handles up to 75 percent of guns sent from manufacturers to  
distributors and nearly 99 percent of firearms shipped from 
distributors to dealers, Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Postal Service also will not send handguns by ground  
shipment, said an employee at the service's nationwide Postal 
Answer Line. 
</P>
<P>
	A small gun dealer in Walnutport, Pa., said the UPS policy  
change would hurt his business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to kill me,'' said Paul Keifer, owner of Keifer's  
Gun Shop.

<HEADLINE> Coach Lied About Notre Dame Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, Mass. (AP) -- Football players and coaches at Old  
Colony Regional High School always took for granted that their 
assistant football coach was Nick Eddy, an All-American halfback at 
Notre Dame in the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the real Nick Eddy called the man who was impersonating  
him, and a ruse that began 20 years ago suddenly fell apart. 
William Nicholas Eddy-McMullen was forced to resign from the 
coaching staff, and he had to own up to living a lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't deny it. I didn't embellish it,'' McMullen said of  
his claims. By coincidence he shares two of the real Nick Eddy's 
names. ``In fact, people were amazed at how modest ... how I didn't 
talk about my past and my exploits and what I'd done, etcetera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials, tipped off by Eddy's call and a report by The  
Standard-Times of New Bedford, said they were surprised at why he 
lied. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is he didn't need to because he was successful just  
on his ability as a coach,'' said David Ferreira, Old Colony's 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	With McMullen assisting head coach Kevin Gonsalves, the team was  
champion of its league four of the past five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The real Nick Eddy, now an insurance executive in Modesto,  
Calif., heard of McMullen's scam through a rumor that he had 
divorced his wife and had a new family in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, `My gosh, that's where this all came from,''' said  
Eddy, who called and confirmed the story in a telephone 
conversation with McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eddy, who played seven seasons with the Detroit Lions, said  
he doesn't have any ill will toward McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only real harm, I think that has come out of it, is the  
impression that I was divorced,'' said Eddy, 55, who will soon 
celebrate his 34th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Tuesday, McMullen said his deception started  
about 20 years ago. While broke and looking for a job, the Iowa 
native interviewed at a New Bedford clothing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had played football at Notre Dame under his  
stepfather's last name, Eddy. He added that he had also used his 
middle name, Nick. 
</P>
<P>
	Noticing Notre Dame paraphernalia at the plant manager's office,  
he decided to try to boost his chances of getting hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a last minute tidbit, I threw in that I went to Notre  
Dame,'' said McMullen, whose highest degree was actually from high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	The lie worked, and McMullen kept up the facade until he moved  
to California in 1979 and temporarily dropped the act. 
</P>
<P>
	He resumed it, however, when he returned to Massachusetts in  
1989, and an old acquaintance introduced him to others as the 
football great. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of snowballed,'' McMullen said.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, McMullen was hired at Old Colony as one of several  
assistant football coaches after a chance meeting with head coach 
Kevin Gonsalves. Gonsalves had been impressed by McMullen's 
knowledge of the game -- even without McMullen bringing up his 
fictitious past. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they first learned of McMullen's claims  
when he sent his resume. Because he used his own social security 
number and passed the state's criminal records check, his past was 
never questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferreira said McMullen was a popular coach and a good motivator.  
But that didn't excuse his lies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our eyes there's something wrong in that he misrepresented  
himself when he's working with young men, trying to teach them 
honesty and proper values,'' Ferreira said. ``That's 
inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMullen said he is embarrassed about his lies. He apologized to  
the real Nick Eddy over the phone, he said, and plans to apologize 
to Old Colony's players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's going to change the nature of the relationships I  
have with just about everybody I have in this town,'' McMullen 
said. He said when the news broke, he had been working with a 
therapist to figure out how to come clean about the lie to the 
community -- and also his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is out and I've dealt with it,'' he said. ``I'm  
going to go forward and see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> New Air Bag Technology Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At car dealers this fall: new, more  
sophisticated air bags that adjust their force of inflation to the 
severity of a crash to protect passengers better. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no longer just a high-tech concept. So-called dual-stage  
air bags are on the 2000 models of some luxury cars and several of 
the nation's most popular family cars -- the Ford Taurus and Honda 
Accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety experts say the new technology will reduce deaths and  
injuries from air bags that inflated explosively, prompting a 
public outcry. 
</P>
<P>
	In serious crashes, when passengers need the devices' full power  
to cushion them, the new bags inflate with about the same force as 
those in 1999 model cars. But in lower speed crashes, the air bags 
pop open with at least 20 percent less force. 
</P>
<P>
	A sensor in the front of the car detects the severity of a crash  
by calculating the change of velocity that occurs when another 
object, such as a car, crashes into it. Another sensor registers 
whether a front seat belt is buckled. If a belt is being used, the 
full force of the air bag is delayed until a higher speed when it 
is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today in cars we have a one-bag-fits-all mentality. This  
changes all that,'' says Stephen Kozak, a Ford engineer who oversaw 
the Taurus system's development. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials, automakers, insurers and safety advocacy  
groups agree the new technology will reduce air bag deaths and 
injuries -- particularly of young children and shorter adults -- in 
low-speed crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reduces the risk (of deaths and injuries) dramatically in  
better tailoring the air bag inflation to the crash,'' said Dr. 
Ricardo Martinez, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Air bags have been blamed for at least 145 deaths -- mostly  
children and shorter women -- in low-speed crashes the victims 
otherwise should have survived, federal safety regulators say. Air 
bags also have saved an estimated 4,600 lives in higher-speed 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. has the dual-inflation air bags on both the  
driver and passenger side of its model year 2000 Taurus, the 
third-best-selling car nationwide. Honda Motor Co. has them on just 
the passenger side of its 2000 Accords. The Accord is the 
second-best-selling car. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Ford and Honda to put the technology on their  
top-selling family cars as standard equipment means that for the 
first time advanced air bags are reaching large numbers of American 
families. The automakers say they plan eventually to expand the 
system to other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to see this technology spread very rapidly,''  
said Brian O'Neill of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Several luxury automakers also have dual-stage air bags on some  
2000 models, such as the Mercedes-Benz S-class sedans and BMW 3-, 
5- and 7-series sedans, but all those models sell in much smaller 
numbers because of their high costs. Some Honda Acuras had a 
dual-stage bag for the 1999 model year. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers declined to discuss the new technology's price.  
</P>
<P>
	Toyota, which makes the Camry, the nation's best-selling car  
last year -- has not announced plans for dual-stage air bags; 
neither have other major automakers in the United States -- General 
Motors and DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	But GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said: ``It's no secret that we  
and everyone else are working on that. It's the wave of the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honda is focusing on the passenger side because that is where  
children -- the most vulnerable population -- have suffered serious 
injuries. ``It reduces the potential for air bag-related injury 
there,'' said spokesman Mike Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford believes both front-seat passengers could benefit from  
dual-stage bags with a ``significant reduction'' in moderate to 
severe injuries, including deaths, Kozak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford put the system on the driver's side to help short adults  
who sit close to the steering wheel and are more likely than other 
adults to be injured by the air bag. A sensor detects whether the 
driver's seat track is nearly or all the way forward and signals 
the air bag to always deploy the first, softer stage in crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kozak predicted the new Taurus system will eliminate about half  
of today's air bag deployments for belted passengers. And the 
majority of air bags will inflate at the lower level, he said, 
because most accidents are at lower speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	That translates into fewer air bag-related injuries.

<HEADLINE> Surprises Seen in Playoff Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Maybe this is the second coming of the Amazin'  
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	In one incredible week, New York has gone from the brink of  
elimination, to a wild-card playoff victory, then an all-night 
flight to Phoenix, where they beat Randy Johnson and the Arizona 
Diamondbacks 8-4 in the opener of their NL division series Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a great feeling,'' Edgardo Alfonzo said,  
``because we've been playing great these last couple of games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a game that didn't start until 11:10 p.m. EDT, no one played  
greater than Alfonzo, who homered off Johnson in the first inning, 
then won the game with a grand slam off reliever Bobby Chouinard in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo, who also homered against Cincinnati on Monday night in  
the game that earned the Mets the NL wild card, became the first 
player to hit a grand slam in his postseason debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last few years, Edgardo Alfonzo has been a fabulous  
baseball player who has kind of a star quality,'' said Mets manager 
Bobby Valentine, in a playoff game for the first time. ``He's 
gaining confidence, and with confidence you get performances like 
you saw tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other playoff openers, Houston beat Atlanta 6-1 in the NL and  
New York defeated Texas 8-0 in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who left the game with the bases loaded and one out in  
the ninth, lost his sixth straight postseason decision, a major 
league record. He struck out 11 and held on through an exhausting 
138 pitches as Arizona rallied from a 4-1 deficit to tie it at 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obviously not the way I would've wrote the script,''  
Johnson said. ``Hopefully, I'll have another chance to pitch 
against those guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks send Todd Stottlemyre to the mound tonight  
against New York's Kenny Rogers. The series shifts to New York for 
Game 3 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Olerud became the first left-hander to hit a home run off  
Johnson since Jim Edmonds on Sept. 23, 1997. Olerud's two-run shot 
put New York up 3-0 in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to protect the plate,'' he said. ``I was looking  
for a fastball. He threw a slider and I just reached out in front 
and grabbed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud and the Mets' other left-hander in the lineup, Robin  
Ventura, each had two hits off Johnson, who usually dominates 
lefties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got four hits left-handed, and that's determination,''  
Valentine said. ``That's reaching down and wanting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After falling behind 4-1, the Diamondbacks rallied on a solo  
homer by Erubiel Durazo and and a two-run homer by Luis Gonzalez to 
make it 4-all. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson settled down to pitch four hitless innings, but Ventura  
led off the ninth with a single. With one out, Rey Ordonez singled, 
and Johnson walked Melvin Mora to load the bases and bring on 
Chouinard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I just got a little tired and walked some people and  
got behind and gave up some hits,'' Johnson said. ``I gave it all I 
had out there in the ninth inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman Matt Williams made a diving stop, his second of  
the game, on Rickey Henderson's grounder, and threw home to force 
out Ventura, putting Arizona an out away from getting out of the 
jam. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alfonzo hit Chouinard's 3-1 pitch just inside the left-field  
foul pole for the grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little jittery,'' Chouinard said. ``It was my first  
time out there. It was a big crowd and a playoff game. I tried to 
do what I normally do, throw a first-pitch strike. I was 
overaggressive. I was trying to throw too hard. I threw a 3-1 
fastball right down the middle. I fell behind and I paid for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona manager Buck Showalter said he felt it was right to  
leave Johnson in the game, even though the big left-hander said he 
was getting close to running out of gas. Showalter, who has never 
brought closer Matt Mantei into a game with runners on base, said 
he used Chouinard because he'd been one of the best relievers this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we could have figured out a way to keep Alfonzo in the  
park, then maybe we could have had some fun in the ninth inning,'' 
Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo said that with a 3-1 count, he expected a fastball.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he wanted to walk me,'' Alfonzo said.  
</P>
<P>
	After he hit it, the only question was whether it was fair.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if it was a foul or fair ball,'' Alfonzo said.  
``I stayed at home plate, going, `C'mon, c'mon.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, whose postseason record fell to 2-6, allowed seven runs  
on eight hits. Turk Wendell pitched one inning and was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	In the seventh, Johnson doubled for his first postseason hit.  
But he was doubled up when took off running on Tony Womack's 
one-out fly ball to left. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's essentially pretty much the way the night went for  
me,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Astros 6, Braves 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Daryle Ward hit a tiebreaking homer in the sixth inning and Ken  
Caminiti hit a clinching three-run shot in the ninth as Houston won 
at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros, swept in three straight by Atlanta in the 1997 first  
round, took the lead when Ward, son of former major leaguer Gary 
Ward, connected off Greg Maddux. Atlanta had been 12-1 in 
first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 39,119 was nearly 11,000 short of capacity and was  
the smallest in Atlanta's 44-game postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Yankees 8, Rangers 0    	
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Hernandez pitched two-hit ball for eight innings, Bernie  
Williams homered and drove in six runs, and New York picked up 
right where it left off last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champions again shut down Texas. Last year, the  
Yankees swept the first-round series from the Rangers and held them 
to one run and a .141 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez improved to 3-0 with an 0.41 ERA in postseason play.  
He sent Texas to its seventh straight playoff loss and extended its 
postseason scoreless streak to 22 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 0-for-11 in last year's series against the Rangers,  
had a two-run double off Aaron Sele in the fifth inning, a 
three-run homer off Mike Venafro in the sixth and an RBI single off 
Jeff Fassero in the eighth.

	ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- United Parcel Service will stop delivering  
handguns through its ground service beginning Monday, sending gun 
companies scrambling to find alternatives to the world's largest 
package distribution company, a newspaper reported Thursday. 
Atlanta-based UPS -- which handles the vast majority of firearms 
shipments -- is changing its policy to reduce the risk of guns being 
stolen en route, company officials told The Morning Call in 
Allentown. ``We're trying to protect ourselves from employees

	SCOTIA, N.Y. (AP) -- Two National Guard cargo planes took off for  
the South Pole on Wednesday to pick up a 47-year-old doctor who 
discovered a lump in her breast. Dr. Jerri Nielsen, the only 
physician at the South Pole research station, is believed to have 
been treating herself with chemotherapy since mid-July, when drugs

<HEADLINE> Clinton May OK Treaty Vote Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signaled Wednesday he would  
accept a postponement of next week's scheduled vote on a global 
nuclear test ban treaty rather than risk near-certain defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate conservatives, led by outspoken treaty foe Jesse  
Helms, R-N.C., demanded the president request the delay in writing 
and also promise not to seek action on it through the remainder of 
his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who has made the treaty a top foreign policy priority,  
did not offer to seek such a delay, only indicating that he might 
agree to one if Senate leaders made such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	``After two long years of inaction, one week is very little time  
for considered action,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that he would continue to try to summon support for  
the treaty in the absence of such an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have balked at being seen as initiating such a delay,  
or being denied a chance to bring up the treaty in the 2000 
presidential election year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Helms, who had kept it bottled up in his Foreign Relations  
Committee for two years, told a news conference, ``We're ready to 
vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, seeing they lack the votes to ratify the  
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, ``are trying to dictate the terms of 
their own surrender,'' Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms' objection is significant because under Senate rules any  
move to cancel next week's vote would require unanimous consent of 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Helms was joined by other prominent Republicans in  
demanding Clinton seek the delay in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must share with the Senate leadership the burden of not  
going forward,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The development came as Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., were trying to 
negotiate terms of a delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a delay, the Senate will begin debating the treaty on  
Friday and vote either next Tuesday or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said if the Senate  
wanted to propose another schedule, ``we'd obviously want to be 
supportive'' of one that provides for serious analysis and timely 
action on the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the worst outcome would be to vote this treaty  
down,'' he said. ``There's no question about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, preparing to testify in  
support of the treaty on Thursday, told senators in a letter that 
American scientists were able to maintain the U.S. nuclear 
deterrent without test explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, she said, would provide an unprecedented monitoring  
system to detect others' tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the United States rejects this treaty and treats nuclear  
weapons testing as `business as usual,' so will everyone else -- and 
the nightmare of proliferation will grow,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Defense Secretary William Cohen told the Senate Armed  
Services Committee a vote against the treaty could draw 
international condemnation and even lead to new nuclear testing 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Senate rejects the treaty, the proliferation of nuclear  
weapons is more likely, posing serious challenges to our 
nonproliferation goals,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it could thrust the United States into a nuclear ``no  
man's land'' from where it would be difficult to condemn other 
nations for conducting nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Helms demanded a written request from Clinton, Lott  
had sought to extract a guarantee from Democrats that they wouldn't 
press for action at least until after next year's presidential 
election and the convening of a new Congress in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle suggested that went too far.  
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than laying down yet additional conditions, I think we  
ought to simply make the decision not to have the vote until such 
time as we know that we've got the votes to pass it,'' Daschle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If rejected, it would be the first nuclear arms control treaty  
ever turned down by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, speaking with reporters in the Rose Garden, indicated  
he would press on in seeking to build support for the treaty in the 
absence of a delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``For now, the vote is scheduled for Tuesday, and I will  
continue to aggressively argue to the Senate and to the American 
people that this is in our national interest,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary, said senators may need  
``more months to look at this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they change the schedule, we will adjust accordingly,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has been signed by 154 nations, but ratified by only  
48 -- Mexico becoming the latest to do so on Wednesday. But only two 
of the seven declared nuclear powers -- Britain and France -- have 
ratified it. 
</P>
<P>
	To be ratified, the treaty must be approved by 67 senators, or  
two-thirds of the Senate. Even if all 45 Democrats vote for it, 
they must be joined by 22 Republicans for it to pass.

<HEADLINE> Siemens Closer To Glass Fiber Exit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT (AP) -- Siemens AG confirmed today that it is in talks  
to sell its 50 percent stake in the Siecor Corp. glass fiber joint 
venture with Corning Inc. A sale would complete Siemens' exit from 
the cables business. 
</P>
<P>
	A Siemens spokesman, however, declined to discuss a report in  
the German business monthly Manager Magazin that it plans to sell 
the stake to Corning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not commenting on the content of the talks at this  
time,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siemens last year decided to give up its cables business amid a  
major restructuring, and has already sold its high voltage 
electricity cable operations to Italy's Pirelli SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	It has almost completed the sale of all its copper cables  
operations, except for a production plant in the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Magazin reported that Corning, nased in Corning, N.Y.,  
plans to merge Siecor, based in Hickory, N.C., with British 
producer Optical Fibres, which it acquired last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Siecor was formed in 1997 and is one of the world's leading  
glass fiber producers.

<HEADLINE> U-Haul Founder Shoen Dead at 83 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Leonard S. Shoen, who transformed the moving  
industry when he founded U-Haul International Inc. more than five 
decades ago, has died in an apparent suicide. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoen drove his car into a wooden power pole on Monday, police  
said. The case remained under investigation Tuesday, but the Clark 
County coroner's office ruled the death a suicide. Schoen died from 
blunt force trauma. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason for the accident,'' police Detective Rick  
Hart said. ``Nobody else was around. They determined that it looked 
like suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoen founded U-Haul in 1945 and built it into the most  
recognized do-it-yourself moving company in the nation with its 
signature orange and white trucks. He was later forced into 
retirement by his sons, sparking a bitter feud and 
multimillion-dollar court battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoen came up with the idea of providing one-way moving trailers  
at the age of 29, after serving in the Navy during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	With an initial investment of $5,000, he and then-wife Anna Mary  
Carty started the company at the Carty Ranch in Ridgefield, Wash., 
where they built the first U-Haul trailers. The company is now 
based in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	His concept for U-Haul was developed out of a need to provide  
inexpensive means of moving a post-World War II American population 
that had become migratory, especially to the West, according to the 
company's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The original U-Haul trailers were painted bright orange and  
rented for $2 a day. By 1949 it was possible to rent U-Haul 
trailers one way from city to city throughout most of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the company has 14,000 independent dealers and 1,100  
company-owned moving centers. It is the leading company in the 
truck and trailer rental industry and the second-largest 
self-storage facility operator. U-Haul also is the world's largest 
installer of permanent hitches. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Shoen's sons -- Joe and Mark -- forced their father into  
retirement and pushed for control of the parent company, Reno-based 
Amerco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The move triggered a fight that ended in a $1.5 billion jury  
award that five Amerco directors had to pay Leonard Shoen and other 
``outsiders.'' A judge later reduced the award to $461 million, and 
the five directors later sought personal bankruptcy protection from 
the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the shakeup at U-Haul, Shoen lived in Las Vegas, where he  
owned the World Trade Center hotel since 1996. He withdrew his 
application with the Nevada Gaming Commission for a gaming license 
in May.

<HEADLINE> Brown &AMP; Williamson To Close a Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Brown &AMP; Williamson Corp. plans to  
close its specialty-tobacco products plant here within the next 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	One hundred people will lose their jobs at Brown &AMP; Williamson,  
which was formed by George Brown and Robert Williamson in 1894 in 
Winston-Salem. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson, the third-largest tobacco manufacturer in  
the United States after Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, 
moved its corporate headquarters and most of its operations to 
Louisville, Ky., in 1929. That was two years after it was bought by 
British American Tobacco Co. of London. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Smith, a spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson, said the plant  
closing is part of a consolidation of its speciality-tobacco 
business following the merger by its parent company with Rothmans 
International earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	All production of the combined company's speciality-tobacco  
products will be moved to Rothmans International's plant in Tucker, 
Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Winston-Salem plant is older and less efficient than the one  
in Tucker, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined division in Tucker will account for about 62  
percent of the United States' roll-your-own cigarette market and 
about 42 percent of the pipe-tobacco market, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson's 150,000-square-foot plant produces 4.5  
million pounds of speciality-tobacco products a year, including Sir 
Walter Raleigh pipe tobacco, Bugler and Kite roll-your-own smoking 
tobacco, Tube Rose dry snuff, and the firm-plug products of 
Bloodhound, Sun Cured and Red Juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothmans' Lane and Tobacco Exporters International units in  
Tucker manufacture Captain Black pipe tobacco, Roll Rich 
roll-your-own smoking tobacco and Winchester small cigars. The 
division also imports and markets Dunhill and Cartier cigarettes.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart To Add, Remodel Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s redesigned Web site will  
include more than 600,000 items and will allow shoppers to do 
everything from booking airline reservations to refilling 
prescription drugs to buying best-selling books. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest retailer unveiled details of its  
much-awaited Internet strategy late Tuesday, just hours after it 
announced an aggressive store expansion plan for next year and 
better-than-expected sales for September. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts have been waiting for details of Wal-Mart's  
new site, many believing the retailing giant's push online could 
revolutionize e-commerce. Wal-Mart is known for keeping prices down 
and has very sophisticated method of collecting consumer and 
product information. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart will launch the revamped Wal-Mart.com site early next  
year, though some of the changes -- including a broader selection of 
toys and electronics -- will start appearing on the site this 
holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not just about just doing e-commerce,'' said Glenn  
Habern, senior vice president of new business development at 
Wal-Mart. ``It is about driving traffic to our stores as well as 
doing things online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart said the new site by next May  
will have about six times as many products than are found at one of 
its discount stores. The number of books, music, video games and 
home video titles alone will increase tenfold from what 
Wal-Mart.com offers now. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart.com will also offer travel services, including  
reservations for airline tickets, hotels and car rentals. Late next 
year, it will also offer on online pharmacy, giving shoppers the 
option to receive their prescriptions by mail or pick them up at a 
local Wal-Mart store. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on the Web site will match those found in its stores, but  
shoppers will be required to pay extra for delivery. Items bought 
online can be returned to Wal-Mart's bricks-and-mortar stores, 
according to analysts who attended the conference where details of 
the new Web strategy were revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will be very competitive with prices on the Internet just  
like they are in their stores,'' said Walter Loeb, a retail 
consultant who runs Loeb Associates. ``So if someone like eToys is 
offering something for a lot less, they will fight it out with 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Wal-Mart stores will have kiosks linked to the company's  
Web site, so that shoppers can find merchandise that may not be 
stocked in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart will promote the Web site through in-store signs and  
its weekly newspaper circulars, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its Internet announcement, Wal-Mart also said  
Tuesday that it planned to l open, remodel or relocate as many as 
340 stores next year, as well as greatly expand the number of 
distribution centers it operates. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of Wal-Mart's new stores, 160 to 165, will be  
SuperCenters, which combine traditional Wal-Mart discount stores 
with grocery operations. About 100 of them will be expansions of 
existing discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 new stores will be the retailer's regular discount  
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart will expand testing its Neighborhood Markets, adding  
five to 10 units in the fiscal year starting Feb. 1. Wal-Mart's 
Sam's Club division will open 20 to 25 discount warehouse stores, 
with about half being relocations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also plans to open up to 100 stores in existing  
foreign markets, including Germany and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Barnard, president of the newsletter Barnard's Retail Trend  
Report, said the expansion will benefit consumers because it will 
intensify competition with rival merchants, which could force 
prices down at other stores.. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart also unveiled the largest distribution center expansion  
in its history. It will add four regional general merchandise 
centers, four food distribution centers and two fresh food 
distribution centers. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Sept. 30, Wal-Mart had 1,821 discount stores, 650  
SuperCenters and 453 Sam's Clubs in the United States. It also has 
more than 850 stores overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart also announced that its sales from stores open at least  
a year rose 7.2 percent in September compared with a year ago, 
while total sales rose 26.4 percent from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
business. Other retailers are expected to report their monthly 
sales figures on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Issue Engulfs Mass. Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Accusations of bias are particularly painful to  
Margaret Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	An immigrant who earned two Ivy League degrees, she rose to  
become only the second female justice on the state's highest court 
in its 307-year history. As a college student in her native South 
Africa, she was an anti-apartheid leader who led protests against a 
cruel and oppressive government. 
</P>
<P>
	So she was deeply offended by recent claims that she is biased  
against Catholics, charges leveled after the governor nominated her 
to become chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``My entire life, I have tried to learn to be fair and  
open-minded to everybody,'' she said last week. ``The claim that I 
hold bias against anyone is a blow to my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over Marshall's elevation has generated friction in  
Boston's political establishment, involving sensitive topics like 
abortion rights, gender bias and even snobbery. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really an old-boy town,'' said Alan Dershowitz, a  
Harvard University law professor who supports Ms. Marshall, a 
Harvard graduate who served as the university's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old-boy network in Boston hates Harvard, hates women,  
hates feisty women, and, to paraphrase President John F. Kennedy, 
she has the worst of all possible worlds -- she has a Yale education 
and a Harvard job,'' he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-member Governor's Council was expected to vote on Ms.  
Marshall's elevation to chief justice on Oct. 13, and aides to Gov. 
Paul Cellucci have expressed confidence that his nominee will be 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the once smooth road to Ms. Marshall's nomination has  
become rocky, despite endorsements from both The Boston Globe and 
the Boston Herald. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Cardinal Bernard Law, who heads the Roman Catholic  
Archdiocese of Boston, wrote to Cellucci and said Ms. Marshall was 
``open to serious charges of anti-Catholicism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law cited an incident in which Ms. Marshall, as Harvard general  
counsel, chastised a professor who had used university stationery 
for a personal note with an anti-abortion message. 
</P>
<P>
	Catholic groups also fear that she cannot be impartial on  
abortion cases since she once served on an abortion clinic's board 
of trustees. Ms. Marshall denies her personal views would affect 
her role as jurist. 
</P>
<P>
	Law later retracted his assertion of bias after a phone  
conversation with Ms. Marshall, who is Protestant. 
</P>
<P>
	``She gave me her assurance that she was not anti-Catholic,''  
the cardinal said, ``and I have absolutely no reason to not accept 
her word on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law's criticism opened the door for all sorts of attacks on Ms.  
Marshall, a 55-year-old jurist married to New York Times columnist 
Anthony Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have accused Ms. Marshall of helping to quash a charge of  
ethnic bias leveled against Harvard security guards seven years ago 
by hiring her former law firm to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm's six-month investigation exonerated the school,  
although the Russian immigrant was later awarded nearly $3 million 
by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	And an Iranian-American scholar claims Ms. Marshall played a  
role in his false arrest by Harvard police because he blew the 
whistle on the university's financial connection to a 
fundamentalist group opposed to author Salman Rushdie. Harvard has 
denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor has accused Ms. Marshall's detractors of opposing  
her because she is a woman. Dershowitz had another explanation: He 
said Ms. Marshall represents a threat to the state's hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old boys appoint the old boys and they know if they're in  
trouble, they can always make a phone call,'' Dershowitz said. 
``She is outside the political realm and there's nervousness about 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Nazi Slave Labor Talks Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talks on compensation for former Nazi slave  
laborers made some progress Wednesday, but the big issue in the 
two-day session -- the money part -- was scheduled for the second 
day, negotiators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Otto Lambsdorff, chief German negotiator in the multinational  
talks, said in an interview late Wednesday afternoon that progress 
was made on issues such as how any future lawsuits brought by 
forced laborers will be handled in U.S. courts. 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted that he would not be presenting until Thursday's  
session the German offer on how much survivors might be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This, of course, will set a new tone and be the beginning of a  
new discussion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the survivors, German companies that used  
slave labor and several governments have been meeting for months to 
negotiate a plan under which the German government and German 
industry would set up two foundations to pay as many as 2.4 million 
people forced into labor as part of Hitler's war effort. 
</P>
<P>
	During that time survivors reportedly have demanded $20 billion  
in compensation while German businesses were said to be considering 
offering $3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	No officials involved in the talks have confirmed those figures.  
</P>
<P>
	But attorneys for survivors have criticized all figures the  
German's were rumored and reported to be contemplating, calling 
them far too low. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambsdorff, however, said he felt the offer he was bringing to  
the meeting was a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only say that what I'm going to present tomorrow is the  
result of very tough efforts in the German Republic to put this 
huge amount of money together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I would not have come here if I would not feel in a  
position to defend it as a justified, dignified offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he backed away from recent reports quoting him as saying his  
offer this week would be ``the final'' one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been asked whether I have the authority to compromise.  
I have not,'' Lambsdorff said. ``If we can make an offer, then the 
ball is in the court of the other side and they will, and have to, 
react.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he ``would be happy'' if agreement on all foundation  
issues, including money, could be reached by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivor attorney Mel Weiss said it was ``somewhat comforting  
... that it's not going to be a take-it-or-leave-it offer, which 
leaves room for the negotiations to continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department says an estimated 12 million workers were  
forced to labor in German industry and agriculture, some producing 
materials for the war and also to free German men to fight on the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast number of victims who still survive are Eastern  
European Christians from countries overrun by Hitler's forces in 
the early years of the war, the department says. Estimates vary 
from 1 million to 2.5 million eligible for compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the United States and Germany, other governments  
involved in the negotiations are those of Israel, Poland, Belarus, 
Ukraine, Russia and the Czech Republic, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen German companies, which have been sued in U.S. courts,  
originally were involved in the talks, but some two dozen more are 
reported to be planning to contribute to the foundation fund as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has said negotiations will get money to  
more people, and faster, than the lawsuits would. Part of he 
agreement would be a U.S. government statement, essentially 
discouraging the courts from accepting further cases, or saying 
that future claims should be handled by the foundations.

<HEADLINE> Pele's Son Convicted of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The son of Brazilian soccer great Pele  
was convicted of murder early today for participating in a street 
car race which resulted in the death of a passing motorcyclist. 
</P>
<P>
	Edson Cholbi do Nascimento, 29, received a six-year sentence to  
be served under a work release program, which means he must sleep 
in prison but can leave during the day to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento and Marcilio Jose Marinho de Melo, 25, -- who also was  
convicted and received the same sentence -- were accused of racing 
their cars in Santos, a town 48 miles southeast of Sao Paulo, when 
they struck and killed 50-year-old retiree Pedro Simoes Neto. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Melo's car was the one that hit Neto, Nascimento was  
found guilty for taking part in the race in October 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the verdict, Nascimento's lawyer, Marlon Machado  
filed an appeal claiming that some of the witnesses had ``obviously 
lied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so obvious, that the judge reminded one of them that he  
was testifying under oath,'' Machado said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he thought some witnesses would lie, Machado said:  
``Probably to show Brazil and the rest of the world that impunity 
will not be tolerated in Santos and that even the son of a famous 
and wealthy personality could be sent to jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But in this case they helped convict two innocent people.'' he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Superior Tribunal of Justice of the state of Sao  
Paulo probably will rule on his appeal by August 2000. If the 
appeal is successful, a new trial would be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento and Melo will remain free until the appeal is judged.  
</P>
<P>
	Machado tried to convince the jurors that Simoes Neto was killed  
in an accident and not because of a car race. 
</P>
<P>
	Globo News showed videotape of Nascimento denying he had  
anything to do with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I witnessed an accident that happened in front of me,''  
Nascimento told the judge. ``My only involvement was as a 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Nascimento nor Pele were available for immediate  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agencia Folha news agency quoted Nascimento as saying: ``We  
should congratulate the prosecutor because he managed to condemn 
two innocent people without proof.''

<HEADLINE> States Have College Saving Plans / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One of the casualties of the recent tax bill  
veto was the state-sponsored college savings plan and its 
tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
	But plan proponents believe tax-free withdrawals eventually will  
be permitted. Even in their present form, they say, college savings 
plans are among the best programs around for families with 
college-bound kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are attracted to the vehicle today. You have an  
unbeatable way to save for school,'' said Jim McCarthy, vice 
president of tax product development for Merrill Lynch, which 
manages the savings plan for Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other industry experts believe a bipartisan compromise  
eventually will emerge to make savings plan earnings tax exempt. 
The effort had been approved by Congress but stalled out because it 
was tacked on to the $729 billion tax cut bill President Clinton 
vetoed in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it will come back at some point,'' said Joseph F.  
Hurley, author of ``The Best Way to Save for College.'' ``There 
isn't really much opposition to the change that's being talked 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the biggest attraction of the savings plan -- aka the  
529 plan after the Internal Revenue Code section which allows them, 
and also known as a qualified state tuition plan -- is that earnings 
are tax-deferred until withdrawn for tuition, room and board or 
other college expenses. Then they're taxed as ordinary income at 
the student's tax rate, which is usually lower than that of the 
parents or whomever is funding the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other big pluses:  
</P>
<P>
	--No income limits. Everyone can participate. Other plans, like  
the Roth Individual Retirement Account, which can be tapped to pay 
educational expenses, have strict limits for adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
	--Few residency restrictions. Unlike the more established prepaid  
tuition plans, many state-run savings plans are available to 
out-of-state investors, and the money can be used for any college 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	--More parental control. Custodial accounts let children use the  
money as they please after a certain age, but college savings plans 
must be used for education. Many states even allow those funding 
the plans to change beneficiaries or take back the money. 
</P>
<P>
	--More contributions permitted. Anyone -- parent, grandparent,  
generous friend -- can contribute up to $50,000 in a child's account 
in a single year and owe no gift tax, provided they make no 
additional gifts during the next four years. The $50,000 counts for 
five years' worth of $10,000 tax-free gifts allowed per donor each 
year under current gifting laws. The Roth IRA limits contributions 
to $2,000 a year; the maximum annual contribution for an Education 
IRA, a tax-free savings vehicle, is $500. 
</P>
<P>
	There are limits, though, to the total contributions permitted  
for college savings plans. The tax law says a program cannot accept 
more than what is need to pay for college -- in other words, five 
year's worth of undergraduate expenses at the most expensive 
college in a state, according to Hurley. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are some drawbacks. For one thing, a student's ability  
to obtain financial aid could be adversely impacted. Also, neither 
parent nor student has control over how money within a state plan 
is invested. 
</P>
<P>
	Most state savings plans have special age-based portfolios of  
mutual funds, which generally means the younger the child, the more 
aggressive the investment strategy. But there's no guarantee 
savings will cover future costs -- if the stock market tumbles, so 
too may the portfolio's value. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the savings plan remains far more attractive than the  
more restrictive prepaid tuition plan, which has been around for 
about 10 years. Although prepaid tuition plans still hold the most 
money, more states have been offering savings plans, thanks to 
recent tax changes that have helped cleared up some lingering tax 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, competition is heating up among the financial  
institutions for a piece of this growing market. The trend among 
the states is to shift responsibility for managing a plan to 
outside companies. 
</P>
<P>
	TIAA-CREF (Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association) has  
managed New York's state tuition savings program for about a year 
and was selected to manage programs in California, Vermont, 
Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and Minnesota. Fidelity manages plans 
in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	This past summer, Merrill Lynch began running Maine's program.  
Salomon Smith Barney was recently chosen to handle the program in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurley sees this competition as beneficial for consumers.  
</P>
<P>
	``They (the states) ... are doing everything they can to make  
the programs attractive for families,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurley's book has a state-by-state breakdown of various plans.  
The College Savings Plans Network has a Web site 
(www.savingforcollege.com) that lists and rates them.

<HEADLINE> Testud Snaps S. Williams Win Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) -- Serena Williams' winning streak was  
snapped at 16 matches Wednesday when she blew a 5-1 lead in the 
third set at the Porsche Grand Prix against Sandrine Testud. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams appeared to be overpowering the defending champion and  
world's 13th-ranked player when both her backhand and serve 
suddenly deserted her in the 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Testud put a lot of pressure on me -- and I cracked. That's  
unusual for me,'' said Williams. ``I don't know what happened. I'm 
very disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger of the Williams sisters last was beaten at the  
French Open by fellow American Mary Joe Fernandez. She was trying 
to break her own personal best of 16 straight wins set earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams, 18, blew hot-and-cold during the match at the  
$520,000 event, which boasts 22 of the world's top 25 players. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seeded Martina Hingis and No. 2 Lindsay Davenport both  
advanced Wednesday with wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was dominant in the first set and led 3-0 in the  
second, up two breaks. Then she suddenly fell apart and finally 
dropped the set, the final point coming on a double fault. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Williams appeared in control as she raced to a 5-1 lead  
in the decisive third set. But another double fault gave Testud her 
first service break in the set, closing the Frenchwoman to 3-5. 
Then, Williams lost one rally after another by blasting shots into 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the worst I ever played. My serve was really off,''  
she said. ``You can bet I'll practice it when I get home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American's last chance to win disappeared when she had a  
chance to go back up 6-5. But her backhand spun around the top of 
the net and fell back inside her half of the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did she really lead 5-1? I didn't know that. It's  
unbelievable,'' said Testud. ``I was just playing point by point. I 
served very well -- that really helped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testud also took away Williams' practice of ripping winners off  
her opponents' weak second serve by simply hitting her second serve 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was fresh off winning the U.S. Open and last week's  
lucrative Compaq Grand Slam Cup, collecting almost $2 million in 
the two tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	She now plans to attend college in Florida and will next play at  
the Chase Championships in New York Nov. 15-21. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open, her first Grand Slam tournament title, capped a  
meteoric rise in which Williams became only the fourth player to 
rise from being unranked to No. 4 within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis beat Jennifer Capriati 6-4, 6-0 to reach the  
quarterfinals, while Davenport routed Silvia Farina of Italy 6-0, 
6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis, playing the event where she won her first WTA Tour title  
in 1996, struggled at first against Capriati, who has risen to 30th 
in the rankings this year. But the Swiss teen-ager needed only 15 
minutes to blow past the American in the second set and reach the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first set was a little nerve-wracking, but then I played  
well,'' said Hingis, the world's top-ranked player. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Mary Pierce, seeded fourth, needed two hours, 25  
minutes to struggle past Natasha Zvereva of Belarus 7-6 (7-3), 5-7, 
6-4. Another Frenchwoman, Nathalie Dechy, ousted American Mary Joe 
Fernandez 7-6 (7-4), 6-1.

<HEADLINE> Miami's Collins Promoted to Starter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins rookie running back Cecil  
``The Diesel'' Collins will make his first start Sunday at 
Indianapolis in place of Karim Abdul-Jabbar, who was demoted to 
third string Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cecil gives us a chance to get some big plays,'' coach Jimmy  
Johnson said. ``We want to let him get into a rhythm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big plays were rare for Abdul-Jabbar, a starter since his rookie  
season in 1996. His longest run last year was 18 yards, and in his 
three full seasons, Miami ranked 19th, 29th and 24th in the NFL in 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie J.J. Johnson will spell Collins on Sunday, and  
Abdul-Jabbar might be inactive, coach Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to play the two young guys,'' the coach said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Karim is a valuable player to us. He may not be getting action  
right now, but as I told him, we're going to need him before this 
year is over. He's got a real good attitude about it. He 
understands the situation. He's obviously disappointed, but he's a 
professional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lineup change was based on potential rather than production,  
because all three running backs have struggled. Abdul-Jabbar has 
rushed for 95 yards on 28 carries, a 3.4 average, and Collins has 
gained 92 yards on 31 carries, a 3.0 average. 
</P>
<P>
	But Collins has been recovering from a sprained ankle, and he  
showed flashes of brilliance in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of talent,'' Johnson said. ``I want to put guys  
in there who are going to make plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, limited to six games in college because of drug and  
legal problems, slipped to the fifth round in the April draft. He 
has avoided controversy with the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just looking forward to contributing any way I'm asked,  
whether it's as a starter or a backup,'' he said. ``I've learned a 
lot by playing as much as I have the first few games, and I think 
I'm ready for this opportunity. I'm just going to go out and play 
as well as I can.''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Reviews Hawaii Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices questioned Hawaii's  
policy of letting only people with Hawaiian blood elect leaders of 
a state program benefiting descendants of the islands' original 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Several justices appeared sympathetic to a white lifelong Hawaii  
resident's argument that the state constitutional provision amounts 
to unlawful racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``You say this isn't race'' but a trust intended to benefit  
certain people, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy told the state's lawyer 
who defended the voting limit. But Kennedy likened the provision to 
a state providing benefits only to descendants of people who could 
vote at a time when only white people were allowed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it has to do with Hawaiian ethnicity,'' Kennedy  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is who can vote for trustees of the Office of Hawaiian  
Affairs, which administers state funds and proceeds of public land 
to aid people descended from original Hawaiians. The office 
administers a $300 million trust that provides economic, social, 
health and education aid for an estimated 200,000 residents of 
Hawaiian blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The state constitution limits voting for the trustees to people  
descended from the original Hawaiians on the islands in 1778, date 
of the first known arrival by Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii was a kingdom through the 1800s until 1893, when the last  
queen was overthrown with U.S. help. Hawaii then became a U.S. 
territory until 1959, when it became the 50th state. 
</P>
<P>
	The voting limit was challenged in federal court by Harold Rice,  
a rancher who has no Hawaiian blood, although his family has lived 
on the islands since the mid-1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Theodore B. Olson, called the provision ``ballot box  
racial discrimination, plain and simple. ... Because he has the 
wrong ancestry, he is no longer Hawaiian and he may not vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state's lawyer, John G. Roberts Jr., said Rice was not  
denied the right to vote on racial grounds but because he is not a 
beneficiary of the trust. Rice did not challenge the state's right 
to create a trust to benefit people with Hawaiian blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The state, supported by the Clinton administration, contends the  
voting law is valid because the federal government has an 
obligation to native Hawaiians who lost their land similar to its 
obligation to American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the comparison between  
Hawaiians and American Indians ``seems to me quite strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii ``was a sovereign kingdom,'' she said. ``The United  
States had a large hand in destroying that sovereignty.'' Ginsburg 
wondered whether a ruling in Rice's favor would affect other 
provisions regarding native Hawaiians and possibly other people 
such as native Alaskans. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia said the Constitution refers to Indian  
tribes and noted the Hawaiian descendants do not have the same 
tribal structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked Olson whether his argument would  
entitle 18-year-olds to vote for board members of a senior citizen 
center. But Breyer also questioned extending the definition of 
Hawaiians ``to people 10 generations later'' who had ``one ancestor 
many years ago?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer Edwin S. Kneedler said the Hawaiian  
descendants are a ``distinct people determined to maintain their 
culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scalia shot back, ``A lot of groups in this country are like  
that.''

<HEADLINE> Ozone Hole Smaller Than Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The area of depleted ozone over the South Pole  
-- the ``ozone hole'' -- has shrunk slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA reported Wednesday that the depleted area stretched 9.8  
million square miles on Sept. 15. The record area of Antarctic 
ozone depletion of 10.5 million square miles was set on Sept. 19, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials cautioned that the decreased size of the ozone  
hole is not an indication of the recovery of Antarctic ozone 
levels. They said year-to-year variations of size and depth of the 
ozone hole depend primarily on the variations in weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone in the upper atmosphere forms a protective layer, helping  
block dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun. 
Environmentalists fear the depletion could spread to other areas, 
leading to more skin cancer and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the main ozone depleted area, the scientists  
found a thinning area of ozone had formed between New Zealand and 
Antarctica on Sept. 17 and drifted west for several days. Referred 
to as a ``mini-hole,'' this resulted from the redistribution of 
ozone by a large weather system. 
</P>
<P>
	The ozone is damaged by chlorine and bromine compounds released  
by industrial products. International treaties regulate the 
production of these gases, and the amount of chlorine in some 
regions of the stratosphere is beginning to decline.

<HEADLINE> School Shooting Survivor Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- One of the two dozen students wounded in a  
1998 shooting attack in a school cafeteria has been killed in a 
hunting accident, struck by a shot from his brother's rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Peek Jr., 19, who was wounded in one arm in the  
bloodshed at Thurston High School, was shot in the head Tuesday 
while hunting deer with his 17-year-old brother, Robert, said Lane 
County sheriff's Sgt. Byron Trapp. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were hunting near Vida when Robert's rifle  
discharged, Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert was not charged but the shooting remains under  
investigation, Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of the brothers were in the Thurston cafeteria in  
Springfield when Kip Kinkel opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle, 
killing two and wounded others. Kinkel, who had also killed his 
parents, pleaded guilty last month to four counts of murder and 26 
counts of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Peek said in February he still suffered pain in his  
wounded arm but surgery had helped him regain movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how he would change society in light of the school  
shooting, he said: ``I'd make it harder for kids to get guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told The Register-Guard of Eugene that he missed a day of  
work after the Littleton, Colo., shooting in April. ``I couldn't 
deal with it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peek's family had filed a $250,000 lawsuit against Kinkel and  
his parents' estate.

<HEADLINE> Daimler, Canada Union Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers and DaimlerChrysler AG  
have reached a contract agreement, less than two hours before 
13,800 union workers were to walk off the job. 
</P>
<P>
	CAW President Buzz Hargrove said at a news conference in Toronto  
that the deal reached late Tuesday was modeled on an agreement 
union members ratified last week with Ford Motor Co. of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an excellent deal,'' Hargrove said. ``I have absolutely  
no disappointment at all. After bargaining a long while, I know you 
don't get everything you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken McCarter, vice president for human resources of  
DaimlerChrysler Canada, expressed satisfaction with the agreement, 
which he said addressed the major issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers will begin meeting Friday to vote on ratification and a  
decision could be announced late Sunday, CAW spokesman John 
McClyment said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the United Auto Workers has set a deadline  
to reach an agreement with Ford. The UAW said Tuesday it would not 
extend its contract beyond 3:30 p.m. Friday, a sign talks could be 
intensifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks on a new contract to cover about 100,000 U.S. Ford  
employees were to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the Canadian deal, the two sides appeared to be at  
a standstill over four disputes related to union organizing and 
future work. The union had set a strike deadline of 11:59 p.m. 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the agreement between CAW and Ford, workers received a 3  
percent wage increase in each year of a three-year package, a 
$1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus, a lucrative retirement package and 
other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said the agreement with DaimlerChrysler also includes a  
$1,200 (Canadian) Christmas bonus and $800 in tuition fees for 
dependents. He said that under the agreement, 2,300 workers are 
eligible to retire immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove had said that the union could strike over disputes at  
DaimlerChrysler plants in Windsor and Ajax, Ontario, where work has 
not been assigned. He said the CAW had reached agreements at both 
those plants, including saving more than 70 jobs at the Ajax plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said DaimlerChrysler is committed to new investment  
worth $400 million (U.S.) at the truck plant in Windsor, which has 
2,000 workers. He said he expects more workers to be hired at the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said the union did not make any progress in its effort  
to force DaimlerChrysler to pressure a supplier, Magna 
International Inc., to recognize the union in Magna's plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're walking away empty handed on the Magna issue,'' Hargrove  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW now moves on to negotiations with General Motors of  
Canada Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Asarco Accepts Phelps Dodge Buyout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Asarco Inc. has accepted Phelps Dodge's $1.1  
billion takeover offer, completing a three-way $2.9 billion merger 
and putting an end to a bidding war that has reshaped the world's 
copper industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, reached late Tuesday, as well as last week's deal  
to buy Cyprus Amax Minerals Co, puts together three of the nation's 
four largest copper producers under the Phelps Dodge umbrella, 
creating the world's largest copper company. 
</P>
<P>
	In accepting the Phelps Dodge bid, Asarco's board rejected a  
slightly lower offer from Mexico City-based Grupo Mexico, even 
though the companies each hold a 10 percent interest in the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals come as the industry, which was battered by  
overproduction and softened demand from Asia, is slowly rebounding 
from rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco and Cyprus originally rejected what began as a hostile  
stock-only takeover bid by Phoenix-based Phelps Dodge, which 
already was the nation's largest copper producer before the 
takeover bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco's acceptance came after Phelps Dodge raised its bid and  
included a total of $1 billion in cash. Phelps Dodge offered $1.8 
billion for Cyprus Amax. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The merger) is an effective strategy to make more money,''  
said John Tumazos, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. 
But Phelps Dodge will have to lower their costs faster than prices 
fall to boost their profits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge has estimated the combined company will save $200  
million a year by the end of 2001 by making their operations, 
administration and exploration more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not in the depths of despair we were in, say three  
months ago,'' said Kurt Billick, an analyst for Warburg Dillon Read 
in San Francisco, referring to the copper industry. But ``Phelps 
paid a pretty full price and they're gonna have to do quite a bit 
to recoup the investment.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago's Probert, Manson Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NHL announced Wednesday the suspensions of  
Chicago Blackhawks forward Bob Probert for four games, and 
defenseman Dave Manson for three games. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspensions resulted from an altercation in Chicago's Oct. 4  
game against San Jose. While on the bench, both players became 
involved in confrontations with a Sharks player on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Probert received a match penalty for attempt to injure when he  
struck San Jose goaltender Steve Shields with his stick. Manson 
grabbed Shields from the bench during the same incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The league has previously issued a clear directive in this  
regard,'' NHL executive vice president and director of hockey 
operations Colin Campbell said. ``The message should be clear: any 
involvement with players on the ice by players off the ice is not 
acceptable and will be subject to discipline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Probert will miss the Blackhawks next four games, beginning Oct.  
6 at Vancouver. Manson will miss the first three of those games. 
</P>
<P>
	Probert forfeits $33,854 in salary, while Manson will have to  
give up $55,243 to the NHL's Emergency Assistance Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest league disciplinary action comes one day after three  
Anaheim players were suspended for incidents in an Oct. 1 game 
against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mighty Ducks defenseman Ruslan Salei was suspended for 10 games  
for his hit on Stars captain Mike Modano. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim defenseman Pascal Trepanier was suspended five games for  
hitting Dallas center Joe Nieuwendyk with an elbow to the head 
midway through the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Jim McKenzie was suspended for initiating an altercation  
with Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor, and persisting although Sydor 
offered no resistance and was defenseless.

<HEADLINE> Telescope Reveals Galaxy Bulges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After taking a closer look at the centers of  
the massive spiral galaxies in space, scientists have found 
differences in how and when the star groups formed. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of studies were released Wednesday by the National  
Aeronautics and Space Administration detailing what researchers 
have been able to learn using the Hubble space telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulges of millions of stars in the more tightly wound spiral  
galaxies formed early in the life of the universe, according to a 
team led by Reynier Peletier of the University of Nottingham in 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	While a second team, led by C. Marcella Carollo of Columbia  
University in New York, concluded that galaxies with small bulges 
and long bars or lines of stars that bisect the nucleus grew more 
recently and through different processes. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers say the central bulge stabilizes a galaxy's  
development and largely controls the ebb and flow of star birth in 
the core. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hubble telescope allows astronomers, who had previously been  
able to study only the bulge at the center of our own galaxy, to 
peer deep inside the bulges of other galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
	Carollo's team said the central bulge in the galaxies they  
studied probably formed early in the history of the universe, but 
was later fed by gas flowing into the galaxy's core, caused by 
instability in the surrounding disk of stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The gas fueled the birth of new stars, and the bulge grew, with  
bright star clusters populating the center. They found both young 
and old stars in the bulge. 
</P>
<P>
	Peletier's researchers studied the center of 20 spiral galaxies  
that have large bulges. They concluded that elliptical bulges of 
stars formed over a relatively brief period very early in the young 
universe, either through the collapse of a single cloud of hydrogen 
or the merger of primeval star clusters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bulges of early spiral galaxies are old, and at least the  
outer parts of their disks are considerably younger,'' Peletier 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups used Hubble telescope to study more than 200  
neighboring galaxies, out to a distance of 100 million light years. 
A light year is the distance light travels in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Using visible light and infrared cameras, they were able to  
determine the stars' true colors. Older stars tend to be redder, 
but space dust can interfere with color perception from Earth. The 
Hubble space telescope permitted the researchers to look past that 
dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Peletier's report is scheduled for publication in Monthly  
Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and Carollo's work will 
appear in Astrophysical Journal.

<HEADLINE> Report: FBI Fired Shots at Davidians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An expert sought by the House Government  
Reform Committee says he believes an FBI agent fired shots during 
the bureau's 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	That view, expressed in an interview published in today's  
editions of The Washington Post, is at odds with the FBI's position 
that none of its agents fired shots at any time during the siege in 
which about 80 people died. 
</P>
<P>
	The expert in thermal imaging and videotape analysis, Carlos  
Ghigliotti, has done work for the FBI in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I conclude that the FBI fired shots on that day,'' Ghigliotti  
told the Post in an interview conducted Tuesday. ``I conclude this 
based on the ground-view videotapes taken from several different 
angles simultaneously and based on the overhead thermal tape. The 
gunfire from the ground is there, without a doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghigliotti, owner of Infrared Technologies Corp., in Laurel,  
Md., said the tapes also confirm that the Davidians fired at FBI 
agents repeatedly during the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Although FBI agents were operating under rules that permitted  
them to return fire, bureau officials have maintained that no 
agents fired any shots -- a stance reiterated today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI has not changed its position that there has been no  
evidence developed to date to indicate that any FBI agents fired 
any rounds during the standoff at Waco,'' said bureau spokesman 
Tron Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghigliotti, whom the House committee plans to use as an expert  
analyst, is not asserting that any injuries or deaths were caused 
by FBI gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the Post he reached his conclusion after spending  
hundreds of hours reviewing various tapes of the siege, including a 
newly released FBI audio recording that was part of a videotape 
turned over to Congress recently in response to a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., who discussed  
Ghigliotti's opinion with him informally, said today, ``What we 
have heard from this expert is troubling but we think it is 
premature to make any final determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to go off half-cocked,'' Burton said in a  
statement. ``As soon as we get all the necessary information, we 
will hold hearings and present the information to the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., has been appointed by  
Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate FBI actions at Waco.

<HEADLINE> Houston Gets NFL Expansion Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Houston rejoined the NFL today, paying a record  
$700 million for an expansion franchise and beating out Los 
Angeles, the nation's second-largest TV market. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote, announced by commissioner Paul Tagliabue, was 29-0  
with Arizona and St. Louis abstaining. Twenty-four votes were 
needed for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles business leaders were unable to agree on several  
proposals for a stadium site. The city lost the Raiders to Oakland 
and the Rams to St. Louis after the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote awarding Houston businessman Bob McNair the team  
followed months of indecision in which the NFL at one point 
conditionally awarded a franchise to Los Angeles. A deadline for 
Los Angeles to come up with a suitable stadium proposal came and 
went, eventually putting Houston back into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think after a while we all got tired of it, thought it was  
time to make a decision,'' McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $700 million fee is the highest for a sports team in the  
United States. With a $310 million stadium included, the Houston 
deal would be worth more than $1 billion -- a first for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day for Houston, we hope a great day for  
football,'' McNair said. ``Our facility will be second to none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote returns an NFL team to Houston, which lost the Oilers  
to Tennessee after the 1996 season and is the nation's No. 11 
television market. 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the Houston team is not set, but Tagliabue said it  
would not be ``Oilers.'' When Cleveland lost its franchise to 
Baltimore after the 1995 season, the NFL brought back a team to 
Cleveland, along with its traditional nickname, colors and records. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners also voted to adjust the league alignment to eight  
divisions of four teams each. Right now, there are six divisions -- 
one with six teams and the rest with five. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston will be placed in the AFC, where the old Oilers played.  
That would mean one AFC team would have to switch to the NFC. 
Arizona and St. Louis abstained because of questions over the 
proposed alignment. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair said a retractable-roof stadium will be completed in time  
for Houston to play its first season in 2002. Public funds of $195 
million will go into the project. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Houston will be the site of a Super Bowl  
``as soon as practical after completion of the stadium,'' Tagliabue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made an outstanding business proposal, and these are  
good business people who know a good proposal,'' McNair said. 
``From what I know about the other proposals, I don't think they 
compare to ours. I think the main issue is that Houston's ready to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league's expansion committee met with McNair on Tuesday  
evening and also heard Michael Ovitz make another pitch for giving 
Los Angeles the 32nd team. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair's $700 million franchise bid is some $50 million higher  
than the new franchise was expected to be worth. Ovitz, who most 
recently proposed building a stadium at Hollywood Park in 
Inglewood, Calif., and another group seeking a team for the Los 
Angeles Coliseum apparently did not make an offer anywhere close to 
the one by Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz and his backers hold an option on a parcel of land at  
Hollywood Park. But he obtained the option just last week, so any 
plan for that site would have to be in the very early stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Roski, one of the Coliseum backers, also was in Atlanta. He  
would not disclose the amount of the offer made by his group, which 
includes billionaire Eli Broad. Roski said he thought any plan to 
build a stadium at Hollywood Park faced a number of challenges, 
including a lack of freeway access, that the Coliseum proposal did 
not face. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said in Los  
Angeles that the Coliseum group never received a clear idea of what 
the NFL wanted in LA. 
</P>
<P>
	The league owners voted 29-2 last March to give Los Angeles a  
team provided the NFL received a suitable stadium and financing 
proposal by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The league soon narrowed in on the Coliseum, eliminating a bid  
by Ovitz, who proposed building a stadium in suburban Carson. But 
the negotiations with the Coliseum stalled last summer after the 
NFL requested -- and did not receive -- the promise of $150 million 
in public funds to go toward the Coliseum project.

<HEADLINE> Back Injury Knocks Out Martinez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A back injury did what the Cleveland Indians  
couldn't -- knock Pedro Martinez out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The shoo-in for the AL Cy Young award suffered a muscle strain  
in the middle of his back and left after just four innings 
Wednesday night, the second shortest start of his brilliant season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Red Sox were leading 2-0 at the time in the opener of  
the best-of-5 division series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox said he injured himself on a pitch and is  
day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez allowed three hits and one walk and striking out three.  
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, Martinez had one stint on the  
disabled list, from July 19 to Aug. 3, with a sore right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	But he came back even stronger than before.  
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was 23-4 and led the AL with 313 strikeouts and the  
majors with a 2.07 ERA. In his last 10 regular-season starts, he 
was 7-1 with a 1.25 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox were counting on their ace to pitch them to an  
opening-game win. In the next three games, their probable starters 
are Bret Saberhagen, Ramon Martinez and Kent Mercker, who all had 
physical problems this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Pedro Martinez left, he was replaced by Derek Lowe, who  
has been nearly unhittable by the Indians. They were 1-for-30 
against him this year with the only hit coming April 24 by Roberto 
Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lowe gave up a two-run homer to Jim Thome in the sixth that  
tied the score 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez wasn't as sharp as usual, allowing runners in three of  
his four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired the first two batters in the first. Then Alomar  
singled and stole second before Manny Ramirez, struck out, making 
him 2-for-21 with 11 strikeouts in his career against Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Thome grounded out to start the second, then Harold Baines  
singled. But Baines was forced at second on David Justice's 
grounder and Travis Fryman flied out to center. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez struck out Sandy Alomar starting the third then walked  
Kenny Lofton. In 213 1-3 innings this year, Martinez walked just 37 
batters. Omar Vizquel flied out, then Roberto Alomar singled Lofton 
to third. But Ramirez grounded into a force out. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth, Thome struck out and Baines popped out to second  
baseman Jose Offerman. Martinez's last batter was Justice, who 
grounded out to first baseman Mike Stanley. Martinez rushed to 
first to cover on the play.

<HEADLINE> Houston Beats L.A. for NFL Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFL picked Houston over Los Angeles for its  
next expansion team Wednesday, preferring a smaller market's record 
$1 billion proposal to a shaky one from its bigger, more glamorous 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer, the richest ever for a franchise, came from Houston  
businessman Bob McNair and includes the $700 million franchise 
price, plus a $310 million retractable roof stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston will begin play in 2002 in the AFC, where the old Oilers  
played before moving to Tennessee after the 1996 season. No name 
has been chosen for the new team, but it won't be Oilers, because 
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue has declared that name ``retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners also voted to adjust the league alignment to eight  
divisions of four teams each. Now there are six divisions -- one 
with six teams and the rest with five. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote to award Houston the NFL's 32nd franchise was 29-0.  
Arizona and St. Louis abstained because of questions over the 
proposed alignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to come up with a suitable stadium doomed Los Angeles,  
the nation's second-largest TV market. Houston, the nation's No. 11 
market, was more willing to pay for a stadium, providing $195 
million in public funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a passion for football, we have a dynamic market, and  
we have a large market in Houston,'' McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the Washington Redskins sold for $800 million  
earlier this year, but that price included the stadium, so the 
franchise price works out around to $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Houston will be the site of a Super Bowl  
``as soon as practical after completion of the stadium,'' Tagliabue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the negotiations and the agreement struck were  
typical of big business dealings: Houston's franchise bid was $150 
million higher than that offered by either the LA Coliseum group or 
another headed by Michael Ovitz, who proposed building a stadium at 
Hollywood Park. Ovitz and his money man, grocery billionaire Ron 
Burkle, offered $550 million, and the Coliseum group bid $500 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money talks. It sure talked this time,'' said Eli Broad,  
another of the failed bidders from Los Angeles whose group had 
submitted a $500 million proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice of Houston followed months of indecision in which the  
NFL at one point conditionally awarded a franchise to Los Angeles. 
A six-month deadline for Los Angeles passed on Sept. 15, putting 
Houston back into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think after a while we all got tired of it, thought it was  
time to make a decision,'' McNair said. ``We knew we had to 
differentiate ourselves, had to do something that would break the 
period of indecision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His $700 million bid did just that.  
</P>
<P>
	Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones believes losing the expansion  
franchise derby actually will work in Los Angeles' favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``A team needs to move to Los Angeles,'' Jones said. ``We will  
have football in Los Angeles, and soon. What we did today will 
expedite that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said it would be great if Raiders owner Al Davis, who  
initially moved the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles after the 
1994 season, then took them back to Northern California again, did 
still another U-turn back to LA. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who is suing Oakland to get out of his lease and claims  
he still holds the NFL rights on Los Angeles, would not comment on 
that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Roski, who headed the failed effort to bring the expansion  
team to the LA Coliseum, now is expected to focus on the 
possibility of luring an existing team to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	John Semcken, a spokesman for Roski's group, said, ``Houston  
just blew us away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Football fans in Houston were ecstatic upon learning of the NFL  
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on cloud nine,'' said Larry Dluhy, owner of Sports  
Collectibles of Houston. ``I've lived here all my life and the last 
two years with the Oilers gone there's been a huge vacancy. It's 
like an empty closet and now we've filled it back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the SRO Sports Bar &AMP; Cafe near downtown Houston, the lunch  
crowd had not yet arrived but manager Kathryn Scharringhousen was 
already celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone just loves a Houston home team,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, 41-year-old Henry Parker expressed the kind of  
indifference to pro football in Southern California that frequently 
was cited by critics of the city's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I've seen teams come and I've seen them go,'' Parker said.  
``If we got a team just to say we have a team, that isn't enough, 
it's not worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only will the 31 present NFL owners split Houston's $700  
million franchise fee, they also raised the bar on their teams' 
values. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones paid $180 million for the Cowboys in 1989, at the time  
considered an astronomical price for a team. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Rupert Murdoch failed in his attempt to buy  
the Manchester United soccer team for $1 billion in what would have 
been the most expensive price for any team in the world.

<HEADLINE> Radio Show Plans Insight on Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- The two men could be best friends  
sitting in a college cafe, chatting about the merits of a book and 
laughing as they talk of life, love and writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Except that these are not typical guys and their talk is  
anything but the usual banter. 
</P>
<P>
	Novelist Salman Rushdie and host Michael Silverblatt sit across  
from one another at a small table in KCRW-FM's basement offices at 
Santa Monica College. They wait for their cue as the show's theme 
song plays, ``You are a human animal. You are a very special breed, 
for you are the only animal who can think, who can reason, who can 
read!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverblatt nods to his guest and begins ``Bookworm,'' the  
nation's only syndicated literary radio show, broadcast to nearly 
half a million listeners at more than 40 radio stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-hour show features interviews with a roster of authors,  
from literary icon Norman Mailer to Pulitzer-prize winning author 
Toni Morrison to acclaimed contemporary fiction writer Lorrie 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 10 years, ``Bookworm'' has weathered the  
uncertainties that come with the financial instability of public 
radio. And it has thrived in Los Angeles, a town that has long 
battled a lowly reputation for its arts and culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, the first time we presented the show to  
a station in New York, they were like, `A literary show from Los 
Angeles? Are you kidding?''' said Silverblatt, 46, a graduate of 
State University of New York in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	The secret to the show's endurance is providing literary insight  
that few other radio shows can offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most of us who do the book tour circuit look forward  
to coming on Michael's show because he asks thought-provoking 
questions,'' Rushdie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverblatt prepares for each show by reading not only the book  
he plans to discuss, but the author's entire works. The daunting 
research sometimes calls for reading more than a dozen books in a 
week, but allows Silverblatt to lead an incisive discussion rare in 
a media world dominated by sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
	``There really isn't anyone like Michael. He's just completely  
immersed in literature and so knowledgeable that he really doesn't 
have any competition,'' said Pamela Henstell, West Coast promotion 
director for Alfred A. Knopf publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got a very casual interview style,'' said Trey  
Giles, publicity director of the Los Angeles bookstore Book Soup. 
``I think people become relaxed around Michael. They go to areas 
where they might otherwise not go.''

	Ruth Seymour, KCRW-FM's general manager, discovered Silverblatt,  
a former film industry publicist and freelance writer, at a dinner 
in Los Angeles for entertainment industry figures. She recalls 
being so captivated by Silverblatt's talk about Russian poetry that 
she offered him his own radio show on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's his intelligence, coupled with his humor,''  
Seymour said. ``He is a literary person, but he's not an academic 
person, so that makes him accessible and he's genuinely charming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To his interview with Rushdie, Silverblatt brings only a soft  
drink and a copy of Rushdie's latest novel, ``The Ground Beneath 
Her Feet.'' Silverblatt doesn't believe in using notes during his 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the best interviews are conversations,''  
Silverblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hour-long talk, the two men discuss the difficulties  
of writing about love in a novel in which one of the main 
characters has trouble believing in love. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverblatt confessed after the Rushdie interview that he read  
the 500-page book twice. The first was three months ago, then again 
just before the interview, finishing as he arrived at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to come into an interview vibrating from the book,''  
Silverblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
	His research is so meticulous that he is able to make  
on-the-spot, well-articulated observations that authors say often 
hit their mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It becomes a real conversation with someone who loves books  
and who knows how to read them,'' Rushdie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverblatt caught the reading fever as a boy growing up in  
Brooklyn, N.Y., rushing to the library after school one day to ask 
for a book on Greek ``mints,'' his curiosity piqued after a class 
on Greek mythology. A librarian quickly figured out Silverblatt 
wanted to read up on Greek mythology, and he was soon reading every 
chance he could. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to get calls from neighbors saying, `Michael's not  
watching the street when he crosses because he's always reading a 
book,''' recalled his mother, Lorraine Silverblatt. 
</P>
<P>
	Books remain the nucleus of Silverblatt's world.  
</P>
<P>
	An anomaly in a town known for its car culture, he doesn't  
drive, instead preferring public transportation, which allows him 
more time to read. Most of the rooms in his Los Angeles apartment 
are decorated wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling with books. 
</P>
<P>
	``Books are important because they're the place where we find  
out who we are at the heart's core,'' Silverblatt said. ``They grip 
you because they make your life important.''

<HEADLINE> Administration Backs Annan on Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration endorsed the gist  
of a proposal by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the United 
Nations to take control of all government functions in East Timor 
and rebuild the battered province. But a U.S. spokesman said 
Wednesday the cost and some other issues had to be studied. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, an Australian-led force of about 8,000  
troops would be replaced by 8,950 U.N. peacekeepers who would guide 
the territory to statehood over two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
	This could add hundreds of millions dollars to the U.S. share of  
the cost of the peacekeeping operation. Currently, the nations that 
participate are footing the bill; and with only a token U.S. force 
in the area, the cost to the United States is small. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin welcomed Annan's  
proposal for a transitional administration in East Timor, the 
former Portuguese colony that voted for independence by a nearly 
4-1 margin. The Indonesian military and militia then devastated 
much of the province and left many dead and others uprooted from 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said, however, ``We'll have to obviously look carefully at  
the proposal and consult with the U.N. with respect to the size of 
the mission and the cost of the mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States owes the United Nations $1.025 billion by  
Clinton administration calculations, $1.7 billion according to the 
U.N. undersecretary for management, Joseph E. Connor. Congress has 
passed legislation to pay $200 million; and while the United 
Nations assesses the United States 31 percent of the cost of 
peacekeeping operations, Congress has refused to pay more than 25 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do support a U.N. mission in East Timor and we support  
Secretary-General Annan's efforts to bring peace and stability to 
that region,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In particular, we respect the views the secretariat and his  
representatives have and the knowledge they have about the 
on-the-ground situation in East Timor and the necessary military, 
civilian and humanitarian resources that have to be put in place,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The question, Rubin said, is the size and the cost of a U.N.  
peacekeeping force taking over responsibility for East Timor. 
``Those are issues that we think need to be carefully examined,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the American spokesman expressed grave concern  
about reports the Indonesian government is registering refugees in 
West Timor who fled the violence and want to return home. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Indonesian militia keep watch over the registration  
and the refugees do not have access to good information about the 
situation in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said the Indonesian government should allow the  
U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees to participate fully in 
registration and return of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 people are due to be flown to Dili, the East Timorese  
capital, later in the week, with up to 230,000 others remaining in 
camps and dispersed among communities in West Timor, Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> BellSouth Seen Facing Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- BellSouth Corp. has watched for years as other  
telecommunications companies joined forces in major mergers. But 
its entry into the Sprint bidding war for Sprint Corp. might mean 
the only Baby Bell yet to merge is off the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth lost its $100 billion bid for Sprint to MCI WorldCom,  
but industry analysts said Tuesday that the $23-billion 
telecommunications company needs to make some sort of deal soon to 
compete effectively in an industry being overtaken by gargantuan 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth ``would be in a stronger position probably if it was  
able to acquire Sprint.'' The failure to do so ``puts them at a 
long-term disadvantage,'' said David Burks of J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. 
Lyons. ``They can overcome that perhaps by being involved in a deal 
of their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burks said the move to merge with Sprint indicates a different  
direction for Atlanta-based BellSouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sends a signal that it's not business as usual,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth officials would not speculate on other potential  
merger targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Jeff Battcher said the battle for Sprint should be  
viewed as an ``opportunity to acquire a unique set of assets and 
not a signal for anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While BellSouth's competitors have been jumping on the merger  
bandwagon in recent years, it has remained the last of the 
independent regional Bells. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has not totally forsaken industry team-ups. Earlier  
this year, BellSouth paid $3.5 billion for a 10 percent stake in 
Qwest Communications. In 1993, BellSouth teamed with QVC to bid for 
movie studio Paramount but lost out to Viacom. Earlier, the company 
lost a bid against Craig McCaw for Linn Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been one of the most active companies as far as  
mergers and joint ventures go,'' Battcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	But BellSouth has stayed away from the sort of mega-mergers  
other Bells have made. Bell Atlantic bought NYNEX, then later made 
a deal for GTE. Pacific Bell and Ameritech were bought by SBC 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's ongoing consolidation probably will give  
BellSouth -- once the largest local telephone company, now the 
second smallest of the regional Bells -- new urgency when it comes 
to pursuing new options, Burks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible acquisition targets could include Cincinnati Bell or  
Qwest, which is in the process of acquiring U S West, the smallest 
of the four remaining Baby Bells. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are both logical candidates,'' Burks said.  
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth is currently limited to a 10 percent ownership of a  
long-distance company. It and the other regional Bell companies 
have been seeking regulatory approval to offer long-distance 
service to their local customers and are hopeful they will soon 
gain that permission. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts said the Sprint merger was too pricey for  
BellSouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``BellSouth is in a very good position for an investor and  
shareholder and still represents an excellent investment,'' said 
Douglas Christopher with Crowell, Weedon &AMP; Co. ``It was a tradeoff 
between wanting to own the asset. They probably wanted to, but I 
don't think you need to own it at 35 to 40 times earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth provides telecommunications, wireless communications,  
cable and digital TV, and Internet and data services to about 34 
million customers in 19 countries. Its primary service area is in 
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North 
Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> Court Reinstates Celtics' Walker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A negligence lawsuit against Boston Celtics  
forward Antoine Walker was reinstated by a federal appeals court 
that said he might be liable for an alleged rape at his home if he 
could have stopped it without danger to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st  
Circuit said that state law isn't clear about a host's legal duty 
to protect guests in his home. 
</P>
<P>
	In general, state law does not require bystanders to come to the  
aid of those in distress. However, a host is required to take 
reasonable care of the guests in his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said that if Walker knew his friends were dangerous,  
he should have warned the woman, who was identified only as ``Jane 
Doe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case was sent back to the district court, where the judge  
will determine if Walker knew the woman was being raped and could 
have stopped the attack without risking his own safety, yet chose 
to do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is far from clear whether Walker authorized, acquiesced, or  
even knew of Doe's presence at the house prior to the alleged 
assault; nor is it clear that he knew that an assault was 
occurring,'' Circuit Judge Michael Boudin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's lawyer, Nicholas Theodorou, said his client will be  
cleared when the facts are aired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although he is disappointed in the court's ruling, Antoine  
Walker is prepared to defend the case vigorously,'' Theodorou told 
the Boston Herald. ``... We're confident as (the evidence) is 
developed, we will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No criminal charges were filed in the case. But the woman filed  
a civil suit last year, claiming she was socializing at a nightclub 
with Walker, former Celtics Ronald Mercer and Chauncey Billups, and 
Walker's housemate Michael Irvin on the night of Nov. 9, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman said Irvin told her Walker wanted her to come to his  
condominium in Waltham, Mass. While there, the lawsuit alleged, she 
was sexually assaulted in the bedroom by Mercer, Irvin and Billups. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claimed Walker entered the bedroom during the  
assault. He allegedly declined Irvin's invitation to have sex with 
the woman, but didn't intervene to protect her. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman sued Walker for negligence and the other three men  
under the Violence Against Women Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she'll be gratified that she will have an opportunity  
to have her day in court with respect to Mr. Walker,'' Margaret 
Burnham, the woman's lawyer, told The Boston Globe.

<HEADLINE> Buss Says Pippen Contract Too Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Phil Jackson wanted the Los Angeles  
Lakers to acquire Scottie Pippen, but team owner Jerry Buss said 
Pippen's $67 million contract would have hamstrung the team for too 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was traded by Houston to Portland last week for six  
reserves. He has four years remaining on a five-year deal he signed 
with Chicago before he was traded to the Rockets last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phil definitely felt that Scottie would be a big improvement  
for us in the next year or two,'' Buss told a gathering of 
reporters Wednesday at training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he is aware that if you take somebody like Scottie with a  
long-term contract under the current rules, it would have been 
impossible to ever improve this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buss said the four years remaining on Pippen's contract  
precluded pursuing him. He denied reports that the Lakers offered 
Houston a deal, only to be rejected by the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie is just a great player and certainly for a year or two  
it would've been the right thing to do,'' he said. ``We would've 
probably done it had he not had a four-year contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buss also knew acquiring Pippen would've drained the Lakers'  
budget for free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you take him, you're basically saying this is our  
personnel for the next four years,'' he said. ``Right now we have a 
lot more leeway than that and I think we should maintain that 
leeway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Pippen, Buss believes the combination of Jackson  
and the current roster gives the Lakers an excellent chance to win 
their first NBA championship since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best team we've had in the last 4-5 years,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buss lured Jackson out of retirement in June with a five-year,  
$30 million deal that makes him one of the NBA's highest-paid 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner never spent that kind of money on a coach before, but  
he believes coaches need long-term, rich contracts to deal with 
today's big-money NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult for somebody making one-tenth of what the  
player he's talking to does and get that kind of respect,'' Buss 
said. ``It's probably true that the money associated with it does 
command a certain amount of respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under former coach Del Harris and his replacement Kurt Rambis,  
there was speculation the players didn't respect or listen to 
either man. 
</P>
<P>
	Buss believes Jackson is the answer.  
</P>
<P>
	``He commands a lot of respect. I like his confidence,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buss could be looking at dipping into his wallet again to keep  
swingman Glen Rice around. The Lakers exercised a $7 million option 
on Rice for this season, but he wants a long-term deal starting at 
the league maximum of $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant holding big-money  
contracts, giving Rice the kind of deal he wants could strain the 
team's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to pay three superstars because once you do that,  
you're really freezing any improvements you could make past that 
point and there are nine other soldiers on that team,'' Buss said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Lakers executive vice president Jerry West wants to  
watch Rice this season and see how he fits into Jackson's triangle 
offense. Rice practiced only lightly Wednesday because of 
tendinitis in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he deserves that money, we would have to pay him,'' Buss  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any lingering talk of bringing back Dennis Rodman after his  
ill-fated stint with the Lakers last season appears unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody's really seriously considered bringing  
back Dennis,'' said Buss, who especially wanted Rodman in the first 
place last season.

<HEADLINE> Study: Obesity Can Shorten Lifespan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In the largest study ever done on obesity and mortality,  
researchers reported today that people run the risk of dying 
earlier simply because they are overweight. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk was there even among people who didn't smoke and were  
otherwise healthy during their middle years, according to the study 
of more than 1 million Americans. It was conducted by the American 
Cancer Society and published in today's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	It settles once and for all any lingering questions about  
whether weight alone increases the risk of death and disease, said 
Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Harvard University endocrinologist and 
preventive-health specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence is now compelling and irrefutable,'' Manson said.  
``Obesity is probably the second-leading preventable cause of death 
in the United States after cigarette smoking, so it is a very 
serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study found an especially clear association between excess  
weight and a higher risk of dying from heart disease or cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike a similar study last year that suggested being  
overweight is less of a problem as people grow older, this study 
found many more deaths among overweight people of all ages, 
especially those over 75. 
</P>
<P>
	More adults and children are overweight than ever before, with  
55 percent of American adults weighing more than they should. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is we're too fat and it's killing us. We need to  
come up with ways as a society to eat less and exercise more,'' 
said American Cancer Society epidemiologist Eugenia Calle, lead 
author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson said: ``It's going to take a coordinated campaign to turn  
this around, at the community level, at the environmental level, 
with changes in the food industry and marketing industry, having 
more bike paths and sidewalks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black women were found to be the only exceptions to the rule.  
The study found the most obese black women did not have a 
significantly higher risk of premature death than slender black 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	That poses a fascinating scientific riddle, said June Stevens, a  
University of North Carolina professor of nutrition. ``Although I 
had seen this in several other studies, I wasn't ready to believe 
it was true,'' she said. ``Now I'm thinking maybe this is true, and 
we need to figure out why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Stevens and Manson said the study probably understates  
the risks of obesity for black women. 
</P>
<P>
	They pointed out that slender, non-smoking black women have a  
higher risk of death to begin with than their white counterparts, 
probably because they have less access to health care than white 
women and more undetected disease. That makes it appear that weight 
alone doesn't play a big role in death rates among black women. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be really unfortunate if we became more complacent  
about obesity in blacks than in whites,'' Manson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied participants in the national Cancer  
Prevention Study II from 1982 through 1996. The average age at 
enrollment was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers calculated each subject's body mass index, or  
BMI, a ratio of weight to height, and tracked them for age and 
cause of death. The results were adjusted for age, education, 
physical activity, alcohol use, marital status, use of aspirin as a 
blood-thinner, consumption of fats and vegetables, and use of 
estrogen supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	Among healthy, non-smoking white men and women and black men,  
the researchers found a gradually increasing risk of death 
beginning with a BMI of 25, which is 150 pounds for a 5-foot-5 
woman and 174 pounds for a 5-foot-10 man. 
</P>
<P>
	The fattest white men, with a BMI of 40 or more -- 278 pounds on  
a 5-foot-10 frame -- were 2.58 times more likely to die than their 
healthiest peers, men of the same height weighing 153 to 170 
pounds. White women with a BMI of 40 or greater -- 240 pounds for a 
5-foot-5 woman -- were twice as likely to die as their counterparts 
who weighed 132 to 148 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Thin men and women also had higher death rates, but it was not  
clear whether their low weight was a cause or an effect of disease.

<HEADLINE> Miracles Happen for Hawaii Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- June Jones, who left the NFL to tackle a huge  
rebuilding project in Hawaii, is already regarded as a miracle 
worker after just five games with the Rainbow Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawaii football team was riding an 18-game losing streak,  
the longest in the nation, when Jones arrived after spurning the 
San Diego Chargers to take over as coach of his alma mater. The 
Rainbow Warriors went 0-12 last season and 5-31 in three seasons 
under Fred vonAppen. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with many of the same players from those losing teams,  
Hawaii is 4-1, in first place in the Western Athletic Conference at 
2-0 and once again talking about bowl games and conference titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to lose continually was a horrible feeling,'' said senior  
linebacker Jeff Ulbrich, the team's leading tackler. ``The fact 
that we're winning is amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a span of five games, Jones ended Hawaii's 19-game losing  
streak, stopped its seven-year string of WAC road losses, put fans 
back in the stands and revived merchandise sales for a money-losing 
athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Jones is amazed by the fast start.  
</P>
<P>
	``I never guessed that we'd be sitting here 4-1,'' Jones said.  
``I didn't have any preset notions. As bad, or as down, as this 
program was, we were just trying to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice coach Ken Hatfield, whose team plays at Hawaii on Saturday,  
said Jones has instilled confidence in his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he turned down the San Diego Chargers to come home ...  
they know he gave up a lot,'' Hatfield said. ``I think that allowed 
all the players to buy into the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Jones wants his team to keep its fast start in  
perspective, some Hawaii fans are calling him ``Jesus Jones'' for 
reviving a program that was so bad there was talk of dropping to 
Division I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a dream watching the team being resurrected from the  
dead. We truly believe you're a miracle worker,'' one fan wrote 
Jones. ``After you win the WAC, can you take a look at fixing the 
state economy and the cost of living?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones replied he was just worried about Rice, but appreciates  
the heartfelt support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good that the people here in Hawaii feel good about  
themselves again,'' he said. ``Wherever I go, everybody's spirits 
are better, and that makes me feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a 62-7 season-opening loss to Southern California,  
Hawaii has rebounded with victories over I-AA Eastern Illinois, 
Boise State, Southern Methodist and Texas-El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
	While that isn't the upper echelon of college football, Jones  
feels no need to apologize for the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``They lost to these same teams last season,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Using a four-receiver offensive set that spreads the field and  
emphasizes the pass and an aggressive defense led by former Seattle 
Seahawks coordinator Greg McMackin, Jones has made the Rainbow 
Warriors one of the biggest surprises in college football. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys we have on this team always have had a great heart  
and desire to win,'' quarterback Dan Robinson said. ``We just 
weren't able to put it all together before. Now coach Jones has put 
those things together. He taught us how to believe in ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Plagued With Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- It was a tale of two defensive tackles for  
the battered Arizona Cardinals on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Eric Swann was getting closer to returning from his two  
knee surgeries, Mark Smith was headed to Colorado to be examined by 
the doctor who performed the most serious of Swann's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other injuries, wide receiver Rob Moore is listed as  
doubtful for Sunday's game against the New York Giants because of a 
pulled hamstring, and offensive tackle James Dexter is out with 
torn triceps. Cornerback Corey Chavous has an ailing knee and wide 
receiver David Boston a sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann, a two-time Pro Bowl performer who hasn't played since the  
seventh game last season, has practiced more each week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll put the pads on tomorrow and Friday and he'll practice  
with pads on,'' coach Vince Tobin said. ``We still haven't gotten 
him officially cleared to play. Until that happens, he's not going 
to play. I think he's a lot closer. Whether he can play this week 
or not, I don't know at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said he can tell Swann likes the way things are going.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's got life in his step,'' Tobin said. ``I think he feels  
good about where he is at this point in time. When you play a 
ballgame, it's certainly different than practice without pads on, 
but I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a contract holdout who finally reported to the team Sept.  
25, has fluid on his right knee. He is going to Colorado this week 
for a second opinion on how to treat the injury from Dr. Richard 
Steadman, the noted knee specialist who performed the unusual 
reconstructive surgery on Swann. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith downplayed the seriousness of the injury.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to get a second opinion,'' he said. ``I might  
have to get a little work done. They say he's one of the best, so 
I'd like to go see him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he's uncertain whether he will play Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Moore, who sat out last weekend's 35-7 loss to Dallas, has not  
practiced this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll probably run today and tomorrow just to see how it  
feels,'' Tobin said. ``The last time we brought him back he lasted 
about a quarter. We'd like for him to come back and be healthy, but 
by the same token we need him as quickly as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said it's up to Moore to let the coaches know how he  
feels. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it feels healthy, then we'd like him to play,'' Tobin said.  
``If we don't feel like he's 100 percent healthy, then we'll 
probably hold him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavous, beaten by Dallas' Rocket Ismail on a long touchdown  
pass last week, indicated he's still hurting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have to work through it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Chavous has been splitting time with backup Tommy Knight in  
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll look at them in practice and we'll make a decision which  
way we will go later in the week,'' Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston insisted his sore shoulder is fine, but Tobin said it's  
bothering the rookie as he runs his routes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin finally found a punt returner he likes in Mac Cody, but  
now Cody is hurting, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got hit in the thigh,'' Tobin said. ``I don't know if it  
was on the punt return or the kickoff return. He tried to practice 
today and it tightened up on him, so they put some ice on it and 
held him out. If he's 100 percent healthy, he'll be back returning 
punts. I thought he did a great job. He caught the ball well and 
got it upfield and made people miss.''

<HEADLINE> Mass Transit To Get First Y2K Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transportation officials are uneasy about the  
readiness of mass transit systems for the year 2000, because huge 
New Year's Eve celebrations will send thousands of revelers toward 
public transportation just minutes after computers make the date 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	If a Y2K bug paralyzes subway nervous systems or the electrical  
supply that runs trains in cities such as Boston, New York and 
Washington, operators will have virtually no time to make repairs 
or warn incoming riders. 
</P>
<P>
	French officials will stop all trains and subway cars in France  
between 11:55 p.m. and 12:15 a.m. to ``respond to the anxiety'' of 
passengers, said a statement issued Monday by SNCF, the national 
train company. 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. operators, such as the Chicago Transit Authority, will  
conduct similar pauses. Federal officials think it's a prudent 
step. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than take any risk, they feel five minutes out of their  
schedule, with each train stopping in the station, would be a 
useful precaution,'' Mortimer Downey, deputy transportation 
secretary, said last week at a congressional hearing about the 
readiness of transportation systems for millennium change. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Year 2000 problem poses a special problem for mass  
transit because it will strike at the intersection of two 
unavoidable realities: the test of Y2K computer fixes at precisely 
the moment some transportation systems will be taxed by 
larger-than-usual crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	Some older computers were programmed to recognize dates in  
two-digit format, so the question emerges what will happen when 
1999 -- recognized by those computers as simply ``99'' -- changes to 
2000. Computers may malfunction and think the clock has been set 
back to 1900 instead of forward to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	At that moment, New Year's Eve parties will be reaching their  
climax. Crowds urged to use public transportation as a way to avoid 
traffic will head for the nearest bus, subway station or railroad 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington officials expect up to 800,000 riders that night on  
their Metro subway system, many of them attracted to the Lincoln 
Memorial for a millennium party hosted by entertainer Will Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston is expecting 2 million for its First Night celebration,  
an increase of 500,000 people from a normal year, while Times 
Square in New York is expected to be a mecca for millennium buffs. 
</P>
<P>
	A Federal Transit Administration survey found that of 550  
federally funded operators -- including bus, subway and commuter 
rail providers -- all but four said they are either Y2K compliant or 
have contingency plans. The remaining four, all in Puerto Rico, 
either did not respond or responded incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
	Major subway operators insist they and their equipment suppliers  
have done all the tests they can do. Privately, some say they're 
not sure about the reliability of their electricity suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have a number of technical people available. However,  
we've been assured by our contractors and subcontractors that they 
have met all the challenges to ensure a smooth transition,'' said 
Tom Kelly, spokesman for New York's Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came through the 9-9-99 with no problem, and people said  
that might be an issue,'' said Cheryl Johnson, a Washington Metro 
spokeswoman. Analysts had feared that Sept. 9, with its lineup of 
9's, would seize computer brains. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak and commuter railroads also insist their trains are  
ready, but many have their own Achilles heel: they operate on 
tracks owned by freight railroads. The four largest freight lines 
in the country -- Burlington Northern Santa Fe, CSX, Norfolk 
Southern and Union Pacific -- won't report their Y2K readiness until 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Rail experts say the public should not worry, since older subway  
cars and many locomotives are not computerized. Equipment such as 
grade crossing signals is tripped not by time and date information 
but by mechanical switches thrown by an approaching train. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet last month, Washingtonians got a hint of their subway's  
vulnerability. For the first time in 20 years, a computer that 
monitors every train in the Metro system froze just before the 
start of the morning rush hour. It caused delays of up to 50 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro officials said the problem was not Y2K-related.

<HEADLINE> IOC Labs Back Tests for Nandrolone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- The world's leading drug control  
laboratories have affirmed the validity of tests for nandrolone, 
the banned steroid which has produced a recent spate of positive 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of the 27 labs accredited by the International Olympic  
Committee, meeting in Monaco, said they were satisfied with the 
effectiveness of testing for nandrolone and its precursors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement, the labs noted that nandrolone and its  
related compounds, norandrostenedione and norandrostenediol, are 
included on the IOC's list of banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC reiterated that athletes should refrain from taking  
medications or supplements without proper medical supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab officials urged government authorities to ban the sale,  
manufacture and importation of unlicensed nutritional supplements 
containing banned substances. Some of the supplements are not 
labeled. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have been puzzled by the sudden surge in positive  
tests for nandrolone, which has been available for decades and is 
easily detectable in standard urine controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Many officials believe the increase is the result of athletes'  
taking supplements which, they may or may not know, contain 
nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an excuse for the athletes,'' IOC medical director  
Patrick Schamasch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schamasch said the IOC has twice written to the U.S. Food and  
Drug Administration complaining about ineffective labeling 
standards for dietary supplements. Some of the products, available 
over the counter and advertised over the Internet, contain banned 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been positive nandrolone findings in numerous sports  
this year, including high-profile cases in track and field 
involving sprinters Linford Christie of Britain and Merlene Ottey 
of Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie, the 1992 Olympic 100-meter champion, has been cleared  
by the British national federation, while Ottey's case still is to 
be reviewed by Jamaican officials.

<HEADLINE> Nevadans Take on Federal Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Hundreds of citizens with pickaxes and shovels  
are expected to spend part of the weekend trying to reopen a road 
that has been kept closed to protect a threatened fish. 
</P>
<P>
	State Assemblyman John Carpenter plans to lead up to 1,000  
people to the Jarbidge River near the Idaho state line to rebuild 
the dirt road, which is in a national forest. The protesters claim 
the road has belonged to Elko County for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid the potential for an explosive confrontation is  
high,'' said Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute involves a 1.5-mile section of road that leads to a  
campground and outhouse in the Humboldt Toiyabe-National Forest. A 
flood washed the road out in 1995 and the Forest Service decided 
not to rebuild it because eroding soil could foul the river and 
threaten the bull trout, which is now protected under the 
Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials won't say how they intend to  
respond if the volunteers begin reconstructing the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they stop people, they'll never hear the end of it,''  
Carpenter said. ``This is an absolute peaceful work party. We don't 
advocate violence and never will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general asked Elko County officials to help  
stop the rebellion in Jarbidge, a historic mining town in a canyon 
so remote most Nevadans can't get there without driving north into 
the Idaho wilderness and then back south into Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Neil Harris said only that he will help keep the peace.  
</P>
<P>
	``To send a small contingent of federal law enforcement up there  
to issue citations or make arrests could cause the thing to become 
somewhat violent,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Air Bag Technology Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More sophisticated air bags are entering the  
mass market this fall on the 2000 models of several of the nation's 
most popular family cars. Safety experts say the new technology 
will reduce deaths and injuries from inflating air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called dual-stage air bag, standard equipment on the 2000  
Ford Taurus and Honda Accord, along with some luxury cars, tailors 
the force of its inflation to the severity of a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	In serious crashes, when passengers need the devices' full power  
to cushion them, the new bags inflate with about the same force as 
those in 1999 model cars. But in lower speed crashes, the air bags 
pop open with at least 20 percent less force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today in cars we have a one-bag-fits-all mentality. This  
changes all that,'' says Stephen Kozak, a Ford engineer who oversaw 
the Taurus system's development. 
</P>
<P>
	A sensor in the front of the car detects the severity of a crash  
by calculating the change of velocity that occurs when another 
object, such as a car, crashes into it. Another sensor registers 
whether a front seat belt is buckled. If a belt is being used, the 
full force of the air bag also is delayed until a higher speed when 
it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials, automakers, insurers and safety advocacy  
groups agree the new technology will reduce air bag deaths and 
injuries -- particularly of young children and shorter adults -- in 
low-speed crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reduces the risk (of deaths and injuries) dramatically in  
better tailoring the air bag inflation to the crash,'' said Dr. 
Ricardo Martinez, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Air bags have been blamed for at least 145 deaths -- mostly  
children and shorter women -- in low-speed crashes the victims 
otherwise should have survived, causing a public outcry. But air 
bags also have saved an estimated 4,600 lives in higher-speed 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. has the dual-inflation air bags on both the  
driver and passenger side of its model year 2000 Taurus, the 
third-best-selling car nationwide. Honda Motor Co. has them on just 
the passenger side of its 2000 Accords. The Accord is the 
second-best-selling car. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Ford and Honda to put the technology on their  
top-selling family cars as standard equipment means that for the 
first time advanced air bags are reaching large numbers of American 
families. The automakers say they plan eventually to expand the 
system to other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to see this technology spread very rapidly,''  
said Brian O'Neill of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Several luxury automakers also have dual-stage air bags on some  
2000 models, such as the Mercedes-Benz S-class sedans and BMW 3-, 
5- and 7-series sedans, but all those models sell in much smaller 
numbers because of their high costs. Some Honda Acuras had a 
dual-stage bag for the 1999 model year. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota, which makes the Camry -- the nation's best-selling car  
last year -- has not announced plans for dual-stage air bags; 
neither have other major automakers in the United States: General 
Motors and DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	But GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said: ``It's no secret that we  
and everyone else are working on that. It's the wave of the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kozak predicted the new Taurus system will eliminate about half  
of today's air bag deployments for belted passengers. And the 
majority of air bags will inflate at the lower level, he said, 
because most accidents are at lower speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	That translates into fewer air bag-related injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	Honda is focusing on the passenger side because that is where  
children -- the most vulnerable population -- have suffered serious 
injuries. ``It reduces the potential for air bag-related injury 
there,'' said spokesman Mike Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford believes both front-seat passengers could benefit from  
dual-stage bags with a ``significant reduction'' in moderate to 
severe injuries, including deaths, Kozak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford put the system on the driver's side to help short adults  
who sit close to the steering wheel and are more likely than other 
adults to be injured by the air bag. A sensor detects whether the 
driver's seat track is nearly or all the way forward and signals 
the air bag to always deploy the first, softer stage in crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a worst-case scenario, when a short women is thrust on top of  
the steering wheel by pre-impact braking, testing showed the new 
Ford system would reduce the force of the deploying air bag on the 
woman's neck by about 45 percent, Kozak said.

<HEADLINE> Zimmer Plans To Return Next Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A bandage on his face and a lump on his neck,  
Don Zimmer all but confirmed Wednesday that he had decided against 
retirement and will return as the New York Yankees' bench coach 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer was smacked in the head by a foul ball during Tuesday  
night's AL playoffs opener. Players were concerned when he was on 
the dugout floor and helped to the clubhouse, but it turns out 
Zimmer came away with just a few cuts on his left jaw and ear. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the ball hit me, I didn't know whether it hit me up in  
the head, whether it hit me in the cheek bone,'' Zimmer said 
Wednesday. ``When I woke up this morning, I knew where it hit me 
the hardest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turns out, it hit his neck and rebounded toward his left ear.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little swelling,'' Zimmer said. ``I'm a little  
stiff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Zimmer talked about retiring after this  
season, his 51st in professional baseball. Zimmer, 68, was hobbled 
by a bad knee and stressed by a stint as interim manager while 
manager Joe Torre recovered from prostate cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	After Zimmer was hit, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner came  
down to the clubhouse along with his son, Hal, wanting to find out 
Zimmer's condition and talking about installing plexiglass to guard 
the dugout next season. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Zimmer, an ice pack on his face, brought up his  
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Well, maybe I'll clear this up a little bit right  
now.' I said, `Boy, I've had a tough summer.' I said, `I think I'll 
go another four or five years can then call it quits.' I was trying 
to throw George a little hint, you know, I'll maybe come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer said it was the scariest moment he's experienced with a  
foul ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of guys that sit in the dugout and they're not  
paying attention. As many times as I've been hit in the head, I do 
pay attention,'' said Zimmer, who has a metal plate in his head, 
the result of a 1953 beaning. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was in the clubhouse being attended to, Zimmer was told  
his wife, Jean, had come down from the seats and was outside in the 
hallway. He wanted to get back to the bench right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Tell her to go on up, sit in the stands and have a  
hot dog, and I'll see her after the game,' '' Zimmer related. 
``That's when they slowed up the bleeding of my ear. Where else am 
I going to go but back to the bench?'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he got there, Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter had a surprise  
for him, showing a picture to manager Joe Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard him say, `Joe, take a look at this,' '' Zimmer said.  
``I'm thinking maybe it's a pitch that far outside, they called a 
strike on him. When I look down, it's this face with the ice pack 
on it. Leave it up to Jeter, he'll do something.''

<HEADLINE> Brown &AMP; Williamson To Close a Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Brown &AMP; Williamson Corp. plans to  
close its specialty-tobacco products plant here within the next 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	One hundred people will lose their jobs at Brown &AMP; Williamson,  
which was formed by George Brown and Robert Williamson in 1894 in 
Winston-Salem. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson, the third-largest tobacco manufacturer in  
the United States after Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, 
moved its corporate headquarters and most of its operations to 
Louisville, Ky., in 1929. That was two years after it was bought by 
British American Tobacco Co. of London. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Smith, a spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson, said the plant  
closing is part of a consolidation of its speciality-tobacco 
business following the merger by its parent company with Rothmans 
International earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	All production of the combined company's speciality-tobacco  
products will be moved to Rothmans International's plant in Tucker, 
Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Winston-Salem plant is older and less efficient than the one  
in Tucker, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined division in Tucker will account for about 62  
percent of the United States' roll-your-own cigarette market and 
about 42 percent of the pipe-tobacco market, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson's 150,000-square-foot plant produces 4.5  
million pounds of speciality-tobacco products a year, including Sir 
Walter Raleigh pipe tobacco, Bugler and Kite roll-your-own smoking 
tobacco, Tube Rose dry snuff, and the firm-plug products of 
Bloodhound, Sun Cured and Red Juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothmans' Lane and Tobacco Exporters International units in  
Tucker manufacture Captain Black pipe tobacco, Roll Rich 
roll-your-own smoking tobacco and Winchester small cigars. The 
division also imports and markets Dunhill and Cartier cigarettes.

<HEADLINE> McCain Pushes 'Soft Money' Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, acknowledging Wednesday that  
he needs ``all the help we can get,'' asked his Republican 
presidential rivals to push for Senate passage of his legislation 
banning unlimited soft money donations to political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator had a special request for George W. Bush,  
the GOP front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``If even half of the members of Congress who endorsed your  
candidacy were to honor your request, (the soft money ban) would 
pass with votes to spare,'' McCain wrote to the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The response from the Bush camp was cool.  
</P>
<P>
	``Like thousands of other Americans who write to us, we're glad  
he recognizes Governor Bush's leadership and ability to lead,'' 
Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said, declining to elaborate on 
whether Bush would support McCain's bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush believes individuals should be able to make unlimited  
donations to political parties but corporations and unions should 
not, ``because shareholders and union members don't have any say in 
how that money is spent,'' Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft money ban offered by McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold,  
D-Wis., is a stripped-down version of campaign finance legislation 
killed in the Senate last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft money originally was used by political parties for  
party-building and get-out-the-vote efforts but is increasingly 
used for ``issue advertising'' designed to sway the outcome of an 
election. McCain says soft money has become a way for corporations 
and unions to get around bans on direct donations to candidates and 
for individuals to circumvent the $1,000 contribution cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Warming up for a Senate debate on the measure next week, McCain  
wrote to five GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need all the help we can get,'' McCain said. ``If they say  
they are for campaign finance reform, which they have stated 
publicly, I would hope that they would weigh in on the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not send letters to Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who  
has already said he opposes the plan, and Patrick Buchanan, who 
McCain has said ``already left the Republican Party'' by 
questioning U.S. involvement in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said chances of passage are iffy in the Senate, and that  
he did not know if he had the 60 votes that would be needed to cut 
off debate and bring the measure to a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some have alleged this is a kamikaze mission,'' McCain said in  
a speech to the Committee for Economic Development, which supports 
a soft money ban. 
</P>
<P>
	About 290 current or former business executives and university  
officials have signed on to the committee's call to ban soft money, 
said the group's president, Charles Kolb. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not saying that money in politics is a bad thing,''  
Kolb said. ``What we're saying is, the way it's raised now has a 
corrupting influence.''

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Ranked Best Big City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Money magazine says San Francisco is the  
best big city in the country to live in -- but that doesn't mean 
it's the best city for you. 
</P>
<P>
	So for its annual selection of the nation's most livable  
locations, released Wednesday, Money is offering a way for you to 
find your own Shangri-la. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of ranking the nation's largest 300 metropolitan areas,  
as it did in past years, the magazine's editors picked a winner and 
a few runners-up. Then they built into their Web site 
(www.money.com) an interactive method of entering your own 
criteria. The site measures your needs against what those 300 metro 
areas offer and gives you an in-order list of cities to love. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we didn't rank the 300 cities? We felt people would  
be better served by picking a city best suited to them,'' said 
Patti Strauss, Money's public relations director. ``The Web has 
been a part of the story for a couple of years. On the Web site, 
you can rank the criteria that are most important to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what put San Francisco -- and Rochester, Minn., in the  
small-city category -- in first place? 
</P>
<P>
	``San Francisco has wonderful things to offer,'' Strauss said.  
``We know housing is very expensive, there's the threat of 
earthquakes -- but basically you have so many things we feel far 
outweigh that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine says the city and environs rank in the top 5  
percent for air quality, offers first-rate museums, sports, and 
more restaurants per resident than any other city in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, it's the city's wide range of recreational  
opportunities -- great places to swim, sail, hike and ski are easy 
to reach -- that clinched it,'' Money said. 
</P>
<P>
	But those things aren't important to everyone. Money's  
searchable Web database lets you find your ideal in two ways -- a 
short form and a lengthy search form that asks detailed questions 
on a wide variety of items. 
</P>
<P>
	You get 15 questions on weather, including your ideal  
temperature, rainfall, snowfall and altitude above sea level. There 
are five questions on economic factors, five more on housing and 
health, two on crime and 13 on leisure activities, among other 
criteria. 
</P>
<P>
	After you file in all the blanks, the database will find the  
cities among the 300 that best meet your needs. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't hard to find officials to applaud Money's choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``Money Magazine confirms what we San Franciscans have known all  
along,'' Mayor Willie Brown crowed Wednesday. ``This is the best 
city in America for one reason -- its people. This is the greatest 
collection of people ever found in any one city. I know that after 
40 years. They're compassionate, progressive and adventurous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Money did point out the city's flaws -- the threat of  
earthquakes, a high student-to-teacher ratio and ``the 
extraordinary cost of living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not surprising to me that Money has selected San  
Francisco, but it's also ironic, because San Francisco increasingly 
is becoming a better and better place to live for people who have 
money,'' said Gabriel Roth, city editor of The San Francisco Bay 
Guardian, an alternative weekly that's highly critical of how the 
city is run. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth sees a city in which officials consciously cater to new  
residents ``earning six figures.''

<HEADLINE> Companies Protest Flu Drug Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A government proposal to discourage the state-run  
health service from prescribing a new influenza drug has raised the 
ire of Britain's three largest pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
	AstraZeneca PLC and SmithKline Beecham PLC joined Glaxo Wellcome  
PLC in writing to Prime Minister Tony Blair, warning that their 
industry could suffer if government doctors were barred from 
prescribing Glaxo's flu drug, Relenza. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the government's National Institute for  
Clinical Excellence, which is understood to be discouraging use of 
Relenza, represents an additional hurdle for British drug makers 
seeking to win approval for new medicines. They sent their letter 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has potentially devastating consequences for the future  
of the British-based pharmaceutical industry,'' said the letter, 
which was signed by Tom McKillop, chairman of the British Pharma 
Group, a trade organization comprising the three firms. He also is 
chief executive of AstraZeneca. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza was approved for sale in the United States in July,  
though a government advisory panel had previously advised against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	NICE chief executive Andrew Dillon refused Wednesday to say  
whether his agency has actually advised against the use of Relenza 
by doctors in Britain's National Health Service. He dismissed press 
reports about the agency's recommendation as ``speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Glaxo Wellcome spokeswoman Nancy Pekarek said a  
so-called rapid review committee within NICE has in fact rejected 
the drug. The agency's final decision against Relenza was leaked 
later to the press, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	NICE was set up April 1 to assess new drugs and medical  
equipment and issue guidelines for their use by the NHS. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's rejection of Relenza would effectively block use of  
the drug by the majority of people in the United Kingdom who 
receive medical care through the state-funded NHS -- though it still 
would be available from doctors in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Glaxo Wellcome had been alone in expressing its displeasure. But  
the company drew the support of competitors AstraZeneca and 
SmithKline Beecham because they felt that NICE also poses a threat 
to their own efforts to bring new drugs to market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that the U.K. is becoming a more hostile environment  
for the launch of a new drug,'' said Chris Strutt, head of the 
British Pharma Group. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of what could be at stake, Glaxo Wellcome announced  
Tuesday that it plans to lay off 6 percent of its work force, or 
3,400 employees, as part of an effort to restructure in the face of 
intense global competition. Half the jobs lost would be British. 
</P>
<P>
	Pekarek said Relenza is the first anti-viral treatment ever  
developed for flu, a disease that killed 29,000 people in Britain 
in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
	Relenza costs $40 for a five-day treatment. It is the first drug  
for which NICE has issued a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	If doctors in the National Health Service were to prescribe the  
drug, patients would pay less than $10 for it, with the government 
picking up the remaining cost, Pekarek said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be some consideration for the number of deaths  
and hospitalizations and the amount of suffering that can be 
reduced'' through its use by the NHS, she argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillon of NICE said his agency's recommendation on the drug is  
expected to lead to a government decision some time before flu 
season starts in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, if it's no more effective and costs more than what's  
already available, we would want to look very closely before making 
any recommendation to the National Health Service,'' he warned. 
</P>
<P>
	In their letter, the three pharmaceutical firms said they were  
``appalled'' at NICE's apparent recommendation against Relenza. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emergence of NICE as a new obstacle to market entry serves  
to wipe out, at a stroke, a key element of the U.K.'s competitive 
advantage,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, NICE was founded partly to speed up access by  
government doctors to new drugs and technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHS, Dillon said, ``tends to be rather cautious about taking  
up new technologies.''

<HEADLINE> Regulations Helped Fight Acid Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Environmental regulations have reduced acid rain but have not  
yet spurred the recovery of damaged lakes and streams in North 
America, government researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Their study is the first to show that reductions in sulfur  
dioxide emissions are directly related to reduced acidity in lakes 
and streams in Europe. As for the United States, which imposed its 
regulations later, researchers said the payoff is probably still in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The study could have important implications for efforts to  
further restrict sulfur emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Acid rain is created when sulfur dioxide, produced primarily by  
coal-burning power plants, and nitrogen-bearing gases, primarily 
from automobiles, combine with water vapor in the atmosphere. That 
creates acidic sulfate and nitrate solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	While minerals in the soil, like calcium, can neutralize some of  
the acid, the large amounts of acid rain over the last 100 years 
have resulted in acidic lakes and streams, harming plant and animal 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study, done by the Environmental Protection Agency, was  
published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. It examined 
acidity in 205 lakes and streams in five regions of North America 
and three regions in Europe from 1980 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The best news is that the amount of acidic sulfates entering  
lakes and streams has declined everywhere, said chief author John 
Stoddard. 
</P>
<P>
	The data also showed a drop in acidity of lakes and streams in  
Europe and a North American region that includes eastern Maine and 
southern Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	However, no such recovery appeared in four other regions  
covering much of the area from eastern Manitoba through the upper 
Great Lakes to Quebec and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked only at the chemical properties of the water;  
it did not look at plant and animal life 
</P>
<P>
	Stoddard said the recovery of lakes and streams in North America  
was apparently stalled because the capacity of the soil to 
neutralize the acid was being depleted as fast as the sulfate 
levels were dropping. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what happened in Nordic countries during the 1980s,  
Stoddard said. ``Subsequently we have seen recoveries in the Nordic 
countries. We expect to see that in North America,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found virtually no changes in nitrates anywhere. They  
are not as strictly regulated as sulfates. The failure to reduce 
nitrates has seriously impeded the recovery of lakes and streams, 
Stoddard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Oppenheimer, a scientist with the Environmental Defense  
Fund, said the study proves that environmental laws do work and 
that to speed recovery of North American lakes and streams, 
stricter laws must be adopted in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA is expected to produce regulations by the end of the  
year that will reduce smog-causing pollution from older, dirtier 
coal-burning power plants. Stoddard said the new regulations are 
driven by studies like his. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for the Edison Electric  
Institute, an association of privately owned electric companies, 
said it is too soon to impose new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not consider data collected after 1995, the year  
stricter limits were placed on emissions, Reidinger said. He added 
that even tighter controls will be imposed next year as part of the 
1990 Clean Air Act, and that those efforts should be given a chance 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have gotten better and things are going to continue to  
get better,'' Reidinger said.

<HEADLINE> States Push Up Against Y2K Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With less than three months to go, several  
states are pushing up against the Jan. 1 deadline in their scramble 
to ensure Y2K computer problems do not disrupt basic public 
services, officials said at a House hearing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials stressed that states generally have done a good  
job in either fixing computers or installing backup systems to 
prevent interruptions in such services as food stamps, Medicaid 
payments, unemployment benefits and child nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``But some state completion dates are so close to the turn of  
the century that the risk of disruption to their programs is 
substantially increased,'' said Joel Willemssen of the General 
Accounting Office, the investigative wing of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of American lives will be harshly disrupted if these  
vital programs fail,'' said Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., chairman of 
the House Government Reform subcommittee that has followed the Y2K 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Many older computers read only the last two digits in a year and  
could malfunction if they mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 
1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agencies have been given high ratings in addressing  
computer problems in 43 ``high impact'' programs. But states are 
responsible for administering 10 of those programs, not one of 
which is expected to be fully compliant until year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Watkins of the Agriculture Department said Georgia will  
not have its Women, Infant and Children (WIC) nutrition program 
ready until December, and Maryland is to fix its child nutrition 
program in December. She said both states have backup systems and 
there will be no interruptions in service. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Hugler of the Labor Department said the District of  
Columbia will not fix its unemployment insurance program until the 
end of the year. California still has some work left to do on its 
unemployment benefits program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO, in a report issued Wednesday to the Senate Finance  
Committee, listed New Mexico, New Hampshire, North Carolina and the 
Virgin Islands as high risk in terms of having their Medicaid 
benefits systems ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama, Alaska, Massachusetts, the Virgin Islands and Puerto  
Rico were given high risk ratings for Medicaid information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little bit of disappointment that many of the  
providers have not taken this serious enough,'' said John Callahan 
of the Health and Human Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Benzen of the National Association of State Information  
Resource Executives, which represents 48 state chief information 
officers, said 43 member states accounting for more than 94 percent 
of the nation's population are now at least 75 percent compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the states with lower than 70 percent of their mission  
critical systems compliant were Alabama, Hawaii and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzen said it was hard to classify state performances because  
the situation is changing daily as states rush to complete work. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico, for example, which got a high-risk rating for its  
Medicaid system, said that while it had encountered problems in 
testing its computer upgrades, those problems had been resolved and 
they expected to get a low risk rating in the next review.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tracking Food Aid to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia is seeking an additional 5 million  
metric tons of U.S. food assistance, even as the Clinton 
administration tries to bolster its monitoring of the donation 
program to prevent the aid from being stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the United States is giving Russia 3 million metric  
tons of wheat, corn, pork and other commodities worth an estimated 
$1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration wants to be very careful proceeding down  
the road with another request until the monitoring is as good as we 
can make it,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told the House 
Agriculture Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's request for next year includes a million tons of  
milling wheat, 3 million tons of feed grains, and a million tons of 
soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department could alter the aid package to suit  
the needs of U.S. producers, and lawmakers are pushing Glickman to 
include pork and peanuts, among other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no evidence that any of the commodities in this year's  
shipment have been diverted, Glickman said. But he acknowledged 
that it is difficult to track proceeds from sales of the food once 
they are put into the banking system. Russia is allowed to sell 
most of the donated commodities but the money is to be deposited 
into a government pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way we're going to be foolproof'' in preventing the  
diversion of funds, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department's inspector general, Roger Viadero,  
disclosed Wednesday that some proceeds from aid packages in 1993 
and 1994 may have been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was supposed to be spent on development projects but  
some of it was transferred from a bank in Russia out of the 
country, Viadero said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to discuss the case further, but an official with a  
private organization that was to use the sale proceeds, the 
Washington-based Fund for Democracy and Development, said the 
questionable transfer involved about $1 million, half of which has 
been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're right in the middle of trying ... to get this money  
back,'' said Jack Heller, the group's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about U.S. food aid emerged this summer in connection  
with allegations about a massive money laundering scheme involving 
the Bank of New York. Three people, including a former vice 
president of the bank, and three companies were charged with 
illegally channeling $7 billion through the bank's accounts. The 
money is believed to be tied to the Russian mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have been trying to determine the origin of those  
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has significantly improved its monitoring of food  
shipments to Russia in recent months, said Viadero, USDA's internal 
watchdog. But given the problems in the Russian banking system, the 
controls still are not sufficient to guarantee the aid is not being 
diverted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't give you any assurances and can make no assertions  
about what controls are in place or whether they are working,'' he 
told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA has bolstered its monitoring staff in Russia from three to  
eight and will be inspecting as many as 20 percent of the food 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	About 75 percent of this year's aid has been shipped, and about  
10 percent of the proceeds that are supposed to be placed in the 
pension fund has been deposited so far. Russia has four months to

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks, Johnson Come Up Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- In the team's first playoff game, Randy Johnson  
wasn't enough for the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up four early runs, Johnson made it to the ninth  
inning with the score tied at 4. And after the Big Unit left, 
Edgardo Alfonzo hit a grand slam that sent the Diamondbacks to an 
8-4 loss to the New York Mets in their NL playoff opener Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a sad finish for Johnson, who lost his major  
league-record sixth consecutive postseason decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also got his first playoff hit -- a one-out double in the  
seventh inning when the score was tied at 4. But he blundered when 
he wandered away from second base on Tony Womack's fly to left 
field and was doubled off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was obviously disappointed not knowing how many outs there  
were,'' Johnson said. ``Essentially that was pretty much the way 
the night went for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 17-9 with a league-leading 2.48 ERA, walked three  
batters before the ninth and paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
	John Olerud hit a two-run homer in the third after Rickey  
Henderson walked for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	And after Jay Bell's sacrifice fly in the third, Johnson allowed  
another run in the fourth when Robin Ventura doubled and scored on 
a bunt by Rey Ordonez. It was the Mets' sixth hit. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Johnson regained his command, and pitched hitless ball  
through the next four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he had good stuff,'' said Olerud. ``I thought he  
threw the ball hard. He was able to throw his slider for strikes. I 
think we took advantage of his mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura singled leading off the ninth and Ordonez singled with  
one out. After walking Melvin Mora on four pitches, Johnson was 
lifted after 138 pitches and Bobby Chouinard relieved. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it seemed like Matt Williams saved the day, diving to his  
left to smother Henderson's grounder to third and throwing 
accurately to the plate to just get the forceout on Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of bringing in Matt Mantei, who finished with 32  
saves, Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter left in Chouinard to 
face Alfonzo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like he was best-suited for the situation,'' Showalter  
said. ``He's done the job for us most of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After working the count to 3-1, Alfonzo hit a drive down the  
left-field line, and it just stayed fair. 
</P>
<P>
	With that, the Diamondbacks lost in their entry to the  
postseason. Now they have to win three of four, starting Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	All of a sudden, those 100 wins for Arizona don't mean so much.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Close Higher; Dow Up 187.75 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today as investors cast aside  
interest rate concerns and turned upbeat about third-quarter 
earnings. Financial and Internet issues once again led the gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
was up 187.75 at 10,588.34. The Dow has rebounded nearly 375 points 
since last Wednesday, when it reached 10,213.48, its lowest point 
since April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose, although advancing stocks  
only narrowly beat decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 24.03 to 1,325.38, and the  
Nasdaq composite index was up 57.42 at 2,857.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,752 up, 1,266 down and 527 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 888.83 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
954.19 million in Tuesday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.41 at 428.42.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors were focused on third-quarter earnings  
reports which have begun to trickle in, and expected many of them 
to be strong. 
</P>
<P>
	For companies that reported earnings today, the market followed  
its recent pattern of rewarding firms that beat analyst 
expectations and punishing those that meet but don't exceed 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Pepsico rose after surpassing Wall Street's  
expectations, although its beverage sales suffered because of 
higher prices. Coca-Cola, a Dow stock, rose as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Aluminum producer and Dow component Alcoa fell after meeting  
forecasts but reporting a drop in shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimism about earnings comes after weeks of worry about  
what the Federal Reserve would do with interest rates. The Fed 
decided Tuesday to leave interest rates alone for now but lean 
toward a rate hike in the coming months. Although the Fed's 
announcement initially led to heavy selling, investors were more 
relaxed today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market spent six weeks wretching its hands about interest  
rates, and though it didn't get exactly what it wanted, it's now 
behind us,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis for 
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank has pushed rates higher twice since June and  
worries about another increase helped depress stocks down for much 
of the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think the market is oversold and think they can pick up  
some bargains,'' said Eugene G. Mintz, financial markets analyst at 
Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express and Hewlett Packard helped push the Dow higher.  
</P>
<P>
	Online autioneer Ebay and Priceline.com were leaders in the  
Nasdaq market.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Address Teamsters Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reaching out to a key labor group, President  
Clinton will speak at a New York dinner honoring Teamsters union 
president James P. Hoffa, whose powerful federation is struggling 
to recover from years of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will meet privately with Hoffa on Thursday at an event  
sponsored by the National Labor Research Association, a 
labor-backed research group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president reaches out on a regular basis to labor union  
leaders in this country and will continue to do so,'' White House 
press secretary Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's appearance comes four days before the AFL-CIO, which  
includes the Teamsters, opens its annual convention in Los Angeles. 
The union is expected to consider whether to endorse Vice President 
Al Gore in his race against former Sen. Bill Bradley for the 
Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart played down the politics of Thursday's event.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they'll discuss issues that involve rank and file  
Teamsters and working Americans,'' Lockhart said. ``I don't know 
that there'll be any discussions of political endorsements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's attendance at the dinner also gives prominence to the  
Teamsters' drive to end strict federal supervision intended to 
remove any taint of mob influence from the union.

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: Bruce Willis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bruce Willis, the wisecracking action hero,  
had trouble preparing for an atypical role as a family man married 
for 15 years in his latest film, ``The Story of Us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hit on an answer, which involved hitting on co-star Michelle  
Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked Michelle about it, and I said, 'Look, the only way I'm  
ever going to pretend or act like I know you or we've been married 
all this time, is, if it's OK with you, I'm going to flirt with you 
every day that we come to work,''' Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer laughed and said fine, Willis said in an interview to  
promote the Rob Reiner comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``So my job on this film was to flirt with Michelle Pfeiffer  
every day,'' Willis said. ``Nice work if you can get it. I highly 
recommend trying to get that job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willis, 44, has gotten some nice work lately far removed from  
the bigger-and-better-explosion genre of the ``Die Hard'' series 
that made him a box-office behemoth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sixth Sense,'' in which Willis turns in a low-key  
performance as a therapist treating a boy who can speak with the 
dead, has surpassed ``Armageddon'' as the actor's highest-grossing 
film and stands to take in well over $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He stars in ``Breakfast of Champions,'' an adaptation of Kurt  
Vonnegut's novel, as a manic car dealer on a darkly comic quest to 
unravel his own identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Now comes ``The Story of Us,'' in which Willis and Pfeiffer play  
a disaffected couple contemplating divorce. That somber scenario 
aside, it is a comedy, and Willis delivers a funny, tender 
performance reminiscent of his breakthrough role on television's 
``Moonlighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you recall, when he first got 'Die Hard,' everybody said,  
'Bruce Willis in an action picture?''' Reiner said. ``It was 
unheard of because he had done 'Moonlighting' up to that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willis' first film role was the Blake Edwards romantic comedy  
``Blind Date.'' His reputation was built on action films that 
haven't required much range, but ``Story of Us'' will show everyone 
``that this is a complete actor,'' Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the chops to do it. You can see it in 'The Sixth  
Sense,' and you can see it here,'' Reiner said. ``I think it's 
going to elevate him to a level that he hasn't seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Story of Us'' comes on the heels of Willis' split with Demi  
Moore last year. Willis won't discuss any parallels between the 
looming divorce in the film and the breakup of his own marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are few areas of my private life that are still private,  
and this happens to be one of them,'' Willis said. ``I'm sure it's 
an interesting hook from a journalistic standpoint to write about 
my personal life as it parallels this film, but one is a movie and 
one is real life, and one I will talk about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between his shoot-'em-up roles, Willis has taken on a number of  
beefier parts, as a disillusioned Vietnam vet in ``In Country,'' a 
double-crossing boxer in Quentin Tarantino's ``Pulp Fiction,'' a 
cheating husband opposite Paul Newman in ``Nobody's Fool,'' and a 
time-traveling loner in Terry Gilliam's apocalyptic ``12 Monkeys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willis said he hasn't ruled out future action films, but admits  
he's become bored with the tough-guy roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to keep myself interested,'' Willis said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have missed doing comedy and trying to be funny, which is  
much more difficult and at the same time more rewarding ... than 
running down a street with a gun in my hand shouting, 'No,' which 
I've done and is not that difficult to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fun when I was younger, but I think that genre kind of  
needs to reinvent itself. We've run out of bad guys, we've run out 
of story lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With ``Sixth Sense,'' Willis now has box-office luster outside  
the action genre. The surprise blockbuster has climbed past the 
``Austin Powers'' sequel as the year's second biggest hit after 
``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willis said he hopes to shoot another film with ``Sixth Sense''  
director and writer M. Night Shyamalan this spring. Shyamalan was 
just delivering the script to Willis this month and wouldn't tell 
him what it's about, but the actor said he's agreed to do it, sight 
unseen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's overwhelming he would do that,'' Shyamalan said.  
``Obviously, he's been offered hundreds of things for that time of 
year that he said no to because I told him I wanted to work with 
him on my next film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willis' hits and misses in action films have unfairly defined  
his career, while his more daring roles have been largely ignored, 
Shyamalan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's definitely taken huge risks in his career,'' Shyamalan  
said. ``I told him he's going to need to hit it out of the park 
three times before anyone will go, 'All right, all right, he can 
act.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Breakfast of Champions'' is playing in limited release and has  
received generally poor reviews. Still, Willis said he's proud of 
the movie, which he helped bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a labor of love,'' said Willis, who was executive  
producer for the film that co-stars Nick Nolte and Albert Finney. 
``Everybody who showed up worked for free and rushed to work every 
day. We had a ball doing this film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Story of Us'' appealed to Willis because of the universal  
theme of relationships on the skids. Also, because of his acting 
background, Reiner (who co-stars as Willis' best friend) was able 
to bring fresh storytelling nuances ``into the tiny moments that 
happen on screen,'' Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
	And writers Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson provided a funny,  
full-bodied script that gave the actors room to roam, Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like these were mediocre scenes that due to my  
extraordinary acting ability got turned into something great,'' 
Willis said. ``It was well written, and when you have funny lines, 
it's easy to make them work if you have a little bit of comic 
timing and you have great actors to work off of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willis came prepared with suggestions to spice up the story,  
Zweibel and Nelson said. On the set, Willis told Nelson he could do 
a funny ``Riverdance'' imitation that might fit Ben, the boyish 
husband's character. 
</P>
<P>
	He told her, ``Don't you think Ben's the kind of guy who would  
`Riverdance' at an inappropriate moment?'' Nelson said. And so, in 
the final scene, Willis does his version of the Irish tap dance to 
welcome the couple's children home from summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Willis is taking some time off till early next year and said  
he's enjoying running his own children back and forth to school. 
</P>
<P>
	For all his box-office success, when he gets back to work, he  
won't necessarily be hunting for more hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The yardstick in Hollywood is a very simple one. If it makes  
hundreds of millions of dollars, it's a hit. If it doesn't, it's a 
failure,'' Willis said. ``I don't use that yardstick to measure my 
own worth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you talk about your career, you're talking about  
the sum total at the end of your career,'' Willis said. ``What did 
you accomplish and what did you do and what kind of stories did you 
tell and what kind of films did you make. 
</P>
<P>
	``The body of work. We're not going to know about that for a  
long time.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules on Tissue Research Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona law prohibiting the use of fetal  
tissue in medical research has been found unconstitutional by a 
federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William Browning said the law was too vague  
because it failed to define terms like ``experimental'' and did not 
draw clear line between experimental and standard practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar laws in other states, including Utah, Louisiana and  
Illinois, have been overturned by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, based in New York,  
had challenged Arizona's fetal-tissue ban in 1996 on behalf of four 
people suffering from Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical studies have suggested that some fetal-tissue  
transplants can effectively treat the neurological disorder because 
the tissue produces dopamine, a substance in the brain that 
controls voluntary movement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1975 Arizona law, revised in 1983, barred medical  
researchers from using fetal tissue that resulted from an induced 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	In his decision Sept. 30, Browning ordered the state to stop  
enforcing the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Pati Urias, a spokeswoman for the state Attorney General's  
office, said Wednesday that the office had not decided whether to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Right to Life President John Jakubczyk criticized the  
ruling, saying it favored a ``pro-abortion industry'' that wants to 
profit from ``fetal harvesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Arizona affiliates of Planned Parenthood had joined the  
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Fisher, chairman of the neurology department for  
Barrow Neurological Center in Phoenix, said the ruling could lead 
to breakthroughs in treatment for people with brain disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the opportunity to do research, it will become much more  
feasible to make it a clinically important and useful procedure,'' 
he said. But he added, ``It also raises significant ethical 
dilemmas that will have to be considered along with scientific 
advances.''

<HEADLINE> Animal May Have Dragged Missing Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUSTIC, Colo. (AP) -- Trackers cast doubt on belief that a cougar  
might have snatched a 3-year-old boy missing for five days when 
they reported Wednesday night that what looked like the boy's 
footprints were actually bear tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trackers confirmed a set of prints near the bear tracks  
on a steep, rocky mountainside were made by a mountain lion, 
Larimer County Sheriff Sgt. Justin Smith said. And a bootprint 
still thought to be Jaryd Aterdo's was found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes this lead a little more suspect,'' Smith said of the  
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, however, said an attack by a mountain lion attack  
couldn't be ruled out in the boy's disappearance. Jaryd was with a 
group of hikers in rugged Poudre Canyon Saturday when he became 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still the only lead we have with any type of evidence,''  
Smith said of the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's father, Allyn Atadero, 41, said that thought doesn't  
make it any easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just something that could be a conclusion, but at the  
same time it's something I hope didn't happen,'' Atadero said. 
``You would think there would be something, a shoe or blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the search in the canyon, about 20 miles west of Fort  
Collins and about 80 miles northwest of Denver, would be 
significantly scaled back Thursday. Sixty-nine people were combing 
the mountainsides Wednesday, but only 12, including four people 
with two tracking dogs, will go out Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10-year-old Lakewood boy was killed in 1997 by a mountain lion  
in Rocky Mountain National Park and an 18-year-old man died in 1991 
in a similar attack near Idaho Springs.

<HEADLINE> Leafs 2, Avalanche 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Mats Sundin set up Toronto's first goal and then  
scored the eventual game-winner in the Maple Leafs' 2-1 victory 
Wednesday night over the Colorado Avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto scored both of its goals on the power play, as Jonas  
Hoglund got credit for the first one when Sundin's shot went in off 
Hoglund's leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundin has three goals and three assists in helping lead Toronto  
to a 3-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Sakic scored for the Avalanche, who are without injured  
forwards Peter Forsberg, Shjon Podein and Adam Deadmarsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto took a 1-0 lead at 11:36 of the second period as Sakic  
sat out an interference penalty. Sundin fired a wrist shot that 
caromed off Hoglund, and goaltender Patrick Roy couldn't get to it 
through traffic in front of the net. Referee Bill McCreary signaled 
a goal, and Roy followed him to the scorer's booth to protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic tied it at 16:53 when Sakic scored on a wrist shot. The  
play Claude Lemieux slipped the puck to rookie Alex Tanguay, who 
passed it to Sakic in the faceoff circle. Sakic lifted a shot 
through the legs of Toronto defenseman Alexander Karpovtsev and 
into the far top corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundin got the winner at 10:44 of the third. After Dan Hinote  
was called for high-sticking, Steve Thomas passed to Sundin, who 
got the shot past Roy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche were without Adam Foote, their best defenseman,  
for the last 10 minutes. McCreary gave Foote a 10-minute misconduct 
then a game misconduct for arguing after Foote and the Leafs' Yanic 
Perreault were assessed coinciding high-sticking penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph, who stopped 23 shots, made an exceptional glove save  
with 40 seconds left by robbing Sandis Ozolinsh's shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy made 26 saves for the Avalanche.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Catastrophe Claims Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. property and casualty insurers will pay  
about $2.1 billion to homeowners and businesses for property losses 
from seven catastrophic events in the third quarter of 1999, down 
from $3.5 billion for 13 catastrophic events in the second quarter, 
an industry group reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the industry's catastrophic losses in the third quarter  
stemmed from storms and hurricanes, including Hurricane Floyd, 
which caused nearly $1.3 billion in insured losses, said the New 
York-based Insurance Services Office Inc.'s Property Claims 
Services unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Homeowners, businesses and auto owners have made 831,000 claims  
so far from major catastrophes in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the industry has seen claims of $7.4 billion in 1999.  
</P>
<P>
	The most costly catastrophe of 1999 has been the series of  
tropical storms and tornadoes that barreled through 18 states in 
early May, causing $1.5 billion in damage.

	The Schmidts refused to comment. In Iowa, divorce proceedings  
are not public record until decrees are granted. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1991, Mrs. Schmidt, then Cara Clausen, gave birth in  
Cedar Rapids to a girl she named Anna. Two days later, she signed 
papers giving her child up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	When the child was just two weeks old, her parental rights were  
terminated, and Jan and Roberta DeBoer of Ann Arbor, Mich., were 
granted legal custody of the baby as her adoptive parents. The 
DeBoers named her Jessica. 
</P>
<P>
	But then two weeks later, Ms. Clausen filed papers to revoke her  
initial decision. Dan Schmidt filed an affidavit of paternity. 
</P>
<P>
	During the ensuing legal battle, the girl lived with the  
DeBoers. A national debated raged over the rights of biological and 
adoptive parents, and the case led to changes in the laws of Iowa 
and other states on the amount of time a birth parent has to make a 
claim on a child in an adoption proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schmidts finally won custody in August 1993 when the Supreme  
Courts in Iowa and Michigan sided with them. A throng of 
photographers and TV cameras captured the screams and tears of the 
2 1/2-year-old girl as she was taken from the DeBoers to the Schmidts. 
</P>
<P>
	Baby Jessica, once again Anna Schmidt, is an 8-year-old  
third-grader, and she has had no contact with the DeBoers since 
moving to Iowa. The Schmidts have another child, 6-year-old Chloe. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not good, and I think most adults would look at the  
situation and say, `This is not good,''' said Ennio Cipani, a 
professor at the California School of Professional Psychology in 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
	The DeBoers, who adopted another child in 1994, and their  
supporters founded an organization Hear My Voice, which lobbies for 
``safe and permanent homes'' for children not kept by their birth 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Janet Snyder, executive director of the organization, said the  
DeBoers had no comment on the Schmidts' divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we would never wish family difficulty on anyone,''  
she said.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A $12.6 billion foreign aid bill appears  
headed for a presidential veto -- one that is likely to be 
sustained. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is unhappy with the measure because it cuts  
nearly $2 billion from his request. 
</P>
<P>
	The House narrowly approved the bill 214-211 on Tuesday. Senate  
approval, possibly as soon as today, also was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, senior Democrat on the House  
appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, said the overall 
bill ``does not measure up, even in the slightest way, to our 
leadership role in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The foreign aid allocation was given very little priority,''  
she complained. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican leaders suggested the money wasn't available.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have more money. The only way to get more money is  
through new taxes, jeopardizing Social Security or breaking the 
budget caps,'' said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the 
foreign operations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	He alleged an ``insatiable appetite for money that President  
Clinton wants to hand out as he does his travels during this last 
year and a half of his presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we wants to veto it, let him veto it,'' said Callahan.  
``This is as much as he's going to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the cut funds: $500 million that Clinton had requested as  
a first installment on last year's Wye River peace accord between 
Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Clinton has pledged $1.8 billion toward that effort.  
</P>
<P>
	The administration and its Democratic allies in the House also  
complained that the legislation cuts many economic assistance 
programs, including those for poor countries in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is also unhappy that the legislation  
eliminates $241 million for a State Department program to help find 
work for former Soviet nuclear weapons scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Conferees did agree to do away with a controversial antiabortion  
provision that social conservatives had championed and which had 
been in the original House-passed bill. 
</P>
<P>
	That would have prohibited U.S. funds from flowing into any  
international family planning organizations that support or promote 
abortion rights.

<HEADLINE> Ullrich Wins Cycling Time Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TREVISO, Italy (AP) -- Once again, Jan is The Man.  
</P>
<P>
	Hailed as the next dominant cyclist when he won the 1997 Tour de  
France, a newly fit Jan Ullrich put himself back amongst the 
sport's elite Wednesday by winning the men's time trial at the 
World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The German, riding with a cotton cap instead of a protective  
helmet, covered 31.4 miles in 1 hour, 28.44 seconds -- more than a 
minute faster than all but two of the 55 other entrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always great to win, but to finally be a world champion  
is a beautiful thing. It'll be hard to criticize me now,'' said 
Ullrich, bronze medalist in 1994 at Catania, Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found my rhythm very early and gave all I had at the end.''  
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have enough energy left to celebrate.  
</P>
<P>
	Ullrich pushed through the finish line beside Treviso's 12th  
century cathedral with mouth agape, gasping air. There was no 
thrusting of arms in the air, no high-fives with team members, not 
even a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just needed to catch my breath,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ullrich's season started poorly. He was 55th at the Amstel Gold  
Race, 14th in the Tour of Bavaria and seventh in the Tour of 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	And a rider who never has finished lower than second at the Tour  
de France in three tries was forced to skip that prestigious stage 
race this summer after a fall during the Tour of Germany in May 
left him with head and knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, though, Ullrich looked in better shape than he has  
in two years, having lost about 15 pounds from early in the 1998 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Andersson of Sweden finished second, 14.09 seconds  
behind. Britain's Chris Boardman, the 1994 champion, was third in 
1:01:27.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the race, Igor Bonciucov became the first rider banned at  
these championships because of an elevated red blood cell count. 
The Moldovan was among 12 cyclists tested Wednesday, the sport's 
governing body said. Twenty-six were tested Tuesday, with all 
passing.

<HEADLINE>  Bodies Sought After Train Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Police, firefighters and railway crews, working  
with a heavy crane, searched for more bodies today in a coach that 
was burned and mangled in Britain's worst rail disaster in a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The rush-hour collision in the residential Ladbroke Grove area  
of west London killed at least 27 people and injured more than 160. 
</P>
<P>
	The train companies said their investigation would focus on the  
behavior of the outbound train, which may have gone through a red 
light. Reports said both trains were traveling 60 mph when the 
outbound train tried to cross in front of the London-bound train. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they expected to find more dead in a badly burned  
first-class car at the front of the London-bound train. 
</P>
<P>
	``The search of the burnt carriage is going to be extremely  
difficult,'' said Andy Trotter, deputy assistant commissioner of 
the Metropolitan Police. ``There was a severe fire in that carriage 
and great devastation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The London-bound Great Western train had a green light to  
proceed, according to a statement Tuesday by Great Western, Thames 
Trains and Railtrack, the company that owns and operates the rail 
infrastructure. Thames Trains operated the outbound train. 
</P>
<P>
	Signals in the vicinity were in full working order, the  
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investigations will now concentrate on the behavior of the  
Thames turbo train following reports that it had passed a signal at 
danger,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thames Trains earlier said the train driver had been working for  
two months, after completing 11 months of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The train drivers' union, ASLEF, threatened to call a strike  
vote unless rail companies responded positively to demands for 
safety improvements within seven days. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's general secretary, Mick Rix, said it wanted the  
installation of an automatic train protection system that would 
prevent trains from passing red lights. That system was recommended 
by an official investigation following the death of 35 people in a 
1988 accident, but the government balked at the estimated cost of 
$1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Tony Thomson of British Transport Police said  
officers had found the data recorder from the outbound train but 
were still looking for the recorder from the London-bound Great 
Western train. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred near the spot where a 1997 crash killed seven  
people and injured 150. Great Western had been fined $2.47 million 
for ``dereliction of duty'' in connection with the earlier crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Injuries are among the worst I have seen in my professional  
career,'' said Robin Touquet, an accident and emergency consultant 
at St. Mary's Hospital. ``It was like looking after people from an 
air crash, but it was a train crash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Great Western said as many as 500 people might have been on  
board its train, which originated in Cheltenham, northwest of 
London, and was minutes away from its destination of Paddington 
Station. The Thames train, which may have been carrying up to 150 
passengers, had just pulled out of the station bound for nearby 
Bedwyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's accident was Britain's worst rail crash since December  
1988, when three trains collided outside London's Clapham Junction, 
killing 35 people.

<HEADLINE> Dole Calls Tobacco Suit Misguided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The federal government should be more  
concerned about stemming the flood of illegal drugs into the 
country than with suing the tobacco industry, Republican 
presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole criticized a recent Justice Department lawsuit that seeks  
to recover from the industry billions of dollars that taxpayers 
have spent on smoking-related health care. The suit alleges that 
cigarette makers conspired since the 1950s to defraud and mislead 
the public and to conceal information about the effects of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that's interesting to me is here's the Clinton-Gore  
administration going so hard after (the lawsuit). Where are they on 
drugs?'' Dole told reporters after a luncheon speech to the 
Lexington Professional Women's Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't we see action when drugs are literally killing a lot  
of our kids, ruining their lives, not just children but adults as 
well?,'' she added. ``And yet that bully pulpit has not been used 
to really preach that drugs aren't cool, they kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said she would rather see the government focus on ways to  
effectively spend more than $240 billion that cigarette makers have 
agreed to pay the states over 25 years to compensate for their 
smoking-related health insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should be working to use a lot of that money for  
education for our children,'' she said. ``That's what's important. 
It's not in the courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said she also supports an all-out effort to prevent tobacco  
companies from selling cigarettes to young people, including bans 
on vending machines that are accessible to children and advertising 
targeting the young. 
</P>
<P>
	However, rather than sue tobacco manufacturers, Dole said she  
would like to see the government pursuing an aggressive anti-drug 
campaign.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Democrats Duel Over Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The partisan duel over Social Security  
continued Wednesday as the Senate signaled support for using 
across-the-board spending cuts to keep from tapping the pension 
program's surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	By 54-46, the Senate approved a non-binding, Republican  
resolution advocating unspecified, across-the-board cuts in all 13 
annual spending bills for the new fiscal year. Sen. John McCain, 
R-Ariz., a presidential contender, was the only senator to cross 
party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the Senate voted 54-46 to reject a Democratic  
alternative, with defections by Sens. John Edwards, D-N.C., James 
Jeffords, R-Vt., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. That non-binding 
measure said instead of across-the-board cuts, Congress should 
close tax loopholes and find other unspecified savings to pay for 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither vote advanced Congress' overdue spending bills for  
fiscal 2000, which began Friday. Rather, a battle for political 
positioning was under way, with Republicans casting themselves as 
champions of Social Security and Democrats accusing the GOP of 
seeking dangerous cuts in popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our objective is to make absolutely certain we don't dip into  
or spend Social Security surplus money,'' said Senate Majority Whip 
Don Nickles, R-Okla., defending across-the-board cuts as a sensible 
way to prevent that if other savings cannot be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do my colleagues really want to go on record cutting  
education?'' asked Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., following that 
with anti-crime, health research, and other programs no politician 
wants to be seen as slashing. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid some internal grumbling, congressional Republicans --  
especially in the House -- are considering across-the-board 
reductions to keep from eating into Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans have been considering a 2.7 percent cut to  
achieve that. The White House budget office said it would really 
take a 9 percent reduction, and produced a five-page memo asserting 
that such cuts would have a ``severe impact'' on defense, education 
and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, President Clinton has signed only four of the 13 bills  
for fiscal 2000, vetoed one and threatened to veto five others. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House-Senate bargainers working on one of the most  
contentious spending bills were ready to roll back some 
House-approved cuts in NASA and housing -- if administration 
officials could provide savings to pay for them, said congressional 
participants who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget chief Jack Lew was talking to lawmakers about  
finding the savings. But the two sides had not yet agreed on dollar 
amounts to be restored or how the extra spending would be paid for, 
an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said if an agreement on savings was reached,  
lawmakers would provide 50,000 new rental housing vouchers for 
low-income families that Clinton has requested, the $13.6 billion 
he sought for the space program, and restore the national service 
Americorps program. 
</P>
<P>
	The House had approved none of the housing vouchers, voted to  
kill Americorps, and pared $900 million from Clinton's NASA 
request. White House officials have cited both in their threats to 
veto a $97 billion measure financing housing, veterans, environment 
and space programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were other disputes surrounding the bill that leave  
its fate uncertain. House-Senate negotiators were hoping to meet 
formally on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, Congress sent Clinton its sixth spending bill  
as the Senate voted 51-49 to approve a $12.6 billion foreign aid 
bill. Clinton has threatened to veto it because it provides $1.9 
billion less than he wants, including none of the $500 million he 
requested for Israel and the Palestinians to implement the Wye 
River peace pact between them.

<HEADLINE> American Home To Cut 700 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, N.J. (AP) -- American Home Products Corp. will eliminate  
about 700 jobs in its Cyanamid Agricultural Products division, or 
about 13 percent of the unit's worldwide work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts disclosed today are included in a wide-ranging  
restructuring of the Cyanamid unit, which is headquartered in 
Parsippany. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, AHP officials said they are trying to make their  
manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts more efficient. They 
also will make changes to the unit's research operations and buy 
back a portion of its soybean herbicide inventory from the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyback results from distribution changes and comes while  
the company is preparing to launch a new soybean herbicide for the 
2000 season. The repurchase will cost the company $330 million, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The eliminated positions represent 13 percent of the Cyanamid  
workforce, which totals 5,500 worldwide. About 2,300 employees are 
in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will close four U.S. regional administrative sales  
offices by the end of 1999, said AHP spokesman Lowell Weiner. Those 
offices are in Denver, Indianapolis, Des Moines, Iowa, and Memphis, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP did not immediately release the number of employees who work  
at those offices. Weiner said layoffs -- and possibly other office 
closings -- would occur worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring costs will be reflected as a special charge in  
the company's third-quarter earnings.

<HEADLINE> Mets 8, Diamondbacks 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Edgardo Alfonzo ruined Randy Johnson at the start  
and buried the Arizona Diamondbacks at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo, who had a solo home run in the first inning, hit a  
grand slam with two outs in the ninth off reliever Bobby Chouinard 
as the New York Mets beat the Diamondbacks 8-4 Tuesday night in the 
opener of their NL playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last few years, Edgardo Alfonzo has been a fabulous  
baseball player who has kind of a star quality,'' said Mets manager 
Bobby Valentine, in a playoff game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's improving. He's gaining confidence, and with  
confidence you get performances like you saw tonight,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who left the game with the bases loaded and one out in  
the ninth, lost his sixth straight postseason decision, a major 
league record. He struck out 11 and held on through an exhausting 
138 pitches as Arizona rallied from a 4-1 deficit to tie it at 4. 
</P>
<P>
	John Olerud became the first left-handed batter to hit a homer  
off Johnson in two years with his two-run shot in the third that 
made it 3-0. Olerud and the Mets' other left-hander in the lineup 
each had two hits off Johnson, who usually dominates lefties. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys came out swinging. I thought they were just great  
at-bats tonight,'' Valentine said. ``We got four hits left-handed, 
and that's determination. That's reaching down and wanting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks rallied on home runs by Erubiel Durazo and Luis  
Gonzalez to make it 4-all. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson settled down to pitch four hitless innings, but another  
lefty, Robin Ventura, led off the ninth with a single. With one 
out, Rey Ordonez singled, then Johnson walked Melvin Mora to load 
the bases and bring on Chouinard. 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman Matt Williams made a diving stop, his second of  
the game, on Rickey Henderson's grounder, and threw home to force 
out Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alfonzo hit Chouinard's 3-1 pitch just inside the left-field  
foul pole for the grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona manager Buck Showalter said he felt it was right to  
leave Johnson in the game, even though the big left-hander had said 
he was getting close to running out of gas. He said he used 
Chouinard because he'd been one of the best relievers this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we could have figured out a way to keep Alfonzo in the  
park, then maybe we could have had some fun in the ninth inning,'' 
Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, whose postseason record fell to 2-6, allowed seven runs  
on eight hits. Turk Wendell pitched one inning and was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if it was a foul or fair ball,'' Alfonzo said.  
``I stayed at home plate, going, `C'mon, c'mon.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson now is in sole possession of the longest postseason  
losing streak by a pitcher. Joe Bush (1914-23) and Doyle Anderson 
(1973-87) both lost five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy Johnson is one of the best pitchers in baseball right  
now,'' Alfonzo said. ``You have to be patient and wait for a pitch 
to hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the seventh, Johnson doubled for his first postseason hit.  
But he was doubled up when took off running on Tony Womack's 
one-out fly ball to left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets showed no sign of being emotionally spent despite an  
overnight flight from their 5-0 wild-card playoff victory Monday 
night at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out in the first, Alfonzo, who had 27 homers in the  
regular season, hit Johnson's 0-2 pitch over the left-center field 
wall. On Monday night, Alfonzo also homered in the first inning the 
previous day against the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud and Mike Piazza followed with singles before Johnson  
struck out Benny Agbayani and Ventura to end the inning. Johnson 
retired the side in order in the second, but walked Henderson to 
start the third. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out, Olerud made it 3-0 when he hit Johnson's 2-2 pitch  
over the right-field fence, the first left-hander to hit a homer 
off the Big Unit since Jim Edmonds did it twice on Sept. 23, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona cut the lead to 3-1 in the third when Womack tripled to  
deep left field, then scored on Jay Bell's sacrifice fly. Ventura 
led off the fourth with a double, moved to second on Shawon 
Dunston's bunt single and scored on a sacrifice bunt by Rey Ordonez 
to make it 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Durazo, who started the season in Double-A El Paso but became  
Arizona's starting first baseman in July, made it 4-2 with a solo 
homer in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell led off the sixth with a single, then Gonzalez hit a home  
run an estimated 452 feet into the right-field seats to tie it at 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was coming off what he has called his best season, when  
he struck out 364, fourth-most in baseball history, and led the 
National League in ERA at 2.48. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Valentine said Orel Hershiser likely will not start any  
games in the series. ... Henderson stole second twice. ... The Mets 
committed just 68 errors in the regular season, a major league 
record. ... Three of the first six hits off Johnson were by 
left-handed batters. ... Johnson threw 78 pitches in the first four 
innings. ... Williams saved a run with a diving stop on pitcher 
Masato Yoshii's grounder with a runner at second in the fourth 
inning. ... The 49,584 at the game made up the largest paid crowd 
in Bank One Ballpark's two-year history.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nuclear Industry Spotlighted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two nuclear accidents in less than a week  
halfway around the world came as America's nuclear industry has 
been largely free of embarrassments and, in fact, has successfully 
pushed for less federal regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The question looming among industry executives and federal  
regulators is whether the incidents in Japan and South Korea will 
have an impact on a U.S. industry that many believe already is in 
its twilight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shouldn't have any impact,'' insists Steve Kerrikas, a  
spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, the nuclear power 
industry trade group. ``For more than a decade now we have been 
achieving steady, consistent gains in safety and operating 
performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some industry watchdog groups say the events in Japan and  
South Korea -- though themselves very different -- sent ominous 
message and warnings about the safety of nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	``They reinforce the reality that the root cause of nuclear  
accidents is human error. It always has been and always will be,'' 
says Michael Mariotte, director of the Nuclear Information and 
Resources Service, a watchdog group often critical of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	He argues that the incidents, in which human error led to  
workers -- and in the case of Japan also the public -- being exposed 
to radiation, raises renewed questions about ``a nuclear culture 
that says we're not going to have any problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Japan incident at a nuclear fuel processing plant was by far  
the most serious. Errors by workers, who apparently fail to follow 
regulations, led to an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction at the 
plant, exposing dozens of people to radiation and forcing the 
evacuation of hundreds of others. Three workers were seriously 
injured from radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Korea, 22 workers were exposed to a small amount of  
radiation when radioactive water spilled while a pump valve was 
being repaired. The water was contained inside the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. nuclear safety officials are monitoring both incidents, but  
are most interested in the Japan ``criticality'' accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what impact it's going to have on any of the  
United States (fuel) plants. We're just going to look at what 
happened and if anything like it could happen here,'' said Mindey 
Landau, a spokeswoman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuclear experts noted that U.S. power plants are designed  
differently than the Korean plant, which is a Canadian ``Candu'' 
reactor. The incident in Japan involved apparent negligence in 
processing uranium much more highly enriched than the uranium 
processed for power reactors in U.S. fabrication plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some of the nuclear industry's critics suggest the  
Japanese case may raise questions as to whether the Japanese 
industry was adequately monitored by regulators, and to what extent 
industry should be trusted to self-regulate no matter what country 
it's in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until last week Japan and South Korea were considered nations  
with modern nuclear programs. You didn't see the U.S. nuclear 
industry looking down on these countries,'' said Mariotte. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japan and South Korea accidents came as the NRC is revamping  
the way it monitors and regulates the U.S. nuclear industry, making 
many changes that the industry for years has sought. While NRC 
officials insist that safety will not be compromised, some nuclear 
critics have voiced concern that the agency may end up relying too 
heavily on industry self-regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the change, less attention will be given to plants  
with good operating and safety record and NRC focus will be on 
specific areas of greatest risk to plant safety. The new system is 
being tested in a pilot program at nine power plants and may be 
expanded to all plants perhaps as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
	NRC and industry officials say the incidents in Japan and South  
Korea should not have any impact on the NRC's adoption of the 
planned regulatory changes. To equate the two, says Kerrikas, the 
industry spokesman, ``is to compare apples and oranges.''

<HEADLINE> Allsate To Close 4 Regional Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHBROOK, Ill. (AP) -- Allstate Corp. says efforts to make its  
property and casualty group more efficient are behind plans to 
close four of the division's 17 regional offices by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance giant said it will announce later this year how  
the 500 jobs involved will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The offices to be closed are in Kansas City, Kan.; Hudson, Ohio;  
Farmington, Conn.; and Orange, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The closings announced Tuesday are the first major initiative  
under Richard Cohen, who became head of Allstate Property and 
Casualty last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials say the closings are unrelated to a business  
review Allstate is undertaking after announcing that its 
third-quarter earnings will dip below Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate has said layoffs are among possible remedies it will  
seek to turn things around.

	Japanese PM Inspects Accident Site  
</P>
<P>
	TOKAIMURA, Japan (AP) -- Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi inspected  
the site of Japan's worst nuclear accident today as outrage swelled 
over growing evidence the accident was caused by a stunning -- and 
possibly criminal -- disregard of safety procedures. Obuchi visited 
Tokaimura, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo, as the investigation into 
the accident intensified with police raids on the 
uranium-processing plant and the Tokyo headquarters of the plant's 
operator, JCO Co. Authorities are searching for evidence of 
wrongdoing behind the Sept. 30 accident, which sent three workers 
to the hospital and forced the evacuation of surrounding homes. 

</P>
<P>
	Commuter Rail Crash Cause Unknown  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Investigators are likely to focus on driver error  
or signal failure as potential causes of the rush-hour train crash 
that killed at least 27 people and injured 160 near a west London 
rail station, newspapers reported today. Authorities have not 
commented on what might have caused yesterday morning's collision 
between two packed commuter trains. But newspapers said the probe 
would look first at whether the driver of the outbound train ran a 
red light near the station. Detailed tests also were being 
performed on signaling equipment. 

</P>
<P>
	Rains Continue in Mexico  
</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Forecasters said torrential rains in Mexico  
would continue without respite today. The rain has flooded rivers, 
caused dams to overflow and sent mudslides rolling over houses in 
central and eastern Mexico, killing at least 49 people. Officials 
said yesterday that more than 100,000 people had fled their homes 
ahead of the rising waters, which carried crocodiles into the 
streets of the Tabasco state capital, Villahermosa, where rivers 
were at a 40-year high.

	Chechnya Leader Declares Martial Law  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Chechnya's leader has declared martial law  
in the rebel republic in a bid to halt the advance of Russian 
troops, who were digging in today along a river north of Chechnya's 
capital, Grozny. The Russians say they've seized the northern third 
of Chechnya since entering the lawless territory last week in an 
effort to seal it off from the rest of Russia. The Russians today 
were fortifying positions on the northern bank of the Terek River, 
including a stronghold near the village of Chervlyonnaya, only 15 
miles northeast of Grozny.

	Expert Says Shots Fired at Davidians  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a view that is at odds with the FBI's  
position that none of its agents fired shots during the 1993 siege 
at the Branch Davidian compound, an expert hired by a House 
committee says he believes an agent did just that. That view was 
expressed by Carlos Ghigliott, an expert in thermal imaging and 
videotape analysis, in an interview published in today's editions 
of The Washington Post. ``I conclude that the FBI fired shots on 
that day,'' Ghigliotti told the Post in an interview.

	A Blow Against Evolution in Ky.  
</P>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- The word ``evolution'' has been deleted  
from guidelines of what Kentucky public school students should know 
and be tested on, the latest blow to a topic many scientists 
consider a cornerstone of biology. State Education Department 
officials substituted ``change over time'' for evolution during a 
last-minute editing session, said Associate Education Commissioner 
Linda Houghton. She cited state ``testing sensitivity'' guidelines, 
designed to keep children from taking a position on subjects such 
as death, divorce and animal rights.

	Asarco Accepts Phelps Dodge Buyout  
</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Asarco Inc. has accepted a sweetened buyout offer  
from Phelps Dodge Corp., setting up a three-way, $2.9 billion deal 
that will make Phelps Dodge the world's largest copper producer. 
Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. accepted a similar offer last week, 
breaking away from what had been the Englewood, Colo.-based 
company's plan to merge with New York-based Asarco. With Asarco's 
acceptance late last night, the deal merges three of the country's 
four largest copper companies.

	Tokyo Share Prices Higher  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices rose moderately today. The  
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 112.27 points to 
close at 17,896.42. In New York yesterday, the Dow ended 0.64 lower 
at 10,400.59 after the Federal Reserve decided against raising 
interest rates but left open the possibility of a third rate hike 
later this year. 

</P>
<P>
	Mets, Yankees, Astros Win  
</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The New York Mets beat Randy Johnson and the  
Arizona Diamondbacks 8-4 in the opener of their NL division series 
last night. Edgardo Alfonzo homered off Johnson in the first 
inning, then won the game with a grand slam off reliever Bobby 
Chouinard in the ninth. In other playoff openers, Houston beat 
Atlanta 6-1 in the NL and the New York Yankees defeated Texas 8-0 
in the AL.

<HEADLINE> Study: Obesity Can Shorten Lifespan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A study of more than 1 million Americans provides the most  
convincing evidence yet that simply being overweight can cut your 
life short. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, the largest ever done on obesity and mortality, found  
that overweight people run a higher rate of premature death. And 
this was true even among people who didn't smoke and were otherwise 
healthy during their middle years. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was conducted by the American Cancer Society and  
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	It settles once and for all any lingering questions about  
whether weight alone increases the risk of death and disease, said 
Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Harvard University endocrinologist and 
preventive-health specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence is now compelling and irrefutable,'' Manson said.  
``Obesity is probably the second-leading preventable cause of death 
in the United States after cigarette smoking, so it is a very 
serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study found an especially clear association between excess  
weight and a higher risk of dying from heart disease or cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike a similar study last year that suggested being  
overweight is less of a problem as people grow older, this study 
found many more deaths among overweight people of all ages, 
especially those over 75. 
</P>
<P>
	More adults and children are overweight than ever before, with  
55 percent of American adults weighing more than they should. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is we're too fat and it's killing us. We need to  
come up with ways as a society to eat less and exercise more,'' 
said American Cancer Society epidemiologist Eugenia Calle, lead 
author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson said: ``It's going to take a coordinated campaign to turn  
this around, at the community level, at the environmental level, 
with changes in the food industry and marketing industry, having 
more bike paths and sidewalks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black women were found to be the only exceptions to the rule.  
The study found the most obese black women did not have a 
significantly higher risk of premature death than slender black 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	That poses a fascinating scientific riddle, said June Stevens, a  
University of North Carolina professor of nutrition. ``Although I 
had seen this in several other studies, I wasn't ready to believe 
it was true,'' she said. ``Now I'm thinking maybe this is true, and 
we need to figure out why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Stevens and Manson said the study probably understates  
the risks of obesity for black women. 
</P>
<P>
	They pointed out that slender, non-smoking black women have a  
higher risk of death to begin with than their white counterparts, 
probably because they have less access to health care than white 
women and more undetected disease. That makes it appear that weight 
alone doesn't play a big role in death rates among black women. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be really unfortunate if we became more complacent  
about obesity in blacks than in whites,'' Manson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied participants in the national Cancer  
Prevention Study II from 1982 through 1996. The average age at 
enrollment was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers calculated each subject's body mass index, or  
BMI, a ratio of weight to height, and tracked them for age and 
cause of death. The results were adjusted for age, education, 
physical activity, alcohol use, marital status, use of aspirin as a 
blood-thinner, consumption of fats and vegetables, and use of 
estrogen supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	Among healthy, non-smoking white men and women and black men,  
the researchers found a gradually increasing risk of death 
beginning with a BMI of 25, which is 150 pounds for a 5-foot-5 
woman and 174 pounds for a 5-foot-10 man. 
</P>
<P>
	The fattest white men, with a BMI of 40 or more -- 278 pounds on  
a 5-foot-10 frame -- were 2.58 times more likely to die than their 
healthiest peers, men of the same height weighing 153 to 170 
pounds. White women with a BMI of 40 or greater -- 240 pounds for a 
5-foot-5 woman -- were twice as likely to die as their counterparts 
who weighed 132 to 148 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Thin men and women also had higher death rates, but it was not  
clear whether their low weight was a cause or an effect of disease.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Loses Case Over $7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. government prosecuted a lunchroom  
cashier over $7 -- and lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Williams, 51, was accused of putting money from a customer  
in her pants pocket last March while working at the Veterans 
Affairs Medical Center in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Williams, who had worked in the cafeteria for four years,  
denied the theft. She said her pocket contained a $5 bill and two 
$1 bills, change from the $10 bill she had used to buy breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal police confiscated the money, cited her and wrote Mrs.  
Williams a $25 ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The customer told police he had given Mrs. Williams seven  
crumpled $1 bills for his breakfast -- not a $5 bill and two $1 
bills -- and Mrs. Williams, who lost her job, decided to take the 
charge to court. Testimony, featuring five government witnesses, 
lasted one day. 
</P>
<P>
	The turning point came when federal Detective Robert Hetner  
revealed what he found in Mrs. Williams's register. ``In the single 
($1 bill) slot, there were seven crumpled-up singles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ruled in Mrs. Williams' favor on Sept. 15 before the  
defense attorney could make his closing argument. He ordered the 
court clerk to return Mrs. Williams' $7, and she said she hopes to 
get her job back.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 8, Rangers 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe the New York Yankees are as good as they  
were last year after all. 
</P>
<P>
	And maybe the Texas Rangers won't ever beat them in the playoffs  
-- or even score another run against them. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Orlando Hernandez pitched and Bernie Williams hit in the  
opener, it sure looks like the Yankees will finish off the Rangers 
pretty quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Again.  
</P>
<P>
	``What happened tonight was the exception rather than the  
rule,'' Williams said Tuesday night after his six RBIs helped New 
York to an 8-0 win in the opener of the best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Bernie, when the Yankees play the Rangers, it is the  
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas is scoreless in its last 22 innings in the playoffs and  
has one run in its last 42 postseason innings in the playoffs, all 
against the Yankees. The Rangers have lost seven straight 
postseason games since beating the Yankees in the their first one, 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care Yankee Stadium, Yellowstone Park, it doesn't  
matter. We can score more runs than this by accident,'' Rangers 
manager Johnny Oates said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez allowed two hits in eight innings, improving to 3-0  
with an 0.41 ERA in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always pitch well with pressure,'' he said. ``I like to have  
pressure when I pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas mounted its best threat in the first inning, loading the  
bases on a one-out double by Ivan Rodriguez and walks to Rusty 
Greer and Rafael Palmeiro. But Hernandez got out of it by striking 
out Todd Zeile to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Hernandez allowed only a single by Rodriguez in the  
third. 
</P>
<P>
	It was reminiscent of his first playoff start, when the Yankees  
were trailing Cleveland 2 games to 1 in last year's championship 
series. ``El Duque'' got into a two-out jam in the first, retired 
Jim Thome on a flyout to the right-field warning track, then 
blanked the Indians through seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in control,'' catcher Jorge Posada said. ``Everything  
was low in the zone. The fastball was jumping out of his hand. 
Today he was very intense, very aggressive. He was awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Yankees pitchers are against Texas in the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, New York came off its record 114-48 regular season  
and held the Rangers to one run and a .141 average in a three-game 
sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the Yankees' record slipped a league-high 16 wins to  
98-64, creating doubt whether they were strong enough to win their 
third Series title in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez used breaking pitches to baffle the Rangers, who led  
the AL in hitting for the second straight season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all great hitters,'' he said through a translator.  
``Luck was on my side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, meanwhile, showed why the Yankees paid $87.5 million  
to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
	New York took a 1-0 lead in the second against loser Aaron Sele  
when Greer lost Ricky Ledee's curving liner to left field in the 
lights, turning it into an RBI double. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams then hit a two-run double off Sele in the fifth, a  
three-run homer off Mike Venafro in the sixth and an RBI single off 
Jeff Fassero in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to have a terrible night,'' Williams  
said. ``I was sleepy and dragging a little bit and it was cold. 
Something happened when they said the lineups. Something inside of 
me just woke up, said it's time to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 0-for-11 against Texas in last year's playoffs,  
started slowly, with a groundout in the first. He wasn't happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said you just got to go out and play hard, you got to wake  
up. This is the postseason. This is not the regular season 
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also made a sliding catch of Juan Gonzalez's liner to center  
field with two on in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I had a shot at it,'' Williams said. ``At the  
last minute, the ball stayed up longer than I had anticipated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a day off, the series resumes at Yankee Stadium on  
Thursday, with Andy Pettitte (14-11) pitching for New York against 
Rick Helling (13-11). 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play better than this,'' Sele said. ``We have to  
pitch better, hit better and field better to beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Texas has about 2,000 tickets remaining for Game 3 on  
Saturday, nearly all obstructed views, and about 6,000 remaining 
for Game 4 on Sunday. ... Williams has a record 17 RBIs in the 
first round, three more than O'Neill's prior mark. ... Yankees 
bench coach Don Zimmer sustained cuts to the left jaw and ear when 
he was hit by Chuck Knoblauch's foul ball. ... New York has won 
five straight postseason openers. The Yankees have won eight 
postseason games in a row, starting with Hernandez's win over 
Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> Why Matthews Not McNown Is Starting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Shane Matthews walked off the field  
after throwing his second interception in the third quarter with 
his head down, a chorus of boos ringing in his ears. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bears were trailing, and Matthews was playing like a  
journeyman veteran who'd been cut four times. This was exactly why 
fans were clamoring for rookie Cade McNown. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the last 1:48, Matthews led the Bears on a comeback  
worthy of John Elway and Brett Favre. Calling his own plays, he 
threw two touchdown passes and gave the Bears a 14-10 upset over 
former coach Mike Ditka and the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	This is why Matthews, not McNown, is starting.  
</P>
<P>
	``At the critical part of the game, he really came through for  
us. He puts us in the right situations, and he makes the right 
calls,'' coach Dick Jauron said. ``Shane has played very well for 
us, well enough so we could be sitting here with four wins. The 
fact is, we're 2-2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Bears cut Erik Kramer two days before training camp,  
most fans figured Matthews would only baby-sit the starter's job 
until McNown, the $22 million quarterback of the future, was ready. 
By the time training camp ended, Matthews surely would be relegated 
to the No. 2 spot. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jauron had a different idea. McNown, who was still trying to  
catch up from his holdout, wasn't ready to start when the season 
began. Matthews, despite his lack of success in the past, was. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than risk bringing McNown along too fast -- remember Ryan  
Leaf? -- Jauron came up with an unusual arrangement. Matthews would 
start and play most of the game. McNown would go in for at least a 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shane's our guy,'' Jauron said. ``We said he's going to get  
the vast majority of the plays, and he's going to get them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So even though Matthews was dismal for most of Sunday's game,  
Jauron didn't consider taking him out. Not even after Matthews 
threw the second interception, the fourth turnover in as many 
drives for the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to pull him out,'' Jauron said. ``We don't  
want him looking over his shoulder, wondering, `If I don't perform 
on this drive, on this play, am I coming out?' We don't want that 
to happen. We'll stick with our plan and we'll reevaluate it as we 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews rewarded Jauron's faith in him, going 12-of-14 in the  
last two drives and finding Curtis Conway on scoring passes of 22 
and 6 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still kind of hard to believe we won that game. We  
believed in one another that we could get it done, but to score two 
touchdowns in under 1:48 is pretty miraculous,'' Matthews said. ``I 
had played poorly most of the game, but we came together as an 
offensive unit and put it together when we needed to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's more to Matthews than those last two scoring drives,  
too. He's 92-of-149 (61.7 percent) in four games, a better 
completion rate than Favre, Troy Aikman and Steve Young. He's 
thrown for 859 yards and six touchdowns. His 82.6 quarterback 
rating is seventh-best in the NFC -- better than Favre and Young. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, meanwhile, is 10-for-20 this season with a 68.5  
quarterback rating. The offense hasn't scored a touchdown in his 
five series, though he did lead the Bears to a field goal in the 
season opener against Kansas City.

<HEADLINE> Mets 8, Diamondbacks 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Edgardo Alfonzo ruined Randy Johnson at the start  
and buried the Arizona Diamondbacks at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo, who had a solo home run in the first inning, hit a  
grand slam with two outs in the ninth off reliever Bobby Chouinard 
as the New York Mets beat the Diamondbacks 8-4 Tuesday night in the 
opener of their NL playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last few years, Edgardo Alfonzo has been a fabulous  
baseball player who has kind of a star quality,'' said Mets manager 
Bobby Valentine, in a playoff game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's improving. He's gaining confidence, and with  
confidence you get performances like you saw tonight,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who left the game with the bases loaded and one out in  
the ninth, lost his sixth straight postseason decision, a major 
league record. He struck out 11 and held on through an exhausting 
138 pitches as Arizona rallied from a 4-1 deficit to tie it at 4. 
</P>
<P>
	John Olerud became the first left-handed batter to hit a homer  
off Johnson in two years with his two-run shot in the third that 
made it 3-0. Olerud and the Mets' other left-hander in the lineup 
each had two hits off Johnson, who usually dominates lefties. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys came out swinging. I thought they were just great  
at-bats tonight,'' Valentine said. ``We got four hits left-handed, 
and that's determination. That's reaching down and wanting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks rallied on home runs by Erubiel Durazo and Luis  
Gonzalez to make it 4-all. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson settled down to pitch four hitless innings, but another  
lefty, Robin Ventura, led off the ninth with a single. With one 
out, Rey Ordonez singled, then Johnson walked Melvin Mora to load 
the bases and bring on Chouinard. 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman Matt Williams made a diving stop, his second of  
the game, on Rickey Henderson's grounder, and threw home to force 
out Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alfonzo hit Chouinard's 3-1 pitch just inside the left-field  
foul pole for the grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona manager Buck Showalter said he felt it was right to  
leave Johnson in the game, even though the big left-hander had said 
he was getting close to running out of gas. He said he used 
Chouinard because he'd been one of the best relievers this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we could have figured out a way to keep Alfonzo in the  
park, then maybe we could have had some fun in the ninth inning,'' 
Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, whose postseason record fell to 2-6, allowed seven runs  
on eight hits. Turk Wendell pitched one inning and was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if it was a foul or fair ball,'' Alfonzo said.  
``I stayed at home plate, going, `C'mon, c'mon.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson now is in sole possession of the longest postseason  
losing streak by a pitcher. Joe Bush (1914-23) and Doyle Anderson 
(1973-87) both lost five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy Johnson is one of the best pitchers in baseball right  
now,'' Alfonzo said. ``You have to be patient and wait for a pitch 
to hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the seventh, Johnson doubled for his first postseason hit.  
But he was doubled up when took off running on Tony Womack's 
one-out fly ball to left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets showed no sign of being emotionally spent despite an  
overnight flight from their 5-0 wild-card playoff victory Monday 
night at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out in the first, Alfonzo, who had 27 homers in the  
regular season, hit Johnson's 0-2 pitch over the left-center field 
wall. On Monday night, Alfonzo also homered in the first inning the 
previous day against the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud and Mike Piazza followed with singles before Johnson  
struck out Benny Agbayani and Ventura to end the inning. Johnson 
retired the side in order in the second, but walked Henderson to 
start the third. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out, Olerud made it 3-0 when he hit Johnson's 2-2 pitch  
over the right-field fence, the first left-hander to hit a homer 
off the Big Unit since Jim Edmonds did it twice on Sept. 23, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona cut the lead to 3-1 in the third when Womack tripled to  
deep left field, then scored on Jay Bell's sacrifice fly. Ventura 
led off the fourth with a double, moved to second on Shawon 
Dunston's bunt single and scored on a sacrifice bunt by Rey Ordonez 
to make it 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Durazo, who started the season in Double-A El Paso but became  
Arizona's starting first baseman in July, made it 4-2 with a solo 
homer in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell led off the sixth with a single, then Gonzalez hit a home  
run an estimated 452 feet into the right-field seats to tie it at 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was coming off what he has called his best season, when  
he struck out 364, fourth-most in baseball history, and led the 
National League in ERA at 2.48. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Valentine said Orel Hershiser likely will not start any  
games in the series. ... Henderson stole second twice. ... The Mets 
committed just 68 errors in the regular season, a major league 
record. ... Three of the first six hits off Johnson were by 
left-handed batters. ... Johnson threw 78 pitches in the first four 
innings. ... Williams saved a run with a diving stop on pitcher 
Masato Yoshii's grounder with a runner at second in the fourth 
inning. ... The 49,584 at the game made up the largest paid crowd 
in Bank One Ballpark's two-year history.

<HEADLINE> John Prine Makes Duets Album </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- John Prine is about as glamorous as your  
local bartender, and probably has about the same vocal range. He's 
a regular guy, singing for other regular guys. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's Prine singing the praises of a woman:  
</P>
<P>
	``She looks down her nose at money  
</P>
<P>
	``She gets it on like the Easter Bunny.''  
</P>
<P>
	Duet partner Iris DeMent answers sassily:  
</P>
<P>
	``He ain't real sharp but he gets things done  
</P>
<P>
	``He drinks his beer like it's oxygen.''  
</P>
<P>
	Titled ``In Spite of Ourselves,'' the song was written for the  
upcoming Billy Bob Thornton movie, ``Daddy and Them,'' in which 
Prine plays the brother of Thornton's character. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also the title song of the songwriter's album of duets  
about the ups and downs of love -- or , as Prine calls it, 
``meetin', cheatin' and retreatin'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's nothing on the album -- Prine's first since ``Live on  
Tour'' in 1997 -- alluding to the personal trauma he endured while 
making it. 
</P>
<P>
	Prine discovered a lump in his neck while shaving and a biopsy  
showed it was cancerous. He had the tumor removed late in 1997 and 
underwent radiation treatments. So far, the cancer has not 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Prine, who turns 53 Oct. 10, said the experience made him more  
appreciative of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shined a light on everything for me,'' he said. ``I would  
hate to go through that again ... but I got to say that everything 
that has come out of it has been good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Prine, whose catalog of songs includes ``Sam Stone'' and  
``Hello in There,'' is back performing live after a two-year break. 
DeMent is touring with him, performing the four songs she sings on 
``In Spite of Ourselves'' and other duets sung on the album by 
Emmylou Harris, Trisha Yearwood, Patty Loveless, Connie Smith, 
Lucinda Williams, Melba Montgomery, Dolores Keane and Prine's wife, 
Fiona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a big long list of my favorite girl singers, with a  
slant towards country,'' Prine said. ``The first nine girls I 
called, they all said yes, which I didn't expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prine made his reputation on songs that find humor in life's  
little inconveniences, absurdities or pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1971 debut album, ``John Prine,'' is still his best, with  
standards like ``Angel From Montgomery.'' ``The Missing Years,'' 
released two decades later, was nearly as good and won a Grammy. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Spite of Ourselves'' is Prine's first overtly country  
album. Though he's lived in Nashville for years and has often used 
country instrumentation on his records, he is more often grouped 
with the singer-songwriter movement of the 1970s, when he came of 
age along with James Taylor and Steve Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Since it takes three or four years for him to write an album of  
original songs -- his last was in 1995 -- Prine decided to do an 
album of vintage country music duets. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a way to get a record out more quickly, and have some  
fun. He searched for songs at the Ernest Tubb Record Shop in 
downtown Nashville, which carries out-of-print country music 
albums. 
</P>
<P>
	``Old country music must have taken a surge in popularity, just  
in what I bought last year,'' Prine said. ``Sometimes I had to buy 
cassettes because it wasn't available on anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, Prine unearthed some long-forgotten tunes, like  
``Let's Invite Them Over,'' an ode to wife-swapping written by Onie 
Wheeler and a No. 17 hit for George Jones and Melba Montgomery in 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
	The album was delayed when Prine was sidelined by cancer. He  
considered non-surgical treatments, but his friend, Sam Phillips, 
got wind of the situation and intervened. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, the legendary Memphis producer who discovered Elvis  
Presley, steered Prine to the Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, 
where his son Knox Phillips had been treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sam wouldn't have it any other way,'' Prine said. ``He talked  
to me and talked to me. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors there told Prine that had the cancer been found six  
months later, it probably would have been fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prine said he's thankful for the second chance he's been given  
for numerous reasons: his children, who are just 3 and 4 years old, 
his wife, and even his ``great little band.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The album, he said, has been a pet project of his for years.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now I'm sitting here talking about it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``So everything is going along just the way I want it to right  
now.''

<HEADLINE> Agassi To Play in Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Andre Agassi will play in the Davis  
Cup, after all. 
</P>
<P>
	After having vowed never to play again, Agassi, the world's No.  
1 player, decided to return to the U.S. team, saying Wednesday he 
would play in the first round in February. 
</P>
<P>
	With Pete Sampras still injured and uncertain to be available,  
Agassi will anchor American hopes to reclaim the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, Agassi said he would never again participate in  
Davis Cup competition after friend and team doctor George Fareed 
was dropped from the squad. 
</P>
<P>
	But Agassi changed his mind after John McEnroe became captain.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be the best captain ever so far,''  
Agassi said at the Swiss Indoors. ``He'll help a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll bring a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of energy, a lot of  
experience. It's an advantage to have someone on your team with 
this kind of fighting spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe played on 12 Davis Cup teams, including five champions.  
He still holds six U.S. Davis Cup records and compiled an overall 
record of 59-10. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't just McEnroe's Davis Cup prowess which swayed  
Agassi, it also was the fact the U.S. Tennis Association allowed 
the team to have some say in the choice of captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me the most important thing was how the decision was made  
so the players had say-so in some of the more important areas such 
as who the captain is,'' Agassi said. ``And I know with John the 
team will always make decisions as a unit, which is something you 
always hope for in the Davis Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding speculation McEnroe might play in the Davis Cup  
doubles matches, Agassi was diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's addicted to competition,'' Agassi said, laughing. ``It  
would be a new thing for a coach to be a player, but John is 
objective enough to have the best team out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In deciding to return to Davis Cup competition, Agassi  
overlooked his differences with the U.S. Tennis Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw for the 2000 Davis Cup competition will be Thursday in  
London. The United States will then learn its first-round opponent 
for competition Feb. 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is one of eight seeded teams. The others are  
Germany, Britain, Spain, Australia, France, Russia and Slovakia. 
The Americans will face one of the eight non-seeded countries: 
Austria, Czech Republic, Italy, Netherlands, Zimbabwe, Belgium, 
Brazil or Switzerland.

	Today is Thursday, Oct. 7, the 280th day of 1999. There are 85  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 7, 1849, author Edgar Allan Poe died in Baltimore at age  
40. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1765, the Stamp Act Congress convened in New York to draw up  
colonial grievances against England. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1777, the second Battle of Saratoga began during the American  
Revolution. (British forces under General John Burgoyne surrendered 
10 days later.) 
</P>
<P>
	In 1949, the Republic of East Germany was formed.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1954, Marian Anderson became the first black singer hired by  
the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, President Kennedy signed the documents of ratification  
for a nuclear test ban treaty with Britain and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, the Motion Picture Association of America adopted its  
film-rating system. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, Pope John Paul II concluded a week-long tour of the  
United States with a Mass on the Mall in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, Egypt's parliament named Vice President Hosni Mubarak  
to succeed the assassinated Anwar Sadat. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice musical ``Cats,''  
featuring the popular song ``Memory,'' opened on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Palestinian gunmen hijacked the Italian cruise ship  
Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean with more than 400 people 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: Hungary's Communist Party renounced Marxism in  
favor of democratic socialism during a party congress in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: President Clinton ordered Army troops on alert  
and dispatched an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf after Iraqi 
troops were spotted moving south toward Kuwait. At an East Room 
news conference, Clinton expressed frustration over failures in his 
legislative agenda, blaming Republicans for ``trying to stop it, 
slow it, kill it or just talk it to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Matthew Shepard, a gay college student at the  
University of Wyoming, was beaten, robbed and left tied to a wooden 
fence post outside of Laramie; he died five days later. (Russell 
Henderson later pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping; a second 
suspect, Aaron McKinney, has yet to stand trial.) The Justice 
Department sued Visa and MasterCard, the nation's largest credit 
card networks, on grounds they were restraining competition and 
limiting consumer choice.

<HEADLINE> Bubby's Back as Broncos' Starter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Adrift without a victory and hoping to save their  
season, the champion Denver Broncos on Wednesday switched 
quarterbacks for the second time in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	They benched Brian Griese and promoted Bubby Brister to starter.  
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that we're 0-4 and something needs to change,''  
Griese said Wednesday. ``Whether that blame comes to me, that's 
fine. I can handle it. I'm not going to let any of this get me 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Shanahan said Brister ``gives us the best chance to  
win now. We're not playing for the future. We're trying to do the 
best we can right now and obviously trying to find a way to win a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is, what can we do to give us the best chance to  
get out of this slump?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Brister will start Sunday at Oakland, with  
Griese No. 2 and veteran Chris Miller remaining No. 3. Brister 
hasn't started more than eight games in a season since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited about having the opportunity to be back and be the  
starter and maybe help us get back on track,'' Brister said. ``But 
I will say this: It's not one guy's fault. Brian played hard but 
had some unfortunate things happen. We all have to play better and 
coach better to get back on track. Hopefully, I can make a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Howard Griffith said the big difference between the  
quarterbacks is that Brister has won in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this league, it's all about wins and losses,'' he said.  
``Right now, Brian hasn't won any games for us, but that doesn't 
mean we have lost confidence in him. He's not the sole reason we 
have lost games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, who went 4-0 as a starter in place of the injured John  
Elway last season, was deemed the heir apparent when Elway retired 
last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But, in a startling change of heart, Shanahan benched Brister on  
Aug. 30 after the fourth of five exhibition games and made the 
inexperienced Griese the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, who played poorly during preseason, protested. He said  
he was never told his job was on the line. Shanahan said he felt 
Griese gave the Broncos their best chance and Brister was better 
suited for providing a spark off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan changed his mind after the two-time defending Super  
Bowl champions failed in win in Griese's four regular-season 
starts. Along the way, the Broncos lost standout linebacker John 
Mobley and league MVP Terrell Davis to season-ending knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said Griese played well in the first half of Sunday's  
21-13 loss to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a chance to have four touchdown passes and 250-260  
yards in the first half,'' he said. ``But the bottom line is we 
didn't get it done. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you lose four games in a row, it's easy to blame it on a  
young quarterback. I think it's best for our team to take some of 
that pressure away from the quarterback position and disperse it 
among everybody on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Griese played solidly in the Broncos' opening  
38-21 loss to Miami, completing 24 of 40 passes for 270 yards and 
three touchdowns. But he struggled in the next two games and wound 
up with three interceptions in last week's loss to the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	He has completed 64 of 116 passes for 721 yards with four  
interceptions and five touchdowns for a rating of 67.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister has come off the bench in two games, completing 12 of 20  
passes for 87 yards with three interceptions for a rating of 30.6. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Brister's outburst following his benching, Shanahan  
said: ``I knew it was going to be tough on Bubby. I didn't expect 
it to be easy. I didn't expect him to blast me like he did, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at the same time, I understand that he's emotional. I care  
about him. He told me later that he overreacted. That's football, 
that's life. We go on.''

<HEADLINE> Astros Downed By Dominant Millwood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Despite a loss to a dominant Kevin Millwood, the  
Houston Astros headed home Wednesday feeling pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood held the Astros to one hit -- a solo home run by Ken  
Caminiti in the second inning -- and the Braves went on to a 5-1 win 
over Houston to knot the best-of-5 series at a game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	After dropping six of seven games to Atlanta during the regular  
season, the Astros go back to Houston all tied up. They won the 
opener 6-1 Tuesday on a tiebreaking homer by Daryle Ward and 
Caminiti's three-run shot in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going home even,'' Craig Biggio said. ``We came in here  
and got a split. We had an opportunity to go up 2-0, but the guy 
pitched an unbelievable game. There's no need to hang our heads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for the Astros confidence is the fact that since  
the opening round division series was initiated in 1995, no NL team 
has come back after losing the first game to win the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Games 3 and 4 are at the Astrodome on Friday and Saturday.  
Houston's Mike Hampton (22-4) takes on Tom Glavine (13-11). 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Lima, Houston's other 20-game winner, took the loss in the  
second game. He allowed four runs and nine hits in 6 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't complain. We played well and now we're going home,''  
Lima said. ``This is not over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lima, however, was upset that Atlanta manager Bobby Cox has  
asked the umpires to check out a dark spot on his uniform near his 
right thigh, questioning whether it was pine tar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's dirt, not pine tar,'' Lima said. ``I always see Biggio  
and (Jeff) Bagwell and Caminiti with dirt all over them and I just 
want dirt on my pants, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lima watched Cox at the postgame interview session which was  
shown on television the Astros clubhouse, say he asked the umpires 
to check him out before the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no clue what it was,'' Cox said. ``The last time he  
pitched against us, he didn't have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I did,'' Lima said to no one in particular as he watched.  
</P>
<P>
	The Astros, winners of the Central Division for the third  
straight season, were swept by the Braves in three games in 1997 
and lost in four games to San Diego last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, however, they've got the Braves, who have won a  
record eight straight division titles, at home and can win it 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to feel good,'' Bagwell said. ``We come out of here  
with a win and we've got our best pitcher going for us on Friday.''

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Former President Carter, who commuted Patty

Clinton to pardon the newspaper heiress. ``She's been a model 
citizen in every way,'' Carter told the Los Angeles Times in a 
story published Wednesday. ``The fact is she deserves the pardon. 
Her oldest daughter has just entered college. And all this time, 
Patty has not been able to vote, she's not been a full-fledged

<HEADLINE> Exhumations Bring Clues to '54 Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Forty-five years after her brutal death,  
Marilyn Sheppard's mummified remains still reveal clues about her 
mysterious killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sheppard's body, and that of the male fetus she was  
carrying at the time of her death in 1954, were exhumed Tuesday 
from a two-story mausoleum in a suburban Cleveland cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial tests show the beating that killed her was much more  
damaging to her face than previously thought. One scientist said 
they also debunked a theory that Mrs. Sheppard bit her attacker. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings could help prosecutors, who ordered the exhumation  
in a search for evidence to defend the state in a lawsuit brought 
by Mrs. Sheppard's son. The trial is scheduled to begin in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Reese Sheppard contends his father, Dr. Sam Sheppard, was  
wrongfully imprisoned for his mother's death. The doctor was jailed 
for 10 years before being acquitted at a retrial. He died in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard, 52, is suing the state to have his father declared  
innocent, a stronger legal statement than the ``not guilty'' 
verdict at his second criminal trial. Sheppard could collect an 
estimated $2 million if he wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Coroner Elizabeth Balraj extracted about 30 DNA samples each  
from Mrs. Sheppard and the fetus. Mrs. Sheppard's body also was 
X-rayed and photographed. Tests were completed Tuesday night, and 
the bodies were reinterred this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sheppard was beaten to death at the family's home on Lake  
Erie. Her husband maintained that a bushy-haired intruder killed 
his wife and then knocked him unconscious when ran to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Her death and the charge against her husband helped inspire  
``The Fugitive'' television series and movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we want to do is get to the truth as to the murder of  
Marilyn Sheppard,'' said prosecutor William Mason. ``Exhuming this 
body and doing these tests are going to help us solve some of the 
questions that have been lingering through these two trials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell Levine, forensic dentist with the New York State Police,  
said Tuesday that the injuries to Mrs. Sheppard's mouth indicated 
she didn't bite her assailant. ``It just didn't happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Mrs. Sheppard's teeth were broken during the attack.  
Forensic scientist Paul Leland Kirk, a defense witness at the 
retrial, had concluded that Mrs. Sheppard bit her attacker -- who 
then pulled the teeth out when he jerked his hand away. Her husband 
had no bite wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing also showed that the injuries to Mrs. Sheppard's  
face were much more extensive than expected, Mason said. The bones 
below her eye and around the mouth were detached from her face. 
</P>
<P>
	``The viewing was difficult but she was composed, she was  
together,'' Sheppard said after attending the exhumation. ``I 
needed to witness that because I learned long ago that in terms of 
her murder my imagination is worse than the real thing.''

<HEADLINE> Kidnappers Send Runner Into Hiding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The terrifying phone call from home came shortly after Ronaldo  
da Costa arrived in Rio de Janeiro last month for a race. 
</P>
<P>
	Be careful, a friend warned the world-record holder in the  
marathon, the kidnappers are looking for you again. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the third time in two weeks kidnappers had come for  
him, and it was too much. Da Costa found his girlfriend, and they 
got on a flight for San Diego the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no time for the race, no time to go and say goodbye to  
his family and friends in Brazil. There wasn't even time to pack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand why,'' da Costa said Wednesday through an  
interpreter. ``I'm very innocent. I'm trying to do my job and 
somebody is trying to kidnap me. It is the biggest shock I've had. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm scared to go back to Brazil.''  
</P>
<P>
	Da Costa, who will race for the first time since the kidnapping  
attempts in the Chicago Marathon on Oct. 24, has lived a frenzied 
life since September 1998, when he won the Berlin Marathon in 
2:06.05. That time shattered Belayneh Densamo's record that had 
stood for 10 years by a full 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	He became an instant celebrity in Brazil, even being dubbed  
``Ronaldinho'' -- the little Ronaldo -- to distinguish him from 
soccer star Ronaldo. A Brazilian television crew flew to Berlin and 
accompanied him home, and then flew him by helicopter to his rural 
hometown of Descoberto. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters followed him wherever he went, and he was on  
television all the time. Fans were constantly asking for a picture 
or autograph. He even got stopped when he was training. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very likable person,'' said his agent, Luis Felipe  
Posso. ``We went to Monaco last November and after we checked into 
the hotel we went for a walk. There was a group of Brazilian 
tourists and everybody recognized him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While da Costa didn't mind his newfound fame, it carried an ugly  
undertone. Violence, fueled by drugs and high unemployment, has 
soared in Brazil in recent years, and da Costa was a natural 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, he was at his girlfriend's house when his friend  
called. Two big, strong-looking men had come to the gate at da 
Costa's house in the small town of Sao Joao Neponuceno asking for 
the runner. The next night, after midnight, three armed men came 
looking for da Costa. The police were called, but no arrests were 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	When the phone call came in Rio, da Costa knew he had to flee.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you have money in Brazil, it's not secure,'' da Costa said.  
</P>
<P>
	Added Posso, ``He didn't even bring training gear, that's how  
scared he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Da Costa was so shaken by the kidnapping attempts he withdrew  
from the Great North Run, a half-marathon this Sunday in Newcastle, 
England. He could barely think about running, let alone a race. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his girlfriend spent a week in San Diego, trying to  
digest what had happened and figure out what to do next. He thought 
about dropping out of the Chicago Marathon, even though the course 
sets up perfectly for him, fast and flat just like Berlin's. 
</P>
<P>
	But last week, he moved to Boulder, Colo., and started running  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind is clean and I'm ready to go,'' da Costa said. ``I  
think I can perform a good race, but I recognize I'm not in the 
same shape as I was before the kidnapping attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm focusing on training and doing my best,'' he added. ``I'm  
in very good mental shape, though my physical shape is 10 percent 
less than before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Da Costa is uncomfortable talking about the kidnapping attempts.  
Besides wanting to forget about them, he knows the suspects were 
never caught and he worries about the family he left in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	It's that lack of security that's convinced him to stay in the  
United States. No one bothers him there. He and his girlfriend can 
go out for pizza at night and be left alone. He can have a life 
again, just like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to stay here,'' he said. ``I have peace of mind.''

<HEADLINE> Dat You Miz Blue Wins at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dat You Miz Blue spotted the field several  
lengths at the break, then recovered and won the Belmont Park 
feature Wednesday just as a 2-5 shot should. 
</P>
<P>
	Rallying strongly to take the lead entering the stretch, the  
2-year-old filly, ridden by Jerry Bailey, drew away through the 
stretch under 114 pounds for a 10 1/4-length victory in the $54,900 
Joseph A. Gimma Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
        	Dat You Miz Blue racedseven furlongs in 1:25 15 on the fast 	
track to earn $32,940 for Landon Knight with her second win in four  
starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner returned $2.80, $2.60 and $2.10. Casting Cinema paid  
$18.60 and $5.80, and Bid's Femme was $4 for show.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `The Limey' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Don't even think about messing with Dave Wilson. Chain smoking  
and dressed in black, this brash British ex-con is on a mission: 
Trek to Los Angeles and find his daughter's killer. 
</P>
<P>
	He rocks L.A. like an earthquake in ``The Limey.'' Director  
Steven Soderbergh, who created the independent smash ``sex, lies 
and videotape'' a decade ago, again offers an edgy, hip film with a 
terrific cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh from a nine-year prison term for one of his many  
white-collar schemes, Wilson (Terence Stamp) learns his estranged 
daughter, Jenny, has died in an explosive car crash in Los Angeles. 
The young woman moved there from England with dreams of stardom, 
and instead frolicked with record producer Terry Valentine (Peter 
Fonda). 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson thinks Jenny's death was no accident, and when he tracks  
down Valentine, he has all the more reason for suspicion. Tanned 
and trim with a blinding smile, Valentine reigns comfortably from 
his modern mansion in the Hollywood Hills, letting his tattooed 
thugs do his drug running on the streets below. 
</P>
<P>
	Soderbergh's Los Angeles isn't the sun-dappled, palm-tree-lined  
paradise so often depicted in films. It's smoggy, bleak and gray, 
full of sleazy people doing bad things. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson doesn't hesitate to sink to their level -- beating a few  
guys up, running their cars off the road, even firing a few rounds 
when necessary. But he finds a few decent souls, mostly actors and 
wannabes, who befriended Jenny and knew her in a way he never did. 
They help Wilson in his obsessive quest and hurtle along with him 
toward the film's surprising climax. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of what makes ``The Limey'' so sharp is how it plays with  
time and narrative structure in a stylish way, similar to ``Go'' 
and, before that, ``Pulp Fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's quite an ambitious approach, really. We see Wilson start  
telling a story in a coffee shop. All of a sudden, he's riding in a 
car at night. Seconds later, he's sitting in a modest motel room. 
Giant chunks of time seem to have flown by on screen, but the story 
he's telling stays intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Soderbergh's dreamlike, stream-of-consciousness directing style  
also is intriguing. As Wilson talks about the daughter he barely 
knew, grainy, black-and-white memories flash into the present-day 
action: Jenny playing with sand on the beach; flashing an impish 
grin; threatening to call the police to report his latest offense. 
We're right inside Wilson's head. 
</P>
<P>
	But Soderbergh at times relies on these techniques too heavily,  
making simple, linear storytelling seem really appealing only once 
in a while. 
</P>
<P>
	The cast is always strong, however. As the title character,  
Stamp is a man to be cheered and detested at the same time. He's a 
criminal to the core, but his sense of justice almost makes him 
noble. He was never there for his daughter when she was alive -- 
perhaps he can makes amends by avenging her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Fonda is in top form as Valentine, and there are lots of clever  
1960s references to remind us of his ``Easy Rider'' days. His 
character ranges from breezy arrogance to melancholy longing, as he 
clearly yearns for his high-flying youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Lesley Ann Warren is the lone source of peace and stability in  
the movie, playing an acting coach and former soap star who was a 
mother figure to Jenny. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the best moments come from a series of well-written  
scenes in which supporting characters banter about absolutely 
nothing. One of them features a hit-man heckling child actors on 
the set of a commercial. They provide a chorus of comic relief amid 
the intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Limey,'' an Artisan Entertainment release, was written by  
Lem Dobbs (``Romancing the Stone,'' ``Kafka''). It is rated R for 
strong language and violence and runs 87 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Object to WorldCom Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc.'s bold $115 billion plan to  
take over Sprint Corp. and unite the nation's second- and 
third-largest long-distance companies met immediate resistance from 
a top federal regulator who asked ``How can this be good for 
consumers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom and Sprint, however, insist their deal, the richest  
corporate buyout ever, would strengthen competition across the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	WorldCom, as the combined company will be known, could offer  
customers local and long-distance service, as well as mobile phone, 
paging and Internet products, all for one, flat-rate monthly fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators, however, point to WorldCom's control of 36 percent  
of the $110 billion U.S. long-distance market, second only to AT&AMP;T 
Corp.'s 43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competition has produced a price war in the long-distance  
market. This merger appears to be a surrender,'' William E. 
Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said the companies ``will bear a heavy burden to show  
how consumers would be better off'' as a result of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to FCC approval, the deal also faces antitrust  
scrutiny from the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	His concerns were echoed by consumer groups and rival Baby Bell  
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The static coming out of Washington had many people, including  
investors, wondering if the deal would fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's shares unexpectedly fell $2 to $58.87 1/2 Tuesday on the  
New York Stock Exchange, despite MCI WorldCom's offer of $76 a 
share in stock. MCI WorldCom's stock slumped $3.68 3/4 to $67.93 3/4 a 
share on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard J. Ebbers, president and chief executive of MCI  
WorldCom, defended his deal during a New York news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understood from day one it is our burden of proof to show  
this is pro-competitive,'' he said. ``The chairman (of the FCC) 
told us he would keep an open mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The long-distance market in the United States is expected to get  
new entrants as Baby Bells, such as Bell Atlantic Corp., get the 
green light from regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to promote  
competition in local and long-distance markets and cable 
television. But in the past three years, new technology has changed 
the competitive landscape, and started a wave of mergers and 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can now make a telephone call that is carried over the  
Internet, receive e-mail messages over their wireless phones and 
watch movies on their computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like many of the recent events in our industry, this merger  
would have seemed improbable a few years ago,'' Ebbers said. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom topped a competing $100 billion offer from  
BellSouth Corp. to win control of Sprint. MCI WorldCom, based in 
Clinton, Miss., sweetened its offer rather than risk losing 
Sprint's 4 million wireless customers and 1.7 million paging 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebbers, 58, will be president and chief executive of the new  
WorldCom. William T. Esrey, 59, chairman and chief executive of 
Kansas City, Mo.-based Sprint, will be chairman of WorldCom.

<P>
	For Ebbers, it is the second stunning takeover in two years. His  
upstart WorldCom acquired what was then MCI Communications in 1998, 
beating out foreign rival British Telecommunications PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's deal is structured so that Sprint shareholders will  
get $76 worth in MCI WorldCom's stock for each Sprint share as long 
as MCI WorldCom shares trade between $62.15 and $80.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of Sprint PCS, the stock that tracks the  
performance of Sprint's wireless business, will exchange their 
shares, on a 1-for-1 basis, for shares in WorldCom PCS. They also 
will receive 0.1547 of a share of MCI WorldCom stock, worth $10.51, 
based on Tuesday's closing price. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom also will assume $14 billion in Sprint debt and  
preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom will have 10 seats on the board of the new company,  
while Sprint will have six. The companies hope to complete the deal 
in the second half of next year.

<HEADLINE> UAW Sets Deadline for Ford Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- For the first time since contract talks began  
earlier this year between automakers and the United Auto Workers, a 
deadline to reach an agreement has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW on yesterday in effect set a strike deadline of 11:59  
p.m. EDT Friday against Ford Motor Co., saying it would not extend 
its contract beyond then -- a sign talks could be intensifying. The 
deadline was originally thought to be 3:30 p.m., but a review of 
the contract by both sides indicated the later time was the 
earliest a strike could be called. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Ford said the union made the decision and talks  
recessed for the day. Talks on a new contract to cover about 
100,000 employees were scheduled to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this is a normal part of the collective bargaining  
process,'' Ford spokesman Edward Miller said. ``Our negotiations 
are continuing in good faith, and we believe we can reach an 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW negotiated new contracts with DaimlerChrysler AG,  
General Motors Corp. and GM's former parts unit without setting a 
strike deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW President Stephen P. Yokich said earlier this week he  
expected Ford to accept the same contract terms the UAW agreed to 
with DaimlerChrysler AG and General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler workers ratified their agreement last month,  
while GM and Delphi workers are scheduled to finish voting by Oct. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the union, the four-year contracts with  
DaimlerChrysler, GM and Delphi Automotive Systems give workers an 
annual raise of 3 percent a year, a $1,350 signing bonus and 
improved cost of living adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also agreed not to spin off any division into a  
separate business or close or sell any factories. That clause was 
expected to create some problems for Ford, which has plans to spin 
off or sell its Visteon parts unit. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW leaders have been vigorously opposed to a spinoff of  
Visteon, which has about 23,500 UAW members, saying it could lead 
to pay cuts, plant closures and fewer union jobs. During the Labor 
Day parade in Detroit, many marchers carried signs depicting 
Visteon as ``the alien within'' Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	One labor expert said it wasn't clear whether the union was  
upset with Ford or simply wanted to speed talks along. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's out of character for what they've been doing,'' said Dale  
Brickner, an emeritus professor at Michigan State University. ``It 
could be a threat that they don't find whatever offer they have on 
the table acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A strike at Ford would be a sharp reversal of the company's  
relations with the UAW. Ford was the lead company in negotiations 
in 1993 and 1996. The last time the union held a national strike 
against Ford was 1976 -- during contract negotiations.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Cable TV Chief Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T's risky plan to transform its cable TV  
systems into pipelines for phone calls and Internet services 
claimed its first casualty Wednesday with the abrupt resignation of 
Leo J. Hindery, the quarterback of the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	While AT&AMP;T was eager to stress that Hindery will stay on as an  
adviser, the company's failure to name an immediate successor as 
president and chief executive officer of its cable television 
business unit suggests he probably had some help with his decision 
to ``pursue other interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that they have a temporary replacement means that  
AT&AMP;T wasn't planning to replace him,'' said Rex G. Mitchell, an 
industry analyst at Banc of America Securities in San Francisco. If 
his departure had been amicable, ``they certainly would have let 
him stay on until they could find a replacement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there have been many possible sources of internal strife  
for AT&AMP;T executives in recent months, industry observers didn't 
view Hindery's departure as a major disruption in the company's 
cable strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's shares, which have been beaten down lately amid  
uncertainty over its plans, gained 3.6 percent Wednesday, rising 
$1.62 1/2 a share to $46.62 1/2 amid a powerful market rally. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is now undertaking the daunting and expensive task of  
upgrading its cable links to millions of homes. It is also fighting 
with America Online over the Internet service provider's demand 
that AT&AMP;T provide access to those high-speed cable lines. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also uncertainty over whether AT&AMP;T might decide to make  
a deal with AOL and then break up or sell ExciteAtHome, its own 
Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	Those troubles ``probably all play into'' Hindery's departure,  
said Mitchell. But, he added that ``the most likely reason may have 
been personality differences,'' noting that its not unusual to see 
relationships fail among executives thrown together by merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Hindery was president of Tele-Communications Inc., the first big  
cable company AT&AMP;T acquired in a $100 billion spending spree. 
Following the deal, Hindery was chosen to lead the company's 
formidable new cause, which also includes the pending acquisition 
of MediaOne Group, another big cable company. Once that deal 
closes, the nation's largest long-distance company will also be its 
largest cable company with 24 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging from their chummy public appearances, it seemed that  
Hindery and AT&AMP;T chief executive C. Michael Armstrong had a good 
rapport -- and perhaps they still do if he is really going to advise 
Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Adele Ambrose, a spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T, said Hindery's departure  
``was a mutual decision that has evolved over several months'' and 
denied that he had been forced out. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Armstrong said AT&AMP;T's plans to roll out new  
cable services remain on target, including offering phone service 
over cable lines in eight cities by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel E. Somers, chief financial officer of AT&AMP;T, will  
temporarily assume responsibility for AT&AMP;T's cable operations while 
a search begins for a permanent successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Alper, an analyst for Gomez Advisors in Concord, Mass.,  
downplayed the importance of Hindery's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be much more than a hiccup,'' Alper said. ``Armstrong  
and the people he's brought in -- and the approach they have taken 
in wanting to reinvent the Bell system -- they seem to have their 
act together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's biggest decision -- although not make or break -- may be  
whether to create an alliance with AOL -- alienating the 
ExciteAtHome online service that AT&AMP;T created through acquisitions 
and nurtured as a centerpiece of its cable strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, there have been conflicting signals from  
executives at ExciteAtHome and AT&AMP;T, including comments by Hindery, 
over the subsidiary's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, AT&AMP;T is going to have to decide if it will stay  
the course or bend to a new affiliate and embrace AOL,'' said 
Alper.

<HEADLINE> Depression, `Silent Stroke' Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- If you're over 50 and suffer from depression, you  
may have experienced a minor stroke without even realizing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say they have found a connection between depression  
and ``silent strokes,'' brain abnormalities that occur when small 
blood vessels in the brain become blocked or rupture. They're 
called silent because they lack classic stroke symptoms such as 
slurred speech, blindness and lack of motor skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we get older, the risk for stroke goes up,'' said Dr. David  
C. Steffens, the study's lead author and an associate professor of 
psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center. ``The same risk 
factors for stroke may be the risk factors for late-life 
depression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers studied 3,660 elderly people in 1993 in four  
communities -- Forsyth County, N.C.; Sacramento County, Calif.; 
Washington County, Md., and Pittsburgh. They released their 
findings Sept. 30 in Stroke, a journal of the American Heart 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors viewed the patients' brains through MRIs -- magnetic  
resonance imaging -- to look for small lesions in the basal ganglia. 
Deep in the brain, the basal ganglia act as a relay station between 
various parts of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The lesions, less than 3 millimeters in diameter, appear to have  
been caused by small strokes. A millimeter is roughly equal to the 
thickness of a paper clip. 
</P>
<P>
	The subjects answered a questionnaire about energy levels, mood,  
sleep patterns and concentration, which could indicate depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers divided patients into four groups based on  
questionnaire scores. By comparing the most and least depressed, 
they found that reports of severe depression occurred 40 percent 
more among those with basal ganglia lesions. 
</P>
<P>
	Steffens conceded, however, that researchers did not consider  
whether patients had a history of depressive episodes or had 
received treatment for depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose to focus on two medical conditions -- hypertension and  
cardiovascular heart disease,'' he said. ``Not having a more 
detailed psychiatric history is likely one limitation of the 
present study.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Hal Unwin, director of the stroke program at the University  
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, said his only 
criticism of the study was its reliance on patients reporting their 
own depressive feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	Unwin said the Duke study affirms a connection between  
depression and stroke that he has found in his own practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Depression does occur in the elderly, and the medication we  
use to treat depression can actually speed recovery of stroke 
patients,'' said Unwin, who was not part of the Duke study. ``Is 
that because they're being treated for depression and they're 
motivated to work harder, or is it because they're doing something 
else? We don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steffens said patients with risk factors for stroke must be  
monitored closely for signs of depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Depression is often overlooked in the elderly because its  
symptoms may differ from those seen in younger people,'' he said. 
``Their depression may be more characteristically marked by apathy, 
a loss of interest in their usual activities, instead of sadness. 
So, as a result, neither the patients, their families nor their 
physician may recognize these characteristics as signs of clinical 
depression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stroke killed 159,942 people in 1996 -- the most recent year for  
which complete numbers were available -- and accounted for about one 
in every 14.5 deaths in the United States, according to the 
American Heart Association. Stroke is the third largest cause of 
death among Americans, behind heart disease and all forms of 
cancer.

<HEADLINE> Ky. Drops Evolution From Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- The word ``evolution'' has quietly been  
deleted from Kentucky's guidelines for what students should be 
taught, two months after Kansas created a furor when it dropped 
Darwin's theory as a required part of the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Education Department edited out ``evolution'' and  
replaced it with the phrase ``change over time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Education Commissioner Gene Wilhoit said the word was  
considered ``a lightning rod that creates a diversion from what 
we're teaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some teachers, already nervous about what they consider an  
assault on a cornerstone of biology from those who favor the 
biblical account of creation, were annoyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They chose the less scientifically correct term and went with  
a more politically feasible term,'' Ken Rosenbaum, director of the 
Kentucky Science Teachers Association, said Wednesday. ``In science 
we have big words like photosynthesis. Do we not call it 
photosynthesis? Do we call it plant food making?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helen Mountjoy, chairwoman of the Kentucky Board of Education,  
said the change would make no difference in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``We teach evolution and we test evolution in Kentucky,'' she  
said. ``There is no change in the way we expect teachers to 
approach this subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In August, the Kansas Board of Education adopted new testing  
standards that play down the scientific importance of evolution, 
including the theory that humans descended from apes and other 
lower species. 
</P>
<P>
	In many states, including Kentucky, there are periodic attempts  
at local levels to push ``creationism'' as a biblical 
counterbalance to evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, officials in the Marshall County school district in  
western Kentucky confiscated science textbooks and glued together 
two pages dealing with the big-bang theory. Some principals had 
complained that the fifth- and sixth-grade textbooks did not 
include the biblical account of creation. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Kentucky science guidelines were first provided to  
teachers in 1995, they did not include the word ``evolution'' in 
the statement: ``Biological change over time accounts for the 
diversity of species developed through gradual processes over many 
generations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, science teachers successfully campaigned to  
substitute ``evolution'' for ``change over time.'' This year, the 
original wording was restored. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Ham, director of Answers in Genesis, a ``creationism''  
ministry in Kentucky, said the change won't stop evolution from 
being taught. 
</P>
<P>
	The change ``has nothing to do with de-emphasizing evolution.  
They don't want to offend certain students,'' Ham said.

	House OKs Health-Care Tax Breaks

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled House today approved  
a package of tax breaks designed to help the uninsured afford 
health care coverage, overriding complaints from Democrats that the 
plan would consume a portion of the Social Security surplus. The 
vote was 227-205, largely along party lines. It served as prelude 
to an expected clash over a White House-backed bill to strengthen 
patients' hands in dealing with their insurance companies.

better are coming to new cars this fall. So-called dual-stage air 
bags are on the 2000 models of some luxury cars and several of the 
nation's most popular family cars -- the Ford Taurus and Honda 
Accord. Safety experts say the new technology will reduce deaths 
and injuries from air bags that inflated explosively.

	Regulations Helped Fight Acid Rain  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Environmental regulations have reduced acid rain  
but have not yet spurred the recovery of damaged lakes and streams 
in North America, government researchers say. Their study is the 
first to show that reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions are 
directly related to reduced acidity in lakes and streams in Europe. 
As for the United States, which imposed its regulations later, 
researchers said the payoff is probably still in the future.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Houston rejoined the NFL today, paying a record  
$700 million for an expansion franchise and beating out Los 
Angeles. Owners also voted to adjust the league alignment to eight

businessman Bob McNair. The $700 million fee is the highest for a 
sports team in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Down, Corn, Soybeans Up / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures prices were lower, while corn and  
soybean futures prices were higher in early trading today on the 
Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures continue to be pressured by abundant supplies. And  
despite the recent drop in prices, there has been little increase 
in export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The slight rise in corn futures was largely due to technical  
factors. Traders were shifting their positions ahead of the U.S. 
Agriculture Department's crop production and supply and demand 
report, to be released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices gained despite near ideal weather, which  
is speeding the harvest of the soybean crop. Slow selling by 
farmers gave a boost to prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was a 1/2 cent lower at $2.64 a  
bushel; December corn was a 1/2 cent higher at $2.04 a bushel; 
December oats were 1 cent higher at $1.11 a bushel; November 
soybeans were 1 1/2 cents higher at $4.85 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and pork futures were lower in early trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports that Russia is planning to turn away from beef because  
of high prices were pushing cattle prices lower. Hog futures prices 
fell due to concern over weak cash prices. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle were .15 cent lower at 68.97 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle were .32 cent lower at 81.15 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs were .88 cent lower at 47.32 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were .75 cent lower a 60.10 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Cites Tobacco Industry's Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- The tobacco industry uses its  
enormous wealth to manipulate scientists and public opinion with 
the aim of increasing global cigarette sales, the World Health 
Organization's European director said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hard evidence, now coming to light in documents that the  
industry has been forced to make public, confirms these 
suspicions,'' said Jo E. Asvall, the U.N. body's regional director. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. attorney Roberta Walburn last year forced tobacco companies  
to release 35 million pages of documents. Among them Walburn's 
legal team claim to have found evidence that tobacco companies had 
known for decades that nicotine was addictive. 
</P>
<P>
	Walburn, who helped the state of Minnesota reach a $6.6 billion  
settlement with the tobacco industry last year, took a year's leave 
from her law firm to work with the WHO at its international 
headquarters in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``hazard merchants,'' Asvall said in a statement, stay close  
to scientists ``in order to learn about their intention, to modify 
their opinions, to precede their interventions with national 
government agencies and to activate defensive industry response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, WHO said the tobacco industry covertly funded  
so-called ``independent scientists and journalists'' to write 
newspaper articles which were published in major dailies and which 
questioned the agency's works and reports, WHO spokesman Franklin 
Apfel said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extent of the manipulation, deceit and corruption exceeds  
our worst fears,'' Asvall said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to WHO figures, 4 million people around the world died  
this year of tobacco-related illnesses, such as cancer. That figure 
was projected to rise to 10 million deaths in 2030. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tobacco industry acts as a global force, sparing no nation  
or people, Asvall said. Tobacco ``kills human beings and saps 
national treasuries,'' he said, referring a World Bank report on 
the economic aspects of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Asvall is departing the agency's European headquarters in  
Copenhagen after 15 years as its regional director. He said WHO 
would continue to challenge the tobacco industry. ``We need fully 
to expose the industry's tactics and continue to take decisive 
steps to counter their influence,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cash Flow Into Mutual Funds Is Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The amount of money invested in mutual funds in  
the first eight months of 1999 was down 15 percent from the first 
eight months of 1998. Through August of 1999, investors had put 
$112 billion into mutual funds, down from $132.3 billion a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	So what?  
</P>
<P>
	Well, the obvious answer is that if there's less money going  
into mutual funds, there must be less confidence in the stock 
market. But it's not that simple. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash flow into stock funds is generally viewed ``as a proxy for  
the public's sentiment of the stock market,'' said John Collins, a 
spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based 
trade organization that tracks mutual fund information. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, conventional wisdom holds that the amount of money  
going into mutual funds is directly related to whether the stock 
market goes up or down, given the huge amounts of cash investors 
now put into stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the correlation between the flow of money into stock funds  
and the direction of the stock market is weak, according to 
Collins. ``It's not much of an indicator,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 20 percent of the total value of the stock market is held  
by mutual funds, Collins explained. The rest is held by 
institutions such as private pension fund managers, state and local 
government pension funds, banks and insurance companies, and 
wealthy private investors. Small, individual investors are also 
thrown into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
	The information is valuable primarily to the fund industry  
itself, analysts said. Fund companies like to keep track of where 
the money is going -- or not going -- in order to keep an eye on the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, some mutual fund managers blame the mutual  
fund industry's dismal third quarter performance figures on the 
fact that less money was flowing into funds. And both of those 
dynamics, they argue, contributed to the 1,000 point, or 9 percent, 
decline in the Dow Jones industrial average during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the mutual fund statistics for the period from July  
through September: diversified United States stock funds, whose 
portfolios include stocks from similar-sized companies but from a 
number of different industries, were down on average 5.37 percent; 
and sector funds, whose portfolios include stocks from the same 
industries, fell an average of 3.51 percent. And within those 
categories, certain popular niches stood out for their poor 
performances. For example, diversified funds that track the 
performance of the S&AMP;P 500 index fell an average of 6.35 percent. 
And funds that focus on financial services stocks fell 12.68 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a far cry from the double-digit gains most investors have  
grown accustomed to in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Now consider that those poor third quarter performances  
coincided almost precisely with the stock market selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual fund analysts said three factors contributed to the third  
quarter downturn in fund performance: fears that the Federal 
Reserve Board would raise interest rates for a third time this year 
to keep inflation at bay; concerns that Y2K computer bugs could 
hurt companies' ability to do business; and the dollar's recent 
slide against foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Walsh, a portfolio manager with King Investment Advisors  
in Houston, said the stock market falloff was directly related to 
the outflow of cash from stock mutual funds. Specifically, he said 
many fund managers took money out of stocks to build up cash 
reserves as a precaution against potential Y2K computer bug 
problems that could hurt a company's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``That caused pressure across the board,'' Walsh said, referring  
both to third quarter mutual fund performance and the drop-off in 
the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	So the debate continues.

<HEADLINE> Parents Plead Innocent to Lying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A couple who went on national talk shows to  
appeal for help in finding their missing 5-month-old daughter 
pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges they lied about her 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlene and Steve Aisenberg said their daughter Sabrina vanished  
from her crib on Nov. 24, 1997, as the family slept in their home 
in Brandon, 15 miles east of Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the couple knew all along that Sabrina was dead.  
</P>
<P>
	According to an indictment returned by a federal grand jury  
Sept. 9, Mrs. Aisenberg was recorded telling her husband: ``The 
baby's dead and buried. It was found dead because you did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No body has been found and officials said they do not know what  
happened to Sabrina or where she is. Her parents have not been 
charged with murder or kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who have moved to Bethesda, Md., remain free on  
$25,000 bond apiece. Their trial is scheduled to begin in December. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of all counts, Mrs. Aisenberg could face up to 30  
years in prison and Aisenberg could face 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Report: FBI Fired Shots at Davidians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An expert hired by the House Government Reform  
Committee says he believes an FBI agent fired shots during the 
bureau's 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	That view, expressed in an interview published in today's  
editions of The Washington Post, is at odds with the FBI's position 
that none of its agents fired shots at any time during the siege in 
which about 80 people died. 
</P>
<P>
	The expert in thermal imaging and videotape analysis, Carlos  
Ghigliotti, has done work for the FBI in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I conclude that the FBI fired shots on that day,'' Ghigliotti  
told the Post in an interview conducted Tuesday. ``I conclude this 
based on the ground-view videotapes taken from several different 
angles simultaneously and based on the overheard thermal tape. The 
gunfire from the ground is there, without a doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghigliotti, owner of Infrared Technologies Corp., in Laurel,  
Md., said the tapes also confirm that the Davidians fired at FBI 
agents repeatedly during the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Although FBI agents were operating under rules that permitted  
them to return fire, bureau officials have maintained that no 
agents fired any shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghigliotti is not asserting that any injuries or deaths were  
caused by FBI gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the Post he reached his conclusion after spending  
hundreds of hours reviewing various tapes of the siege, including a 
newly released FBI audio recording that was part of a videotape 
turned over to Congress recently in response to a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the committee that retained  
Ghigliotti said ``it is premature to make any final 
determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to go off half-cocked,'' Burton told the Post.  
``As soon as we get all the necessary information, we will hold 
hearings and present the information to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., has been appointed by  
Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate FBI actions at Waco.

<HEADLINE> American Home To Cut 700 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, N.J. (AP) -- American Home Products Corp. will eliminate  
about 700 jobs in its Cyanamid Agricultural Products division, or 
about 13 percent of the unit's worldwide work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts disclosed today are included in a wide-ranging  
restructuring of the Cyanamid unit, which is headquartered in 
Parsippany. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, AHP officials said they are trying to make their  
manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts more efficient. They 
also will make changes to the unit's research operations and buy 
back a portion of its soybean herbicide inventory from the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyback results from distribution changes and comes while  
the company is preparing to launch a new soybean herbicide for the 
2000 season. The repurchase will cost the company $330 million, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The eliminated positions represent 13 percent of the Cyanamid  
workforce, which totals 5,500 worldwide. About 2,300 employees are 
in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will close four U.S. regional administrative sales  
offices by the end of 1999, said AHP spokesman Lowell Weiner. Those 
offices are in Denver, Indianapolis, Des Moines, Iowa, and Memphis, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	AHP did not immediately release the number of employees who work  
at those offices. Weiner said layoffs -- and possibly other office 
closings -- would occur worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring costs will be reflected as a special charge in  
the company's third-quarter earnings.

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Mark Parrish and Viktor Kozlov each scored in the  
final two minutes as the Florida Panthers rallied for a 4-2 win 
over the Los Angeles Kings on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 2-1, the Panthers struck for two goals in a 20-second  
span of the third period against Kings goalie Stephane Fiset. 
</P>
<P>
	Kozlov scored from just outside the left crease on a feed from  
Ray Whitney to tie the game with 1:51 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 20 seconds later, Bret Hedican picked up a loose puck and  
fired it from the blue line towards Parrish, who deflected it from 
in front of Fiset for the game-winner. Pavel Bure, who has 31 goals 
in 37 career games against the Kings, added an empty-net goal with 
34 seconds left as Florida won for the second time in as many 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Luc Robitaille scored his third goal of the season and 520th of  
his career as the Kings lost for the first time in three games.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Oxendine Will Start as RB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons have moved to their  
second option to replace Jamal Anderson, making second-year running 
back Ken Oxendine the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxendine, from Virginia Tech, will replace Byron Hanspard when  
the Falcons (0-4) play the Saints (1-2) Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons are still searching for a runner to fill the void  
left by Anderson, who is out for the season after tearing a 
ligament in his right knee in a loss to Dallas on Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Oxendine got the nod to start from coach Dan Reeves,  
Hanspard still figures to see plenty of action. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a football player, you try to earn a starting job no matter  
what level you're at,'' said Oxendine. ``I'm happy to get the 
chance, and it means a lot to me. But when (Hanspard is) in there, 
I'll do everything I can to make him do better out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hanspard, also in his second year, hardly seemed eager to talk  
about the move. The 200-pounder is 30 pounds lighter than Oxendine, 
and his slashing style of running hasn't done much for an Atlanta 
offense that ranks 27th in the NFL in touchdowns and total yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be me. I'm going to run the ball the way I run  
the ball,'' said Hanspard, who is averaging only 2.9 yards per 
carry. ``If they're not happy with me, they'll make their decision. 
I've done the best that I can, and if they're not pleased with me, 
that's not my problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After making his debut Sept. 26 at St. Louis with two carries  
for only six yards, Oxendine stepped in against the Ravens after 
Hanspard suffered a slight shoulder sprain in the first half. 
Oxendine carried a career-high 11 times for only 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Another decision will be made later this week regarding Chris  
Chandler. Though still listed as doubtful, the Pro Bowl quarterback 
hopes to start Sunday after sitting two of the last three games 
with a pulled hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler practiced sparingly Wednesday afternoon as backup Tony  
Graziani took the bulk of the work. Coach Dan Reeves indicated 
earlier in the day that Graziani will start for the third time this 
year if Chandler is unable. 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling in his starting debut Sept. 20 at Dallas,  
Graziani was effective in relieving Chandler the next week at St. 
Louis, completing 14 of 22 passes for 152 yards and his first NFL 
passing touchdown of his three-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Graziani was 9 of 13 for 73 yards against the Ravens before  
suffering a concussion that forced him from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just have to see how Chris does,'' Reeves said. ``If  
Chris is ready to go, he will start. If not, Tony will start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graziani passed his NFL-mandated concussion tests Tuesday is  
listed as probable for the Saints game.

<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Maybe this is the second coming of the Amazin'  
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	In one incredible week, New York has gone from the brink of  
elimination, to a wild-card playoff victory, then an all-night 
flight to Phoenix, where they beat Randy Johnson and the Arizona 
Diamondbacks 8-4 in the opener of their NL division series Tuesday 
night.

	In a game that didn't start until 11:10 p.m. EDT, no one played  
greater than Alfonzo, who homered off Johnson in the first inning, 
then won the game with a grand slam off reliever Bobby Chouinard in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo, who also homered against Cincinnati on Monday night in  
the game that earned the Mets the NL wild card, became the first 
player to hit a grand slam in his postseason debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last few years, Edgardo Alfonzo has been a fabulous  
baseball player who has kind of a star quality,'' said Mets manager 
Bobby Valentine, in a playoff game for the first time. ``He's 
gaining confidence, and with confidence you get performances like 
you saw tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other playoff openers, Houston beat Atlanta 6-1 in the NL and  
New York defeated Texas 8-0 in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who left the game with the bases loaded and one out in  
the ninth, lost his sixth straight postseason decision, a major 
league record. He struck out 11 and held on through an exhausting 
138 pitches as Arizona rallied from a 4-1 deficit to tie it at 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obviously not the way I would've wrote the script,''  
Johnson said. ``Hopefully, I'll have another chance to pitch 
against those guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks send Todd Stottlemyre to the mound tonight  
against New York's Kenny Rogers. The series shifts to New York for 
Game 3 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Olerud became the first left-hander to hit a home run off  
Johnson since Jim Edmonds on Sept. 23, 1997. Olerud's two-run shot 
put New York up 3-0 in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to protect the plate,'' he said. ``I was looking  
for a fastball. He threw a slider and I just reached out in front 
and grabbed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud and the Mets' other left-hander in the lineup, Robin  
Ventura, each had two hits off Johnson, who usually dominates 
lefties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got four hits left-handed, and that's determination,''  
Valentine said. ``That's reaching down and wanting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After falling behind 4-1, the Diamondbacks rallied on a solo  
homer by Erubiel Durazo and and a two-run homer by Luis Gonzalez to 
make it 4-all. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson settled down to pitch four hitless innings, but Ventura  
led off the ninth with a single. With one out, Rey Ordonez singled, 
and Johnson walked Melvin Mora to load the bases and bring on 
Chouinard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I just got a little tired and walked some people and  
got behind and gave up some hits,'' Johnson said. ``I gave it all I 
had out there in the ninth inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman Matt Williams made a diving stop, his second of  
the game, on Rickey Henderson's grounder, and threw home to force 
out Ventura, putting Arizona an out away from getting out of the 
jam. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alfonzo hit Chouinard's 3-1 pitch just inside the left-field  
foul pole for the grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little jittery,'' Chouinard said. ``It was my first  
time out there. It was a big crowd and a playoff game. I tried to 
do what I normally do, throw a first-pitch strike. I was 
overaggressive. I was trying to throw too hard. I threw a 3-1 
fastball right down the middle. I fell behind and I paid for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona manager Buck Showalter said he felt it was right to  
leave Johnson in the game, even though the big left-hander said he 
was getting close to running out of gas. Showalter, who has never 
brought closer Matt Mantei into a game with runners on base, said 
he used Chouinard because he'd been one of the best relievers this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we could have figured out a way to keep Alfonzo in the  
park, then maybe we could have had some fun in the ninth inning,'' 
Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonzo said that with a 3-1 count, he expected a fastball.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he wanted to walk me,'' Alfonzo said.  
</P>
<P>
	After he hit it, the only question was whether it was fair.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know if it was a foul or fair ball,'' Alfonzo said.  
``I stayed at home plate, going, `C'mon, c'mon.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, whose postseason record fell to 2-6, allowed seven runs  
on eight hits. Turk Wendell pitched one inning and was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	In the seventh, Johnson doubled for his first postseason hit.  
But he was doubled up when took off running on Tony Womack's 
one-out fly ball to left. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's essentially pretty much the way the night went for  
me,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Astros 6, Braves 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Daryle Ward hit a tiebreaking homer in the sixth inning and Ken  
Caminiti hit a clinching three-run shot in the ninth as Houston won 
at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros, swept in three straight by Atlanta in the 1997 first  
round, took the lead when Ward, son of former major leaguer Gary 
Ward, connected off Greg Maddux. Atlanta had been 12-1 in 
first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 39,119 was nearly 11,000 short of capacity and was  
the smallest in Atlanta's 44-game postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Yankees 8, Rangers 0    	
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Hernandez pitched two-hit ball for eight innings, Bernie  
Williams homered and drove in six runs, and New York picked up 
right where it left off last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champions again shut down Texas. Last year, the  
Yankees swept the first-round series from the Rangers and held them 
to one run and a .141 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez improved to 3-0 with an 0.41 ERA in postseason play.  
He sent Texas to its seventh straight playoff loss and extended its 
postseason scoreless streak to 22 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 0-for-11 in last year's series against the Rangers,  
had a two-run double off Aaron Sele in the fifth inning, a 
three-run homer off Mike Venafro in the sixth and an RBI single off 
Jeff Fassero in the eighth.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Carter Puts Health First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Cris Carter's streak of 100  
consecutive starts for the Minnesota Vikings could come to an 
unceremonious end Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, second to Jerry Rice among active receivers with 856  
career receptions, has an injured left hip flexor that kept him out 
of practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just sore, sore and stiff, it's just like a pulled  
muscle,'' said Carter, hurt Sunday when he stretched for a first 
down against Tampa Bay and was hit by Buccaneers linebacker Shelton 
Quarles. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, who walked with a pronounced limp and had ice packs  
strapped to his left hip, said he wouldn't imperil his team's 
chances by playing Sunday if he's not healthy enough to be more 
than a decoy against the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to jeopardize my future and I'm not going  
jeopardize my team by going out there knowing I can't do 80, 95 
percent of what I normally would be able to do,'' Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he wasn't worried about continuing his streak.  
</P>
<P>
	``As far as this week's game, I won't jeopardize the team and  
what we're trying to do over the long haul just to try to play a 
game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter's streak was imperiled last year when he pulled a calf  
muscle before the Bears-Vikings game on Dec. 6. He started, but 
left after a few plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dennis Green said he was optimistic he'd have his  
perennial Pro Bowl receiver available against the Bears this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to keep Cris out of the lineup,'' Green said.  
``First, he's a fast healer and he works real hard in his 
rehabilitation and he's very fortunate to have been given a strong 
body that heals very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Free safety Orlando Thomas said he was certain Carter wouldn't  
miss the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's going to be in street clothes,'' Thomas  
said. ``I don't think that's possible. I don't think that will 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter was injured with 14 minutes left Sunday after catching an  
8-yard pass from Randall Cunningham. He returned to action but was 
mostly a decoy, and his injured hip stiffened on him that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, who has been to six straight Pro Bowls, has 22 catches  
for 256 yards and one TD but he's been kept out of the end zone for 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	If Carter can't play against the Bears, Matthew Hatchette and  
Chris Walsh probably will see increased playing time alongside 
Randy Moss and Jake Reed.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Release Lance Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs released center fielder Lance  
Johnson on Wednesday as the team began to revamp its lineup after a 
dismal last-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 36, was to be the Cubs' leadoff man in 1999 but missed  
the middle third of the season with an abdominal strain. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who would have been eligible for free agency after the  
World Series, batted .260 in 95 games this year. He has a lifetime 
average of .291 with four different teams and has 117 triples, most 
among active players.

<HEADLINE> Pele's Son Convicted of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The son of Brazilian soccer great Pele  
was convicted of murder early today for participating in a street 
car race which resulted in the death of a passing motorcyclist. 
</P>
<P>
	Edson Cholbi do Nascimento, 29, received a six-year sentence to  
be served under a work release program, which means he must sleep 
in prison but can leave during the day to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento and Marcilio Jose Marinho de Melo, 25, -- who also was  
convicted and received the same sentence -- were accused of racing 
their cars in Santos, a town 48 miles southeast of Sao Paulo, when 
they struck and killed 50-year-old retiree Pedro Simoes Neto. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Melo's car was the one that hit Neto, Nascimento was  
found guilty for taking part in the race in October 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the verdict, Nascimento's lawyer, Marlon Machado  
filed an appeal claiming that some of the witnesses had ``obviously 
lied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so obvious, that the judge reminded one of them that he  
was testifying under oath,'' Machado said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he thought some witnesses would lie, Machado said:  
``Probably to show Brazil and the rest of the world that impunity 
will not be tolerated in Santos and that even the son of a famous 
and wealthy personality could be sent to jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But in this case they helped convict two innocent people.'' he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Superior Tribunal of Justice of the state of Sao  
Paulo probably will rule on his appeal by August 2000. If the 
appeal is successful, a new trial would be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento and Melo will remain free until the appeal is judged.  
</P>
<P>
	Machado tried to convince the jurors that Simoes Neto was killed  
in an accident and not because of a car race. 
</P>
<P>
	Globo News showed videotape of Nascimento denying he had  
anything to do with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I witnessed an accident that happened in front of me,''  
Nascimento told the judge. ``My only involvement was as a 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Nascimento nor Pele were available for immediate  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agencia Folha news agency quoted Nascimento as saying: ``We  
should congratulate the prosecutor because he managed to condemn 
two innocent people without proof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento, a reserve goalie for eight years on the Santos team  
-- Pele's former club -- announced his retirement from professional 
soccer in June.

<HEADLINE> Nevada Power Plant To Cut Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The owners of a coal-burning power plant that  
environmentalists say is a major source of the haze over the Grand 
Canyon have agreed to install pollution control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement between the owners of the Mohave Generating  
Station in Laughlin, Nev., and two environmental groups was filed 
Wednesday in federal court in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	It calls for installation of smokestack scrubbers, a filter  
system and new burners for the plant's boilers. The project could 
cost $300 million and is supposed to be finished by 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be one of the largest cleanups of one of the  
old coal-powered plants in the West,'' said Rick Moore, air quality 
program officer for the Grand Canyon Trust, one of the 
environmental groups. ``This plant regularly belches enormous 
plumes of soot and smoke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Salt River Project, a major Arizona utility,  
announced completion of a $420 million cleanup at a second 
coal-burning plant accused of polluting the canyon, the Navajo 
Generating Station near Page. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of these plants are examples of corporations stepping up  
to the plate and taking care of their environmental 
responsibilities,'' Moore said. ``Cleaning up these two plants is 
definitely going to improve visitors' experiences at the Grand 
Canyon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mohave plant, 75 miles from the Grand Canyon, is the last  
large power plant operating in the Southwest without equipment to 
control sulfur pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Air pollution affecting the canyon is also believed to come from  
Los Angeles, Las Vegas and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups contend the 28-year-old Mohave plant  
routinely exceeded federal standards for emissions of sulfur 
dioxide, which combines with other atmospheric chemicals to form 
haze. 
</P>
<P>
	``This plant will go from one of the dirtiest to one of the  
cleanest in the Southwest,'' said Rob Smith of the Sierra Club, the 
other environmental group that signed the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Wyman, an attorney for Mohave's owners, said that the plant  
has stayed within federal guidelines but that settling the lawsuit 
makes it easier to continue operations in an increasingly 
competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvements at the plant are designed to cut sulfur dioxide  
emissions by at least 85 percent and reduce nitrogen oxides and 
soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grand Canyon Trust and the Sierra Club sued in 1998 to try  
to force a cleanup. A judge now has 45 days to review the proposed 
consent decree submitted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mohave plant is owned by Southern California Edison, the Los  
Angeles Department of Water &AMP; Power, Nevada Power Co. and the Salt 
River Project in Phoenix. It produces 1,580 megawatts of 
electricity each year -- enough to serve up to 1.5 million 
households in California, Arizona and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, the plant burns about 6 million tons of coal. That  
creates about 40,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, 10,000 tons of soot 
and 20,000 tons of nitrogen oxide, the pollutant that stains the 
air brown over many large cities.

<HEADLINE> NatWest Drops Controversial Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- National Westminster Bank PLC today dropped its  
controversial offer to buy a British life insurance firm, improving 
the odds that Bank of Scotland would succeed in its hostile 
takeover bid for NatWest. 
</P>
<P>
		   National Westminster's offer for Legal &AMP; General Group PLC made  
it the target of a $34.40 billion hostile bid by the Bank of 
Scotland. The Scottish bank cited the Legal &AMP; General deal as proof 
that NatWest was straying outside its core banking business. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest had offered $17.74 billion for the insurer on Sept. 3,  
but the move was badly received by investors. NatWest said 
Wednesday that its bid would not be extended beyond the closing 
date of next Monday, and a bank spokesman said it now expects that 
offer to lapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland has made its own bid for NatWest conditional  
upon the rejection by NatWest shareholders of the London-based 
bank's offer for Legal &AMP; General. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of Scotland made its offer for NatWest, a rival more than  
twice its size, on Sept. 24. NatWest quickly rejected the bid, 
which amounted to 12.50 British pounds a share, or $20.63 at 
current exchange rates. NatWest stock soared as analysts speculated 
that other bidders would enter the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	NatWest shares closed down 1 percent Wednesday at 14.35 pounds  
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said Royal Bank of Scotland is one of the  
likeliest counterbidders for NatWest. Royal Bank has said it is 
considering the position of NatWest and is watching the situation 
as it develops.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Claim A Pitcher, Shortstop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies claimed shortstop  
Felix Martinez from the Kansas City Royals and pitcher Carlos Reyes 
from the San Diego Padres on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players have been added to the 40-man roster.  
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, 25, spent most of the season at Double-A Wichita  
before being called up by the Royals in September. For Kansas City, 
he appeared in six games with one start. 
</P>
<P>
	In 87 games at Wichita, Martinez hit .269 with four homers, 37  
RBIs and 19 stolen bases. During his minor league career, he was 
cited three times by ``Baseball America'' as having his league's 
best infield arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes, 30, was 2-4 in 65 relief appearances for the Padres in  
1999 with a 3.72 ERA and one save. He allowed 76 hits in 77.1 
innings pitched with 24 walks and 57 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last two seasons, Reyes has posted 3.64 ERA in his 111  
appearances, all in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the Phillies outrighted the following seven  
players to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre: Billy Brewer, Mike Grace, Joe 
Grahe, Torey Lovullo, Ryan Nye, Chad Ogea and Yorkis Perez.

<HEADLINE> Houston Gets NFL Expansion Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Houston rejoined the NFL today, paying a record  
$700 million for an expansion franchise and beating out Los 
Angeles, the nation's second-largest TV market. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote, announced by commissioner Paul Tagliabue, was 29-0  
with Arizona and St. Louis abstaining. Twenty-four votes were 
needed for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles business leaders were unable to agree on several  
proposals for a stadium site. The city lost the Raiders to Oakland 
and the Rams to St. Louis after the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote awarding Houston businessman Bob McNair the team  
followed months of indecision in which the NFL at one point 
conditionally awarded a franchise to Los Angeles. A deadline for 
Los Angeles to come up with a suitable stadium proposal came and 
went, eventually putting Houston back into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think after a while we all got tired of it, thought it was  
time to make a decision,'' McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $700 million fee is the highest for a sports team in the  
United States. With a $310 million stadium included, the Houston 
deal would be worth more than $1 billion -- a first for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day for Houston, we hope a great day for  
football,'' McNair said. ``Our facility will be second to none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote returns an NFL team to Houston, which lost the Oilers  
to Tennessee after the 1996 season and is the nation's No. 11 
television market. 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the Houston team is not set, but Tagliabue said it  
would not be ``Oilers.'' When Cleveland lost its franchise to 
Baltimore after the 1995 season, the NFL brought back a team to 
Cleveland, along with its traditional nickname, colors and records. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners also voted to adjust the league alignment to eight  
divisions of four teams each. Right now, there are six divisions -- 
one with six teams and the rest with five. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston will be placed in the AFC, where the old Oilers played.  
That would mean one AFC team would have to switch to the NFC. 
Arizona and St. Louis abstained because of questions over the 
proposed alignment. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair said a retractable-roof stadium will be completed in time  
for Houston to play its first season in 2002. Public funds of $195 
million will go into the project. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Houston will be the site of a Super Bowl  
``as soon as practical after completion of the stadium,'' Tagliabue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made an outstanding business proposal, and these are  
good business people who know a good proposal,'' McNair said. 
``From what I know about the other proposals, I don't think they 
compare to ours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many owners favored Houston from the start because they  
preferred McNair to the potential Los Angeles owners and because 
the city already had a stadium plan and financing. Yet, the league 
remained concerned about not having a presence in a city as 
prominent as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Football fans in Houston were ecstatic upon learning of the NFL  
vote today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on cloud nine,'' said Larry Dluhy, owner of Sports  
Collectibles of Houston. ``I've lived here all my life and the last 
two years with the Oilers gone there's been a huge vacancy. It's 
like an empty closet and now we've filled it back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the SRO Sports Bar &AMP; Cafe near downtown Houston, the lunch  
crowd had not yet arrived but manager Kathryn Scharringhousen was 
already celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone just loves a Houston home team,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The league's expansion committee met with McNair on Tuesday  
evening and also heard Michael Ovitz make another pitch for giving 
Los Angeles the 32nd team. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair's $700 million franchise bid is some $50 million higher  
than the new franchise was expected to be worth. Ovitz, who most 
recently proposed building a stadium at Hollywood Park in 
Inglewood, Calif., and another group seeking a team for the Los 
Angeles Coliseum apparently did not make an offer anywhere close to 
the one by Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz and his backers hold an option on a parcel of land at  
Hollywood Park. But he obtained the option just last week, so any 
plan for that site would have to be in the very early stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Roski, one of the Coliseum backers, would not disclose the  
amount of the offer made by his group, which includes billionaire 
Eli Broad. Roski said he thought any plan for a stadium at 
Hollywood Park faced a number of challenges, including a lack of 
easy freeway access. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said the Coliseum  
group never received a clear idea of what the NFL wanted in LA. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners voted 29-2 in March to give Los Angeles a team provided  
the NFL received a suitable stadium and financing plan by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The league soon narrowed in on the Coliseum, eliminating a  
proposal by Ovitz that featured a new stadium in suburban Carson. 
But the negotiations with the Coliseum stalled last summer after 
the NFL failed to receive a promise of $150 million in public funds 
to go toward the Coliseum project.

<HEADLINE> Test Ban Vote Nears Postponement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate leaders worked toward an agreement  
today to postpone a showdown on a global nuclear test-ban treaty 
that both sides said clearly lacked support. President Clinton, 
leaving the door open for a deal, said the treaty should be given 
more time for debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``After two years of inaction,'' the president said, ``one week  
(of debate) is very little time for considered action.'' Clinton, 
speaking with reporters in the Rose Garden, said he would continue 
to press for the treaty's approval as long as it is scheduled for a 
vote on Tuesday. He noted that Democrats and Republicans were 
discussing ``a better process for deliberating on this important 
treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said Senate rejection would  
thrust the United States into a nuclear ``no man's land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Senate rejects the treaty, the proliferation of nuclear  
weapons is more likely, posing serious challenges to our 
nonproliferation goals,'' Cohen told the Senate Armed Services 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader  
Tom Daschle, D-S.D., hoped to announce later today that a vote on 
the treaty would be postponed, Republican and Democratic aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daschle told reporters that Democrats were not ready to go  
along with a Republican demand that the vote be put off until after 
the 2000 presidential election. Daschle said many Democrats want to 
reserve the option that the treaty could be considered next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, said Daschle, ``There is a desire on the part of many not  
to have a vote. ... I'm hopeful that we can find some solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand the votes may not be there'' to ratify the  
treaty, Daschle said. In fact, he accused Republican leaders ``of 
making this a party-line test vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said: ``As long as  
the treaty remains on the Senate calendar for next Tuesday, we're 
going to go ahead and make the best case we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, the only Republican in Clinton's Cabinet, opposed a  
nuclear test ban when he represented Maine in the Senate in the 
1980s and early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the committee he has changed his mind on the ban because  
``the threat of nuclear missile proliferation was more acute today 
than it was in 1992, and accordingly the importance of 
strengthening nonproliferation has increased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the Senate should ratify the treaty -- but suggested  
that, if it couldn't, it should avoid a direct vote rejecting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would put the United States in a rather difficult  
position,'' said Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	He said even if the United States continued the moratorium on  
testing that has been in place since 1992, it would make it 
extremely hard to protest if other nations tested, given a Senate 
vote against the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have something of a no-man's land,'' Cohen said.  
</P>
<P>
	If all 100 senators vote, the treaty would require 67 votes, or  
two-thirds, to be ratified. Even if all 45 Democrats vote for it, 
the treaty would still require the support of 22 Republicans -- 
something both sides agreed does not appear within grasp. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 154 nations, including the United States, have signed  
the treaty, only 47 countries have ratified it. Only two of the 
seven declared nuclear powers, Britain and France, have ratified 
the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott forced the issue by scheduling a quick vote on the treaty  
after Republicans had blocked it for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Tuesday he would consider calling off the vote -- but  
only if President Clinton and Senate Democrats would acknowledge 
they had initiated the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, Lott said he would not agree to any plan under  
which the treaty could be called up during next year's presidential 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to vote on this issue in this Congress, it's  
going to be next Tuesday or Wednesday,'' Lott told reporters 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton invited a bipartisan group of senators to a three-hour  
dinner to lobby for the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Some supported the treaty and others expressed reservations. The  
president ``spoke quite passionately about the treaty ... and the 
consequences of defeat to U.S. leadership, the national interest 
and the nonproliferation agenda,'' National Security Council 
spokesman David Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said today that the consensus  
among the group of senators appeared to be in favor of ``a little 
more time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The view among these senators seems to be that this is a  
serious treaty, but it cannot be done by Tuesday,'' he said at a 
meeting of an Energy Department advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden, senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee, said it looked as if the treaty battle was 
degenerating into an almost straight party-line vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans have vanished into the ether,'' Biden said.  
</P>
<P>
	A defeat of the treaty would be a humiliating loss for Clinton,  
who had argued that it was vital for America's national security 
interests and a deterrent to the spread of nuclear weapons. ``It 
would send a terrible message,'' the president said Tuesday at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Many prominent Republicans -- including GOP presidential hopeful  
George W. Bush and the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, 
Sen. John Warner of Virginia -- say the treaty is not verifiable and 
would not stop the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran. 
Further, they argue it would harm efforts to maintain the safety 
and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

<HEADLINE> Rams' Hakim Solid on Return Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams thought they knew what kind  
of prize they had when Az-Zahir Hakim returned two punts for 
touchdowns in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they're sure.  
</P>
<P>
	Hakim had an 84-yarder for a touchdown last week in a 38-10 rout  
of the Bengals and caught three touchdown passes. From now on he 
expects ``the good teams, the smart teams,'' to avoid him at all 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If teams are going to keep on kicking to me, I've got to keep  
on taking them back,'' Hakim said. ``Hopefully I can still 
contribute and take some more punts back to the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakim's four TDs tied the team record, last accomplished by  
Harold Jackson in 1973. He's the first NFL player to score four 
touchdowns in a game since Corey Dillon of Cincinnati Dec. 4, 1997, 
and his 147 punt return yards is the second-highest total in team 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Az was spectacular,'' coach Dick Vermeil said. ``The kid is  
very courageous, very confident, and he knows he can do it. He is a 
threat every time he touches the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakim, a fourth-round pick in the 1998 draft, is one of many  
weapons at wide receiver along with the finally healthy Isaac 
Bruce, Torry Holt and Ricky Proehl. He has 10 catches for a 
15.8-yard average and those three touchdowns, including a 
51-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you want me to say about him?'' quarterback Kurt  
Warner said. ``The guy is special, he's phenomenal. He's capable of 
doing that each and every week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakim said he's special mainly because he's part of a special  
offense. The Rams are No. 4 in the NFL, averaging 394.7 yards, 
after ending last season 27th. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know whose week it's going to be this week,'' Hakim  
said. ``They have to try to stop us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where Hakim really sticks out is in the return game, a big  
problem area for the Rams last season. He replaced Eddie Kennison, 
a former first-round pick who fell off and was shipped to New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite little previous punt return experience, Hakim returned  
two for scores against San Diego in an exhibition. Vermeil said he 
could have scored another touchdown against the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil also said having that dangerous a player is a huge boost  
to the other 10 players on the field blocking for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a return team knows they have a guy back there that can  
put it in the end zone or in good field position, they just go 
harder,'' Vermeil said. ``They just do things better, because their 
blocks and their effort are meaningful to them, and the reward is 
greater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakim recovered his own fumble on his 84-yard return, perhaps  
throwing off the coverage. He also fumbled on one of his two 
preseason returns, not that either was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to do that on purpose,'' Hakim said. ``It kind  
of fools the defense, and everything works out well for me.''

<HEADLINE> Oriole's Miller Waiting on Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Ray Miller would prefer to spend October in the  
dugout for a playoff game. Instead, the Baltimore Orioles' 
embattled manager is playing the waiting game. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the terms of the contract he signed in November  
1997, Miller was to learn his status for the 2000 season no later 
than Wednesday. But the manager waived that provision at the 
request of owner Peter Angelos, who wanted more time to make a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's predecessor, Davey Johnson, sent a fax to Angelos  
saying he would resign if he didn't get an extension or a buyout of 
his final year. Angelos waved goodbye to Johnson and hired Miller 
to guide a team coming off two straight appearances in the AL 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	What followed were two straight losing seasons, including this  
year's 78-84 disaster, for a team that carried a $78.5 million 
payroll on opening day. The Orioles' payroll is the third-highest 
in the game behind the New York Yankees and Johnson's new team, the 
Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared Miller would be fired Monday, but Angelos apparently  
was swayed by a 13-game winning streak in September that proved 
Miller could win. Miller didn't meet with Angelos until Tuesday, 
and the 90-minute session didn't lead to a decision by the owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him to take your time and do what you think is best,''  
Miller said. ``He doesn't have to worry about the 72-hour thing. 
Whenever he wants, I don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move came as a surprise to the Orioles' public relations  
staff, which was waiting patiently for news of Angelos' decision. 
General manager Frank Wren was also surprised to hear of the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	So, for the time being, Wren can't make a move to interview  
possible candidates for the job. If Miller's contract is 
terminated, possible successors include former Milwaukee Brewers 
manager Phil Garner, Orioles director of player personnel Tom 
Trebelhorn and former Orioles-Don Baylor, now the Atlanta Braves' 
hitting coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Riggleman, a Marylander who was fired by the Chicago Cubs on  
Monday, also is a possibility.

<HEADLINE> McNair Brings NFL Team to Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Bob McNair never wavered from his dream of  
bringing an NFL franchise back to his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair was rewarded Wednesday when the league's owners voted to  
award the 32nd franchise to Houston after repeatedly stalling on 
his offer to give Los Angeles, the nation's No. 2 media market, 
more time to put together a viable proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the ultimate tribute to the persistence of Bob McNair  
to see this happen for this community and bring it together,'' 
Harris County Judge Bob Eckels said. ``I think that finally tipped 
the scales in our favor because we had the community and the owner 
working together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair is paying $700 million for the expansion franchise. He  
has plans for a $310 million retractable roof stadium to be built 
on county property adjacent to the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote returns an NFL team to Houston, which lost the Oilers  
to Tennessee after the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think without Bob McNair spearheading this and being the  
quality of person he is, we would not have gotten this far,'' 
Houston Sports Authority chairman Billy Burge said. ``Despite the 
competition with Los Angeles, I think the owners saw that they had 
a quality person that would live up to his obligations that the 
city could rally around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bud Adams, who has owned the Oilers-Titans since their beginning  
in 1960, congratulated McNair's accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob has done an outstanding job putting together a great  
package to get the new expansion team for Houston,'' Adams said. 
``I was very much in favor of the decision today which was 
demonstrated by my vote of confidence at the owners' meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the NFL continued to give Los Angeles more time to come up  
with a suitable plan, McNair kept sweetening the pot. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, he guaranteed sellouts for the first five years of the  
franchise. McNair said he would devise a system to give to charity 
any tickets not sold by the blackout deadline. NFL rules dictate 
that if a game is not sold out 72 hours before kickoff, it cannot 
be televised within 75 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the NFL meetings in Atlanta, McNair offered $700  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks he made a good deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is an opportunity to put Houston back on the map,''  
McNair said. ``It is my hometown and I like to see the spotlight on 
Houston. We've got a great sports market in Houston. It's a big 
investment, but we're going to have a wonderful stadium and even a 
Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City and county officials were somewhat surprised by the owners'  
speedy decision after hearing the recommendations of the league's 
expansion committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure we expected them to take action this quickly, but  
we're pleased that they did,'' Eckels said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we scored a touchdown for our fans, for our community  
and for our economy,'' Houston Mayor Lee Brown said. ``So I say, 
welcome football back to our city and let's play ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eckels said the next step will be to complete the architectural  
engineering workup for the stadium and construction plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers played their final game in Houston Dec. 15, 1996,  
before moving to Tennessee. Fans angered by the Oilers' departure 
stayed away from the final games, and by season's end only 15,131 
showed up for the Astrodome finale, a 21-13 loss to the Cincinnati 
Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Texans have always known that football is at the heart of  
Texas,'' U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm said in a prepared statement. ``Now, 
the NFL knows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The enthusiasm even reached all the way to Dallas, where Cowboys  
owner Jerry Jones welcomed Houston back. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dream is that we could play them every year,'' Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
	Houston sports bars already were gearing up for the return of  
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we can take all these Dallas Cowboys billboards down in  
Houston,'' sports bar owner Mike Boze said. ``I'm so sick of the 
Cowboys it makes me want to throw up. I think everybody has been 
ready for this since Bud Adams left. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody that would put up $700 million to get a new Houston  
football team has gotta be a good guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair founded Cogen Technologies in 1984. As its chief  
executive officer, he led it to become a huge cogeneration company. 
Its natural gas-fired plants in New Jersey supply about 13 percent 
of New York City's electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Cogen Technologies also is the world's largest privately owned  
cogenerator of electricity and thermal energy. Houston-based Enron 
Corp., which bought naming rights to Houston's new baseball stadium 
to open next spring, bought a majority of Cogen's assets earlier 
this year.

<HEADLINE> Aikman Allies With Eagles' McNabb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It's been 10 years, three Super Bowl titles  
and a whole lot of hits since Troy Aikman endured a 1-15 rookie 
season with the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	He seems like the perfect guy to ask about what the Philadelphia  
Eagles are trying to do with Donovan McNabb. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike McNabb, Aikman was thrown right into the starting lineup  
by coach Jimmy Johnson in 1989. The results were forgettable; 
Aikman made a career's worth of mistakes, was sacked more times 
than he can remember and stepped onto the field every week with 
doubts about whether he could play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were 0-11 as a starter my rookie season,'' Aikman said  
Wednesday, his past experience serving as the backdrop to the 
Cowboys' game against the struggling Eagles this week. ``You invest 
so much time and energy into the sport for your team to have 
success. To come up short each and every week, that takes a real 
toll on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles (0-4) have resisted every temptation to start their  
heralded rookie. McNabb, the No. 2 overall draft pick and the 
future of a franchise with a mostly insufferable history, stands on 
the sideline and watches veteran backup Doug Pederson take his 
lumps. 
</P>
<P>
	In his few chances at relief duty, McNabb's results have been  
even worse than Pederson's. Neither quarterback has led the offense 
on a touchdown drive in 15 quarters, dating to the first quarter of 
the season opener against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he wavered this week, Eagles coach Andy Reid is sticking  
with his plan to have McNabb watch and learn until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard some people say that they feel it's better to bring  
a young quarterback along slowly,'' Aikman said. ``I've heard 
others say that you don't really learn unless you're in the fire 
and kind of learning on job. I don't really know which is best. I 
was thrown in there immediately and took my lumps along with the 
football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid's first move when hired by the Eagles was to bring Pederson  
with him from Green Bay, where Reid coached quarterbacks and 
Pederson watched Brett Favre work magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Through four weeks, it's obvious that the Eagles are one of the  
NFL's worst offensive teams in years, regardless of who's playing 
quarterback. Why throw a rookie into a no-win situation? There is a 
good reason, Aikman explains. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the coaching staff kind of looked at it as maybe we  
wouldn't be as good as we could have been had we had a more veteran 
quarterback,'' Aikman said. ``But our team was not going to be that 
good anyway. We were not a playoff team, so I kind of got thrown in 
with the rest of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for the Eagles is to make sure McNabb is not  
wasting his time, whether he plays or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had continued along that path, I don't think I could go  
out each and every year and go through some of the things that we 
went through as a football team or that I went through as an 
individual for 10 or 12 years,'' Aikman said. ``We had an owner, a 
head coach and a staff that was able to get talent in here and got 
it turned around pretty quickly. Four years after my rookie season, 
we won a world championship. I was blessed. A lot of guys don't 
have that happen to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb has been the epitome of patience, not once questioning  
the coach's judgment. He has watched Tim Couch, the quarterback 
taken ahead of him in the draft, start since Week 2 for Cleveland. 
Akili Smith, picked third by Cincinnati, will start this week 
despite missing time due to a protracted contract squabble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for them,'' McNabb said. ``For myself, it's a little  
different situation. I'm just waiting my turn.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Bill Goes To Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would increase flights out of  
some of the nation's busiest airports while infusing new money into 
airport improvement and safety projects won Senate approval and was 
headed toward tough negotiations with the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chief sponsor of the Federal Aviation  
Administration bill, said quick action to find a compromise bill 
was crucial because, with the beginning of the new fiscal year last 
Friday, the FAA cannot make new grants for airport projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we fail to reauthorize this program, we may do significant  
harm to the transportation infrastructure of our country,'' said 
McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA bill, approved by the Senate on a voice vote Tuesday,  
would provide some $45 billion over four years for airport safety, 
modernization and competition programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The most contentious element was the decision to eliminate the  
``high density rule'' established in 1969 to limit flights out of 
New York's Kennedy and LaGuardia airports by 2007. Illinois Sens. 
Richard Durbin, a Democrat, and Republican Peter Fitzgerald kept 
the rule in place for Chicago's O'Hare, but agreed to increase 
slots -- a takeoff or landing -- by 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Slots at Washington's Reagan National would be increased by 24,  
with 12 for flights beyond the 1,250-mile ``perimeter rule'' in 
place since 1986 to ensure the economic viability of the region's 
two long-haul airports, Washington-Dulles and Baltimore-Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill, passed in June by a 316-110 margin, is similar,  
but would eliminate takeoff and landing restrictions at O'Hare in 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight increases were strongly opposed by lawmakers  
representing areas around the airports, but were championed by 
McCain and others who said it was a key way to improve service to 
smaller markets and allow new airlines to get into airports 
dominated by major carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	In one heated exchange, Fitzgerald suggested that McCain was too  
busy to discuss the issue with him because he was occupied running 
for the Republican presidential nomination. McCain, in turn, said 
that by holding up the bill Fitzgerald was ``jeopardizing, 
literally, the safety of airline passengers all over this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year both chambers passed FAA bills by wide margins but  
they were unable to reach a compromise because of differences on 
the slot issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Another hurdle this year is language in the House bill, promoted  
by House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., that 
would bar the Airport Trust Fund, revenues coming in from airport 
user taxes, from being used for anything but airport improvement 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund, which takes in about $10 billion a year and is  
now running a surplus, makes it easier to balance the general 
federal budget and taking it off-budget is opposed by the Clinton 
administration and congressional budget writers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill also provides more than $2 billion a year for  
the Airport Improvement Program and, in a step welcomed by the 
administration, moves to overhaul the air traffic control system by 
appointing a chief operating officer and creating an oversight 
board. The administration has been pressing to make the system, 
swamped by rapidly expanding flights, operate more like a private 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the critical challenge facing the FAA,''  
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill authorizes $30 million a year to purchase precision  
instrument landing systems, requires that cargo aircraft be 
equipped with midair collision warning systems and regulates air 
tour flights over national parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Durbin inserted language to ban smoking on all international  
flights landing or taking off from this country and Sen. Ron Wyden, 
D-Ore., won approval of language requiring the Transportation 
Department to make sure the airlines are putting their promises to 
improve service into their legal contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 82.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accuses GOP on Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the House opened a fractious debate on  
federal regulation of managed care health plans, President Clinton 
today accused Republicans of ``legislative gamesmanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a Rose Garden appearance, Clinton said the House majority,  
acting at the behest of the insurance industry, set rules for 
debate that were ``filled with enough poison pills and legislative 
sleights of hand to practically guarantee the defeat of this 
bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Clinton spoke, Democrats were complaining that the  
Republicans were not allowing amendments that would cover the cost, 
estimated to be several billion dollars over several years. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said that without  
the ability to provide for payment of the additional cost, many 
Democrats would not support the party proposal, assuring its 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton picked up that theme, saying that ``a bipartisan  
majority is poised to pass this bill, but now they are being 
blocked by legislative tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people deserve more than partisan posturing and  
legislative gamesmanship on an issue this vital,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., responded that Democrats raised this  
concern over how to pay for the bill at the last minute. 
Republicans, he said, had granted every major request over the 
rules of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats have moved the goal post again,'' Goss said.  
</P>
<P>
	The central debate, now in its second year on Capitol Hill, is  
how to give frustrated patients new rights in dealing with health 
maintenance organizations and other managed care plans, which often 
impose restrictions in order to control costs and eliminate 
unnecessary care. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats got some Republican support for a broad bill and  
appeared to have enough support to pass over the objections of 
Republican leaders. But the prohibition on amendments to cover the 
cost endangered those prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt also sought to inject a little presidential politics  
into the debate. He released a letter to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
the GOP front-runner, asking that he urge congressional Republicans 
to support the Democratic bill, which is similar to a Texas HMO 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you can educate your leadership on the importance of  
enacting meaningful reforms,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	By beginning debate with the tax bill, GOP leaders hope to shift  
attention to those without any insurance at all. They argue that 
the Democratic approach would increase costs and prompt businesses 
to drop coverage, leaving more Americans uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the severe poor who don't have health care. There are  
government programs that reach out (to them),'' House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Tuesday, sounding the GOP's central 
theme. ``It's working people today, who are working for small 
businesses or who run their own shop or they go from job to job, 
who need the ability to get health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders planned to bring the tax bill to the floor for  
debate first, with a vote expected today. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill includes popular tax breaks for people buying health  
coverage on their own and for long-term care insurance. But it also 
includes a provision opposed by many Democrats that would allow 
more medical savings accounts, which let people opt out of the 
current health insurance market and buy high-risk plans on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would give small businesses the option to  
buy health insurance under federal rather than state regulation -- 
exempting them from state mandates that bigger self-insured 
companies now avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	After that vote, the House was to move to the HMO issue,  
beginning with a bill backed by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and 
Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., and supported by the White House. With 
backing from some 20 Republicans, ultimately, it is expected to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill would give patients a host of new rights in dealing  
with their health insurance companies. It would make it easier to 
go to an emergency room or see a specialist and would give patients 
the chance to take their complaints to independent panels. Most 
controversially, it would give patients who are still not satisfied 
the right to sue an HMO in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Three alternative GOP bills will be offered, but none appeared  
to have enough support to pass. The leading alternative, crafted by 
Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John Shadegg, R-Ariz., gives 
patients the right to sue, but only in federal courts -- where 
damage awards are typically smaller -- and only under limited 
circumstances. Hastert and other Republican leaders planned to back 
this legislation, reasoning it was preferable to the 
Dingell-Norwood version, but they were not actively encouraging 
other Republicans to do the same, Hastert said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have a choice and now the House will work its will,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even if the broader bill passes the House, it must be  
reconciled with a much more limited version already approved by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	With polls showing strong support for HMO restrictions,  
Democrats were positioning themselves as protectors of the patient 
and the doctor, out only for the best care.

<HEADLINE>  Lakers Get Moving Under Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal likened his first  
practice under new Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson to a 
military drill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being at a boot camp with this general guy that you  
always see on TV beating people up,'' he said. ``You know if you 
don't want to get in trouble, just keep your mouth quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody complained about two hours of running, practicing moves  
without the ball and having partners for drills as training camp 
opened Tuesday. And they returned for another two hours in the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks pretty good so far,'' O'Neal said. ``Everybody was  
focused, everybody is willing to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson wants a team of open minds willing to relearn  
fundamentals they were either taught as youngsters or never 
thoroughly mastered playing in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got to commit to it or submit to the fact that you're  
going to learn, and you have to be flexible, be able to make 
mistakes and not feel embarrassed, not feel irritated, be 
patient,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no timeout, there's no vacation. If you want to take a  
rest, you have to do it someplace else, and that's on the bench,'' 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kobe Bryant was especially enthusiastic about Jackson's style,  
even if he was still a bit confused. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple times I ran into my guy, a couple times Shaq ran into  
his guy, then after a while things started clicking,'' he said. 
``It's really fun because you're doing things that you really 
haven't done ever, especially in an NBA setting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers won't begin playing seriously until later in the  
week. For now, Jackson wants them to grasp basic concepts like 
getting the ball up and down the floor and organizing in specific 
spots on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're kind of like going around with blindfolds on, they're  
trying to figure out where to go and how to please the coaches,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just when the gym was at its most quiet, the Lakers glimpsed a  
bit of Jackson's personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a funny guy,'' Bryant said. ``He'll be serious, then all  
of a sudden he'll just say something weird.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal admitted he and some others had trouble with a few of the  
drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``He reminds me of my father and (LSU coach) Dale Brown, where  
they teach you and they only say it once,'' he said of Jackson. 
``They say it crisp and they expect you to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as Bryant found out, Jackson is quick to set players  
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you mess it up, he'll definitely tell you. If you're doing  
a good job, he'll pat you on the butt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So what did Jackson think of his new charges after one practice?  
</P>
<P>
	``There's about nine out of 10 ballplayers on this team that  
still have a long ways to go of being a complete player,'' he said.

	Test Ban Vote To Be Called Off  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As leaders prepared to withdraw a nuclear test  
ban from Senate consideration, Defense Secretary William Cohen 
declared today that formal rejection of the treaty could speed the 
spread of nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, Democratic and Republican 
aides said that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., hoped to announce later today 
that a vote on the treaty would be postponed. Both sides agree the 
votes aren't there to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, 
which has been signed by 154 nations but ratified by only two of 
seven acknowledged nuclear powers, Britain and France. 

</P>

	Bodies Sought After Train Crash  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Police, firefighters and railway crews, working  
with a heavy crane, searched for more bodies today in a coach that 
was burned and mangled in Britain's worst rail disaster in a 
decade. The rush-hour collision in a residential area of west 
London killed at least 27 people and injured more than 160. The 
train companies said their investigation would focus on the 
behavior of the outbound train, which may have gone through a red 
light. Reports said both trains were traveling 60 mph when the 
outbound train tried to cross in front of the London-bound train. 

</P>
<P>
	Factory Orders Rise 1.3 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to American factories for manufactured  
goods posted a bigger-than-expected increase in August, led by 
stronger demand for airplanes and other transportation products and 
electronic equipment. The Commerce Department reported today that 
factory orders rose 1.3 percent in August. Many analysts had 
forecast factory orders would rise 0.6 percent. August's 
performance marks the 12th increase in the last 15 months and 
provides fresh evidence of the continued rebound of the 
manufacturing sector, which has been battered by a global financial 
crisis.

	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone  
over northern Iraq bombed a missile site today after Iraqi gunners 
opened fire on the aircraft, the U.S. military said. None of the 
planes was hit. The planes bombed a surface-to-air missile site 
west of the city of Mosul, the U.S. European Command said in a 
statement. U.S. and British planes have been patrolling no-fly 
zones over northern and southern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War, to 
protect Kurdish and Shiite minorities from the forces of Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein.

	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- In their first clash with an  
anti-independence militia group since arriving in East Timor, 
peacekeepers shot and killed two militiamen today during a failed 
ambush, the leader of the international force said. Two Australians 
were lightly wounded when the gang tried to ambush their convoy, 
said Australian Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, head of the troops that 
arrived in the Indonesian territory on Sept. 20. The incident took 
place near Suai, a border town which is the last major crossing 
point before the border with Indonesian-ruled West Timor to be 
brought under the force's control.

cashier over $7 -- and lost. Linda Williams, 51, was accused of 
putting money from a customer in her pants pocket last March while 
working at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the Bronx. 
Williams, who had worked in the cafeteria for four years, denied 
the charge but lost her job and decided to take the issue to court. 
Testimony, featuring five government witnesses, lasted one day. The 
judge ruled in Williams' favor on Sept. 15. Williams said she hopes

nation. Bob McNair is paying $700 million for the expansion 
franchise, the highest price ever for a sports team in the United 
States. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced the decision 
after owners met for about 90 minutes. The vote was not disclosed 
but 24 votes were needed for approval. The vote returns an NFL team

<HEADLINE> Tax Strategies for Older Taxpayers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- There's still time. Between now and the end of the  
year, you can take steps to minimize your tax bill come next April. 
</P>
<P>
	However, most of them are steps you won't be able to take after  
Dec. 31, according to a tax expert at the College for Financial 
Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Identifying good strategies for reducing the tax bite is  
especially important to retirees and those nearing retirement 
because they often lose many of the major deductions they've had 
over the years. Home mortgage interest deduction and the exemption 
for dependent children are examples,'' says Michael B. Cates, a 
professional tax preparer and an academic assistant at the college. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, their retirement income may not differ as  
much from their pre-retirement income as they thought it would,'' 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	One special tax move to consider before the year is out is  
``five-year averaging'' on a lump-sum retirement payout, Cates 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the last year this strategy will be available. It's a  
complicated strategy, and not for everyone, so you'll want to talk 
it over with your tax expert if you think it might apply to you. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how it works, according to Cates:  
</P>
<P>
	Basically, you take out in a lump sum the entire balance of a  
retirement plan, a profit-sharing plan or a stock bonus plan, but 
pay taxes on the payout as if you'd received the money spread out 
over five years. This lowers the tax bite overall. 
</P>
<P>
	However, before using this strategy, you should keep in mind  
several key points. 
</P>
<P>
	First, have a good reason for taking the money out, such as to  
buy a vacation home or start a business. Otherwise, it's better to 
let the money continue to grow tax deferred in the account or roll 
it over into an individual retirement account, Cates says. 
</P>
<P>
	You must be at least 59 1/2 years old and have participated in the  
plan for at least five years. The entire account must be withdrawn; 
partial withdrawals don't qualify. And if you receive more than one 
lump sum during the year, you must use the averaging method on all 
of them -- or none of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Cates says a 10-year averaging method will still be available  
after this tax year, but only people born before 1936 can use it. 
Ten-year averaging is not always better than a five-year approach, 
so if you qualify for both methods this year you'll need to run the 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers receiving Social Security but who still earn wages may  
find it beneficial to postpone income such as bonuses or 
self-employment income into the year 2000, Cates says. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security beneficiaries age 65 to 69 can earn up to  
$15,500 in 1999 before benefits are reduced $1 for every $3 earned 
over that limit. However, that income limit jumps to $17,000 in 
2000. So by postponing $1,500 income into 2000, you could save $500 
in Social Security benefits, Cates notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security beneficiaries age under age 65 will see the  
income limitation rise from $9,600 in 1999 to approximately $10,000 
in 2000. (The actual dollar amount will vary somewhat because it is 
indexed for inflation.) They lose $1 in benefits for every $2 in 
income that exceeds the limit. Beneficiaries 70 and older have no 
earnings limitations. 
</P>
<P>
	After another good year on the stock market, one viewed by some  
as overvalued, you may want to take some winners, Cates says. If 
you do, consider offsetting them with losers that you've been 
thinking about unloading. 
</P>
<P>
	But be sure you sell because it is the right investment move,  
not because it is the right tax move. And Cates cautions against 
selling because of Y2K fears, which he believes are vastly 
overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	Older taxpayers with substantial assets also are in a good  
position to make significant charitable donations, such as 
appreciated stock. Talk to your financial planner about the many 
options you may have. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking to get married before the year is out? Not too late to  
postpone the wedding into 2000, Cates says. That would delay for 
one year the ``marriage penalty,'' where married couples earning 
roughly the same amount of money and filing jointly pay more tax 
than if they were taxed as individuals. Cates said the added 
benefit of delaying into 2000 is that he thinks Congress may fix 
the marriage penalty problem next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it's not a tax move to necessarily make before the end  
of the year, Cates says older taxpayers making estimated quarterly 
payments will want to make sure their last 1999 estimated payment 
will be sufficient so they don't get hit with underpayment 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers whose prior year adjusted gross income (AGI) is  
$150,000 or higher should be especially alert, Cates emphasizes. 
For 1998, these taxpayers had to pay at least 100 percent of their 
previous year's tax liability to be safe from underpayment 
penalties. For 1999, that threshold jumps to 105 percent.

	The hole, actually an area of depleted ozone concentration high  
in the atmosphere, remains very large, however, said researcher 
Richard McPeters. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite data show the depleted area stretched 9.8 million  
square miles on Sept. 15. The record area of Antarctic ozone 
depletion of 10.5 million square miles was set on Sept. 19, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone in the upper atmosphere forms a protective layer, helping  
block dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun. 
Environmentalists fear the depletion could spread to other areas, 
leading to more skin cancer and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA officials said the decreased size of the ozone hole from  
last year is not an indication of the recovery of Antarctic ozone 
levels, saying year-to-year variations of size and depth of the 
ozone hole depend primarily on the variations in weather. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the main ozone depleted area, the scientists  
found a thinning area of ozone had formed between New Zealand and 
Antarctica on Sept. 17 and drifted west for several days. Referred 
to as a ``mini-hole,'' this resulted from the redistribution of 
ozone by a large weather system. 
</P>
<P>
	The ozone is damaged by chlorine and bromine compounds released  
by industrial products. International treaties regulate the 
production of these gases, and the amount of chlorine in some 
regions of the stratosphere is beginning to decline.

<HEADLINE> Report: FBI Fired Shots at Davidians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An expert sought by the House Government  
Reform Committee says he believes an FBI agent fired shots during 
the bureau's 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	That view, expressed in an interview published in today's  
editions of The Washington Post, is at odds with the FBI's position 
that none of its agents fired shots at any time during the siege in 
which about 80 people died. 
</P>
<P>
	The expert in thermal imaging and videotape analysis, Carlos  
Ghigliotti, has done work for the FBI in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I conclude that the FBI fired shots on that day,'' Ghigliotti  
told the Post in an interview conducted Tuesday. ``I conclude this 
based on the ground-view videotapes taken from several different 
angles simultaneously and based on the overheard thermal tape. The 
gunfire from the ground is there, without a doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghigliotti, owner of Infrared Technologies Corp., in Laurel,  
Md., said the tapes also confirm that the Davidians fired at FBI 
agents repeatedly during the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Although FBI agents were operating under rules that permitted  
them to return fire, bureau officials have maintained that no 
agents fired any shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghigliotti, whom the House committee plans to use as an expert  
analyst, is not asserting that any injuries or deaths were caused 
by FBI gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the Post he reached his conclusion after spending  
hundreds of hours reviewing various tapes of the siege, including a 
newly released FBI audio recording that was part of a videotape 
turned over to Congress recently in response to a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., who discussed  
Ghigliotti's opinion with him informally, said today, ``What we 
have heard from this expert is troubling but we think it is 
premature to make any final determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to go off half-cocked,'' Burton said in a  
statement. ``As soon as we get all the necessary information, we 
will hold hearings and present the information to the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., has been appointed by  
Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate FBI actions at Waco.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Cites Tobacco Industry's Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- The tobacco industry uses its  
enormous wealth to manipulate scientists and public opinion with 
the aim of increasing global cigarette sales, the World Health 
Organization's European director said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hard evidence, now coming to light in documents that the  
industry has been forced to make public, confirms these 
suspicions,'' said Jo E. Asvall, the U.N. body's regional director. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. attorney Roberta Walburn last year forced tobacco companies  
to release 35 million pages of documents. Among them Walburn's 
legal team claim to have found evidence that tobacco companies had 
known for decades that nicotine was addictive. 
</P>
<P>
	Walburn, who helped the state of Minnesota reach a $6.6 billion  
settlement with the tobacco industry last year, took a year's leave 
from her law firm to work with the WHO at its international 
headquarters in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``hazard merchants,'' Asvall said in a statement, stay close  
to scientists ``in order to learn about their intention, to modify 
their opinions, to precede their interventions with national 
government agencies and to activate defensive industry response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, WHO said the tobacco industry covertly funded  
so-called ``independent scientists and journalists'' to write 
newspaper articles which were published in major dailies and which 
questioned the agency's works and reports, WHO spokesman Franklin 
Apfel said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``The extent of the manipulation, deceit and corruption exceeds  
our worst fears,'' Asvall said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to WHO figures, 4 million people around the world died  
this year of tobacco-related illnesses, such as cancer. That figure 
was projected to rise to 10 million deaths in 2030. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tobacco industry acts as a global force, sparing no nation  
or people, Asvall said. Tobacco ``kills human beings and saps 
national treasuries,'' he said, referring a World Bank report on 
the economic aspects of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Asvall is departing the agency's European headquarters in  
Copenhagen after 15 years as its regional director. He said WHO 
would continue to challenge the tobacco industry. ``We need fully 
to expose the industry's tactics and continue to take decisive 
steps to counter their influence,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today, reversing  
earlier losses on warnings from the U.S. Federal Reserve about 
further interest rate increases. Tokyo share prices rose 
moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 107.36 yen at 5 p.m. (4 a.m. EDT), up 0.76 yen  
from its level of 106.60 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above 
its level of 106.41 yen overnight in New York. During the day, it 
ranged from 105.98 yen to 107.51 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 112.27 points,  
or 0.63 percent, to close at 17,896.42. The average closed up 20.44 
points, or 0.12 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar initially fell then shot back up  
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell after the Fed said it may increase rates,  
warning that it would remain ``especially alert'' to inflation 
threats from tight labor markets, traders said. But the dollar was 
later bought back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese investors bought the dollar through a U.S. bank. The  
dollar's bullish trend might be extended,'' said Takeo Okabe, a 
senior trader at Daiwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 115.28 yen, up 1.38 yen  
from its level of 113.90 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, speculation about the Japanese government's  
economic boosting package helped lift share prices somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi reshuffled his Cabinet on Tuesday  
and kicked off a three party coalition government, retaining 
economic ministers who have played a key role in bringing the 
economy to the verge of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Shizuka Kamei, the policy chief of the ruling party, said he  
expects the government's new stimulus package to include 13 
trillion yen ($121 billion) in total spending. 
</P>
<P>
	That was slightly more than the market had expected but still  
perceived mainly as a defensive measure to keep the recovery going. 
</P>
<P>
	``The size itself is moderate,'' said Kazunori Jinnai, deputy  
general manager of equities at Daiwa Securities SB Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stimulus package is to counter any possibility of a  
slowdown in economic recovery,'' said said Hidenori Karaki, general 
manager of equities at Tokyo Mitsubishi Personal Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section climbed 2.47 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,512.53. 
The TOPIX closed down 5.92 points, or 0.39 percent, the previous 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 490.87 million shares, up from 461.75 million shares 
Tuesday. Retreating issues out numbered advancers 731 to 443, while 
149 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7050 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.6100 percent. Its 
price fell 0.83 point to 99.95.

<HEADLINE> Attorney: Suspect Admits Killing One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAYNESVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A suspect charged with killing six  
people in a two-day crime spree has confessed to one of the 
slayings, his court-appointed attorney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles W. Roache, 25, is charged in the massacre of a Haywood  
County family Sept. 30 and with killing an acquaintance the day 
before near his boyhood home, 100 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Roache has admitted to killing Chad Watt, 22, attorney Roy  
Patton told The Charlotte Observer. Authorities believe Roache and 
Watt argued before Watt was shot and his body was dumped in a 
creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton would not say whether Roache has confessed to the family  
slayings. Authorities have said the family was killed during a 
random robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities apparently have a ``very, very strong case. There  
may not be a question of his guilt,'' Patton said. ``At this point, 
we have an obligation to provide this young man with whatever 
defense he may need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher W. Lippard, 20, also is charged in all six deaths  
and remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe Roache and Lippard gunned down the  
Phillips family on Sept. 30 as they tried to ditch a truck stolen 
earlier in the day and steal two of the family's vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were Earl Phillips, 72, and his wife, Cora, 73; their son  
Eddie, 40; daughter-in-law Mitzi, 44; and 14-year-old granddaughter 
Katie.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Ventura Visits Harvard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- ``The Body'' met with members of  
Harvard's student body on Wednesday, and Minnesota Gov. Jesse 
Ventura said he has no regrets about his controversial interview 
with Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said he says what he feels and he doesn't worry about  
being politically incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not afraid to speak my mind,'' he said. ``If I don't get  
re-elected that's fine. I'll go back to the private sector from 
whence I came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former pro wrestler spent part of the day meeting with  
Harvard faculty before dropping by Harvard football practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who also coaches high school football, joked that the  
Crimson team would have surprised his late father, who used to joke 
that Minnesota had high school teams that could beat Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
	In the evening Ventura talked politics over pizza in a private  
session with about 70 undergraduates, and he also took part in a 
town meeting discussion with CNBC's Chris Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who himself only briefly attended North Hennepin  
Community College in Minnesota, was invited to speak at Harvard by 
an Institute of Politics student advisory committee last November. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was flattered.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you had asked me at any point in my life if I'd be at  
Harvard talking politics I would have laughed at you,'' Ventura 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said they find Ventura refreshing.  
</P>
<P>
	``The average political talk show guest seems like a member of  
an accounting firm, but when you see Governor Ventura on there, 
it's something very different,'' said C.J. Mahoney, a Harvard 
senior from Russell, Kan., and vice chairman of the advisory 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	That candor has won Ventura fans, but has also ruffled feathers.  
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has been barraged with criticism since he told Playboy  
that organized religion is a ``crutch for weak-minded people, that 
legalizing drugs and prostitution should be considered and that the 
Navy's Tailhook sexual-assault scandal was ``much ado about 
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He came under more fire Wednesday for saying in the interview  
that he didn't read books by Ernest Hemingway because the writer 
killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen too many people fight for their lives. I have no  
respect for anyone who would kill himself,'' Ventura said. ``If 
you're a feeble, weak-minded person to begin with, I don't have 
time for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota state Sen. Bob Lessard, whose daughter killed herself  
last month, said he was ``astounded and stunned'' and hoped Ventura 
would reconsider his remarks. ``I know my daughter wasn't 
weak-minded,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura refused to comment about his remarks in the interview,  
but he did say: ``Losing a child is the hardest possible thing a 
family can endure. Terry (his wife) and I offer our deepest 
sympathies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura also stood by his comments to Playboy on religion.  
</P>
<P>
	``What I was referring to is there's not necessarily a bad  
connotation on being weak-minded,'' he said in answer to a 
student's question at the CNBC forum Wednesday night. ``If faith 
and religion fill that void for you, you obviously need it.''

	``Low Budget,'' ``One for the Road,'' ``Give the People What  
They Want,'' ``State of Confusion,'' ``Word of Mouth'' 
(Velvel-Koch/Konk) -- The Kinks 

</P>
<P>
	The troubled Velvel Records label has created some of its best  
business in the past two years by re-releasing the extensive Kinks 
catalog, chunk by delicious chunk. The latest release, five CDs 
originally issued by Arista between 1978 and 1985, represents one 
of the venerable rock band's more interesting -- and less-recognized 
-- periods. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the Kinks' second, more mature life, the one that got  
them on the radio again with songs like the recession lament ``Low 
Budget,'' and, a few years later, the angry ``Destroyer'' and the 
sweet, quirky mini-memoir ``Come Dancing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left behind are the stylized, artsy chords of ``Waterloo  
Sunset'' and ``Sunny Afternoon,'' earlier Ray Davies classics. In 
their place are bang-the-gong social commentaries like the Grateful 
Dead homage ``A Gallon of Gas,'' ``A Little Bit of Abuse'' and the 
delightfully sneering anti-Reagan-era ``Young Conservatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the ballads jam. The elegiac ``Celluloid Heroes,''  
performed live on ``One for the Road,'' has a backbeat not present 
in the studio version; same story with ``Misfits'' and the haunting 
``Yo-Yo'' from ``Give the People What They Want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davies, who loves irony (listen to earlier albums like  
``Arthur'' or ``Village Green Preservation Society'') is more 
overtly sarcastic here. He can still be gentle, but more often he 
bites. He turns his songwriting techniques -- used for 15 years to 
critique the Empire -- toward American culture while retaining his 
Muswell Hill sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	No puffery here; the Kinks' class-bashing lyricism, so suited to  
England, translates perfectly into a late-1970s/early-'80s 
indictment of American excess and the rising nihilism of consumer 
culture. One background chorus does this explicitly: ``Gucci, 
Gucci, Gucci, yeah! Cartier! Cartier!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing rocks better than ``One for the Road,'' the 1980  
live-concert album that presaged the Journey/Foreigner sound and 
reinterpreted earlier Kinks songs with a driving pulse that uses -- 
but never overindulges in -- the disco beats of the age. 
</P>
<P>
	In the live ``Prince of the Punks,'' Davies skewers the  
still-nascent punk movement and its bandwagon mentality, full of 
people who ``failed the blues'' and ``couldn't handle modern jazz 
'cause it played in difficult keys'': ``He talks working class but 
it's all baloney; he's really middle-class and he's just a phony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Kinks' rendition of Davies' ``Stop Your Sobbing,''  
recorded later in a more popular version by his onetime love, 
Chrissy Hynde, has little of her version's melancholy. When Davies 
sings, ``It's time for you to laugh instead of cryin','' the 
disdain drips. It's not a plea; it's a demand. 
</P>
<P>
	It's fascinating to watch the group's evolution within the space  
of these albums. ``Low Budget'' is defined by its '70s-recession 
angst. ``One for the Road'' has the power of a veteran band feeding 
off its audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give the People What They Want'' has an exuberant dudgeon to  
it, a refreshing arrogance. ``State of Confusion,'' deeper into the 
'80s, is tinged with embitterment and loss. Though the cockeyed 
Davies optimism remains, it is muted with autumnal themes like 
alienation, broken relationships and musings about the individual's 
place in an increasingly bewildering world. The final CD, ``Word of 
Mouth,'' seems almost joyless. Except for two tracks, ``Do It 
Again'' and ``Living on a Thin Line,'' it's the least memorable of 
the five CDs. 
</P>
<P>
	And Davies' voice grows more gravelly with each passing album;  
by ``Give the People What They Want,'' it grinds like an 
instrument, the perfect companion to brother Dave's spirited 
electric guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	That album ends with a gentle, optimistic song called ``Better  
Things,'' which promises of ``good things happening up ahead.'' 
But, for the Kinks, this was the last sustained period of genius. 
Put aside an afternoon and swallow these five in one gulp; it'll be 
worth your time.

	``In the Life of Chris Gaines'' (Capitol) -- Garth Brooks  

</P>
<P>
	Is this the loopiest career move of the 1990s, or what?  
</P>
<P>
	Country star Garth Brooks, perhaps tired of being country star  
Garth Brooks, dons a wig and adopts an elaborate new persona: He's 
Chris Gaines, rock superstar, releasing his greatest hits. 
</P>
<P>
	The story is remarkably detailed: Gaines is the Australian son  
of an Olympic swimmer and coach, who moved to Los Angeles when he 
was 5. He launched a musical career -- quite successful, of course -- 
in the mid-1980s and piled up hits on albums like ``Fornucopia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	My, my, my. Now this disc is nothing if not competent --  
chillingly so in spots. Brooks hires top producer Don Was and 
plenty of studio pros, to record songs that sound like outtakes on 
albums by Babyface, Tom Petty, Fleetwood Mac and others. His 
execution of ``Right Now,'' with verses in rap and a chorus swiped 
from the 1960s classic, ``Get Together,'' betrays a remarkably 
astute observer of the pop music scene; why didn't Puff Daddy think 
of that? 
</P>
<P>
	This never fails to sound decent. The trouble is, you can't  
believe a word, and that's what ultimately makes this project so 
infuriating. This is only an actor playing a role. 
</P>
<P>
	No one begrudges Brooks a diversion on his inexorable march  
toward becoming the best-selling artist of all time. A wild left 
turn in his music to flex his creative muscles, a revelation of 
what's behind the well-oiled Brooks machine, may even have won him 
some newfound critical respect ... even if Garth Brooks released 
some of the same music on Chris Gaines' album. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he chickened out. And you're only left with questions  
about his sanity.

<HEADLINE> Raptors Extend GM's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Raptors have given general manager  
Glen Grunwald a multiyear contract extension, The Globe and Mail 
reported in Thursday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported the Raptors will make a formal  
announcement at a news conference on Thursday at the Air Canada 
Centre. The contract is believed to be for at least three years and 
will make Grunwald one of the league's highest-paid GMs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Grunwald and head coach Butch Carter were entering the  
final years of their contracts. The Raptors are also expected to 
announce an extension for Carter within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's done a very good job in rehabilitating this  
franchise,'' said Billy Diamond, the New Jersey-based agent for 
forward Charles Oakley. ``Really, that's what he did. He came into 
a disaster area and rebuilt it. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunwald, the team's vice president and general manager, has  
been with the Raptors since 1994. He was brought into the 
organization by Isiah Thomas, the Raptors' former general manager 
and part owner. 
</P>
<P>
	He took over as general manager of the Raptors in November,  
1997, after Thomas left the club over a dispute with former partner 
Allan Slaight.

<HEADLINE> Animal May Have Dragged Missing Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUSTIC, Colo. (AP) -- A boy missing for five days on the rugged  
slopes of a Colorado canyon may have been dragged off by a mountain 
lion, a sheriff's spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trackers on Wednesday found what they believe may be the foot  
and handprints of 3-year-old Jaryd Atadero on a steep slope on one 
side of the South Fork of the Poudre River. They also found 
mountain lion tracks nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Jaryd was a victim of a mountain lion or cougar and it  
dragged him off that would explain why we haven't found him,'' said 
Sgt. Justin Smith of the Larimer County Sheriff's Office, which is 
leading the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the search will continue, however.  
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the prints was the first time searchers had  
found any sign of Jaryd, who disappeared Saturday in the mountains 
75 miles northwest of Denver while on an outing with family and 
friends. Jaryd was running up the trail to hide behind boulders and 
trees so he could jump out from his hiding place and say ``Boo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 70 searchers have repeatedly searched terrain so rugged  
search dogs must wear pads. 
</P>
<P>
	The search area was extended Wednesday to about a 1,000 yards on  
each side of the trail the boy was last seen on. It initially 
covered only about 100 yards on each side. Searchers also went 
three miles farther up the trail. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10-year-old Lakewood boy was killed in 1997 by a mountain lion  
in Rocky Mountain National Park and an 18-year-old man died in 1991 
in a similar attack near Idaho Springs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nuclear Industry Spotlighted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two nuclear accidents in less than a week  
halfway around the world came as America's nuclear industry has 
been largely free of embarrassments and, in fact, has successfully 
pushed for less federal regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The question looming among industry executives and federal  
regulators is whether the incidents in Japan and South Korea will 
have an impact on a U.S. industry that many believe already is in 
its twilight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shouldn't have any impact,'' insists Steve Kerrikas, a  
spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, the nuclear power 
industry trade group. ``For more than a decade now we have been 
achieving steady, consistent gains in safety and operating 
performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some industry watchdog groups say the events in Japan and  
South Korea -- though themselves very different -- sent ominous 
message and warnings about the safety of nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	``They reinforce the reality that the root cause of nuclear  
accidents is human error. It always has been and always will be,'' 
says Michael Mariotte, director of the Nuclear Information and 
Resources Service, a watchdog group often critical of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	He argues that the incidents, in which human error led to  
workers -- and in the case of Japan also the public -- being exposed 
to radiation, raises renewed questions about ``a nuclear culture 
that says we're not going to have any problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Japan incident at a nuclear fuel processing plant was by far  
the most serious. Errors by workers, who apparently fail to follow 
regulations, led to an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction at the 
plant, exposing dozens of people to radiation and forcing the 
evacuation of hundreds of others. Three workers were seriously 
injured from radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Korea, 22 workers were exposed to a small amount of  
radiation when radioactive water spilled while a pump valve was 
being repaired. The water was contained inside the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. nuclear safety officials are monitoring both incidents, but  
are most interested in the Japan ``criticality'' accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what impact it's going to have on any of the  
United States (fuel) plants. We're just going to look at what 
happened and if anything like it could happen here,'' said Mindey 
Landau, a spokeswoman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuclear experts noted that U.S. power plants are designed  
differently than the Korean plant, which is a Canadian ``Candu'' 
reactor. The incident in Japan involved apparent negligence in 
processing uranium much more highly enriched than the uranium 
processed for power reactors in U.S. fabrication plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some of the nuclear industry's critics suggest the  
Japanese case may raise questions as to whether the Japanese 
industry was adequately monitored by regulators, and to what extent 
industry should be trusted to self-regulate no matter what country 
it's in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until last week Japan and South Korea were considered nations  
with modern nuclear programs. You didn't see the U.S. nuclear 
industry looking down on these countries,'' said Mariotte. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japan and South Korea accidents came as the NRC is revamping  
the way it monitors and regulates the U.S. nuclear industry, making 
many changes that the industry for years has sought. While NRC 
officials insist that safety will not be compromised, some nuclear 
critics have voiced concern that the agency may end up relying too 
heavily on industry self-regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the change, less attention will be given to plants  
with good operating and safety record and NRC focus will be on 
specific areas of greatest risk to plant safety. The new system is 
being tested in a pilot program at nine power plants and may be 
expanded to all plants perhaps as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
	NRC and industry officials say the incidents in Japan and South  
Korea should not have any impact on the NRC's adoption of the 
planned regulatory changes. To equate the two, says Kerrikas, the 
industry spokesman, ``is to compare apples and oranges.''

<HEADLINE> Charges Filed Against Paper Thief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New federal charges were brought Wednesday  
against a New York City man convicted of stealing papers signed by 
Thomas Edison, Thomas Jefferson and others after he allegedly tried 
to sell more documents to a Connecticut antiques dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI complaint said Daniel Spiegelman contacted a Greenwich,  
Conn., store last Friday and tried to sell stolen manuscripts and 
letters worth about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Items signed by five presidents -- Jefferson, James Monroe,  
Andrew Jackson, James Polk and John Quincy Adams -- were offered 
along with scientific papers of Edison and a rare manuscript, all 
stolen from Columbia University, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Greenwich charged Spiegelman last week after the owner  
of Alexander Autographs Inc. in Greenwich said a man identifying 
himself as Andrew Osharksy had offered items that he recognized to 
be part of the stolen Columbia collection, authorities said. 
Prosecutors said Osharksy is an alias used by Spiegelman. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal charges against Spiegelman allege that he illegally  
transported stolen documents acrosss state lines for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Fallick, a lawyer for Spiegelman, declined to comment  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiegelman was sentenced to five years in prison in July 1998  
after he was convicted of stealing $1.3 million worth of historical 
documents from Columbia University's Rare Collection Library in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was arrested Friday, Spiegelman was in a pre-release  
program and living under federal supervision in a Manhattan halfway 
house.

<HEADLINE> Ashley Judd's Public, Private Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tears well in Ashley Judd's eyes.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sorry, I'm tired,'' she says, alluding to the early mornings  
and long days of flogging her latest movie, a publicity push that 
paid off with the critically savaged ``Double Jeopardy'' becoming 
the nation's No. 1 box-office attraction in its first two weekends 
at theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	She's also tired of personal questions, expressing discomfort,  
if not unwillingness, when asked to talk about herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mean just the messes,'' she was saying as her eyes  
began filling up a moment earlier. ``I even said to Mom ..., `You 
know let's not sing our special songs. Because that's our stuff. 
And if you don't protect yourself you're not going to have anything 
left.' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing for our Thanksgiving recipes to be published in  
a cookbook. But it's another thing for all the anecdotes to be made 
public. And I would much prefer to have a very private and very 
separate life from my work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She acknowledges that's difficult since her mother and sister,  
Naomi and Wynonna, have their own celebrity status. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashley's love life has been -- and remains -- tabloid fodder, too,  
which bothers her to the point that she says she dreams about 
killing paparazzi. But she's been willing to talk about how tough 
things were for the three women before The Judds became country 
music stars. 
</P>
<P>
	So that proverbial line in the sand she's drawing can look  
rather zig-zaggy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growing up is growing up. It is what it is,'' she says,  
stopping the tears before they streak her cheek. ``And at some 
point in your life, you take a little inventory and say: `That was 
OK; that was a little rough.' But you grow up and put it all behind 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't all that bad, though. Her grandparents were  
comfortable financially, so they could afford to bring the girls on 
vacation or buy outfits for school even while their mother was 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	After sampling a couple of Krispy Kreme doughnuts, the  
31-year-old actress notes how she can point to fond remembrances, 
``whether it's chocolate pudding, or sparklers in the front yard as 
the crickets come up and the sun goes down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You take both your cherished memories and the stuff you wish  
hadn't happened in the first place and try to smooth those into all 
positives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One way she's done that is by talking pointedly and directly  
with both her mother and sister about the good and the bad they 
shared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every family should do it. But we're a very expressive group  
of women anyhow. So it shouldn't come as any surprise to anybody 
that we talk about everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for what was said and how it was said, Judd draws that line:  
``I don't care to talk about it. It's private between my family and 
me. Thank you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judd, who also stars in the upcoming film ``Eye of the  
Beholder,'' says the recently reported chasm between her and her 
mother over the sexiness of Ashley's roles was ``trumped up,'' an 
effort to drive a wedge between them. 
</P>
<P>
	She says her mother saw both of her new movies in the same day  
and ``cried her head off all day with joy and pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judd talks about sister Wynonna with great affection, saying,  
``She's my buddy,'' with a girlish caress in her voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did her homework. She sat on me,'' she says, smiling.  
</P>
<P>
	And she shoots down any notions about sibling rivalries. ``We  
didn't really have anything about which to rival. She's my hero 
from the time I was very small. She would go to the school then I 
would go play school in her bedroom because I missed her. I just 
basically wanted to be with her all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a really cool sister in that she let me be friends  
with her friends. And she'd include me whether they were going out 
to drive around or try to get into trouble. I got to be in on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Judd says she always had her own interests and pursuits,  
becoming an honors student in college before getting into acting. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving Kentucky, she took the requisite waitressing and  
receptionist jobs in Los Angeles, then snagged roles in the TV 
series ``Sisters'' and ``Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her break in feature films came in director Victor Nunez's 1993  
critically acclaimed independent picture, ``Ruby in Paradise.'' She 
won an Independent Spirit Award for best actress that year, then 
was cast as Val Kilmer's wife in the 1995 film ``Heat,'' and as 
another wife, to Matthew McConaughey, in ``A Time to Kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996 she received an Emmy nomination for her role as Norma  
Jean in the HBO movie ``Norma Jean and Marilyn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her biggest role in a studio film before ``Double Jeopardy''  
came in 1997's ``Kiss the Girls'' opposite Morgan Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Judd downplays talk of this being her meatiest role to date and  
how its success could mark a watershed in her career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel that way,'' she says, even though ``a certain  
amount of footage or whatever would suggest otherwise to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that in terms of public perception and whatnot this is  
a very big deal,'' she says. ``But I've been chugging along quite 
happily through my little body of work, feeling that each thing is 
a gem to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Jodie Foster gave up the ``Double Jeopardy'' lead because  
of pregnancy, director Bruce Beresford and studio executives were 
concerned about whether Judd -- or someone else -- could carry the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yes, this was much discussed,'' Beresford said in a  
separate interview. ``The names were bandied back and forth for 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the names were sent up and shot down like skeet with various  
reasoning: ``They hate her in Europe. ... She's definitely too old. 
...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all very capricious,'' he allows.  
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, Judd pulled off the role, doing her own stunts  
and having just two days off during the entire shoot. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that surprised Beresford was that ``she brought a  
charming level of emotion in the scenes with the child. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's very hard to do when you're cuddling a child who's not  
your kid,'' he said. ``The genuine warmth she felt for the kid, and 
the tears that came to her, was something that was pleasantly 
unexpected.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Opens Tennessee Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore today officially  
moved his campaign headquarters to Tennessee, recalling his roots 
as he sought to bring new energy to his bid for the White House. 
``Home is where we start from,'' he declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, dressed casually in a blue knit sport shirt and cowboy  
boots, proclaimed ``it's a new day'' and the start of a new phase 
of his campaign, which has been stung in recently weeks by polls 
and fund-raising reports showing that Bill Bradley has become a 
formidable challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we start a new task, organizing from the grass roots up,''  
he said to the cheers of supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to Tennessee is part of Gore's attempt to shake his  
image as a Beltway insider, distance himself from President Clinton 
and retool a top-heavy campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced today that he had selected Donna Brazile, one of  
the Democratic Party's most experienced grass-roots organizers, as 
his new campaign manager. The appointment of Brazile, who is black, 
helps diversify Gore's inner circle, which has been criticized for 
being top heavy with white males. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 people, including his 87-year-old mother, Pauline,  
gathered today to hear Gore speak at the opening. A band from a 
local high school provided music. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Hampton of Marion County, wearing an orange ``Al Gore for  
President'' hat, said he's known Gore all his life. ``He's 
experienced, he knows what he's talking about, he knows the needs 
of the people,'' Hampton said, acknowledging he knows nothing about 
Bradley.. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Anderson of Nashville said it was good for Gore to get  
``back to his roots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you get lost in Washington,'' Anderson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Though Gore was born and raised in Washington, he considers  
Tennessee his home. As a boy, he spent summers working on his 
family's farm in Carthage, about 50 miles east of Nashville. As a 
young man, he worked as a reporter at The Tennessean in Nashville 
before being elected to the U.S. House in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	He represented Tennessee in both the House and the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	``Home is not only a place it's an idea,'' Gore said. ``Home is  
where we start from. Home is where we learn our values. It's where 
we turn to remember ourselves in the best sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore renewed his challenge to Bradley to meet him in a series of  
debates. ``We could even have a debate right here in Nashville,'' 
he said. ``I think that would be a good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning Tuesday in New York, Gore called for preschool for  
every child, ``family friendly'' policies at work and other steps 
to ease the burden on working parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, addressing a Manhattan fund-raising luncheon, promised to  
put the concerns of families at the top of his agenda if he becomes 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do not understand the fatigue of the American working  
woman, then you don't deserve to be president of the United 
States,'' he told a mostly female crowd of about 600 supporters. 
``If you elect me president, I will honor your struggle by making 
it easier to be a good worker and a good parent at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, fighting former Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, said he wanted to further women's rights 
by ensuring equal pay for equal work, keeping abortion legal and 
offering help to those juggling the demands of jobs and family. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you elect me president, I will make available high-quality  
preschool for every child in every family across the United 
States,'' said Gore, who shared the stage with his daughter, 
Karenna Gore Schiff, a Columbia University law student and mother 
of a 3-month-old boy. ``It's the single best investment we can 
make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he wants to create tax incentives for employers that  
provide on-site day care or help to parents when child-care 
arrangements fall through. He also said he would encourage 
businesses to offer job shares, flexible schedules and 
telecommuting.

<HEADLINE> Braves 5, Astros 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Kevin Millwood is no longer an afterthought to  
Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz. After Wednesday, he 
deserves to be mentioned right along with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching one of the greatest postseason games in baseball  
history, Millwood threw a one-hitter -- facing only two batters 
above the minimum -- to give the Atlanta Braves a critical 5-1 
victory over the Houston Astros, evening the first-round series at 
one game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, pitching in the postseason for the first time, allowed  
a second-inning homer to Ken Caminiti but that was all. It was the 
first complete-game one-hitter in the postseason in 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed a big win today,'' the 24-year-old Millwood said.  
``It was probably the biggest game I have pitched in my career, so 
I would have to say it was my best performance ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No kidding.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was working,'' he said. ``My fastball was good. My  
curveball was good. My slider was good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood, 18-7 during the regular season, didn't pitch at all  
the last two postseasons while the Braves were knocked out in the 
NL championship series -- even though he won 17 games in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves couldn't pass him by this year. Millwood stepped up  
to become the Braves most consistent starter while Maddux, Glavine 
and Smoltz -- with seven Cy Youngs among them -- went through 
assorted struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I slept pretty good last night,'' Millwood said. ``I thought  
it was going to be kind of tough to get to sleep, but I think some 
of the nervous energy I worked up during the day kind of wore me 
out. I slept good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And pitched even better, throwing the first complete game  
one-hitter in the postseason since Game 2 of the 1967 World Series. 
Boston's Jim Lonborg beat the St. Louis Cardinals 5-0, allowing a 
double to Julian Javier with two outs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Glavine and Mark Wohlers combined on a one-hitter for the  
Braves against Cleveland in Game 6 of the 1995 World Series. The 
were two other combined one-hitters in LCS play. 
</P>
<P>
	``A stronger game has not been pitched against us all year  
long,'' Houston manager Larry Dierker said. ``We really only hit 
two balls hard the whole game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Braves desperate for a victory after losing the first  
game 6-1 Tuesday, Millwood retired 15 batters in a row after 
Caminiti's homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The streak was broken when third baseman Chipper Jones booted a  
grounder with one out in the seventh, but the error didn't bother 
his pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Millwood got the next two batters on grounders. The Braves broke  
open a 2-1 game with three runs in the bottom half on Brian 
Jordan's sacrifice fly and run-scoring singles by Ryan Klesko and 
Andruw Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-5 series shifts to the Astrodome, where the next two  
games will be played Friday and Saturday. If a fifth game is 
needed, it would be at Turner Field on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us confidence going into Houston,'' Jordan said. ``I  
mean, momentum has switched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan and Klesko flip-flopped in the batting order, a move that  
paid off with two RBIs from Jordan, hitting fourth instead of 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko, dropped from the cleanup spot, had three hits, scored  
twice and drove in a run. 
</P>
<P>
	But everyone was overshadowed by Millwood, who flirted with a  
no-hitter several times during the regular season, allowing only 
two hits in four separate starts. 
</P>
<P>
	He went at least six innings in every start after June 28.  
Overall, Millwood finished second in the NL to Arizona's Randy 
Johnson with a 2.68 ERA and led the majors by allowing a .202 
average to hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a dominant pitcher,'' Jordan said. ``We needed a big  
game from our pitcher and he came up with a big game for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves got to Houston starter Jose Lima in the first inning,  
with Gerald Williams scoring on Jordan's two-out, broken-bat 
single. Lima might have been flustered by a visit from third-base 
umpire Bruce Froemming before the very first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Froemming noticed a stain on the right hip of Lima's uniform and  
walked over to check it out. The umpire appeared to touch the spot 
with a finger before allowing Lima to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have been checking the side of my pants all year,'' said  
Lima, who said the stain was simply dirt. ``I don't have to cheat 
to win ball games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lima, 21-10 during the regular season but 0-2 against the  
Braves, went 6 2-3 innings, allowing four runs and nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti, who hit a three-run homer in the ninth inning Tuesday  
to seal Houston's victory, burned the Braves again in the second 
inning. On a 1-2 pitch, Millwood tried to sneak a fastball over the 
inside corner, and it wound up in the right-field seats. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be his only mistake.  
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Perez's sacrifice fly in the sixth broke a 1-1 tie. Andruw  
Jones had the key hit in the inning, a double that broke his 
0-for-20 slump in division series play. It was Atlanta's first 
extra-base hit of this series. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The crowd of 41,913 was larger than Game 1, but still the  
second-smallest in Atlanta postseason history. ... The Braves broke 
a four-game home losing streak in the playoffs. ... Only once in 
the 1990s have the Braves won a postseason series after losing the

<HEADLINE> Labonte Completes Poles Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Just when Bobby Labonte needed a boost in  
his Winston Cup title bid, along comes one of his favorite tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte won the top starting spot for the UAW-GM Quality 500 on  
Wednesday night, completing a season sweep of poles at Lowe's Motor 
Speedway at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we had all the tracks figured out like this,'' said  
Labonte, who in 1995 got the first victory of his Winston Cup 
career on Charlotte's 1.5-mile, high-banked trioval. 
</P>
<P>
	But Labonte hasn't been able to figure out Dale Jarrett, who has  
parlayed 23 top-10 finishes into a 251-point lead over Labonte atop 
the 1999 driver standings. 
</P>
<P>
	With six races left this season, Labonte knows he needs some  
help. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we can do is run the best we can and hope things work  
out,'' Labonte said. ``Dale's got too good of a team and he's too 
good of a driver for something to happen the rest of the way. But 
if he does slip up, we've got to be in a place to take advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte turned a fast lap of 185.682 mph in his Joe Gibbs-owned  
Pontiac to edge Rusty Wallace in first-round qualifying for 
Sunday's 500-mile event. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte's run made him the first driver in the 40-year history  
of the track to win the pole for all three Winston Cup events in 
the same year. Labonte also started up front for The Winston 
all-star event and the Coca-Cola 600, both held in late May at 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain places that you just have special places in  
your heart for and you do good at those places, and this is one of 
those,'' Labonte said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace said he was satisfied with 185.033 mph, mainly because  
it was a significant improvement over what he had been able to do 
in his Ford in practice runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I could run that quick,'' he said. ``The car  
was perfect when I qualified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Andretti, defending UAW-GM 500 champion Mark Martin and  
Tony Stewart, the runaway leader in the 1999 rookie of the year 
standings, rounded out the top five qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett was ninth-fastest at 183.680.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's a pretty good lap,'' he said. ``That will get us in a  
decent spot, and we can get ready to race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having an unusually poor run was Jeff Gordon, winner of six  
poles at Charlotte. Gordon qualified a distant 22nd with a lap of 
182.506, one week after winning at Martinsville Speedway in his 
first event with new crew chief Brian Whitesell. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time we were here in May, we didn't qualify very  
good, either,'' Gordon said. ``We used to be able to knock off some 
awesome laps here. I'm not sure what's changed. We just haven't had 
that good feel where you can drive that thing in deep and jump back 
in the throttle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The list of those who failed to make the field Wednesday night,  
when the top 25 spots for Sunday's starting grid were set, included 
Jeff Burton, winner of this year's Coca-Cola 600. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton's Ford got loose between the first and second turns, and  
even though he was able to save it, he finished with a speed of 
175.262. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Nemechek's speed of 179.677 also wasn't fast enough to  
qualify, but that wasn't his only problem. Nemechek slammed into 
the concrete retaining wall coming out of the fourth turn, and his 
Chevrolet caught fire as he took the checkered flag to complete his 
one-lap run. 
</P>
<P>
	Nemechek was uninjured, but the car was damaged so extensively  
that his team planned to switch to a backup for today's second 
round of time trials, when the rest of the 43-car starting grid was 
to be set.

<HEADLINE> Gore Appoints New Campaign Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, who continues to  
reshuffle his struggling presidential campaign, has selected Donna 
Brazile to be his new campaign manager, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile replaces Craig Smith, a longtime aide to President  
Clinton who did not want to move to Tennessee with the campaign. 
Smith will head Gore's transition to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile's appointment was to be announced by Gore today at a  
ribbon-cutting ceremony at his new Nashville, Tenn., headquarters, 
said two campaign officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile is one of the Democratic Party's most experienced  
grass-roots organizers. The appointment of Brazile, who is black, 
helps diversify Gore's inner circle, which has been criticized for 
being top heavy with white males. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile, who is in her early 40s, is former chief of staff and  
political adviser to Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington, D.C.'s 
delegate to the House. She is an adjunct political science 
professor at the University of Maryland, a member of Democratic 
National Committee and longtime associate of the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile designed voter-campaign assessment program for the  
Democratic House campaign committee, which helped increase minority 
voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Orleans native, she holds an undergraduate degree from  
Louisiana State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazile resigned as deputy national field director for Michael  
Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign after making comments 
about the personal life of his Republican opponent, then-Vice 
President George Bush. Bush is the father of George W. Bush, the 
GOP front-runner in the 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, and media adviser, Carter  
Eskew, retained their jobs in the transition to Tennessee. Gore 
ordered the move to shake up his campaign after rival Bill Bradley 
of New Jersey caught him in polls and money-raising. He replaced 
his pollster, Mark Penn, and plans to thin out his campaign staff.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Acquires Communist Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Harvard University scholars who heralded  
the acquisition of documents from the Communist Party archives in 
the former Soviet Union have learned they are playing second fiddle 
to Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard's news release Tuesday called the documents ``previously  
classified,'' but The Boston Globe reported Wednesday that the 25 
million sheets of material are copies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stanford University-affiliated Hoover Institution of War,  
Revolution and Peace has had most of the material for the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have more than them,'' said a Hoover archivist, Lora  
Soroka. ``Of course we do. It's our project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When told the Hoover Institute has had the archival material for  
years, Marshall Goldman, associate director of Harvard's David 
Center for Russian Studies, said, ``Oh, brother. That's 
embarrassing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard collection was named in honor of George and Abby  
O'Neill, who donated $600,000 to acquire the materials. The 
materials will be stored on 10,000 reels of microfilm. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Goldman, the deal was quickly put together in April  
with the impression that Harvard was getting material not available 
outside of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bang, bang, bang, we wrote the letter to the dean and  
then went and sought funding,'' Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Russian scholars at Harvard wrote a letter to the Arts and  
Sciences dean, Jeremy R. Knowles, on April 7, urging the university 
to buy the microfilm collection by April 15, the deadline imposed 
by the seller, the London-based firm of Chadwyck-Healey. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said, ``Due to the closed nature of the Soviet  
system, no North American library has been able to acquire archival 
materials relating to the Soviet Union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter mentioned the Hoover Institute only once, saying it  
``had financed the microfilming, and will have a complete set.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman said he assumed from the letter that Hoover did not yet  
have the information that Harvard wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection includes the archives of the Gulag, the system of  
Soviet forced labor camps; documents from the organization 
responsible for internal purges of the Communist Party; the 
archives of the Soviet police; and a variety of records detailing 
deliberations within Communist leadership from 1903 through the 
Gorbachev period of the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Brister's Back As Broncos' Starter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos switched quarterbacks again, as  
coach Mike Shanahan today replaced Brian Griese with veteran Bubby 
Brister. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think this is the best thing for our football team  
right now,'' Shanahan said. ``We think this is going to give us a 
chance to win now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, 37, was the heir apparent to replace the retired John  
Elway. But on Aug. 30, after four of Denver's five preseason games, 
Shanahan benched Brister in favor of the Griese, who threw just 
three passes as a rookie last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos went 0-4 under Griese, along the way losing standout  
linebacker John Mobley and league MVP Terrell Davis to 
season-ending knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, what can we do to give us the best chance to  
get out of this slump?'' Shanahan said. ``Brian played well on 
Sunday and we had a chance to have four touchdowns in the first 
half. But the bottom line is, we didn't get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister vowed to get the team back on track.  
</P>
<P>
	Griese, 24, said he was surprised by the decision but added, ``I  
understand that we're 0-4 and something needs to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griese now becomes the backup, and veteran Chris Miller remains  
No. 3.

	Factory Orders Rise 1.3 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to U.S. factories vaulted ahead in  
August on the strength of higher demand for airplanes and 
electronics in another sign of a resurgence in manufacturing. The 
1.3 percent gain in factory orders was the 12th increase in the 
past 15 months, the Commerce Department said today. Analysts had 
generally expected factory orders to rise 0.6 percent. Even that 
would have been brisk. ``This is a pace that ensures significant 
production increases for the rest of the year and into 2000,'' said 
economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers. The report, 
along with other recent manufacturing data, shows ``that 
manufacturing is really healing from the global downturn from the 
past year or so,'' said economist Cliff Waldman of Waldman 
Associates in Arlington, Va.

investors were looking forward to third-quarter earnings reports 
that are starting to trickle in. Internet search engine Yahoo! was

	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. and a rural wireless company are  
teaming up to acquire American Cellular Corp., an operator of small 
Cellular One franchises in 10 states. The price tag of $2.32 
billion includes cash contributions of $370 million each from AT&AMP;T 
and partner Dobson Communications of Oklahoma City. The remainder 
will be funded through bank debt. American Cellular has about 
398,000 subscribers in New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan,

<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Although aluminum shipments dropped during  
Alcoa's third quarter, the company reported a 19 percent rise in 
earnings on the strength of lower production costs. The world's 
biggest aluminum producer said today it earned $259.1 million, or 
69 cents a share, compared to $217.7 million or 61 cents a share in 
the same quarter a year ago. The results met analysts' but Alcoa 
stock fell anyhow, perhaps because of the decline in shipments. 
Revenues fell 1.4 percent to $4.05 billion. Alcoa stock was down 2 7/8 
at 61 1/4 this afternoon.

	DETROIT (AP) -- For the first time since contract talks began  
earlier this year between automakers and the United Auto Workers, a 
deadline to reach an agreement has been set. The UAW on yesterday 
in effect set a strike deadline of 11:59 p.m. EDT Friday against 
Ford Motor Co., saying it would not extend its contract beyond then 
-- a sign talks could be intensifying. A spokesman for Ford said the 
union made the decision and talks recessed for the day. More talks 
were scheduled today. Union officials could not be reached for 
comment.

Hargrove said at a news conference in Toronto that the deal reached 
late yesterday was modeled on an agreement union members ratified

At the FCC, regulators will look at the transaction to see whether 
the merged company serves the public interest. William Kennard, the

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With less than three months to go, several  
states are pushing up against the Jan. 1 deadline in their scramble 
to ensure Y2K computer problems do not disrupt basic public 
services, officials said at a House hearing Wednesday. The 
officials stressed that states generally have done a good job in 
either fixing computers or installing backup systems to prevent 
interruptions in such services as food stamps, Medicaid payments, 
unemployment benefits and child nutrition programs. But Joel 
Williamson of the General Accounting Office, the investigative wing 
of Congress, also said some state completion dates are so close to 
the turn of the century as to increase the risk of disruption.

<HEADLINE> Death Recommended for Child Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- A remorseless drifter who killed a  
9-year-old boy in a beach restroom should die for his crime, jurors 
recommended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Wilson, 21, who slashed Matthew Cecchi's throat, stabbed  
him in the back and left him to bleed to death, told jurors they 
should execute him because he would kill again. He smiled slightly 
as the verdict was read. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson killed the third-grade Oroville boy in November 1998 and  
said he would ``do it again in a second if I had the chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole purpose in life is to help destroy your society. You  
people are here as representatives of that society. As such, you 
should do everything in your power to rid the world of me. Execute 
me,'' Wilson told jurors during testimony in the penalty phase of 
his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel of six men and six women deliberated for five hours  
over two days before reaching the verdict. Jury foreman Gene Wagner 
said outside the courtroom that ``if there was ever a case that 
deserved the death penalty, this one's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge John Einhorn will make the final decision  
at a sentencing hearing Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	He can choose the lesser penalty, but judges usually follow the  
recommendations of juries, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The same jury last week found that Wilson was sane when he  
killed Matthew in the restroom at Oceanside Pier, north of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson admitted during his arraignment that he murdered the boy.  
He said he smiled at him after following him into the restroom and 
then snuck up on him from behind as the boy stood at the urinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson of St. Croix Falls, Wis., claimed he was insane at the  
time, driven by hallucinogenic drugs and voices from God to kill. 
But his videotaped confession to police, which included his gleeful 
re-enactment of the killing and acknowledgment that murder was 
wrong, helped jurors to conclude he was sane. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury heard testimony from the boy's third-grade teacher and  
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Peck of Stanford Avenue School, described how she tried  
to comfort the boy's classmates and explain why he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Third-graders always ask why and that was a question I had no  
answer for,'' said Peck, who called Matthew a straight-A student 
and an extraordinary boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Cecchi recalled trying to comfort her son and to give him  
CPR as he lay bleeding. ``I put my hand on his hair and told him, 
'Hang in there baby. I love you,''' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Ismail Gives Dallas Another Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- In their 10th season together, Troy Aikman,  
Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin are still the heart and soul of the 
Dallas Cowboys offense and the focus of every opposing defense. 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly why Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail has been so  
successful this season. 
</P>
<P>
	With cornerbacks concentrating mostly on Irvin and safeties  
cheating up to stop Smith, Ismail has caught a team-high 13 passes 
for an NFL-best average of 22.2 yards per reception. 
</P>
<P>
	Although two of Ismail's catches have turned into touchdowns and  
several more have set up scores, defenses are still willing to 
leave him in single coverage to avoid being burned by Irvin or 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't gotten to the point yet where defenses are doubling  
Rocket and leaving Michael one-on-one on the other side,'' Cowboys 
coach Chan Gailey said. ``It takes time to change people's minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took Ismail two years in Canada and five NFL seasons before  
fulfilling the expectations that came with his superb career at 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with the Carolina Panthers last year, Ismail nearly  
doubled his previous career highs with 69 catches, 1,024 yards and 
eight touchdowns. He turned that into a seven-year, $21 million 
contract with Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Ismail, who doesn't speak to the  
media, said he was attracted to Dallas because he would play 
alongside players like Aikman, Smith and Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	That trio has been looking for a complementary fourth guy since  
Alvin Harper left after the 1994 season. Kevin Williams, Anthony 
Miller and Billy Davis were all busts as the No. 2 receiver because 
they failed to make teams pay for double-teaming Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	While defenses have been slow to focus on Ismail, Gailey knows  
they eventually will. So he's giving them a lot to worry about once 
they do. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail has caught deep passes and short ones, gone across the  
middle and turned into a running back on end arounds and reverses. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Ismail has gotten the ball 16 times. He's gained at  
least 10 yards on 10 of those plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's such a threat once he gets the football,'' Aikman said.  
``He helps us a tremendous amount. Teams begin having a difficult 
time knowing how to match up with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey began experimenting with Ismail on one of the first  
passes of the season, but he dropped a wide-open bomb. Gailey 
called the play again in overtime and it went for a 76-yard 
game-winning touchdown against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail had only one catch in the second game, but it was a  
38-yard gain on third-and-13 from Atlanta's 47 that set up a 2-yard 
touchdown run by Smith. The score put Dallas up 10-0 in an eventual 
24-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Arizona this past Sunday, the bomb returned as Ismail  
exploited 1-on-1 coverage by cornerback Corey Chavous for a 63-yard 
touchdown that put the Cowboys ahead 21-0 early in the second 
quarter. Gailey called for the play again on Dallas' next snap and 
would've gotten a 74-yard touchdown if the pass were thrown a yard 
deeper. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third quarter, Gailey went to Ismail on third-and-3 from  
the Cardinals' 15. On a play designed to get a first down, Ismail 
caught a swing pass, danced around would-be tacklers and made it to 
the 1. Smith scored on the next play as Dallas cruised to a 35-7 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rocket is a playmaker,'' Gailey said. ``I'm searching for more  
and more ways to use the guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once defenses start paying more attention to Ismail, they'll  
have to give less attention to Smith or Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey can't wait.  
</P>
<P>
	``When they do,'' Gailey said, ``we plan to make them regret  
it.''

	Expert Says Shots Fired at Davidians  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a view that is at odds with the FBI's  
position that none of its agents fired shots during the 1993 siege 
at the Branch Davidian compound, an expert hired by a House 
committee says he believes an agent did just that. That view, 
expressed in an interview published in today's editions of The 
Washington Post. The expert in thermal imaging and videotape 
analysis, Carlos Ghigliotti, has done work for the FBI in the past. 
``I conclude that the FBI fired shots on that day,'' Ghigliotti 
told the Post in an interview conducted yesterday regarding the 
siege which killed about 80 people in the compound.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Authorities in London will soon resume a search  
for more bodies in the wreckage of yesterday's train crash that has 
killed at least 26 people. Authorities have not commented on what 
might have caused the collision between two packed commuter trains. 
But newspapers said the probe would look first at whether the 
driver of the outbound train ran a red light near the station. 
Detailed tests also were being performed on signaling equipment. A 
search for more victims in the mangled carriages is to resume 
today.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Chechnya's leader has declared martial law  
in the rebel republic in a bid to halt the advance of Russian 
troops, who were digging in today along a river north of Chechnya's 
capital, Grozny. The Russians say they've seized the northern third 
of Chechnya since entering the lawless territory last week in an 
effort to seal it off from the rest of Russia. The Russians today 
were fortifying positions on the northern bank of the Terek River, 
including a stronghold near the village of Chervlyonnaya, only 15 
miles northeast of Grozny. The Russian media has said the Russian 
troops may halt their incursion along this line.

	KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A memorial service for  
ethnic Albanians killed in an apparent Serb massacre turned into a 
riot when a group of Serbs passed by in traffic. At least one Serb 
was killed and 15 peacekeepers were injured. The confrontation 
Tuesday underscores the depth of ethnic hatred between Serbs and 
ethnic Albanians more than three months after NATO-led peacekeepers 
arrived in Kosovo. The rioting injured 11 French officers and four 
Russian soldiers, Michel de Clercq, a Belgian military spokesman, 
said today. The Russians were in town to pick up supplies. Eleven

<HEADLINE>  Ismail Gives Dallas Another Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- In their 10th season together, Troy Aikman,  
Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin are still the heart and soul of the 
Dallas Cowboys offense and the focus of every opposing defense. 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly why Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail has been so  
successful this season. 
</P>
<P>
	With cornerbacks concentrating mostly on Irvin and safeties  
cheating up to stop Smith, Ismail has caught a team-high 13 passes 
for an NFL-best average of 22.2 yards per reception. 
</P>
<P>
	Although two of Ismail's catches have turned into touchdowns and  
several more have set up scores, defenses are still willing to 
leave him in single coverage to avoid being burned by Irvin or 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't gotten to the point yet where defenses are doubling  
Rocket and leaving Michael one-on-one on the other side,'' Cowboys 
coach Chan Gailey said. ``It takes time to change people's minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took Ismail two years in Canada and five NFL seasons before  
fulfilling the expectations that came with his superb career at 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with the Carolina Panthers last year, Ismail nearly  
doubled his previous career highs with 69 catches, 1,024 yards and 
eight touchdowns. He turned that into a seven-year, $21 million 
contract with Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Ismail, who doesn't speak to the  
media, said he was attracted to Dallas because he would play 
alongside players like Aikman, Smith and Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	That trio has been looking for a complementary fourth guy since  
Alvin Harper left after the 1994 season. Kevin Williams, Anthony 
Miller and Billy Davis were all busts as the No. 2 receiver because 
they failed to make teams pay for double-teaming Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	While defenses have been slow to focus on Ismail, Gailey knows  
they eventually will. So he's giving them a lot to worry about once 
they do. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail has caught deep passes and short ones, gone across the  
middle and turned into a running back on end arounds and reverses. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Ismail has gotten the ball 16 times. He's gained at  
least 10 yards on 10 of those plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's such a threat once he gets the football,'' Aikman said.  
``He helps us a tremendous amount. Teams begin having a difficult 
time knowing how to match up with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey began experimenting with Ismail on one of the first  
passes of the season, but he dropped a wide-open bomb. Gailey 
called the play again in overtime and it went for a 76-yard 
game-winning touchdown against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail had only one catch in the second game, but it was a  
38-yard gain on third-and-13 from Atlanta's 47 that set up a 2-yard 
touchdown run by Smith. The score put Dallas up 10-0 in an eventual 
24-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Arizona this past Sunday, the bomb returned as Ismail  
exploited 1-on-1 coverage by cornerback Corey Chavous for a 63-yard 
touchdown that put the Cowboys ahead 21-0 early in the second 
quarter. Gailey called for the play again on Dallas' next snap and 
would've gotten a 74-yard touchdown if the pass were thrown a yard 
deeper. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third quarter, Gailey went to Ismail on third-and-3 from  
the Cardinals' 15. On a play designed to get a first down, Ismail 
caught a swing pass, danced around would-be tacklers and made it to 
the 1. Smith scored on the next play as Dallas cruised to a 35-7

<HEADLINE> Packers' Bidwell Unfazed by Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Josh Bidwell walked stiffly from the  
kitchen to the living room in the home of his girlfriend's parents, 
looking pale and weak. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should have seen me a week ago,'' he said, grinning. ``I'm  
feeling better every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Bay Packers punter is recovering from surgery to  
remove lymph nodes after he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell, 23, said the Packers assured him that the punter's job  
is his to lose during training camp next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gives me extra motivation,'' the former Oregon punter  
said. ``They know I am going to take enough pride in myself to get 
in shape and be an even better punter than I was this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell has taken inspiration from e-mails he received from  
Lance Armstrong, the Tour de France champion cyclist whose cancer 
was detected at a much more advanced stage than Bidwell's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lance said the effort it took him to get through his illness  
made him a better cyclist, because he had to work that much 
harder,'' Bidwell said. ``I'm excited to build myself back up. This 
is going to help me out in the long run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 14, Bidwell had surgery at Oregon Health Sciences  
University to remove lymph nodes from the right side of his 
stomach. This week, he began a series of chemotherapy treatments, 
after which doctors all but assured him he will be free of 
cancerous cells. 
</P>
<P>
	He has lost 25 pounds from his 6-foot-3, 225-pound frame, and  
said he will probably lose another 10 during chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe a little hair, too,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Since Bidwell left the team in preseason a week before the final  
cut, he was ineligible for the NFL Players Association medical 
insurance plan. The Packers tried to place him on injured reserve, 
which would have made him eligible for benefits, but the appeal was 
denied. Before Bidwell left Green Bay, general manager Ron Wolf 
told him the medical costs -- estimated at $60,000 -- would somehow 
get covered. 
</P>
<P>
	Within two days, players pledged $67,000. In addition, proceeds  
from the Packers' charity golf tournament will go toward Bidwell's 
medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the best organization in the NFL,'' Bidwell said. ``The  
support of the team and the players has been amazing.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Air Pilots Sue Am. Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Pilots of Reno Air Inc. have sued American  
Airlines, which has acquired the small West Coast carrier, and the 
union representing American pilots over where the newcomers rank on 
American's seniority list. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for 190 of Reno's 300 pilots contend in the lawsuit  
that Fort Worth, Texas-based American and the union conspired to 
keep the Reno crew members at the bottom of American's seniority 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed last week in U.S. District Court in Nevada,  
comes less than two months after Reno merged with American. It 
bought the struggling company in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Assignments of Reno's pilots in American's expanded fleet has  
been a source of bitter dispute between the Texas carrier and the 
Allied Pilots Association, which find themselves as codefendants in 
the lawsuit filed in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	Papers filed in the lawsuit contend that APA placed Reno pilots  
with more than 10,000 hours of flight experience below newly hired 
American second officers. And 157 Reno captains who had up to seven 
years' seniority with Reno were displaced in favor of American 
pilots, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the union and American deny the accusations.  
</P>
<P>
	Gregg Overman, a union spokesman, said Reno pilots -- regardless  
of experience -- were placed below any American pilot hired before 
Dec. 23, when American announced its acquisition of Reno Air. But, 
he said, the Reno pilots are ahead of 500 to 600 American pilots 
hired since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The union spokesman said Reno's pilots benefitted greatly from  
the merger with American, whose pay scale is roughly double that of 
Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reno Air was pretty shaky,'' Overman said. ``The Reno pilots  
didn't have a pension plan, we have one of the best in the 
industry. In compensation, they're getting a home run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Rader, an American spokeswoman, said Reno pilots are  
happy with the airline, which has negotiated in good faith with the 
pilots' union. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position from the beginning is that we would accept the  
seniority list that APA gave us,'' said Ms. Rader. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks a court order prohibiting American and APA  
from implementing the seniority list and also urges the court to 
award unspecified damages and to require American and the pilots' 
union to refer the matter to a neutral arbitrator if it is not 
resolved through negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	American, which acquired Reno Air for $124 million, began  
negotiating with its pilots' union about integration issues. After 
talks faltered, a pilots' sickout stranded hundreds of thousands of 
passengers around the globe and cost American $225 million before 
it was halted by a federal judge who fined the union.

<HEADLINE> Regulations Help Fight Acid Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Environmental regulations have reduced acid rain but have not  
yet spurred the recovery of damaged lakes and streams in North 
America, government researchers reported today in the journal 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is the first to show that reductions in sulfur dioxide  
emissions are directly related to reduced acidity in lakes and 
streams in Europe. As for the United States, which imposed its 
regulations later, researchers said the payoff is probably still in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The study could have important implications for efforts to  
further restrict sulfur emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Acid rain is created when sulfur dioxide, produced primarily by  
coal-burning power plants, and nitrogen-bearing gases, primarily 
from automobiles, combine with water vapor in the atmosphere. That 
creates acidic sulfate and nitrate solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	While minerals in the soil, like calcium, can neutralize some of  
the acid, the large amounts of acid rain over the last 100 years 
have resulted in acidic lakes and streams, harming plant and animal 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study, done by the Environmental Protection Agency,  
examined acidity in 205 lakes and streams in five regions of North 
America and three regions in Europe from 1980 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The best news is that the amount of acidic sulfates entering  
lakes and streams has declined everywhere, said chief author John 
Stoddard. 
</P>
<P>
	The data also showed a drop in acidity of lakes and streams in  
Europe and a North American region that includes eastern Maine and 
southern Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	However, no such recovery appeared in four other regions  
covering much of the area from eastern Manitoba through the upper 
Great Lakes to Quebec and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked only at the chemical properties of the water;  
it did not look at plant and animal life 
</P>
<P>
	Stoddard said the recovery of lakes and streams in North America  
was apparently stalled because the capacity of the soil to 
neutralize the acid was being depleted as fast as the sulfate 
levels were dropping. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what happened in Nordic countries during the 1980s,  
Stoddard said. ``Subsequently we have seen recoveries in the Nordic 
countries. We expect to see that in North America,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found virtually no changes in nitrates anywhere. They  
are not as strictly regulated as sulfates. The failure to reduce 
nitrates has seriously impeded the recovery of lakes and streams, 
Stoddard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Oppenheimer, a scientist with the Environmental Defense  
Fund, said the study proves that environmental laws do work and 
that to speed recovery of North American lakes and streams, 
stricter laws must be adopted in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA is expected to produce regulations by the end of the  
year that will reduce smog-causing pollution from older, dirtier 
coal-burning power plants. Stoddard said the new regulations are 
driven by studies like his. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dan Reidinger, a spokesman for the Edison Electric  
Institute, an association of privately owned electric companies, 
said it is too soon to impose new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not consider data collected after 1995, the year  
stricter limits were placed on emissions, Reidinger said. He added 
that even tighter controls will be imposed next year as part of the 
1990 Clean Air Act, and that those efforts should be given a chance 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have gotten better and things are going to continue to  
get better,'' Reidinger said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Obesity Can Shorten Lifespan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A study of more than 1 million Americans provides the most  
convincing evidence yet that simply being overweight can cut your 
life short. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, the largest ever done on obesity and mortality, found  
that overweight people run a higher rate of premature death. And 
this was true even among people who didn't smoke and were otherwise 
healthy during their middle years. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was conducted by the American Cancer Society and  
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	It settles once and for all any lingering questions about  
whether weight alone increases the risk of death and disease, said 
Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Harvard University endocrinologist and 
preventive-health specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence is now compelling and irrefutable,'' Manson said.  
``Obesity is probably the second-leading preventable cause of death 
in the United States after cigarette smoking, so it is a very 
serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study found an especially clear association between excess  
weight and a higher risk of dying from heart disease or cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike a similar study last year that suggested being  
overweight is less of a problem as people grow older, this study 
found many more deaths among overweight people of all ages, 
especially those over 75. 
</P>
<P>
	More adults and children are overweight than ever before, with  
55 percent of American adults weighing more than they should. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is we're too fat and it's killing us. We need to  
come up with ways as a society to eat less and exercise more,'' 
said American Cancer Society epidemiologist Eugenia Calle, lead 
author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson said: ``It's going to take a coordinated campaign to turn  
this around, at the community level, at the environmental level, 
with changes in the food industry and marketing industry, having 
more bike paths and sidewalks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black women were found to be the only exceptions to the rule.  
The study found the most obese black women did not have a 
significantly higher risk of premature death than slender black 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	That poses a fascinating scientific riddle, said June Stevens, a  
University of North Carolina professor of nutrition. ``Although I 
had seen this in several other studies, I wasn't ready to believe 
it was true,'' she said. ``Now I'm thinking maybe this is true, and 
we need to figure out why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Stevens and Manson said the study probably understates  
the risks of obesity for black women. 
</P>
<P>
	They pointed out that slender, non-smoking black women have a  
higher risk of death to begin with than their white counterparts, 
probably because they have less access to health care than white 
women and more undetected disease. That makes it appear that weight 
alone doesn't play a big role in death rates among black women. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be really unfortunate if we became more complacent  
about obesity in blacks than in whites,'' Manson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied participants in the national Cancer  
Prevention Study II from 1982 through 1996. The average age at 
enrollment was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers calculated each subject's body mass index, or  
BMI, a ratio of weight to height, and tracked them for age and 
cause of death. The results were adjusted for age, education, 
physical activity, alcohol use, marital status, use of aspirin as a 
blood-thinner, consumption of fats and vegetables, and use of 
estrogen supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	Among healthy, non-smoking white men and women and black men,  
the researchers found a gradually increasing risk of death 
beginning with a BMI of 25, which is 150 pounds for a 5-foot-5 
woman and 174 pounds for a 5-foot-10 man. 
</P>
<P>
	The fattest white men, with a BMI of 40 or more -- 278 pounds on  
a 5-foot-10 frame -- were 2.58 times more likely to die than their 
healthiest peers, men of the same height weighing 153 to 170 
pounds. White women with a BMI of 40 or greater -- 240 pounds for a 
5-foot-5 woman -- were twice as likely to die as their counterparts 
who weighed 132 to 148 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Thin men and women also had higher death rates, but it was not  
clear whether their low weight was a cause or an effect of disease.

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Ranked Best Big City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- While the folks at Money magazine chose San  
Francisco as the best big city in the nation to live in, they 
concede the City by the Bay may not be everyone's ideal. So for its 
annual selection of the nation's most livable locations, released 
Wednesday, Money is offering a way for you to find your own 
Shangri-la. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of ranking the nation's largest 300 metropolitan areas,  
as it did in past years, the magazine's editors picked a winner and 
a few runners-up. Then they built into their Web site 
(www.money.com) an interactive method of entering your own 
criteria. The site measures your needs against what those 300 metro 
areas offer and gives you an in-order list of cities to love. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we didn't rank the 300 cities? We felt people would  
be better served by picking a city best suited to them,'' said 
Patti Strauss, Money's public relations director. ``The Web has 
been a part of the story for a couple of years. On the Web site, 
you can rank the criteria that are most important to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what put San Francisco -- and Rochester, Minn., in the  
small-city category -- in first place? 
</P>
<P>
	``San Francisco has wonderful things to offer,'' Strauss said.  
``We know housing is very expensive, there's the threat of 
earthquakes -- but basically you have so many things we feel far 
outweigh that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine says the city and environs rank in the top 5  
percent for air quality, offers first-rate museums, sports, and 
more restaurants per resident than any other city in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, it's the city's wide range of recreational  
opportunities -- great places to swim, sail, hike and ski are easy 
to reach -- that clinched it,'' Money said. 
</P>
<P>
	But those things aren't important to everyone. Money's  
searchable Web database lets you find your ideal in two ways -- a 
short form and a lengthy search form that asks detailed questions 
on a wide variety of items. 
</P>
<P>
	You get 15 questions on weather, including your ideal  
temperature, rainfall, snowfall and altitude above sea level. There 
are five questions on economic factors, five more on housing and 
health, two on crime and 13 on leisure activities, among other 
criteria. 
</P>
<P>
	After you file in all the blanks, the database will find the  
cities among the 300 that best meet your needs. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't hard to find officials to applaud Money's choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``Money Magazine confirms what we San Franciscans have known all  
along,'' Mayor Willie Brown crowed Wednesday. ``This is the best 
city in America for one reason -- its people. This is the greatest 
collection of people ever found in any one city. I know that after 
40 years. They're compassionate, progressive and adventurous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Money did point out the city's flaws -- the threat of  
earthquakes, a high student-to-teacher ratio and ``the 
extraordinary cost of living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not surprising to me that Money has selected San  
Francisco, but it's also ironic, because San Francisco increasingly 
is becoming a better and better place to live for people who have 
money,'' said Gabriel Roth, city editor of The San Francisco Bay 
Guardian, an alternative weekly that's highly critical of how the 
city is run. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth sees a city in which officials consciously cater to new  
residents ``earning six figures.''

<HEADLINE> Ala. Ticket-Fixing Scandal Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Just days before voters will decide  
whether to approve Gov. Don Siegelman's plan for a lottery to 
benefit education, his administration has been rocked by a most 
elementary form of corruption: the fixing of traffic tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press first reported last week that state records  
revealed how Alabama drivers often got tickets dismissed after 
seeking the help of lawmakers, court officials and the state 
trooper director's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost immediately, Siegelman forced the director of Alabama's  
state troopers, Mike Sullivan, to resign and suspended three top 
aides in the governor's office who had sought help with tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal has since widened to the University of Alabama  
football team. Sullivan has been the personal security escort for 
the Alabama head coach at games for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	One player, Shamari Buchanan, was benched during last week's  
game while school officials investigated a ticket that Sullivan 
ordered dropped for him. An assistant coach and an athletic 
department official have acknowledged using their influence to get 
tickets dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan has refused to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Then this week, the AP discovered that a ticket for going 78 mph  
in a 55 mph zone was given to the governor's chief of staff, Paul 
Hamrick, and was dismissed without ever making it to a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman, the former lieutenant governor who defeated Gov. Fob  
James last fall, said he has never had a ticket fixed and has never 
helped anyone have one fixed. Siegelman said he was first made 
aware of the ticket-fixing Thursday night by the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor has given all constitutional officers and state  
agencies 30 days to investigate any cases in their offices of 
interfering with traffic tickets, which is a misdemeanor. He has 
also asked court officials and legislative leaders to conduct 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket-fixing clearly pre-dates Siegelman's administration --  
doing favors has long been part of the political culture in 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing you can do about it,'' said Fred Posey, the  
court clerk in Autauga County for more than 50 years who dropped 
the $128 speeding charge against Hamrick. ``That's the system and 
that's the way it has always been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the timing has been bad for the governor, who campaigned on  
the lottery issue last year and has seen his proposal sail through 
the Legislature. All that's left is a referendum on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show a slight majority of Alabama voters favor the  
lottery, which the governor promises will pay for college 
scholarships, a pre-kindergarten program and school computers. 
</P>
<P>
	But even before the ticket-fixing story broke, opponents had  
been running ads predicting a lottery would be corrupted by 
political favoritism and influence-peddling. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Cooper, chairman of Citizens Against Legalized Lottery, said  
the scandal shows ``how the lottery corporation will be run. ... I 
don't trust Montgomery to be in the gambling business, and now they 
have proven me correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman acknowledged that lottery opponents would seize on the  
scandal, but added: ``I believe the people of Alabama are smarter 
than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AP reviewed copies of traffic tickets written by troopers  
over two years and interviewed drivers who said their fines 
disappeared after they asked for help. Some of the documents, 
including correspondence with people whose fines were dropped, were 
signed with Sullivan's secretary's initials. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, as Posey said, the ``media has gone crazy as hell''  
asking officials about favors with traffic tickets. State Sen. Jim 
Preuitt refused to tell the Montgomery Advertiser if he had ever 
fixed a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media is going too far with this,'' Preuitt said. ``That's  
like asking if you've ever stepped out on your wife.''

<HEADLINE> Asarco Accepts Phelps Dodge Buyout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Asarco Inc. has accepted Phelps Dodge's $1.1  
billion takeover offer, completing a three-way $2.9 billion merger 
and putting an end to a bidding war that has reshaped the world's 
copper industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, reached late Tuesday, as well as last week's deal  
to buy Cyprus Amax Minerals Co, puts together three of the nation's 
four largest copper producers under the Phelps Dodge umbrella, 
creating the world's largest copper company. 
</P>
<P>
	In accepting the Phelps Dodge bid, Asarco's board rejected a  
slightly higher offer from Mexico City-based Grupo Mexico, even 
though the companies each hold a 10 percent interest in the other. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals come as the industry, which was battered by  
overproduction and softened demand from Asia, is slowly rebounding 
from rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco and Cyprus originally rejected what began as a hostile  
stock-only takeover bid by Phoenix-based Phelps Dodge, which 
already was the nation's largest copper producer before the 
takeover bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco's acceptance came after Phelps Dodge raised its bid and  
included a total of $1 billion in cash. Phelps Dodge offered $1.8 
billion for Cyprus Amax. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The merger) is an effective strategy to make more money,''  
said John Tumazos, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. 
But Phelps Dodge will have to lower their costs faster than prices 
fall to boost their profits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge has estimated the combined company will save $200  
million a year by the end of 2001 by making their operations, 
administration and exploration more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not in the depths of despair we were in, say three  
months ago,'' said Kurt Billick, an analyst for Warburg Dillon Read 
in San Francisco, referring to the copper industry. But ``Phelps 
paid a pretty full price and they're gonna have to do quite a bit 
to recoup the investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge began cutting costs months ago, slashing production  
by limiting mines, smelters and refineries throughout the Southwest 
and laying off about 1,650 workers in Arizona, New Mexico and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	For Asarco, Phelps Dodge will pay $29.50 in cash or 0.50266 of a  
Phelps Dodge share for each Asarco share tendered under the 
definitive agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Acceptance is conditioned on obtaining at least 80 percent of  
Asarco's shares and Phelps Dodge stockholder approval at a special 
Oct. 13 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division already has  
signed off on the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge spokeswoman Sue Suver said acquisition of Asarco  
will not affect existing labor agreements with unions representing 
that company's workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of  
Phelps Dodge were down 68 3/4 cents to $52.87 1/2, while shares of Asarco 
were up $1.12 1/2 to $27.87 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Cash Flow Into Mutual Funds Is Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The amount of money invested in mutual funds in  
the first eight months of 1999 was down 15 percent from the first 
eight months of 1998. Through August of 1999, investors had put 
$112 billion into mutual funds, down from $132.3 billion a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	So what?  
</P>
<P>
	Well, the obvious answer is that if there's less money going  
into mutual funds, there must be less confidence in the stock 
market. But it's not that simple. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash flow into stock funds is generally viewed ``as a proxy for  
the public's sentiment of the stock market,'' said John Collins, a 
spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based 
trade organization that tracks mutual fund information. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, conventional wisdom holds that the amount of money  
going into mutual funds is directly related to whether the stock 
market goes up or down, given the huge amounts of cash investors 
now put into stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the correlation between the flow of money into stock funds  
and the direction of the stock market is weak, according to 
Collins. ``It's not much of an indicator,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 20 percent of the total value of the stock market is held  
by mutual funds, Collins explained. The rest is held by 
institutions such as private pension fund managers, state and local 
government pension funds, banks and insurance companies, and 
wealthy private investors. Small, individual investors are also 
thrown into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
	The information is valuable primarily to the fund industry  
itself, analysts said. Fund companies like to keep track of where 
the money is going -- or not going -- in order to keep an eye on the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, some mutual fund managers blame the mutual  
fund industry's dismal third quarter performance figures on the 
fact that less money was flowing into funds. And both of those 
dynamics, they argue, contributed to the 1,000 point, or 9 percent, 
decline in the Dow Jones industrial average during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the mutual fund statistics for the period from July  
through September: diversified United States stock funds, whose 
portfolios include stocks from similar-sized companies but from a 
number of different industries, were down on average 5.37 percent; 
and sector funds, whose portfolios include stocks from the same 
industries, fell an average of 3.51 percent. And within those 
categories, certain popular niches stood out for their poor 
performances. For example, diversified funds that track the 
performance of the S&AMP;P 500 index fell an average of 6.35 percent. 
And funds that focus on financial services stocks fell 12.68 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a far cry from the double-digit gains most investors have  
grown accustomed to in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Now consider that those poor third quarter performances  
coincided almost precisely with the stock market selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual fund analysts said three factors contributed to the third  
quarter downturn in fund performance: fears that the Federal 
Reserve Board would raise interest rates for a third time this year 
to keep inflation at bay; concerns that Y2K computer bugs could 
hurt companies' ability to do business; and the dollar's recent 
slide against foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Walsh, a portfolio manager with King Investment Advisors  
in Houston, said the stock market falloff was directly related to 
the outflow of cash from stock mutual funds. Specifically, he said 
many fund managers took money out of stocks to build up cash 
reserves as a precaution against potential Y2K computer bug 
problems that could hurt a company's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``That caused pressure across the board,'' Walsh said, referring  
both to third quarter mutual fund performance and the drop-off in 
the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	So the debate continues.

<HEADLINE> Timor Leaders Say U.N. Moving Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- East Timorese independence leaders criticized the  
United Nations on Wednesday for being too slow in providing 
humanitarian aid and security to hundreds of thousands of homeless 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not satisfied with slow deployment ... We are not  
satisfied with the slow progress in terms of aid in humanitarian 
assistance,'' former independence leader Jose Ramos Horta said 
during a joint news conference in London with Jose Alexandre 
Gusmao, who is expected to be president of an independent East 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Horta said he had ``grave'' concerns for the safety of 230,000  
displaced refugees living in squalid camps in West Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people, they are not somewhere in the jungle, they are  
in tents controlled by the Indonesian army where they are abused. 
Their conditions are appalling,'' said Horta, who shared the 1996 
Nobel Peace Prize with Bishop Carlos Belo for their campaign for an 
independent East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao nodded when asked if he shared Horta's concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	A U.N.-mandated peacekeeping mission was sent to East Timor to  
end rioting that erupted after East Timorese voted overwhelmingly 
in August for independence from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Gusmao and Horta told British Prime Minister  
Tony Blair that East Timor forces are prepared to disarm only after 
every Indonesian soldier has left the country, Horta said. 
</P>
<P>
	They also asked Blair to support a special role for Portugal,  
East Timor's former colonial ruler, during the third phase of the 
peacekeeping mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would not want to see an attempt by anyone to try to  
diminish the role of Portugal in the transition phase, which would 
be under U.N. responsibility,'' said Horta, who acted as both 
translator and spokesman for Gusmao throughout the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao is expected to fly to Darwin, Australia, in mid-October  
to discuss arrangements for an interim government, which Horta 
described as a ``shadow cabinet'' to the U.N. administration now in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor also plans to adopt a new currency, most likely the  
Portuguese escudo, but discussions are still to take place with 
U.N. officials.

<HEADLINE> 2 Plead Innocent in Gay Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDDING, Calif. (AP) -- Two brothers pleaded innocent Wednesday  
to charges of murdering a gay couple in the rural Northern 
California community of Happy Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and James Tyler Williams, 29 have  
been held without bail in the Shasta County Jail since July 8. They 
were ordered to appear in court Nov. 23, when District Attorney 
McGreggor Scott is expected to tell the court whether he will seek 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams brothers face charges of robbing and murdering  
Winfield Mowder, 40, and Gary Matson, 50, who were found dead July 
1. The victims' home had been burglarized and their car stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said his office may seek the death penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	Shasta County investigators have said that evidence found in  
their homes also link the brothers to fire bombings which did 
nearly $1 million damage to three Sacramento area synagogues on 
June 18, including hate literature, hand-written notes about 
synagogue members and news accounts of the fire bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	They have not been charged in those cases, which are under  
investigation by the FBI and a hate crimes task force.

<HEADLINE> What's Next for Couch-Smith Rivalry? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The first time Tim Couch went head-to-head  
against Akili Smith, Couch won. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Browns considered both quarterbacks for the No. 1  
pick in the draft, negotiated with both and finally decided to 
build their expansion team around Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any time you compete, you want to be the best of the  
best,'' Couch said Wednesday. ``Being the first pick is really 
special. All the guys wanted to be the first pick and come to 
Cleveland, and I was just fortunate to be that guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Come Sunday, Couch and Smith will face each other for the second  
time, but for the first time on the field. Couch will make his 
fourth start for the winless Browns, while Smith makes his debut 
for the winless Cincinnati Bengals on the shore of Lake Erie. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes? Be the first to lead his team to a win.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's kind of neat how it's worked out,'' Couch said.  
``I think both of us are looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith more than Couch. Since draft day, Smith has been looking  
forward to showing the Browns they made a mistake by choosing Couch 
and letting him slip to the third overall pick. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Smith felt used and talked about vengeance. Now  
that he's got a chance to do it, he's avoiding talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a blessing, it really is,'' Smith said, declining to say  
anything more on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Both rookies have gone through far more tribulations than  
blessings this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was elevated to starter after Ty Detmer struggled in a  
season-opening 43-0 loss to Pittsburgh. Couch got into that game in 
the second half, and his first pass was intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Couch has completed 37 of 86 passes for 452 yards with  
two interceptions and three touchdowns, making noticeable 
improvement each week as his team slipped to 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't eyeball his receivers as much as he did the first  
two or three games,'' Bengals cornerback Artrell Hawkins said. ``In 
the first couple of games, he was looking right where he was 
throwing. Now he's trying to look off the safeties, do different 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to respect a No. 1 draft pick. He still has the  
potential to be great and he probably will be a great quarterback, 
but right now he's not sure of a lot of things. I don't want him to 
be great against us at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch signed with the Browns on draft day and has had months to  
learn their system. His big disadvantage is he's playing on an 
expansion team that lacks a star receiver or running back. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has Carl Pickens and Darnay Scott to throw to and Corey  
Dillon to hand off to. He's just not sure what to do sometimes 
because his contract dispute wiped out most of his training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith replaced Jeff Blake in three games and completed 18 of 37  
passes for 188 yards, with two interceptions and one rushing 
touchdown. Coach Bruce Coslet said it's impossible to tell how much 
Smith has improved by the limited game experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get 10 to 15 snaps, it's tough to tell,'' Coslet  
said. ``And coming off the bench is entirely different than 
starting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting changes everything, Bengals offensive tackle Willie  
Anderson noted. Anderson, a first-round pick in 1996, knows that 
those drafted highly -- especially those who throw the ball -- don't 
get much leeway with fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can love you now, but if you don't start winning games,  
they get mad at you quick,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sex-Change Doctor Guilty of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A 77-year-old former doctor has been convicted  
of murder for fatally botching the surgery of a New York man who 
wanted his healthy leg amputated to satisfy a bizarre fetish. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury reached the verdict Tuesday after a day of  
deliberations in the case of unlicensed surgeon John Ronald Brown, 
who could face life imprisonment for second-degree murder. 
Sentencing was set for Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown amputated the leg of Philip Bondy, who paid Brown $10,000  
for the operation in May 1998. Bondy, 79, died of gangrene 
poisoning in a suburban San Diego hotel two days after the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's attorney, Sheldon Sherman, had argued his client never  
had the intent to kill. Sherman said the verdict would be appealed 
on grounds California had no jurisdiction because the amputation 
was performed in Tijuana, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Stacy Running said Brown ``just chopped off'' Bondy's  
leg below the knee and then left him at a hotel to recuperate alone 
while he buried the leg in the desert to hide the evidence from 
Mexican clinic inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bondy called Brown the next day, complaining that he was  
bleeding and oozing from the stump, Running said. Brown returned to 
the hotel, rewrapped the leg and suggested Bondy take more pain 
medications. 
</P>
<P>
	New York psychologist Gregg Furth testified during the two-week  
trial that he and Bondy contacted Brown to fulfill lifelong desires 
to amputate their legs. 
</P>
<P>
	They had a rare fetish known as apotemnophilia, getting sexual  
gratification from limb removal. Only 200 people worldwide are 
known to suffer the fetish. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown did not perform a preoperative examination on Bondy, which  
would have revealed pneumonia and past heart operations, the 
prosecutor said. Coupled with Bondy's age, he was a risky candidate 
for surgery, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who lost his medical license in 1977, was convicted in  
1989 in San Francisco for an unsuccessful scalp surgery to shift 
the hairline of a man during a sex-change operation.

<HEADLINE> McNair Wins NFL Expansion Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Houston finally won the expansion game.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert McNair, tired of negotiating, bid $700 million for the  
NFL's 32nd franchise, and the 31 team owners snapped up the offer 
Wednesday, snubbing more glamorous Los Angeles and its larger TV 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Football the sport is a lot more fun than the business side,  
so we look forward now to getting involved in the sport,'' McNair 
said, beaming as NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced the 
expansion team was going to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The $700 million is the most ever paid for a sports team, and  
the package also gives the NFL its first $1 billion deal because an 
additional $310 million will go into a new stadium in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The news played big in Houston, which McNair called a sports and  
football hotbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on cloud nine,'' said Larry Dluhy, owner of Sports  
Collectibles of Houston. ``I've lived here all my life, and the 
last two years with the Oilers gone there's been a huge vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like an empty closet, and now we've filled it back up.''  
</P>
<P>
	Back in Los Angeles, some residents yawned at the fact their  
city will have to live on without pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen teams come and I've seen them go,'' Henry Parker,  
41, said. ``If we got a team just to say we have a team, that isn't 
enough. It's not worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston will begin play in 2002 in the AFC, the conference the  
Oilers were in before moving to Tennessee following the 1996 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue declared the name Oilers retired, so Houston will come  
up with a new name. 
</P>
<P>
	With 24 votes needed for approval, the owners voted 29-0 for  
Houston during a brief meeting Wednesday morning, following an 
unanimous recommendation from the expansion committee. Arizona and 
St. Louis abstained from the final vote because of questions about 
a realignment plan that also is involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners voted to adjust the league alignment to eight  
divisions of four teams each. Now there are six divisions -- one 
with six teams and the rest with five. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the Houston deal, the city will be the site of a  
Super Bowl ``as soon as practical after completion of the 
stadium,'' Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the negotiations and the agreement struck were  
typical of megabucks business: Houston's franchise bid was $150 
million higher than that offered by either the LA Coliseum group or 
another headed by Michael Ovitz, who proposed building a stadium at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz and his money man, grocery billionaire Ron Burkle, offered  
$550 million, and the Coliseum group bid $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the bids on the table, the NFL quickly chose Houston,  
which has the nation's 11th-largest TV market, over No. 2 Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money talks. It sure talked this time,'' said Eli Broad, a  
billionaire who backed the Coliseum bid. 
</P>
<P>
	John Semcken, who helped with negotiations for the Coliseum  
backers, said of McNair's offer, ``Houston just blew us away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The choice to go to Houston followed months of indecision in  
which the NFL at one point conditionally awarded a franchise to Los 
Angeles. A six-month deadline for Los Angeles to come up with a 
stadium and ownership proposal acceptable to the league passed on 
Sept. 15, putting Houston back into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think after a while we all got tired of it, thought it was  
time to make a decision,'' McNair said. ``We knew we had to 
differentiate ourselves, had to do something that would break the 
period of indecision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he upped the stakes to $700 million, some $200 million more  
than he had offered in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the Washington Redskins sold for $800 million  
earlier this year, but that price included the stadium, so that 
franchise price worked out to about $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty of the teams will split Houston's $700 million franchise  
fee, with the Rams not included because of their deal with the 
league that allowed them to move to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's franchise fee appears to increase the worth of all the  
other franchises in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones paid $180 million for the  
Cowboys in 1989, at the time considered an astronomical price for a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Roski, who along with Broad led the failed effort to bring  
the expansion team to the LA Coliseum, now is expected to focus on 
the possibility of luring an existing team to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones believes losing the expansion team actually will work in  
Los Angeles' favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``A team needs to move to Los Angeles,'' Jones said. ``We will  
have football in Los Angeles, and soon. What we did today will 
expedite that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said it would be great if Raiders owner Al Davis, who  
initially moved his team from Oakland to Los Angeles after the 1994 
season, then took them back to Northern California again, did still 
another U-turn back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who is suing Oakland to get out of his lease and claims  
he still holds the NFL rights on Los Angeles, would not comment on 
that possibility.

<HEADLINE> Judge Blocks a Type of Timber Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, Ill. (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Forest  
Service to halt a type of timber sale that the agency had exempted 
from environmental impact reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge J. Phil Gilbert's injunction, filed Sept. 28  
in a lawsuit brought by an environmental group called Heartwood and 
two of its Illinois members, affects timber sales nationwide under 
what is known as a ``categorical exclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exclusion is used frequently by the Forest Service to allow  
timber companies to log up to 250,000 board-feet of live timber or 
up to 1 million board-feet of dead timber without the agency first 
completing various environmental reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	The exclusion was designed to allow the Forest Service to skip  
costly assessments for projects that were not expected to have 
significant environmental impacts, such as removing debris from 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the agency -- over the objection of its own advisory  
task force -- changed the exclusion and increased the size of the 
allowable timber sales by up to a factor of ten. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists say the agency changed the exemption after  
losing numerous lawsuits prohibiting various forms of logging. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do know that it has been widespread, just extensively  
abused,'' Judi Brawer, an attorney with American Wildlands in 
Bozeman, Mont., said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the Forest Service has allowed timber sales under the  
rule in grizzly bear habitat and areas inhabited by endangered fish 
and birds, as well as in particularly fragile ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have found a number of egregious timber sales under this  
program,'' said Kim Davitt, also of American Wildlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest Service spokesman Pete Pierce said the agency has not  
decided how it will respond to the injunction but has stopped work 
in affected areas. He said the agency has not tried to circumvent 
environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Gilbert said the Forest Service failed to explain its  
reasoning for the 1992 increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing continued use of the current exemption could pose  
``possibly irreparable'' harm to the environment if further review 
shows sales should be much more limited, Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Donham, one of two Illinois environmentalists who filed the  
lawsuit, said the ruling could force the Forest Service to perform 
potentially lengthy environmental reviews on all land exempted 
under its policy since Sept. 16, 1998, the date the suit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce said the agency did not immediately know how many timber  
sales are affected by the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, U.S. District Judge William Dwyer ruled in Seattle  
that the Forest Service had violated the Northwest Forest Plan by 
failing to carry out plant and wildlife surveys prior to putting 
timber up for sale. The agency then put more than 400 million board 
feet of proposed sales on hold.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Wary of WorldCom Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A year after declaring the long-distance  
industry one merger away from being too concentrated, the nation's 
top telephone regulator cast an immediate shadow over the proposed 
marriage between the No. 2 and No. 3 leaders in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	William Kennard, the Federal Communications Commission chairman,  
caught some industry leaders and experts off guard Tuesday by 
openly questioning the value to consumers of a $115 billion 
proposed deal between MCI WorldCom and Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the deal ``a surrender,'' and said the companies  
``will bear a heavy burden to show how consumers would be better 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the only place the two telecommunications giants will  
have to make their case. 
</P>
<P>
	Some top antitrust lawmakers echoed Kennard's comments that they  
would be watching the mammoth deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The burden will be on MCI WorldCom and Sprint to show that  
consolidation in the long-distance sector of the market -- a sector 
which until now, has been extremely competitive -- will benefit 
consumers,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, chairman of the 
Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, and its top Democrat, Sen. Herb 
Kohl of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department will review the merger for any possible  
antitrust violations. One issue likely to be of concern is whether 
there are any other viable long-distance competitors, said Steve 
Sunshine, a partner in the Washington office of Shearman &AMP; 
Sterling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Justice Department and the FCC has to conclude that there  
is still a long-distance market,'' he said. Otherwise, a merger 
that brings the industry from three down to two players will raise 
significant concerns about the state of competition, said Sunshine, 
who formerly supervised merger enforcement in the Justice 
Department's antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the  
Justice Department's antitrust division, said today that the deal 
would get ``a very serious and thorough review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klein, who made the comments while in Brussels, Belgium, said he  
anticipated working with European Union antitrust officials on 
issues raised by the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	At the FCC, regulators will look at the transaction to see  
whether the merged company serves the public interest. Kennard's 
statements indicate the companies will have to work hard to show 
the consumer benefits of such a union. But experts say the FCC 
chief's comments don't signal the death of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that MCI and Sprint would get this close to the  
altar if the chaplain was going to back out,'' said Nicholas 
Allard, a communications lawyer at the Washington firm of Latham &AMP; 
Watkins. ``The FCC chairman has put his finger on the ultimate 
question -- is this deal good for consumers?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1997, then-FCC Chairman Reed Hundt put a much firmer  
hold on merger discussions between AT&AMP;T Corp. and SBC 
Communications, the regional Bell telephone company. Hundt declared 
such a combination ``unthinkable.'' Soon after, talks between the 
two companies dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a more measured response,'' Sunshine said.  
</P>
<P>
	MCI and Sprint are just the latest byproducts of a 1996 law --  
meant to spur local and long-distance companies to compete against 
each other -- that has created an unprecedented wave of telephone 
and media mergers. Together, MCI and Sprint would control 36 
percent of the $110 billion U.S. long-distance market, second only 
to AT&AMP;T's 43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 1996 Telecommunications Act also allows regional Bell  
companies to get into long-distance. If enough Bell companies do 
so, this could reassure regulators that there is adequate 
competition in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who chairs the House Commerce  
telecommunications subcommittee, said the deal should be a wake-up 
call to the FCC to let other players, like the Bell companies, 
provide long-distance to their customers. Bell Atlantic, which last 
week filed its petition with the FCC to offer long-distance service 
to its local customers in New York, is likely to be the first Bell 
company to receive permission to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us would be less concerned about the effect of these  
mergers if we knew there were more competitors out there,'' Tauzin 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the MCI-Sprint deal could face some divestitures or  
other conditions to receive approval. For example, the companies 
could be forced to shed parts of their Internet backbone -- the 
massive data pipelines that crisscross the nation carrying computer 
traffic, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger also faces opposition from some consumer groups and  
the Communications Workers of America.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Reviews Hawaii Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices questioned Hawaii's  
policy of letting only people with Hawaiian blood elect leaders of 
a state program benefiting descendants of the islands' original 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Several justices appeared sympathetic to a white lifelong Hawaii  
resident's argument that the state constitutional provision amounts 
to unlawful racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``You say this isn't race'' but a trust intended to benefit  
certain people, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy told the state's lawyer 
who defended the voting limit. But Kennedy likened the provision to 
a state providing benefits only to descendants of people who could 
vote at a time when only white people were allowed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it has to do with Hawaiian ethnicity,'' Kennedy  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is who can vote for trustees of the Office of Hawaiian  
Affairs, which administers state funds and proceeds of public land 
to aid people descended from original Hawaiians. The office 
administers a $300 million trust that provides economic, social, 
health and education aid for an estimated 200,000 residents of 
Hawaiian blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The state constitution limits voting for the trustees to people  
descended from the original Hawaiians on the islands in 1778, date 
of the first known arrival by Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii was a kingdom through the 1800s until 1893, when the last  
queen was overthrown with U.S. help. Hawaii then became a U.S. 
territory until 1959, when it became the 50th state. 
</P>
<P>
	The voting limit was challenged in federal court by Harold Rice,  
a rancher who has no Hawaiian blood, although his family has lived 
on the islands since the mid-1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Theodore B. Olson, called the provision ``ballot box  
racial discrimination, plain and simple. ... Because he has the 
wrong ancestry, he is no longer Hawaiian and he may not vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state's lawyer, John G. Roberts Jr., said Rice was not  
denied the right to vote on racial grounds but because he is not a 
beneficiary of the trust. Rice did not challenge the state's right 
to create a trust to benefit people with Hawaiian blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The state, supported by the Clinton administration, contends the  
voting law is valid because the federal government has an 
obligation to native Hawaiians who lost their land similar to its 
obligation to American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the comparison between  
Hawaiians and American Indians ``seems to me quite strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii ``was a sovereign kingdom,'' she said. ``The United  
States had a large hand in destroying that sovereignty.'' Ginsburg 
wondered whether a ruling in Rice's favor would affect other 
provisions regarding native Hawaiians and possibly other people 
such as native Alaskans. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia said the Constitution refers to Indian  
tribes and noted the Hawaiian descendants do not have the same 
tribal structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked Olson whether his argument would  
entitle 18-year-olds to vote for board members of a senior citizen 
center. But Breyer also questioned extending the definition of 
Hawaiians ``to people 10 generations later'' who had ``one ancestor 
many years ago?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer Edwin S. Kneedler said the Hawaiian  
descendants are a ``distinct people determined to maintain their 
culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scalia shot back, ``A lot of groups in this country are like  
that.''

<HEADLINE> FIFA Chief Calls for Tougher Refs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUGGE, Belgium (AP) -- Alarmed by an increase in dangerous play,  
soccer's ruling body wants referees to toughen their officiating 
and eject players for tackling from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to control the referees more and to tell them they  
have to do their duties,'' FIFA president Sepp Blatter told The 
Associated Press on Wednesday. ``If not, they shall be replaced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barely a year ago, ejections for tackles from behind became one  
of the most controversial issues at the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The instructions given in France seem to have been forgotten  
when referees went back to their countries,'' Blatter said. ``We 
need very strict control by refs otherwise game will not maintain 
its entertaining character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FIFA chief said all national federations will be told to  
abide by the stricter rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effect will be immediate,'' Blatter said.  
</P>
<P>
	A FIFA medical committee said 60 percent of knee and ankle  
injuries result from tackles from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is incredible what we see,'' FIFA medical chief Michel  
D'Hooghe said. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Hooghe is preparing a report for FIFA's referee committee this  
month.

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By a narrow margin, the Senate on Wednesday  
sent the White House a $12.6 billion foreign aid bill that 
President Clinton has threatened to veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, for the fiscal year that began Friday, cuts  
nearly $2 billion from Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed the bill 51-49. At first it appeared the  
measure was going to be rejected on a 50-50 tie, but at the last 
minute Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., changed his no vote to yes. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the same bill on Tuesday, 214-211.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Appropriations  
subcommittee on foreign operations, called the veto threat ``almost 
inexplicable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill, while not as much as the president requested, is as  
large as he signed last year,'' McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said such a veto could result in a cut off of $735 million in  
aid to former Soviet Republics, $285 million in narcotics-fighting 
assistance and $180 million to combat AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a veto would be sustained, given the thin margins of  
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign aid likely would continue to flow at current levels as  
part of stopgap spending legislation that covers agencies and 
departments for which there has been no appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the funding cut by the legislation is $500 million that  
Clinton had requested as a first installment on last year's Wye 
River peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians. In all, 
Clinton has pledged $1.8 billion toward that effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also has complained that the legislation cuts  
many economic assistance programs, including those for poor 
countries in Africa. The bill also eliminates a $241 million State 
Department program to help find work for former Soviet nuclear 
weapons scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the  
foreign operations subcommittee, defended a Clinton veto in 
advance. ``The money in here falls short of what is needed to 
protect our interests around the world,'' Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also disputed Republican assertions that additional money for  
foreign aid only could come by raiding the Social Security surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the American people are more savvy than that,'' Leahy  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	All 45 Senate Democrats voted against the bill. They were joined  
by three Republicans -- Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Gordon Smith of 
Oregon, George Voinovich of Ohio -- and by Independent Bob Smith of 
New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> House Nears Vote on Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans labored Wednesday to pass a costly  
package of health care tax breaks and to kill a White House-backed 
bill to rein in insurance companies as lawmakers clashed in 
politically charged debate. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, President Clinton accused GOP leaders of  
using legislative ``poison pills'' to doom the so-called patients' 
bill of rights measure allowing individuals to sue their managed 
care companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same sort of thing they did to kill common-sense gun  
legislation'' last spring, Clinton charged, referring to a measure 
that died in a crossfire of opposition from conservatives and 
liberals. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that they had given Democrats the rules  
they had sought for debate. ``The Democrats have moved the goal 
post again,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The rhetoric underscored the deep divide between the two parties  
on health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican-crafted legislation to be voted on first would  
provide a series of new or expanded tax breaks the leadership said 
would increase access to health care for the estimated 44 million 
Americans who now go without. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people are concerned about the fact that they  
can't gain access to affordable health care,'' said Rep. David 
Dreier, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats contended the GOP bill would do little to solve  
that problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill does nothing except to help the insurance companies  
and the well-to-do and the healthy,'' said Rep. John Dingell of 
Michigan. He and other Democrats added it would rely on funds in 
the Social Security surplus to finance the tax breaks, a step 
Republicans have promised not to take and that is the subject of a 
GOP advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP health care measure, expected to cost $48.6 billion over  
10 years, would: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Give workers without insurance at their jobs a new tax  
deduction to offset the cost of private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Allow the self-employed a full 100 percent tax deduction for  
health insurance beginning Jan. 1, 2001, two years faster than 
current law. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Create a new tax deduction for the full cost of long-term care  
insurance premiums and a new exemption for taxpayers who care for 
elderly relatives at home. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes a provision, opposed by many Democrats, that  
would allow more medical savings accounts, which let people opt out 
of the current health insurance market and buy high-risk plans on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would give small businesses the option to  
buy health insurance under federal rather than state regulation -- 
exempting them from state mandates that bigger self-insured 
companies now avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats generally oppose MSAs, claiming that younger,  
healthier individuals would buy them, thereby raising the cost of 
insurance for the rest of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the disagreements about policy issues, Democrats  
complained that Republicans had failed to submit proposals to 
offset the cost of their bill. That issue has become politically 
volatile in recent weeks, as Republicans stressed their 
determination not to invade the Social Security trust funds for 
other programs and began airing television commercials against 
Democrats on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP leaders arranged the vote on the tax bill as a prelude  
to a showdown Thursday on the White House-backed measure to 
strengthen the rights of patients in their dealings with the 
managed care industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats who solidly back that second bill complained that  
Republicans had refused to allow them a chance to offset its cost -- 
thereby jeopardizing the prospects for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The votes are not going to be there to pass this,'' said Rep.  
Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats said that was precisely what the GOP had in mind.  
``They are in league with the insurance lobby,'' said Rep. Rosa 
DeLauro of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argued that after seeking a vote for months on the  
bill, Democrats were secretly maneuvering for its defeat so they 
could continue to exploit the health care issue politically. ``This 
last minute pay-for problem is a smokescreen for the fact that they 
want to play politics,'' said John Feehery, a spokesman for House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMO bill, backed by Dingell and Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga.,  
would arm patients with a variety of new rights in dealing with 
health insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	It would make it easier to go to an emergency room or see a  
specialist and would give patients the chance to take their 
complaints to independent panels. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest point of contention, though, was a provision to  
allow patients to sue an HMO in state court over disputes about 
their care. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with possible defeat on the issue, the leadership threw  
its support behind a freshly drafted alternative that would extend 
a more limited right to sue -- in federal rather than state courts. 
</P>
<P>
	To prevail, Republicans would need the support of conservatives  
who traditionally oppose such a right to sue, as well as from 
moderates who have indicated support for the White House-backed 
bill. In addition, they would need the acquiescence of the 
insurance industry itself, since lawmakers would be unlikely to 
vote for a limited right to sue and risk a backlash from 
traditional supporters.

<HEADLINE>  Chechen Leader Declares Martial Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Chechnya's leader declared martial law in  
a bid to halt advancing Russian troops, who again pounded the rebel 
republic with airstrikes and artillery today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians say they've seized the northern third of Chechnya  
since entering the lawless territory last week in an effort to seal 
it off from the rest of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians today were fortifying positions on the northern  
bank of the Terek River, including a stronghold near the village of 
Chervlyonnaya, 15 miles northeast of Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
	The river cuts across northern Chechnya, and the Russian media  
has said Russian troops may halt their incursion along this line. 
The plains of northern Chechnya are thinly populated and should be 
relatively easy for the Russian ground forces to defend with their 
tanks and big artillery guns. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Russians push south across the river and toward the  
capital, the wooded, hilly terrain would begin to favor the Chechen 
fighters, who are much more effective at guerrilla raids than 
pitched battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the Russian forces  
were facing only ``pockets of resistance'' and may cross the river. 
``Everything will depend on the situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians rained artillery shells on northwest Chechnya and  
carried out bombing raids in eastern Chechnya, the Interfax news 
agency reported, citing Chechen officials. There was no immediate 
word on casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov on Tuesday night declared  
martial law, which took effect today ``to protect the country's 
sovereignty and territorial integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The economy will be placed on war footing, and Chechnya's Muslim  
clerics were expected to call for a ``holy war'' against Russia, 
Chechnya's Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev told the Interfax 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets of Grozny were largely deserted today. Some food  
markets were operating, but most men on the streets were in 
military uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The wing of a Russian Su-25 war plane that was shot down Monday  
was placed on a pedestal in the central square in Grozny. The plane 
was one of two that the Chechen fighters have brought down in 
recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy that this aircraft was shot down,'' said a woman  
who gave her name only as Rosa. ``It means the Russians can't bomb 
us with impunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have been bombing Chechnya for several weeks. Many  
of the attacks have been concentrated in and around Grozny, 
destroying oil refineries, brick yards and suspected bases 
belonging to Chechen militants. 
</P>
<P>
	The raids have prompted at least 125,000 civilians to flee  
Chechnya, with most of them heading to the neighboring republic of 
Ingushetia. The influx is straining resources in Ingushetia, an 
impoverished republic that had just over 300,000 people before the 
refugee flood began. 
</P>
<P>
	``The local hospitals ... just cannot provide the sick refugees  
with medical aid,'' Ingushetia's President Ruslan Aushev told 
Interfax. ``Children sleep on the ground and have very few warm 
clothes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko arrived in  
Ingushetia on Tuesday and said Russia could cope with the crisis 
without international aid. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she added, ``should international organizations express a  
wish to offer assistance, it would be wrong to turn it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia took military action after Chechen-based Muslim militants  
invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in August and 
September seeking to create an Islamic state in southern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants have also been blamed for bombings in Russia last  
month that killed about 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya has effectively been independent since Russian troops  
withdrew at the end of a 1994-96 war, but warlords and criminal 
gangs have rendered the territory ungovernable.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banker OK With Currency Range </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The head of Thailand's central bank  
said Wednesday that authorities were comfortable with the baht's 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul said that the Thai currency's  
value will ultimately be determined by the strength of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The baht ended higher against the dollar in Asian spot trade  
Wednesday, after the bank's move Tuesday to further limit the flow 
of baht to short-term investors offshore, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The baht finished at 39.132 to the dollar Wednesday, rising from  
39.50 at the close of Asian trade on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most research houses expect the baht to settle in a range of 36  
to 39 to the dollar in the next three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The baht recovered from a 13-month low in value, 41.67 to the  
dollar, on Sept. 29 after the release of central bank indicators 
showing a recovery in exports and manufacturing in August.

<HEADLINE> Alcoa earnings rise 19 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Although aluminum shipments dropped during  
Alcoa's third quarter, the company reported a 19 percent rise in 
earnings on the strength of lower production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest aluminum producer said today it earned  
$259.1 million, or 69 cents a share, compared to $217.7 million or 
61 cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met the expectations of analysts surveyed by First  
Call/Thomson Financial. But the stock market, likely disappointed 
by the drop in shipments, sent Alcoa's stock down $3.44 to $60.69 
in midday New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues fell 1.4 percent to $4.05 billion from $4.1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa said it shipped 1.1 million metric tons of aluminum in the  
current third quarter compared to 1.13 million metric tons a year 
ago. The company said the effect of that shortfall on its earnings 
was offset by productivity improvements throughout its 
manufacturing system. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the fiscal year, Alcoa earned  
$720.2 million, or $1.91 per share, up from $634.7 million, or 
$1.83 per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales came to $12.07 billion, up from $11.14 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Alcoa is in the process of merging with No. 3 aluminum producer  
Reynolds Metals Inc. The deal would create a company with about 
$21. billion in annual revenue. But Alcoa's position as the world's 
leading producer of aluminum and alumina, is threatened by another 
deal, between Zurich-based Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup), Pechiney of 
France and Alcan Aluminum of Canada, which would create a company 
with about $21.6 billion in revenue.

	Clinton Accuses GOP on Health Care  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused Republicans of  
``legislative gamesmanship'' in their debate on federal regulation 
of managed care health plans, saying the House majority was acting 
at the behest of the insurance industry. Clinton said the House 
GOP, which opened the debate today, set rules that would 
``practically guarantee the defeat of this bill.'' The central 
issue is how to give frustrated patients new rights in dealing with 
health maintenance organizations and other managed care plans, 
which often impose restrictions in order to control costs and 
eliminate unnecessary care.

	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore officially moved  
his campaign headquarters to Tennessee, recalling his roots as he 
sought to bring new energy to his bid for the White House. 
Recently, Gore's campaign has been stung by polls and fund-raising 
reports showing that Bill Bradley has become a formidable 
challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination. Gore 
announced today that he had selected Donna Brazile, one of the 
Democratic Party's most experienced grass-roots organizers, as his 
new campaign manager.

	FCC OKs Ameritech-SBC Merger  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators cleared the way today for a  
marriage between Ameritech Corp. and SBC Communications, a deal 
that would form the nation's largest local phone company. Approval 
by the Federal Communications Commission was the final step for the 
deal between the regional Bell companies. ``It is the most 
momentous merger we have ever approved,'' said FCC Chairman Bill 
Kennard. The deal is worth more than $70 billion, and the combined 
business would control one-third of the nation's local phone lines 
spread across 13 states.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's tax chief pledged to investigate banks  
and businesses suspected of massive money-laundering through the 
Bank of New York, saying his ministry is looking for 
suspicious-looking transactions. But Tax Minister Alexander 
Pochinok said the probe is complicated by loopholes in Russian 
laws. ``A large number of financial operations helping minimize 
taxes is allowed by law,'' he said. Pochinok's comments came a day 
after an indictment was unsealed in New York that alleged $7 
billion from Russia was illegally funneled through accounts at the 
Bank of New York.

	LONDON (AP) -- Seventy people were still unaccounted for today  
from Britain's worst rail disaster in a decade. The crash, in the 
residential Ladbroke Grove area of west London, killed at least 28 
people and injured more than 160. It wasn't clear if the 70 missing 
included the people who were confirmed dead, police said, as they 
had not identified everyone. Police also have received reports from 
friends and relatives about another 100 people who may have boarded 
the trains.

	SCOTIA, N.Y. (AP) -- Two National Guard airplanes took off today  
for the South Pole to pick up a 47-year-old doctor who has been 
treating herself for nearly three months for a breast lump. Dr. 
Jerri Nielsen, the only physician at the research station, is 
believed to have been treating herself with chemotherapy since 
mid-July, when drugs and medical equipment were air-dropped to the 
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Today's flight also carried a 
replacement doctor for the station, a geodesic dome housing U.S. 
National Science Foundation researchers.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Antarctic ozone ``hole'' is smaller than  
last year, NASA scientists reported. The hole, actually an area of 
depleted ozone concentration high in the atmosphere, remains very 
large, however, said researcher Richard McPeters. Ozone in the 
upper atmosphere forms a protective layer that helps block 
dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun. NASA officials said 
the decreased size of the ozone hole is not an indication of a 
recovery, saying year-to-year variations depend primarily on the 
weather.

<HEADLINE> Activists Protest U.S. on AIDS Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 200 AIDS activists blocked traffic  
outside the office of Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky on 
Wednesday to protest against U.S. policies they say defeat 
developing countries' efforts to get AIDS drugs. Fourteen were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the group ACT UP held signs, chanted slogans and tied  
up traffic outside Barshefsky's office on 17th Street about a block 
from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	They accused Barshefsky of supporting U.S. pharmaceutical  
companies by using the threat of economic sanctions to prevent 
developing countries from producing generic drugs vital in the 
fight against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think that's an accurate picture,'' said Tom  
Tripp, a spokesman with the U.S. Trade Representative's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to recognize there's a complementary relationship  
between issues like public health policy and the protection of 
intellectual property rights,'' Tripp said, which include patent 
agreements. ``It's not one or the other; you have to work them 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators contended the U.S. government supports large  
pharmaceutical companies who want to maintain high prices for 
drugs. The mix of drugs necessary for AIDS patients is too 
expensive for most residents of developing countries, said Julie 
Davids, a spokeswoman with ACT UP. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization had been demonstrating for months against U.S.  
policies toward South Africa after that country passed a law giving 
itself unspecified power to import AIDS drugs from counties where 
they are sold more cheaply or to license production within South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States was pressuring South Africa to amend the 1997  
law but backed down last month after South Africa signed an 
agreement not to implement it in a way that would violate patent 
rights or other world trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore had urged trade officials to work out  
some kind of deal with South Africa after ACT UP protesters started 
dogging him at public appearances, including political events 
promoting his 2000 presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, activists say, the trade office is still restricting other  
developing countries from getting affordable lifesaving medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving lives in Thailand, Brazil and India is just as vital as  
saving lives in South Africa,'' Chris Kimmenez of ACT UP said in a 
statement before the protest.

	``Low Budget,'' ``One for the Road,'' ``Give the People What  
They Want,'' ``State of Confusion,'' ``Word of Mouth'' 
(Velvel-Koch/Konk) -- The Kinks 

</P>
<P>
	The troubled Velvel Records label has created some of its best  
business in the past two years by re-releasing the extensive Kinks 
catalog, chunk by delicious chunk. The latest release, five CDs 
originally issued by Arista between 1978 and 1985, represents one 
of the venerable rock band's more interesting -- and less-recognized 
-- periods.

them on the radio again with songs like the recession lament ``Low 
Budget,'' and, a few years later, the angry ``Destroyer'' and the 
sweet, quirky mini-memoir ``Come Dancing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left behind are the stylized, artsy chords of ``Waterloo  
Sunset'' and ``Sunny Afternoon,'' earlier Ray Davies classics. In 
their place are bang-the-gong social commentaries like the Grateful 
Dead homage ``A Gallon of Gas,'' ``A Little Bit of Abuse'' and the 
delightfully sneering anti-Reagan-era ``Young Conservatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the ballads jam. The elegiac ``Celluloid Heroes,''  
performed live on ``One for the Road,'' has a backbeat not present 
in the studio version; same story with ``Misfits'' and the haunting 
``Yo-Yo'' from ``Give the People What They Want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davies, who loves irony (listen to earlier albums like  
``Arthur'' or ``Village Green Preservation Society'') is more 
overtly sarcastic here. He can still be gentle, but more often he 
bites. He turns his songwriting techniques -- used for 15 years to 
critique the Empire -- toward American culture while retaining his 
Muswell Hill sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	No puffery here; the Kinks' class-bashing lyricism, so suited to  
England, translates perfectly into a late-1970s/early-'80s 
indictment of American excess and the rising nihilism of consumer 
culture. One background chorus does this explicitly: ``Gucci, 
Gucci, Gucci, yeah! Cartier! Cartier!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing rocks better than ``One for the Road,'' the 1980  
live-concert album that presaged the Journey/Foreigner sound and 
reinterpreted earlier Kinks songs with a driving pulse that uses -- 
but never overindulges in -- the disco beats of the age. 
</P>
<P>
	In the live ``Prince of the Punks,'' Davies skewers the  
still-nascent punk movement and its bandwagon mentality, full of 
people who ``failed the blues'' and ``couldn't handle modern jazz 
'cause it played in difficult keys'': ``He talks working class but 
it's all baloney; he's really middle-class and he's just a phony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Kinks' rendition of Davies' ``Stop Your Sobbing,''  
recorded later in a more popular version by his onetime love, 
Chrissy Hynde, has little of her version's melancholy. When Davies 
sings, ``It's time for you to laugh instead of cryin','' the 
disdain drips. It's not a plea; it's a demand. 
</P>
<P>
	It's fascinating to watch the group's evolution within the space  
of these albums. ``Low Budget'' is defined by its '70s-recession 
angst. ``One for the Road'' has the power of a veteran band feeding 
off its audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give the People What They Want'' has an exuberant dudgeon to  
it, a refreshing arrogance. ``State of Confusion,'' deeper into the 
'80s, is tinged with embitterment and loss. Though the cockeyed 
Davies optimism remains, it is muted with autumnal themes like 
alienation, broken relationships and musings about the individual's 
place in an increasingly bewildering world. The final CD, ``Word of 
Mouth,'' seems almost joyless. Except for two tracks, ``Do It 
Again'' and ``Living on a Thin Line,'' it's the least memorable of 
the five CDs. 
</P>
<P>
	And Davies' voice grows more gravelly with each passing album;  
by ``Give the People What They Want,'' it grinds like an 
instrument, the perfect companion to brother Dave's spirited 
electric guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	That album ends with a gentle, optimistic song called ``Better  
Things,'' which promises of ``good things happening up ahead.'' 
But, for the Kinks, this was the last sustained period of genius. 
Put aside an afternoon and swallow these five in one gulp; it'll be 
worth your time.

	``In the Life of Chris Gaines'' (Capitol) -- Garth Brooks  

</P>
<P>
	Is this the loopiest career move of the 1990s, or what?  
</P>
<P>
	Country star Garth Brooks, perhaps tired of being country star  
Garth Brooks, dons a wig and adopts an elaborate new persona: He's 
Chris Gaines, rock superstar, releasing his greatest hits. 
</P>
<P>
	The story is remarkably detailed: Gaines is the Australian son  
of an Olympic swimmer and coach, who moved to Los Angeles when he 
was 5. He launched a musical career -- quite successful, of course -- 
in the mid-1980s and piled up hits on albums like ``Fornucopia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	My, my, my. Now this disc is nothing if not competent --  
chillingly so in spots. Brooks hires top producer Don Was and 
plenty of studio pros, to record songs that sound like outtakes on 
albums by Babyface, Tom Petty, Fleetwood Mac and others. His 
execution of ``Right Now,'' with verses in rap and a chorus swiped 
from the 1960s classic, ``Get Together,'' betrays a remarkably 
astute observer of the pop music scene; why didn't Puff Daddy think 
of that? 
</P>
<P>
	This never fails to sound decent. The trouble is, you can't  
believe a word, and that's what ultimately makes this project so 
infuriating. This is only an actor playing a role. 
</P>
<P>
	No one begrudges Brooks a diversion on his inexorable march  
toward becoming the best-selling artist of all time. A wild left 
turn in his music to flex his creative muscles, a revelation of 
what's behind the well-oiled Brooks machine, may even have won him 
some newfound critical respect ... even if Garth Brooks released 
some of the same music on Chris Gaines' album. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he chickened out. And you're only left with questions  
about his sanity.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Baron's Relative Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARMONK, N.Y. (AP) -- At age 75, Martha Nierenberg can wait no  
longer for the Hungarian government to turn over family art 
treasures looted by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nierenberg, the granddaughter of a Hungarian baron, filed a  
lawsuit Tuesday demanding that Hungary immediately return the 
paintings she calls ``the last prisoners of World War II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed in Budapest, follows three years of unproductive  
negotiations to recover 10 paintings from Hungary and two of its 
national museums. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kept stalling and stalling and stalling,'' Mrs.  
Nierenberg said. ``I'm 75 years old and as it is with these things, 
they were just waiting for me to give up, to go away, to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandor Beer, the Hungarian consul in New York, said he had not  
seen the suit and had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nierenberg is the granddaughter of Baron Maurice Herzog,  
who amassed a 2,500-item art collection between the world wars, 
including paintings attributed to El Greco, Velazquez and Courbet. 
</P>
<P>
	The baron died in 1934, dividing his estate among his three  
children, including Mrs. Nierenberg's mother. The collection has 
been appraised at more than $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1944, under the direction of Adolf Eichmann, the best  
pieces were sent off to Germany as Mrs. Nierenberg's Jewish family 
fled Hungary, the court papers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the art was returned to Hungary after the war. But  
because Mrs. Nierenberg's mother was in the United States by then, 
the pieces that had been left to her were sent to the major 
government museums in Budapest under a ``safekeeping'' law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hungarian government acknowledged that some of the works in  
its custody were from the family collection, but said it wanted to 
take no action until the collection could be accounted for as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nierenberg's lawyer, Glen Young, said Hungarian law was  
clear. ``She owns the paintings. They were never nationalized by 
the government, never taken or appropriated. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nierenberg remembers many childhood visits to the baron's  
home on Andrassy Boulevard in Budapest. ``His house was like a 
museum,'' she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was there often and I was always a little bit annoyed  
because I would want to sit down on a chair, and I would hear, `Oh, 
no, you can't sit down on that chair, that's 12th century,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Bauer's World Is Morally Strict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even before he decided to take on the  
Republican establishment with his own brand of moral conservatism, 
Gary Bauer had established himself as a person of unbending 
principles in the face of tough obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	It began with a campaign to clean up his hometown of Newport,  
Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	The city was a hotbed of corruption. The mob controlled  
everything from the mayor's office and the police to the casinos 
and brothels that dominated its gritty downtown. The situation was 
so bad that Newport earned the nickname ``Sin City of the South.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Literally,'' Bauer recalled. ``The mayor was on the payroll.''  
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1950s, city leaders began a campaign to clean up the  
city and drive the mob out of town. One of their first foot 
soldiers was Gary Bauer, then a sophomore in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer threw himself into the campaign -- stuffing envelopes,  
passing out fliers, and knocking on doors throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first effort to instill in others his own sense of  
morality. 
</P>
<P>
	Much like the obstacles Bauer has faced in his bid for the  
Republican presidential nomination, his cleanup effort in Newport 
was not exactly met with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
	At most doors he was greeted with hostility and resentment. For  
many, ``Sin City'' was a cash cow, providing jobs in a city with 
virtually no other industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of lifestyle had given an awful lot of people a  
really good living for a really long time,'' recalls Bauer's 
childhood friend Tet Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer refused to be daunted, in spite of pressure from  
classmates and townspeople. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're a kid like that it is very easy to stay in the  
status quo. We used to hope things would change, but Gary got right 
in there and helped activate the change,'' Turner recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	When other teen-agers would visit the pool hall, Bauer usually  
stayed behind, despite the inevitable ribbing from his friends, 
Turner said. On those rare times when he did go along, he did not 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Pool halls and gambling did not mesh with his already  
well-shaped notions of morality. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's father, Stanley, was a laborer, who moved from job to  
job. His mother, Betty, was a housewife. An only child, Bauer's 
youth was not an easy one. His father was an alcoholic whose 
drinking led to ``emotional abuse,'' Bauer recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would really belittle me,'' he said. ``I remember dreading  
holidays. It would massively increase the odds of there being 
drinking binges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer sought a refuge, and found it at the First Baptist Church  
in Newport, which he started attending every Sunday with his 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	``As problems in my own family worsened, my faith really began  
to take hold,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also found a hero in Ronald Reagan, and remembers watching  
his nominating speech for Barry Goldwater at the 1964 Republican 
National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	That same year, he left Newport for Georgetown College in  
Kentucky, where he majored in political science and economics. 
After graduation, he moved to Washington to chase his ambition of 
becoming a player in national politics. He has lived there ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer worked for the Republican National Committee while  
attending night law school at Georgetown University. After 
graduation, Bauer went to work for a lobbying group, quickly rising 
to the number two spot in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, Bauer decided to quit and joined Reagan's presidential  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	When Reagan won, Bauer was asked to work as a domestic policy  
aide in the White House. In 1985 he was appointed undersecretary of 
education, a post he held until 1987, when he returned to the White 
House as chief domestic policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	At the height of the Iran-Contra scandal, there was a move among  
top Reagan White House staffers, including chief of staff Howard 
Baker, to fire foreign policy adviser and longtime Reagan supporter 
Elliott Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignoring the political tide, Bauer -- ever the Reagan loyalist --  
invited Abrams to lunch with Education Secretary Bill Bennett and 
his aide William Kristol in the White House dining room. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took the table right in the middle of the White House mess  
so that Howard Baker and others like that would see this big 
gesture of support,'' said Abrams. ``It elicited the glowers that 
everyone expected it to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All the old Reaganites were gone,'' Abrams recalled, ``and in  
those quarters I was a pretty unpopular person, but Gary was acting 
in a principled manner and letting the chips fall where they 
would,'' said Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristol said Bauer's political courage in precarious situations  
is his most characteristic trait. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really was tough -- genuinely courageous.'' said Kristol,  
who served in the Education Department with Bauer. ``Courage in 
Washington is a difficult thing . . . it's tough to sit in a 
meeting and say 'no' to people more powerful than yourself. That 
was very impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer finds his strength in his religion, and in his family.  
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Carol, is a homemaker in Northern Virginia. The couple  
has three children -- two daughters and a son. Last week, they 
surrounded Bauer as he vehemently denied unsubstantiated rumors 
that he had an extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bauer calls her husband the ``ultimate family man.'' She  
said he loves to watch ``Jeopardy'' with the children, shoot 
baskets with them, and attend son Zachary's basketball games. They 
regularly vacation at the Delaware beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	As head of the Family Research Council, Bauer thrust himself  
into the forefront of the social conservative movement. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned an organization with a handful of employees and a $1  
million annual budget, into a Washington powerhouse with a $15 
million dollar budget and more than 100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet he has given that up, for the time being, to compete in  
what he admits is an almost quixotic quest for the Republican 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Republican field where the front-runner has wavered from  
the strict social conservative message, Bauer has continually 
hammered away at abortion rights, gun control, gambling, trade with 
China and gay marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	He uses Reagan as his inspiration. ``I will try to model myself  
after him and his grand sweep of things and the way he presented 
conservatism. He never waffled on the issues, but said it in a way 
to draw people to him,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know Bauer best say his message and principles have  
always been startlingly consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people come to Washington to do well, not to do  
good,'' Abrams said. ``One of the striking things about Gary is the 
degree to which he has stuck to his principles. He is motivated by 
a deep moral sense, a deep sense of right and wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former coworker at the Family Research Council agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Gary is a man who had been here for 20 years and still had all  
of his principles,'' said Amy Myers. ``He still has that passion . 
. . to want to change the way that our country is focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's entry into the 2000 campaign is another chance for him  
to show the world that despite overwhelming odds, he is willing to 
go against the grain. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I think I've got the answers,'' he said, ``I ought to put  
my own head on the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Bauer seems to almost describe himself when he explains  
his well-known admiration for Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the country never agreed with his principles, that was fine  
with him,'' Bauer said. ``He felt they were wrong not to agree, but 
he wasn't going to change.''

<HEADLINE> Ismail Gives Dallas Another Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- In their 10th season together, Troy Aikman,  
Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin are still the heart and soul of the 
Dallas Cowboys offense and the focus of every opposing defense. 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly why Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail has been so  
successful this season. 
</P>
<P>
	With cornerbacks concentrating mostly on Irvin and safeties  
cheating up to stop Smith, Ismail has caught a team-high 13 passes 
for an NFL-best average of 22.2 yards per reception. 
</P>
<P>
	Although two of Ismail's catches have turned into touchdowns and  
several more have set up scores, defenses are still willing to 
leave him in single coverage to avoid being burned by Irvin or 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't gotten to the point yet where defenses are doubling  
Rocket and leaving Michael one-on-one on the other side,'' Cowboys 
coach Chan Gailey said. ``It takes time to change people's minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took Ismail two years in Canada and five NFL seasons before  
fulfilling the expectations that came with his superb career at 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing with the Carolina Panthers last year, Ismail nearly  
doubled his previous career highs with 69 catches, 1,024 yards and 
eight touchdowns. He turned that into a seven-year, $21 million 
contract with Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Ismail, who doesn't speak to the  
media, said he was attracted to Dallas because he would play 
alongside players like Aikman, Smith and Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	That trio has been looking for a complementary fourth guy since  
Alvin Harper left after the 1994 season. Kevin Williams, Anthony 
Miller and Billy Davis were all busts as the No. 2 receiver because 
they failed to make teams pay for double-teaming Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	While defenses have been slow to focus on Ismail, Gailey knows  
they eventually will. So he's giving them a lot to worry about once 
they do. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail has caught deep passes and short ones, gone across the  
middle and turned into a running back on end arounds and reverses. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Ismail has gotten the ball 16 times. He's gained at  
least 10 yards on 10 of those plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's such a threat once he gets the football,'' Aikman said.  
``He helps us a tremendous amount. Teams begin having a difficult 
time knowing how to match up with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey began experimenting with Ismail on one of the first  
passes of the season, but he dropped a wide-open bomb. Gailey 
called the play again in overtime and it went for a 76-yard 
game-winning touchdown against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail had only one catch in the second game, but it was a  
38-yard gain on third-and-13 from Atlanta's 47 that set up a 2-yard 
touchdown run by Smith. The score put Dallas up 10-0 in an eventual 
24-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Arizona this past Sunday, the bomb returned as Ismail  
exploited 1-on-1 coverage by cornerback Corey Chavous for a 63-yard 
touchdown that put the Cowboys ahead 21-0 early in the second 
quarter. Gailey called for the play again on Dallas' next snap and 
would've gotten a 74-yard touchdown if the pass were thrown a yard 
deeper. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third quarter, Gailey went to Ismail on third-and-3 from  
the Cardinals' 15. On a play designed to get a first down, Ismail 
caught a swing pass, danced around would-be tacklers and made it to 
the 1. Smith scored on the next play as Dallas cruised to a 35-7 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rocket is a playmaker,'' Gailey said. ``I'm searching for more  
and more ways to use the guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once defenses start paying more attention to Ismail, they'll  
have to give less attention to Smith or Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey can't wait.  
</P>
<P>
	``When they do,'' Gailey said, ``we plan to make them regret  
it.''

<HEADLINE> Asarco Accepts Phelps Dodge Buyout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Asarco Inc. has accepted a sweetened buyout offer  
from Phelps Dodge Corp., setting up a three-way, $2.9 billion deal 
that will make Phelps Dodge the world's largest copper producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. accepted a similar offer last week,  
breaking away from what had been the Englewood, Colo.-based 
company's plan to merge with New York-based Asarco. 
</P>
<P>
	With Asarco's acceptance late Tuesday, the deal merges three of  
the country's four largest copper companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco and Cyprus originally rejected what began as a hostile  
stock-only takeover bid by Phoenix-based Phelps Dodge, the nation's 
largest copper producer 
</P>
<P>
	Acceptance came after Phelps Dodge raised its bid for Cyprus  
Amax to $1.8 billion and for Asarco to $1.1 billion and included a 
total of $1 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	In going for the Phelps Dodge bid, Asarco rejected a $27.4  
million higher one from Mexico City-based Grupo Mexico, though the 
companies each hold a 10 percent interest in the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning it has been our aim to maximize shareholder  
value. We believe this transaction represents good value for Asarco 
shareholders,'' said Francis R. McAllister, Asarco chairman and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The merging trio has major copper operations in Arizona, where  
Phelps Dodge operates the largest copper mine in North America at 
Morenci near the New Mexico border. The combined company also will 
have copper operations in Peru and Chile as well as New Mexico and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division already has  
signed off on the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This compelling three-way combination positions Phelps Dodge  
to become the leading global copper producer,'' said Douglas C. 
Yearley, the company's CEO and chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge has estimated the combined company will save $200  
million a year by the end of 2001 through efficiencies in 
operations, administration and exploration -- a significant factor 
in a slump that had dropped prices to their lowest in decades, 
adjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of cutting costs, Phelps Dodge recently slashed  
production by limiting mines, smelters and refineries throughout 
the Southwest, laying off about 1,650 workers in Arizona, New 
Mexico and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	For Asarco, Phelps Dodge will pay $29.50 in cash or 0.50266 of a  
Phelps Dodge share for each Asarco share tendered under the 
definitive agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	On a fully prorated basis of 50 percent cash and 50 percent  
stock, Asarco shareholders would receive $14.75 in cash and 0.2513 
of a PD share, the company said today in announcing the deal's 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange offer now extends until Oct. 21. Acceptance is  
conditioned on obtaining at least 80 percent of Asarco's shares and 
Phelps Dodge stockholder approval at a special Oct. 13 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge spokeswoman Sue Suver said acquisition of Asarco  
will not affect existing labor agreements with unions representing 
that company's workers. Phelps Dodge and Cyprus workers in Arizona 
are not represented by labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also is a major producer of carbon black, wire and  
cable with operations in 28 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of  
Phelps Dodge were down $2.18 3/4 to $51.37 1/2, while shares of Asarco 
were up 56 1/4 cents to $27.31 1/4.
