 MYPRIMETIME.COM SEES ITSELF AS BOOMER HUB  &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Do Baby Boomers want their very own home on the Internet?
<P>
   A new San Francisco startup thinks they do _ and is launching a
Web site, www.myprimetime.com, to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   The site is founded by three former journalists from CNNfn, with
$4.25 million in backing from Hummer Winblad, one of the more
prestigious venture capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   MyPrimeTime offers regularly updated sections on jobs,
investing, health and leisure _ topics for which scores of Web
sites already exist. But MyPrimeTime says it brings value by
putting all the topics on one site and by making them relevant for
people between the ages of 35 and 53.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Boomers _ that vast demographic bulge of 81 million people
born after World War II, from 1946 to 1964 _ are not a monolithic
group. Most of them don't even think of themselves as Baby Boomers,
but identify themselves in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   That presents a challenge to the MyPrimeTime entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For any kind of community play to work, it's essential that
there's something special that holds the community together,'' said
Andrea Williams, director of equity research at E-Offering in San
Francisco. ``I'm not sure what it would be for Baby Boomers that
they couldn't find at Yahoo or any of the other portals.''
</P>
<P>
   For Boomers of a certain age, another San Francisco company,
ThirdAge Media, offers a specially tailored Web site. Although the
MyPrimeTime folks say ThirdAge is for older folks, ThirdAge founder
and Chairwoman Mary Furlong said, ``We service people 45 and
older.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Furlong declined to take on MyPrimeTime directly,
it's clear that the ThirdAge site could present MyPrimeTime's most
formidable obstacle. Furlong was reached in New York, where she was
just taping a segment for CBS's ``The Early Show.'' That's the same
CBS that in June plunked down $54 million for roughly one-third of
ThirdAge Media, joining other big backers like Softbank and Si
Newhouse's Advance Publications.
</P>
<P>
   Furlong, an industry veteran who founded SeniorNet, notes her
site's nearly three-year head start and 700,000 registered
community members, and she touts that Time tabbed her as one of the
50 most important people shaping cyberspace today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, MyPrimeTime execs say they're on a fast ramp, and it
looks like it's true. In rehabbed brick-and-glass offices tucked
behind the old U.S. Mint, the company this week announced a
partnership with Fidelity, in which the mutual fund giant will
sponsor its personal finance section.
</P>
<P>
   Those sorts of partnerships, as well as advertising and
unspecified future e-commerce deals, will form the backbone of
MyPrimeTime's planned revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   It's all thanks to the fundamental premise that Baby Boomers are
the biggest, wealthiest generation in U.S. history and therefore
are worth targeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never before were able to micro-target an audience as
large as the Boomers,'' said Craig Forman, co-founder and CEO of
MyPrimeTime. ``It's only in this medium that you could tackle the
aggregation of 81 million people because we tackle it person, by
person, by person.''
</P>
<P>
   The three founders are 38, 40 and 44 years old. ``We look at our
lives as a mirror of the site,'' said Helen Whalen, another
co-founder and the company president.
</P>
<P>
   Note that neither site wants to offend its readers by implying
that they're old, so instead, they refer to them as ``Third Agers''
or people hitting ``my prime time.'' Boomers, as MyPrimeTime's
Whalen said, like to think of themselves as 10 years younger than
they really are.
</P>
<P>
   E-FORTUNE: Here comes Fortune magazine, launching a tech
supplement that it plans to call eCompany Unlimited. Never mind
that there's already a real company called eCompany. (That firm
owns www.ecompany.com. Typing www.ecompanymagazine.com or, worse,
www.pathfinder.com/ecompany takes you to the site of the new
Fortune offering.)
</P>
<P>
   The magazine will be based in the San Francisco Bay Area,
debuting next May with a starting circulation of 200,000. Former
Fortune and Time writer Ned Desmond, 41, will head it.
</P>
<P>
   I found what's motivating the folks at Fortune's parent, Time
Inc., in my mailbox this month: a 424-page issue of Fast Company, a
356-page Wired, a 314-page Red Herring and a 338-page Business 2.0.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'll hit a Boomer Web site for health information _ these
magazines are giving me a hernia.
</P>
<P>
   GIMME AN E: ECompany Unlimited comes as folks start to complain
about words starting with ``e,'' such as eBay, E-Trade, eToys,
E-Loan, E-Stamp. Just this week, I was pitched by companies calling
themselves eAlity and eDedication. Egads!
</P>
<P>
   One firm, Persistence Software of San Mateo, wants to e-liminate
all the e-idolatry. For its campaign, titled, ``E-Nough,''
Persistence created the Society for the Preservation of the Other
25 Letters of the Alphabet, and it is compiling a list of flagrant
e-violations at its Web site, www.persistence.com/enough.
</P>
<P>
   SKY'S THE LIMIT: The Industry Standard's weekly San Francisco
rooftop gatherings have proven so popular, the magazine has had to
make the event invitation-only.
</P>
<P>
   When he founded the Standard last year, John Battelle also
launched a new tradition in the San Francisco Internet community by
inviting people to the roof of the offices at Pacific and Battery
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But with lines snaking around the block and crowds squeezed onto
the aerie, the party was becoming more of a burden than a blast.
Now the magazine will pick its guest list the democratic way: with
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The list of invitees will be sorted by computer. ``We have a
pretty deep database of information on these people,'' said Stacey
Foreman, the Standard's chief of staff. Some of the invites are
selected randomly, and some are picked based on how often the
person attends, or whether they fit the goals of the event's
sponsor _ usually an advertiser who picks up the tab for the
evening's food and drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, things can get tight. More than 3,000 people are
registered; 400 to 600 actually get invited; and the rooftop only
holds 75 people at a time.
</P>
<P>
   If you get the weekly e-mail touting that evening's party,
you're in. If not, wait til next week, and check your in-box.
</P>
<P>
   FRAGRANCE-FREE: Wired magazine is known for some breathtakingrk, but the latest cover can leave you gasping. To tout a
story about technology that enables people to send smells over the
Internet, the magazine slapped a scratch-n-sniff sticker on a
cartoon by Ren and Stimpy's creator John Kricfalusi, showing a slob
plucking hairs from his armpit, a cat vomiting, and other people
doing things so disgusting as to prohibit their mention here. (And
we're not bashful, so you know it's gross.)
</P>
<P>
   At least the scratch-n-sniff doesn't try to realistically match
the cover. While some smell of lily, mine smells sweetly of banana.
</P>
<P>
   As one colleague said: This magazine is owned by the same folks
who publish the New Yorker?

 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   NEW YORK _ There were two stories
to report from the New York City Opera on Tuesday night. The first
is the marvelous new production of Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' directed
with vitality and imagination by Leon Major and offering a
performance by remarkable young American baritone Mark Delavan that
should finally prod the Metropolitan Opera to sign him for
something soon. The Met can boast few better Verdi baritones on its
roster this season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other story concerns the continuing controversy about the
New York State Theater's new sound enhancement system. Those who
object seem to be a small minority. But that minority is getting
agitated, if some shouted comments from one listener during a set
change are representative of more widespread displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   First to the good news. This joint production was formerly
presented at the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., in the
summer of 1998. John Conklin's attractive sets are mostly simple,
movable panels that suggest the interiors of Tudor homes and ale
houses. Conklin's costumes, however, are in period, and the mixture
of somewhat abstract sets and historically appropriate costumes
works beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Major has sometimes been criticized for overdoing the comic
antics in his opera stagings, but here his work is just right. He
has coaxed droll, nuanced and funny performances from his cast.
</P>
<P>
   As the merry wives of Windsor plot a joke against Falstaff for
his amorous self-delusions while they chat around Alice Ford's
dining room table, Alice's daughter, Nannetta, slumps in a chair in
a corner glumly eating grapes because her father is trying to force
her to marry the pompous Dr. Caius. The pratfalls and double takes
of the cast have been carefully choreographed by Major, but they
are wonderfully sensitive to the antics in the music and are
rendered with utter naturalness.
</P>
<P>
   The title role is often undertaken by baritones in the later
stages of their careers. It was bracing to hear the music sung by a
fresh, strong voice. Sir John is old and fat, but he is not a
buffoon. He is proud of his enormous potbelly, to him a symbol of
grandeur and virility. Delavan played Falstaff as self-absorbed, a
sucker for flattery and light on his feet despite his paunch: a
Tudor aristocrat version of Ralph Kramden. Only after he has been
humiliated by Alice and her co-conspirators and tossed into the
Thames in a basket of dirty laundry does he sit alone outside the
inn, sipping a glass of warmed wine, and brood about his life, his
growing weight, his graying hair. Delavan made it a poignant
moment.
</P>
<P>
   His singing was crisp, supple and impressive. His voice is
enormous. No one had any trouble hearing him at the State Theater
before it was sound-enhanced. On this night his voice seemed almost
to overwhelm the system. His fortissimos positively shook the
place, leading that unhappy patron in an upper balcony to shout:
``Turn off the mikes, turn off the mikes! Let's have some real
sound up here.''
</P>
<P>
   The sweet-voiced soprano Amy Burton as Alice Ford, the fine
mezzo-soprano Leah Creek as Meg Page and mezzo-soprano Marion
Pratnicki in a winning company debut as Dame Quickly were the merry
wives.
</P>
<P>
   Soprano Sari Gruber was a delightful Nannetta, although some of
her floated soft high notes had a tremulous quality. She and the
ardent lyric tenor Gordon Gietz as her beloved Fenton made an
endearing couple. The baritone Stephen Powell brought his sturdy
voice to the role of the wealthy, patriarchal Ford.
</P>
<P>
   George Manahan conducted a lithe performance of this miraculous
score. But like that complainer from the balcony, I would have
preferred to hear it without the electronic assist.  &QL;

TEXAS WHEELCHAIR TEAM FINDS HELP FROM DOWN UNDER
</HEADLINE>

By TOBIAS LOPEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The mooring rope that tied the high-speed
ferry to the dock wrapped around Brad Ness's right ankle like an
angry boa constrictor, and an instant later he no longer had a
foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like breaking a stick in half. I heard the sound before
I felt anything,'' said Ness, who was a teen-ager at the time. ``I
looked down and my foot was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness, now 24, began his freshman year at the University
of-Arlington this fall, and the Wagin, Australia, native has
quickly become an integral part of the Movin' Mavs wheelchair
basketball team. In the process, he has formed strong bonds with
his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Ness learned of Texas-Arlington's program through another
Australian player on the team, Campbell Message. The chance to earn
a college education and to play wheelchair basketball brought Ness
to Arlington this fall, a little more than six years after his
accident.
</P>
<P>
   He was working as a deckhand at the ferry dock and thought he
was clear of the mooring rope when he was injured at 11:30 p.m. on
Dec. 12, 1992. After the accident, his right leg had to be
amputated below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Before the accident, he had been an Australian Rules Football
player. He realized he could no longer play that sport at the same
level, but he wanted to remain in competitive athletics, so he took
up swimming and wheelchair basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The Movin' Mavs' 77-43 rout of the Houston Rolling Rockets
semi-professional team on Saturday was Ness' first start for
Texas-Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome to play with a college team with the backing
the Movin' Mavs have,'' Ness said. ``The atmosphere the college
puts on for game night was quite special.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness, 6-foot-4, battled all night with Houston's Paul Schlobaum,
a 7-foot-1 center, and held him to 12 points without picking up a
foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to being the biggest person on the court,'' Ness
said. ``He was a man-mountain; once he was in position he was hard
to move. It was good experience to play against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Movin' Mavs were bumped from the national
wheelchair tournament for the second consecutive season by
Illinois, mostly because they were overpowered on the inside by the
Illini's Will Waller and Pat Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington coach Jim Hayes said coupling Ness with forward
Eddie McGee should even things up in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing at the highest level anywhere when we're against
Illinois.'' Hayes said. ``It's going to take superior players to
play with them, but he works so well with Eddie. He sees the floor
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee agrees with Hayes' assessment of Ness and said he gladly
welcomes the rebound help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a load off my shoulders,'' McGee said. ``He's like a big
vacuum cleaner; anything that pops out he gets.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee and Ness, both single-leg amputees, have quickly become
friends off the court as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty amazing. (Amputees) tend to stick together, so
there's always a few stories to be told.'' Ness said of McGee.
``He's pretty loud, so he always makes you feel welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness and Message like to watch Australian Rules Football games
on cable TV together, and Ness said he doesn't miss playing too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to play wheelchair basketball at the level we are
now more than compensates for not being able to play football,''
Ness said. ``I'd rather watch it with a few mates and a couple of
beers than go through the heartache of playing again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Movin' Mavs are scheduled to travel to Wisconsin-Whitewater
on Nov. 19 for a round-robin tournament. They'll face Whitewater
and Illinois, the teams that finished first and second in the
national tournament last season, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Ness said he's enjoying American culture, especially the team's
Sunday trips to an area restaurant and the opportunity to play for
Texas-Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   He also appreciates the living accommodations for the wheelchair
team at the school _ most of the players live in close proximity to
each other in student housing on the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is by far one of the most superior setups, offering the
education and to be looked after the way we are as wheelchair
athletes,'' Ness said. ``I'm honored to be a part of the Movin'
Mavs.''

ROCKETS REFUELING FOR ANOTHER TITLE RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With so many new players, the Houston Rockets should
have issued nametags when training camp opened this month.
</P>
<P>
   Gone from last year's team are Scottie Pippen, Antoine Carr,
Othella Harrington, Michael Dickerson, Brent Price, Rodrick Rhodes,
Sam Mack and Anthony Miller. They have been replaced by rookie
Steve Francis, Shandon Anderson, Kelvin Cato, Carlos Rogers, Tony
Massenburg, Walt Williams, Don MacLean and Thomas Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a drastic transformation in one off-season? Rockets
coach Rudy Tomjanovich took a long look at his team and realized
changes had to be made.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets will still pass the ball inside to their double
low-post tandem of Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley, ]two
36-year old future Hall of Famers in the twilight of their careers.
However, Tomjanovich wanted to tweak his offense, and plans to use
the young legs and high energy of Francis, Anderson, Rogers, Cato
and Williams to move up and down the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great players in `Dream' (Olajuwon) and Charles, and
they're at the end of their era,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But the
league has turned into an athletic, long league with guys like
(Kevin) Garnett and (Tim) Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always talked about how we needed to get some athletic,
long guys that can run and have the long reaches. And in Cato and
Carlos Rogers, we feel we have those kind of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis, who refused to report to the Vancouver Grizzlies after
they drafted him, was subsequently traded to the Rockets. The No. 2
overall pick in the NBA Draft is not yet as graceful of a point
guard as Stephon Marbury and Allen Iverson, but the signs so far
are promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game to me is a learning experience, so I'm learning
every game,'' Francis said. ``There's a lot of things that I have
to work on to get myself better to get ready for the regular
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said Francis, who was a natural shootingguard in
college, is destined for stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel blessed that we had an opportunity to acquire
Steve,'' he said. ``He's a truly talented player, and a lot of
people thought he'd wind up as the number one pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot to learn, like any rookie coming in. But he
seems to have a knack for getting points on the board, and he
really hasn't even gotten untrack yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich is happy that the Rockets are solid enough to
attract a quality player like Francis, and an equally quality
player like Anderson, who was one of the top free agents this
summer. Anderson spurned a five-year, $24.5 million offer to return
to the Utah Jazz, and instead signed a two-year, $4.2 million offer
with the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's slashing, attacking-the-basket style should benefit
from NBA rules passed during the off-season. He said he decided not
to return to the Jazz for a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a better fit for me here, not just basketball-wise, but I
think socially,'' said Anderson, who is single. ``I just get a
better feel here.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, Cato and Rogers came from Portland as part of the
Pippen trade. Cato, selected by the Mavericks with the 15th pick of
the 1997 draft and traded to Portland, is feeling at home with the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought enough of my Portland teammates to make this look
almost like our old team,'' Cato said. ``I know we've got a lot of
talent, but talent can only go so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we look good on paper. But we're still learning
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still learning the playbook, and each other's names. nn

GOODYEAR'S EXIT SOUNDS LIKE SORRY EXCUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First it was Formula One. Then it was the Indy Racing League and
Championship Auto Racing Teams.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing you know, Goodyear will be pulling out of the baby
carriage tire market, or signing an exclusive contract to supply
recaps for Yugos.
</P>
<P>
   OK, those are exaggerations. But no matter how many times
Goodyear executive Stu Grant referred to the prohibitive research
and development costs associated with the IRL-CART split the other
day, Goodyear's decision to no longer supply tires to domestic
Indy-car teams looks like a sorry case of turning tail in the heat
of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Bad show. Bad press. And hardly the image we have come to
associate with the company that boldly has billed itself ``No. 1''
on the sidewalls of its Eagle racing radials.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear's exit will leave Firestone as sole supplier to IRL and
CART teams beginning in 2000, room-servicing the Nashville-based
manufacturer a monopoly Goodyear once enjoyed for 20 years. Since
returning to Indy-car racing in 1995, Firestone Firehawk-shod cars
have won 59 of 71 CART races and four consecutive PPG Cup
championships. Included is the driver's title to be decided between
Dario Franchitti and Juan Montoya in the season-ending Marlboro 500
at the California Speedway on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone-equipped CART drivers have won 18 of 19 events this
season, and led 2,419 of 2,519 laps (96 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Only five of the 27 cars entered in CART's season-ender will be
on Goodyears and victories by the most notable of those drivers _
Al Unser Jr. and Gil de Ferran _ would have to be classified as
remote.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, Firestone has won 36 times in 37 CART races.
</P>
<P>
   Bad show. Bad press. So, time for a little CART damage control.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the playing field in the IRL has been more level.
Both tire-makers have won 17 races and two Indianapolis 500s since
Tony George launched the IRL in 1996. Texan Greg Ray scored a
series-leading three victories and wrapped up the 1999 driver's
championship in a Firestone-equipped Dallara in the season-ender at
Texas Motor Speedway on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   TMS, in particular, has proven to be a bane to Goodyear-equipped
IRL teams. Recall that the September 1998 race on the 1.5-mile,
high-banked trioval was marred by tires that shredded at speed on a
hot, fall Sunday afternoon in Fort Worth. Goodyear engineers
promised a better, safer tire for the June 1999 night IRL race,
which actually was run in the heat of twilight. And while Scott
Goodyear won that event on Goodyears, several of the manufacturer's
top teams were hampered by blistered tires less than 25 laps into
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Brack, who won the 1998 Pep Boys IRL championship and the
1999 Indy 500 on Goodyears supplied by team owner/Goodyear loyalist
A.J. Foyt, was among the drivers who tested at TMS a month before
the season-ending Mall.com 500. In what amounts to a dose of
gallows humor, Brack summed up the manufacturer's progress:
``September last year, the tires blew up on us, and now they're
only blistered. So, they're going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad show. Bad press. When George announced in late September
that the IRL would go it alone for perhaps as long as four years,
he presented Goodyear with a convenient way out.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Grant said the level of research and development
required to become even more competitive was not worth the price of
operating separate engineering programs for CART's varied circuits
and the all-oval IRL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's financial from the standpoint of value for the dollar
invested,'' said Grant, Goodyear's general manager for global race
tires. ``That's the way we are looking at our racing operation,
whether it'd be CART or IRL or Formula One. It's not sheer number
of dollars. It becomes return on investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant said that Goodyear allocated additional resources to its
faltering CART programs when it pulled out of Formula One after the
1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an excellent road-racing tire in F1 in 1998, and we
needed improvement on road-course and street circuits in the CART
series after 1997 and 1998,'' Grant said. ``We took that technology
developed in F1 and put those people onto that project and they did
a darn fine job in improving our CART (results) on road-courses and
street circuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Bad show. Bad press. De Ferran scored Goodyear's
only CART victory so far this season on the permanent road-course
at Portland (Ore.) International Raceway in June.
Firestone-equipped drivers won the 10 other CART races contested on
either road-courses or temporary street circuits in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear is free to concentrate more of its R&AMP;D resources on
NASCAR's wildly popular Winston Cup, Busch Grand National and
Craftsman Truck series. Goodyear, incidentally, enjoys an
exclusivity contract in those series through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad about that tidy monopoly. Because it might have been the
perfect time for Hoosier Tire to reenter the heat of competition,
and try to determine who's really No. 1 where the rubber meets the
road in NASCAR, too.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCHITTI, MONTOYA SET FOR RUN AT CART CROWN
</P>
<P>
   The third-closest points race in CART's 21-year history will be
decided between Dario Franchitti and Juan Montoya at the California
Speedway on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the friendly rivals have booked a
post-race party for Fontana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed some time ago that win or lose, we are going to have
a small party after the race,'' said Franchitti, a Scotsman who has
built a nine-point lead (209-200) after 19 events.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little party, by the way,'' said Montoya, the Colombian who
will have to overcome two decades of history if he plans to add the
championship to his already stellar rookie season. Montoya will
start the Marlboro 500 knowing that the points lead never has
changed hands at the season-ending race in the 20 previous years of
Championship Auto Racing Teams competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to see myself winning the championship,'' said
Montoya, driver of the No. 4 Target Honda/Reynard owned by Chip
Ganassi. ``But if it doesn't happen, everything has a reason. You
know?''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya has been sensational as the replacement for two-time
CART FedEx Series champion Alex Zanardi. Montoya has established
CART rookie records for victories (7) and laps-led (929) and has
tied the rookie mark for pole positions (7). If he can outscore
Franchitti after 250 laps around the 2-mile California Speedway,
Montoya will join Nigel Mansell (1993) as the only rookies to have
won the PPG Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprising having won seven races and everything we've
done and we haven't won the championship,'' said Montoya, whose
crashes in consecutive street races in downtown Houston and Surfers
Paradise in Australia gave Franchitti the championship lead. ``I
think we gave away points to Dario, too many points to Dario, too
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll see what happens. I'm just going to try to take it
as cool as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti remained in contention on the strength of three
victories, including the most recent round in Australia, and a
series-high 11 podium finishes. Franchitti, who finished third in
last year's championship, can clinch by finishing as low as third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, my position is slightly different from Juan's in
the fact that I don't need to go out and win the race,'' said
Franchitti, driver of the No. 27 Kool Honda/Reynard owned by Barry
Green. ``I just sort of need to be within a place or two, I guess.
But I would like to get out there and try to win this thing. So I'm
going to be out there pushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 priority is the championship, but you just gotta go
and treat ever race the same as we have for the whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, however, only the second 500-mile race on CART's
schedule. Tony Kanaan won the U.S. 500 at the Michigan Speedway in
July, in what amounted to an afternoon of attrition. Kanaan
inherited the lead when Max Papis, gunning for his first victory
for Team Rahal, ran out of fuel in Turn 3 of the 2-mile Michigan
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's that many more things that can go wrong because of a
500-mile race,'' said Franchitti, who finished fifth at Michigan, a
sister track to California Speedway. ``The cars are pushed to their
absolute limit to run as fast as they do for that length of time.
So yeah, you've gotta work with the playing field you're given. I'm
looking forward to the 500-mile race. It's not going to be easy.
But yeah, I think it's an exciting and a fitting end to what's been
a pretty exciting season.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya finished second at Michigan in what was his first
500-miler, and is well aware that the last 50 miles is what decides
these motorized marathons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be interesting, you know, because it's very easy
to win the race and to finish 10th,'' Montoya said. ``Normally,
top-10 guys are running very close, so anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta get to the end of the race and you gotta take care
of the equipment. But you gotta race as well. I need to get many
points, so I'm going to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE THE NUMBERS UPSET SPECIALS
</P>
<P>
   A review of past winners of CART's Marlboro 500 shows that a
number of pre-race longshots have found their way into Victory
Lane:
Year Winner 1981 Pancho Carter 1982 Gordon Johncock 1983 John Paul
Jr. 1984 Mario Andretti 1985 Emerson Fittipaldi 1986 Johnny
Rutherford 1987 Michael Andretti 1988 Danny Sullivan 1989 Michael
Andretti 1990 Al Unser Jr. 1991 Rick Mears 1992 Scott Goodyear 1993
Nigel Mansell 1994 Scott Goodyear 1995 Scott Pruett 1996 Andre
Ribeiro 1997 Mark Blundell 1998 Jimmy Vasser
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS JARRETT NEARS CLINCH
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett can clinch the 1999 NASCAR Winston Cup championship
if he finishes 19th or better in the season's final three races.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett has a 246-point pad over Bobby Labonte after 31 of 34
events.
</P>
<P>
   The series is idle this weekend before heading to Phoenix
International Raceway for the Checker Auto Parts/Dura Lube 500 on
Nov. 7. Jarrett, driver of the No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford
Credit Taurus, won at PIR as recently as 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett also can clinch on the 1-mile PIR oval if he can gain
126 points on Bobby Labonte or third-place Mark Martin. TRUCK TITLE
AT STAKE
</P>
<P>
   Roush Racing's Greg Biffle can become the youngest champion in
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series history by finishing no worse than
third in the season-ending NAPA Auto Parts 200 at California
Speedway on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Biffle, 29, will take a 21-point lead into the race over
archrival Jack Sprague and the No. 24 GMAC Chevrolet. Dennis
Setzer, driver of the No. 1 Mopar Performance Dodge, is third, 25
points off the pace in the closest three-way title race in series
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was between Jack and me (for the victory) in the last race
last season,'' said Biffle, driver of the No. 50 Grainger Ford.
Sprague won that event after executing a bump pass with two laps
remaining at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real fortunate to be able to race him for the championship
this year,'' said Biffle, who has won a series-record nine races in
1999. ``But going in there with a 21-point lead doesn't give you
any cushion at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Biffle has overcome a 120-point penalty levied for a
non-approved manifold at Vegas to remain in the hunt, and perhaps
present Jack Roush his first NASCAR championship. ALLEN SEEKS
SPONSOR
</P>
<P>
   Pro Stock driver Bruce Allen and partner David Reher, both of
Arlington, still are searching for a primary sponsor to fund their
2000 National Hot Rod Association drag racing program.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the Reher-Morrison Racing Engines team, which is
losing backing from Pennzoil's The Outlaw Fuel Additives brand,
needs approximately $500,000 to run the full schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll come up with some things where we can run our car,''
said Allen, who ran two 200 mph quarter-mile laps during the
O'Reilly Fall Nationals at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis last
weekend. ``Hopefully, it'll be with a sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an associate deal with Pontiac and we're still working
on getting a major sponsor. We might have to do an engine rental
program with somebody next year. We're an engine-building shop.
That's what we do. And in racing, your name is what you are. You
get a lot of comments on the race car when it's running well, and
it helps you sell parts. So, we need to keep the car running.''
OUTLAWS RACE TIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kinser and Danny Lasoski are separated by 65 points in the
Pennzoil World of Outlaws standings with only ``A'' main events
remaining in California and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Kinser, who drives the No. 5m Mopar Performance Parts Sprint
Car, must finish ninth or better in the final two preliminary races
and ``A'' main events to clinch his second Outlaws points title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we need some help,'' Lasoski said. ``I
don't want to wish any bad luck on the 5m crew, but they're going
to have to help us for us to win this thing. We're going to have to
win all the races, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The series competes Saturday at Perris, Calif., with the
season-finale scheduled for Nov. 1-3 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
T-SHIRT NIGHT SET
</P>
<P>
   Texas Raceway in Kennedale will host Speedtek T-Shirt Night and
its annual Halloween program at the eighth-mile drag strip Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The first 500 adult spectators will receive a free Texas Raceway
t-shirt, compliments of Speedtek.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the track's regular National Hot Rod Association
Bracket Racing program, children will have a chance to
trick-or-treat in the pit area. Richard House, the track's special
events coordinator, has organized that program.
</P>
<P>
   Racing begins at 3 p.m. For more information call (972)
483-8410. LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be part of the greatest race team that drag
racing's ever seen, and I think we can say that with some certainty
so far.''

CRUCIAL ERRORS OF OMISSION ALSO HAUNT BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The box score of their final game of 1999 will show
that the Atlanta Braves committed no errors. The box score,
however, doesn't always tell the whole story. Ryan Klesko, the
Braves' first baseman, failed to make a makable play in the third
inning Wednesday night, and the New York Yankees, as they did the
entire postseason, capitalized on it for a 4-1 victory and two
record-tying World Series feats.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, generated by the two-run single Tino Martinez was
credited with on his hard grounder to Klesko, gave the Yankees two
successive World Series sweeps, only the third time that feat has
been achieved, and was the Yankees' 12th victory in a row in the
World Series. Both of these records, 12 consecutive victories and
sweeps in successive seasons, were set by _ who else? _ the Yankees
of earlier eras.
</P>
<P>
   As diluted as major league baseball may be as the result of
repeated expansion, the Yankees nevertheless have established one
of the great runs of all time. They have won three World Series
championships in the past four years, making them the first team
since the Oakland Athletics of 1972-'73-'74 to win that many times
in such a short period.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Braves, who played uncharacteristically poor
defense throughout the postseason, suffered another World Series
failure. They compiled the best won-lost record in the 1990s, won
eight consecutive division championships and played in five World
Series, but they have only one Series championship to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   This was the worst of their four World Series losses. They lost
in seven games to Minnesota in 1991, six games to Toronto in 1992
and six games to the Yankees in the 1996. Their only victory came
in 1995, when they defeated the Cleveland Indians in six games.
</P>
<P>
   In the National League Championship Series, the Braves committed
errors, too, but the New York Mets did not take advantage of the
misplays as liberally as the Yankees did in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who led Games 1 and 3 going into the eighth inning,
didn't create the semblance of a threat in Game 4 until the eighth
inning; that made Klesko's failure to field Martinez's grounder all
the more critical.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had the bases loaded with one out in the third
inning of a scoreless game when Martinez rapped a hard grounder
toward first. Klesko is not a good defensive first baseman, not
even an average defensive first baseman. He has played first base
this year because Andres Galarraga, one of the best defensive first
baseman in baseball, was out recovering from lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The ball hit by Martinez bounced twice. As it shot up from its
second bounce, Klesko, who had moved slightly to his right to get
in the ball's path, put his glove on the ground, apparently
expecting it to stay down. But the trajectory never indicated that
the ball would take that direction. That was why the ball sped over
Klesko's glove and struck him on his right forearm. It then caromed
onto the grass in short right-center field as Chuck Knoblauch and
Derek Jeter scurried home with the first two runs of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Had Klesko been able to field the ball, he would have had one
out for certain and possibly a double play because the ball was hit
hard enough to get a double play. Later in the inning, Jorge Posada
singled home a third run, giving Roger Clemens an early, luxurious
three-run margin to work with. With that kind of early lead,
pitchers can pitch a different kind of game, one that usually
benefits them.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have spent the past few weeks benefiting from their
opponents' poor defensive play. In the last six innings in which
the other teams, the Boston Red Sox and the Braves, made errors,
the Yankees scored at least one run. For the entire postseason,
their opponents committed 16 errors, and the Yankees scored 13
unearned runs out of their total of 57 runs. The Braves made 13
errors in 14 postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity is much of what the Yankees have been about the past
several seasons. They have not overwhelmed teams, but they have
left no doubt that they expect to win and much more often than not
do win. They generally have done what it has taken to win, whether
it's capitalizing on a play like Klesko's or getting a game-tying
home run from Knoblauch in the eighth inning, then a game-winning
home run from Chad Curtis in the 10th, as they did in Game 3
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning of Game 3, Knoblauch, the first batter, hit
a fly ball to right-center field that Brian Jordan dropped.
Knoblauch later scored. In the third inning of Game 2, David Cone
hit a soft two-out line drive to short that Ozzie Guillen dropped,
permitting a run to score. In Game 1, Brian Hunter, the Braves'
good-fielding first baseman, made two errors in the eighth inning,
the first on Knoblauch's sacrifice bunt that led to a four-run
flurry and a 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the American League Championship Series, the Yankees took
advantage of Red Sox miscues, of which there were many.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth and last game, Jose Offerman and Mike Stanley made
errors in the seventh inning, and the Yankees scored two runs. The
fourth game featured two such innings. Nomar Garciaparra and Bret
Saberhagen each committed an error in the fourth inning, and the
Yankees scored two runs. Errors by Offerman and Darren Lewis in the
ninth inning contributed to a six-run burst.
</P>
<P>
   Every scout who scrutinized the Yankees either during the season
or in the postseason in advance of a playoff series warned the team
that employed him that it could not give the Yankees extra outs.
They do enough damage with three outs in an inning, the scouts
wrote in great detail in their reports; they make life miserable
for their opponents when they are given a fourth or fifth out in an
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Yankees capitalized on Klesko's failure to field
Martinez's grounder, the resulting runs loomed larger and larger as
the innings passed. The Braves, frustrated with their failures,
entered the game knowing they had an arduous task to snatch this
World Series from the Yankees. They never had a chance.

 SCHOOL BOARD CONSIDERS ZACARIAS BUY OUT 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Fed up with Superintendent Ruben Zacarias'
defiant attitude and his managerial failings, a majority of the Los
Angeles school board agreed Wednesday to buy out his contract today
or fire him if he refuses, the Daily News of Los Angeles has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Cortines, former Pasadena school superintendent and former
chancellor of New York City schools, was the leading candidate to
be named interim superintendent pending a national search for a
successor, board sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias hurriedly left the Los Angeles Unified School
District's headquarters as word of the buyout spread and later
scheduled a press conference but canceled it after meeting with his
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a citizen, I am outraged,'' said his lawyer, Joseph Coyne
of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &AMP; Hampton. ``We don't believe that
under the present circumstances the board has the right to do what
they are doing. We will take whatever legal action we need to in
order to protect Ruben's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension between the board and Zacarias has escalated in the two
weeks since he was stripped of direct managerial control with the
appointment of Howard Miller as chief executive officer. It
culminated Tuesday with the superintendent's announcement he was
going to restructure the nation's second largest school district
without consulting board members or seeking their approval.
</P>
<P>
   The board was set today to redesignate Miller as chief operating
officer, but Zacarias' restructuring announcement and continued
refusal to accept a redefined role infuriated members and led to a
majority agreeing Wednesday to add the buyout to the agenda,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias has 20 months left on his contract, which was extended
for a year by the outgoing board in June. He is paid $188,000 and
would be eligible for an annual pension of nearly $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Genethia Hayes, Caprice Young, Mike Lansing and
Valerie Fields agreed it was time to get rid of Zacarias, according
to sources close to the board. Victoria Castro and David Tokofsky
opposed the action, while Julie Korenstein was wavering despite
saying it was premature to remove Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superintendent chose his own fate,'' Young said. ``The
main issue is how he has failed to move policy into action. He's
usually right on the policy, but he is not strong at all on moving
that policy into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to help him with that by hiring a chief executive
officer with strong implementation skills. The superintendent
rejected that, and I will vote for a buyout.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, Young and Lansing were elected along with incumbent
Tokofsky as a reform slate, but Fields has consistently sided with
the reformers while Tokofsky has backed Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   The board delayed Zacarias' quarterly evaluation on Tuesday but
had developed a laundry list of managerial failings in the district
that they believe can be traced back to the superintendent's
``flawed management.''
</P>
<P>
   Covering every major aspect of the public school system and
highlighted by the district's incompetent management of the
scandalous Belmont Learning Center, the accusations include that
Zacarias:
</P>
<P>
   stood by as administrators purchased millions of dollars of
toxic property for schools in South Gate without adequate
environmental assessments.
</P>
<P>
   failed to locate a backup site for a high school if Belmont
could not be built because of environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   failed to significantly raise students' scores on standardized
state tests.
</P>
<P>
   did not adequately evaluate and counsel senior administrators.
</P>
<P>
   In Zacarias' reorganization plan, he envisioned chopping the
district into 12 semiautonomous minidistricts and overhauling the
chain of command to reflect private management structure.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a defiant attempt to retain control of the district,
the superintendent also removed Miller as CEO and put him in charge
of new school construction _ the role originally assigned to the
developer and former board member.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias insisted he did not need board approval to implement
any of the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed as an act of near treason by the majority of the school
board, Zacarias' rogue reorganization plan prompted board president
Hayes and vice president Valerie Fields to move to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superintendent's reorganization shows total disregard for
the decision of the board to put Mr. Miller in charge of the
day-to-day operations of the district as chief executive officer,''
Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that the superintendent had a lot to offer and that
he could do some long-term planning for the district if he agreed
to work with Mr. Miller. He showed a complete unwillingness to
accept that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro, a longtime Zacarias supporter, accused the reform board
members of planning to remove Zacarias from the day they took
office in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is it's a done deal,'' Castro said. ``If they
posted it, in my experience that's it _ it's done. It's not a
surprise to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to equate it to a hostile takeover of a corporation.
You put a new board in place, you don't inform your stakeholders of
significant changes, and you take over a public entity. You make it
into a corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Korenstein said efforts to remove Zacarias were hasty and
premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad for the district; it's dangerous for the district;
it's very unproductive. And it will cause such a major reaction
that it will be difficult to pick up the broken pieces,''
Korenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be good, at a minimum, to begin a national search and
know what kind of priorities we want in a superintendent and know
what we're looking for. It would have been good to complete his
evaluation to know whether or not he fulfilled the criteria we gave
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky, who represents a predominantly Latino portion of the
district, also was critical of the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between thoughtful governing and
campaign promises,'' Tokofsky said. ``I think we ought to be more
thoughtful. If the action is to sever the superintendent's
contract, I will oppose that action.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the board's decision to elevate Miller, several hundred
Latino parents and community organizers have protested outside
LAUSD headquarters to support Zacarias and denounce the managerial
shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   Sigifredo Lopez, president of the Parents Community Coalition
that organized last's week rally, criticized Hayes and said a
demonstration would be held today in support of Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has no respect for the community and no respect for the
students,'' Lopez said. ``These people are not looking out for the
students. It's completely insulting to the process and insulting to
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by state Sen. Richard Polanco and County Supervisor Gloria
Molina, the superintendent's supporters charged Miller's
appointment violated the superintendent's contract and broke state
education laws.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry prompted the board to agree to vote on Miller's
appointment again in public today and change his title to chief
operating officer. The original vote, coming after environmental
problems were discovered on proposed sites for schools in South
Gate, was taken behind closed doors with almost no advance notice
and without public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, who tried
to mediate the standoff between Zacarias and the board, said board
members must now take steps to quell the anger their handling of
Zacarias caused. They must include the public in the process of
picking a new superintendent, rather than choosing one behind
closed doors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this city needs right now is to calm the waters,'' said
Villaraigosa, a likely mayoral candidate. ``We need to have a
public dialogue, and we need to find someone who can be a change
agent and is willing to do whatever it takes to make our schools
the envy of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, a leading Belmont critic,
said the board now needed to put together a plan for reorganizing
the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see changes,'' he said. ``I don't want to see just a
change of faces.''

STATION CASINO KANSAS CITY COMES UNDER FIRE FROM BLACK CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARYLAND HEIGHTS, Mo. _ Station Casino Kansas City should be
held to an agreement guaranteeing greater participation by
minorities and women in casino purchasing and ownership decisions,
the Missouri Gaming Commission was told Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph E. Mabin, president of the Black Chamber of Commerce of
Greater Kansas City, said the agreement between Station and the
Kansas City Port Authority was not being enforced. At the
commission's monthly meeting, held in a St. Louis suburb, he urged
commissioners to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Port Authority has been lax in their duty,'' Mabin told
commissioners, ``and has turned a blind eye to the growth and
development of minority business enterprises in Kansas City. ... We
need some help.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, attended by more than 100 people, had a full
agenda. Commissioners also heard testimony opposing Station's bid
to purchase Flamingo Hilton Casino and opposing additional casinos
in the St. Louis area.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Mabin said his group wanted the
commission to insist that Station adhere to its agreement with the
Port Authority on minorities before allowing Station to buy the
Flamingo Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Mabin said his group was offended that, years after opening,
Station was still falling short of its goal of 35 percent
purchasing from minority- and women-owned firms and that no
minority members had been brought into the casino's ownership mix.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Station last year, the Port Authority
indefinitely excused the casino from its 10 percent
minority-ownership obligation because it found ``no (minority)
interest in an investment in your company's project'' until it was
more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   That time is now, officials agree, as the Kansas City market has
grown, even without open boarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can come up with a dozen names off the top of my head'' of
investors willing to buy preferred shares of stock in Station's
Missouri subsidiary, Mabin said.
</P>
<P>
   Station executives in recent weeks have met with Mabin's group
to find solutions to purchasing issues. Station also has signed
contracts with at least two minority-owned vendors, for office
supplies and poultry, according to A. Marie Young, executive
director of the Black Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter earlier this month to the Port Authority, Station's
Midwest counsel, Troy A. Stremming, said buying goods and services
from minority vendors was easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the casino's business is in gambling equipment and
supplies for which there are no minority vendors, he said. Missouri
law also requires the casino to purchase liquor from specific,
nonminority vendors. Besides that, Stremming said, many firms _
minority and otherwise _ fail to pass Gaming Commission background
checks as licensed casino vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Stremming noted in his letter that Station had achieved a 30
percent purchasing level from minority- and women-owned firms and
pledged new outreach efforts to reach the 35 percent goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mabin applauded Station's recent efforts but said the casino
must do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a promise to improve this relationship,'' he said.
``But we've had promises before.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert M. Kohn, a Kansas City lawyer representing KC
Entertainment LLC, told commissioners the pending purchase of the
Flamingo Hilton by Station would be anti-competitive and would
leave gamblers with a ``take it or leave it'' choice in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn's clients, including Bill Grace, principal owner of The
Woodlands racetrack, want to buy and operate the Flamingo
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn told commissioners that Station Casino would control 48
percent of the Kansas City market and Harrah's Entertainment Inc.
would control 35 percent if Station is allowed to acquire the
Flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   Station officials did not respond to Kohn's comments Wednesday.
A company executive recently dismissed the group's market-monopoly
concerns in Kansas City as a nonissue.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Kohn said, his KC Entertainment clients would bring
market diversity, gambling experience, a commitment to minority and
women involvement, and local ownership to the Kansas City market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Grace, key owners would include Joseph J. Canfora
and other executives of Illinois-based Empress Entertainment Inc.,
which operates casinos in the Chicago market. Canfora is a one-time
Station executive and former president of the Kansas City casino.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn also identified five local prospective investors in the
ownership group. They are Georgia Buchanan, president of All Pro
Construction Inc. and widow of Kansas City Chiefs great Buck
Buchanan; Roger Cohen, co-executive chairman of Cohen-Esrey Real
Estate Services; Rafael Garcia, president and chief executive of
Rafael Architects Inc.; Mary Jane Kelly, president of J.P. Kelly
Properties and a Northland political activist; and Tula Turner
Thompson, president of Supreme Insulation Inc.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis area minister Gary J. Thomas led the largest
delegation of visitors _ from the new South County First citizens
group _ to oppose new riverboat casinos in south St. Louis County.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to suck money out of the community ... selling
that false dream of getting rich,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Three casino companies are pushing the commission to approve
additional riverboats in the St. Louis market.
</P>
<P>
   Station Casino St. Charles and the President Casino on the
Admiral in St. Louis were also expected to oppose market expansion,
but at the last minute they canceled presentations to commissioners
that had been scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues at Station and President have been essentially flat
since the four-boat Riverport casino complex opened in Maryland
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaming Commission also agreed to fine Harrah's North Kansas
City Casino &AMP; Hotel $20,000 for failing to properly inspect dice
before putting them into craps play and other violations of the
commission's security and personnel staffing rules.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's has 30 days to decide whether to contest the penalty.

TEXAS WHEELCHAIR TEAM FINDS HELP FROM DOWN UNDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOBIAS LOPEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The mooring rope that tied the high-speed
ferry to the dock wrapped around Brad Ness's right ankle like an
angry boa constrictor, and an instant later he no longer had a
foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like breaking a stick in half. I heard the sound before
I felt anything,'' said Ness, who was a teen-ager at the time. ``I
looked down and my foot was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness, now 24, began his freshman year at the University of
Texas-Arlington this fall, and the Wagin, Australia, native has
quickly become an integral part of the Movin' Mavs wheelchair
basketball team. In the process, he has formed strong bonds with
his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Ness learned of Texas-Arlington's program through another
Australian player on the team, Campbell Message. The chance to earn
a college education and to play wheelchair basketball brought Ness
to Arlington this fall, a little more than six years after his
accident.
</P>
<P>
   He was working as a deckhand at the ferry dock and thought he
was clear of the mooring rope when he was injured at 11:30 p.m. on
Dec. 12, 1992. After the accident, his right leg had to be
amputated below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Before the accident, he had been an Australian Rules Football
player. He realized he could no longer play that sport at the same
level, but he wanted to remain in competitive athletics, so he took
up swimming and wheelchair basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The Movin' Mavs' 77-43 rout of the Houston Rolling Rockets
semi-professional team on Saturday was Ness' first start for
Texas-Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome to play with a college team with the backing
the Movin' Mavs have,'' Ness said. ``The atmosphere the college
puts on for game night was quite special.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness, 6-foot-4, battled all night with Houston's Paul Schlobaum,
a 7-foot-1 center, and held him to 12 points without picking up a
foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to being the biggest person on the court,'' Ness
said. ``He was a man-mountain; once he was in position he was hard
to move. It was good experience to play against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Movin' Mavs were bumped from the national
wheelchair tournament for the second consecutive season by
Illinois, mostly because they were overpowered on the inside by the
Illini's Will Waller and Pat Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington coach Jim Hayes said coupling Ness with forward
Eddie McGee should even things up in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing at the highest level anywhere when we're against
Illinois.'' Hayes said. ``It's going to take superior players to
play with them, but he works so well with Eddie. He sees the floor
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee agrees with Hayes' assessment of Ness and said he gladly
welcomes the rebound help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a load off my shoulders,'' McGee said. ``He's like a big
vacuum cleaner; anything that pops out he gets.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee and Ness, both single-leg amputees, have quickly become
friends off the court as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty amazing. (Amputees) tend to stick together, so
there's always a few stories to be told.'' Ness said of McGee.
``He's pretty loud, so he always makes you feel welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Ness and Message like to watch Australian Rules Football games
on cable TV together, and Ness said he doesn't miss playing too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to play wheelchair basketball at the level we are
now more than compensates for not being able to play football,''
Ness said. ``I'd rather watch it with a few mates and a couple of
beers than go through the heartache of playing again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Movin' Mavs are scheduled to travel to Wisconsin-Whitewater
on Nov. 19 for a round-robin tournament. They'll face Whitewater
and Illinois, the teams that finished first and second in the
national tournament last season, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Ness said he's enjoying American culture, especially the team's
Sunday trips to an area restaurant and the opportunity to play for
Texas-Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   He also appreciates the living accommodations for the wheelchair
team at the school _ most of the players live in close proximity to
each other in student housing on the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is by far one of the most superior setups, offering the
education and to be looked after the way we are as wheelchair
athletes,'' Ness said. ``I'm honored to be a part of the Movin'
Mavs.''

EX-OFFENDERS NEED A CHANCE TO BE HIRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ninety-five percent of people who are sentenced to prison come
back out. Many think the best tool for keeping them out is a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``To break the cycle of recidivism, first and foremost, they
need a decent job,'' said Patrick Zaiss, executive director of
Volunteers in Prisons, a Kansas City, Kan., organization that,
among other things, helps ex-offenders mesh back into the
community.
</P>
<P>
   But saying they need jobs is much easier than actually landing
them.
</P>
<P>
   A survey this year by Express Personnel Services, an employment
agency, found that only one in four employers would hire a former
convict. Why take a chance when horrible, high-profile crimes
committed by ex-cons fill our news pages and make us wary of those
whose pasts include prison?
</P>
<P>
   It's a vicious circle, and perhaps a case where the crimes of a
few ruin chances for others to slide back into the work world.
</P>
<P>
   Felons, especially those convicted of violent or sex crimes,
aren't what most people would call model employee material. And
what financial institution would embrace a convicted embezzler?
</P>
<P>
   Many organizations, particularly some big businesses, have
outright policies: We don't hire ex-cons.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations, because of the tight labor market, are
desperate for workers and are willing to take a chance _ but only
if their managers believe in rehabilitation, can be convinced it
has occurred and are comfortable with the management challenges
involved.
</P>
<P>
   When Zaiss counsels ex-offenders, he emphasizes honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a checkered past, be honest about it if asked,''
he said. ``If someone is not going to hire you, it's better to
learn it quickly and not waste time.''
</P>
<P>
   Avert Inc., a company that conducts employment background
checks, said last year that nearly one in 10 job applicants it
researched had a criminal record. With more organizations
conducting background checks, it's less likely an applicant can
hide jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Zaiss said getting to the truth quickly was important because
research finds that the first six months out of prison are pivotal.
Without a return to financial stability in that period, recidivism
is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't waste time pursuing employment that isn't realistic,''
he advised parolees. ``Look at places where you have an advocate.
Depending on the nature of your crime, some places absolutely will
not consider you. But if you're up-front, honest and sincere and
can accurately describe your self-improvement efforts, a lot of
employers will give you a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaiss said the best job-finding success for parolees came in the
``slightly better than entry-level category _ about $7.50 an hour
or so.'' But if the ex-offender has a trade or special skill, he or
she can do far better.
</P>
<P>
   Zaiss told one ex-con to list on his resume his work as an
electrician in prison. The skill and experience landed him a job
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring convicted criminals means taking a chance. But it's a
chance that some employers must be willing to take, provided
instinct and information make it seem the right thing to do.

SCHOOL BOARD CONSIDERS ZACARIAS BUY OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Fed up with Superintendent Ruben Zacarias'
defiant attitude and his managerial failings, a majority of the Los
Angeles school board agreed Wednesday to buy out his contract today
or fire him if he refuses, the Daily News of Los Angeles has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Cortines, former Pasadena school superintendent and former
chancellor of New York City schools, was the leading candidate to
be named interim superintendent pending a national search for a
successor, board sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias hurriedly left the Los Angeles Unified School
District's headquarters as word of the buyout spread and later
scheduled a press conference but canceled it after meeting with his
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a citizen, I am outraged,'' said his lawyer, Joseph Coyne
of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &AMP; Hampton. ``We don't believe that
under the present circumstances the board has the right to do what
they are doing. We will take whatever legal action we need to in
order to protect Ruben's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension between the board and Zacarias has escalated in the two
weeks since he was stripped of direct managerial control with the
appointment of Howard Miller as chief executive officer. It
culminated Tuesday with the superintendent's announcement he was
going to restructure the nation's second largest school district
without consulting board members or seeking their approval.
</P>
<P>
   The board was set today to redesignate Miller as chief operating
officer, but Zacarias' restructuring announcement and continued
refusal to accept a redefined role infuriated members and led to a
majority agreeing Wednesday to add the buyout to the agenda,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias has 20 months left on his contract, which was extended
for a year by the outgoing board in June. He is paid $188,000 and
would be eligible for an annual pension of nearly $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Genethia Hayes, Caprice Young, Mike Lansing and
Valerie Fields agreed it was time to get rid of Zacarias, according
to sources close to the board. Victoria Castro and David Tokofsky
opposed the action, while Julie Korenstein was wavering despite
saying it was premature to remove Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superintendent chose his own fate,'' Young said. ``The
main issue is how he has failed to move policy into action. He's
usually right on the policy, but he is not strong at all on moving
that policy into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to help him with that by hiring a chief executive
officer with strong implementation skills. The superintendent
rejected that, and I will vote for a buyout.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, Young and Lansing were elected along with incumbent
Tokofsky as a reform slate, but Fields has consistently sided with
the reformers while Tokofsky has backed Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   The board delayed Zacarias' quarterly evaluation on Tuesday but
had developed a laundry list of managerial failings in the district
that they believe can be traced back to the superintendent's
``flawed management.''
</P>
<P>
   Covering every major aspect of the public school system and
highlighted by the district's incompetent management of the
scandalous Belmont Learning Center, the accusations include that
Zacarias:
</P>
<P>
   stood by as administrators purchased millions of dollars of
toxic property for schools in South Gate without adequate
environmental assessments.
</P>
<P>
   failed to locate a backup site for a high school if Belmont
could not be built because of environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   failed to significantly raise students' scores on standardized
state tests.
</P>
<P>
   did not adequately evaluate and counsel senior administrators.
</P>
<P>
   In Zacarias' reorganization plan, he envisioned chopping the
district into 12 semiautonomous minidistricts and overhauling the
chain of command to reflect private management structure.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a defiant attempt to retain control of the district,
the superintendent also removed Miller as CEO and put him in charge
of new school construction _ the role originally assigned to the
developer and former board member.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias insisted he did not need board approval to implement
any of the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed as an act of near treason by the majority of the school
board, Zacarias' rogue reorganization plan prompted board president
Hayes and vice president Valerie Fields to move to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superintendent's reorganization shows total disregard for
the decision of the board to put Mr. Miller in charge of the
day-to-day operations of the district as chief executive officer,''
Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that the superintendent had a lot to offer and that
he could do some long-term planning for the district if he agreed
to work with Mr. Miller. He showed a complete unwillingness to
accept that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro, a longtime Zacarias supporter, accused the reform board
members of planning to remove Zacarias from the day they took
office in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is it's a done deal,'' Castro said. ``If they
posted it, in my experience that's it _ it's done. It's not a
surprise to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to equate it to a hostile takeover of a corporation.
You put a new board in place, you don't inform your stakeholders of
significant changes, and you take over a public entity. You make it
into a corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Korenstein said efforts to remove Zacarias were hasty and
premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad for the district; it's dangerous for the district;
it's very unproductive. And it will cause such a major reaction
that it will be difficult to pick up the broken pieces,''
Korenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be good, at a minimum, to begin a national search and
know what kind of priorities we want in a superintendent and know
what we're looking for. It would have been good to complete his
evaluation to know whether or not he fulfilled the criteria we gave
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky, who represents a predominantly Latino portion of the
district, also was critical of the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between thoughtful governing and
campaign promises,'' Tokofsky said. ``I think we ought to be more
thoughtful. If the action is to sever the superintendent's
contract, I will oppose that action.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the board's decision to elevate Miller, several hundred
Latino parents and community organizers have protested outside
LAUSD headquarters to support Zacarias and denounce the managerial
shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   Sigifredo Lopez, president of the Parents Community Coalition
that organized last's week rally, criticized Hayes and said a
demonstration would be held today in support of Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has no respect for the community and no respect for the
students,'' Lopez said. ``These people are not looking out for the
students. It's completely insulting to the process and insulting to
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by state Sen. Richard Polanco and County Supervisor Gloria
Molina, the superintendent's supporters charged Miller's
appointment violated the superintendent's contract and broke state
education laws.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry prompted the board to agree to vote on Miller's
appointment again in public today and change his title to chief
operating officer. The original vote, coming after environmental
problems were discovered on proposed sites for schools in South
Gate, was taken behind closed doors with almost no advance notice
and without public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, who tried
to mediate the standoff between Zacarias and the board, said board
members must now take steps to quell the anger their handling of
Zacarias caused. They must include the public in the process of
picking a new superintendent, rather than choosing one behind
closed doors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this city needs right now is to calm the waters,'' said
Villaraigosa, a likely mayoral candidate. ``We need to have a
public dialogue, and we need to find someone who can be a change
agent and is willing to do whatever it takes to make our schools
the envy of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, a leading Belmont critic,
said the board now needed to put together a plan for reorganizing
the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see changes,'' he said. ``I don't want to see just a
change of faces.''

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- Armenians in Southern California, the largest
community of Armenians outside their homeland, struggled Wednesday
to understand why the country's prime minister and others were
assassinated and whether the attack heralded more bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as anything that will lead to an overthrow.
If it's a coup d'etat, it's a lousy coup d'etat,'' said Vicken
Sonentz-Papazian, executive director of the western region of the
Armenian National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Armen Melkonian, consul general at the Armenian Consulate in
Beverly Hills, said he knew several of those killed.
</P>
<P>
   Melkonian said modern Armenia is still a young country _ one of
the 15 independent republics that emerged from the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991. But he stressed that people in Armenia and
abroad today have faith in the strength of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a terrorist act,'' Melkonian said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects local Armenians to support their homeland as it
attempts to fill the political leadership void left by the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will do more than ever to help Armenia out of this
economic crisis,'' Melkonian said.
</P>
<P>
   He added the Armenian community in Glendale and elsewhere in
Southern California is likely to hold memorials in coming days. A
condolence book will be set out at the consulate building for
people to sign, Melkonian said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five gunmen, Nairi Unanian, said in a telephone
interview with a local television station that the attack was
carried out to protest the government's lack of attention to hunger
and the poor economy. But local Armenians said the situation in the
country was worse in the wake of such previous hardships as the
1988 earthquake and the country's struggle for independence from
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been tougher in the past and it never came to
this,'' Sonentz-Papazian said.
</P>
<P>
   Sonentz-Papazian also said there was no evidence outside
Parliament or elsewhere in the country of an organized revolt.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the death of the prime minister and at least six
others trickled out, many of the 450,000 Armenians living in
Southern California were glued to their televisions and radios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this really touches everyone's heart. There is
a very strong connection between Armenians living in the United
States and Armenia,'' said Levon Marashalian, a professor of
history at Glendale Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked and upset. It's a great loss of Armenian
leaders,'' said Glendale Councilman Rafi Manoukian.
</P>
<P>
   Marashalian said it did not make sense for the gunmen to kill
these politicians in a protest about hunger and a bad economy. The
professor said he believed Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian was the
leader of a government effort to finally do something about the
poor economy. Previous political leaders had ignored the economic
crisis in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects a lot of the anger and frustration people feel
toward a bad economic situation,'' Marashalian said. ``The irony is
the very people they took this action against were the very people
who are taking concrete action to fix the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Armenians here, the attack on the Parliament is as
upsetting as an attack on the U.S. Capitol would be for Americans,
Sonentz-Papazian said.
</P>
<P>
   Local Armenians have played a key role in helping people in
their homeland before, when it suffered a devastating earthquake in
1988, struggled to gain independence from Soviet Union, fought a
war with neighboring Azerbaijan and endured economic blockade by
Turkey and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Local Armenians have been generous in supporting frequent
airlifts of food and supplies to Armenia and many send money to
their relatives there.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Pasadena, said he met Sarkisian when the
prime minister visited Washington, D.C., three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Minister Sarkisian was a patriot and cared deeply about
the cause of independence. I am saddened at the loss of a respected
leader,'' Rogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan himself visited Armenia in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Yerevan just over one month ago, and I saw firsthand
the Armenian government's success in expanding democracy and
developing a healthy economy,'' Rogan said. ``I am saddened that
rogue terrorists would try to compromise this work with acts of
violence.''

CATTLE OWNERS PREPARE THEIR ANIMALS FOR AMERICAN ROYAL
COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED FLETCHER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today is Miss Sweetness' big day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500-pound heifer from Mineral Point, Wis., is to show her
grace, beauty and pedigree against 208 others at an American Royal
event in Hale Arena.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for her 8 a.m. appearance, her day was to start
at 2 a.m. She is to receive the normal wash, conditioning and blow
drying, as well as a mousse-like adhesive to help her hair stand up
in some places and sit down in others. She also will get an
oil-based spray to make her hair shine and some last-minute
tweaking to make sure she looks her best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is kind of the finishing touches,'' said Shane Lindsey, a
consultant for Sweetness' owner, Carrousel Farms.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey leads a team of four who prepare Carrousel Farms' eight
cattle for the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The livestock show began Wednesday and runs through Nov. 6.
Before the show ends, 2,013 competitors will display 2,126 cattle,
hogs, sheep and llamas. The 100th year of the livestock show will
draw competitors from 38 states.
</P>
<P>
   Three rows down and across the staging room isle from the
Carrousel Farms team, Adam, Matt and Casey Owen, ages 16, 14 and 8,
respectively, are to prepare their seven cattle for a showing at 2
p.m. today. The only consultants helping these Springfield, Mo.,
boys will be their father, Aaron Owen, and mother, Jennie Owen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much do all of it,'' said Adam, who has been showing
cattle since age 8. ``It is pretty much a family thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys will enter their cattle in the junior and open
categories. The showing for juniors is limited to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are obvious disparities in the resources that the
teams commit to winning the blue ribbon, their motives are the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the competition) is basically to advertise what we have at
home,'' said Brad Bader, a Carrousel Farms owner.
</P>
<P>
   Bader, his brothers and father own Carrousel Farms, a large
family operation with divisions in Mineral Point and Monroe, Wis.
Bader, 39, said he showed animals when he was a boy. This year he
will fly into Kansas City, Mo., to see Sweetness and his other
cattle compete.
</P>
<P>
   Adam said he competed to have fun and to promote Owen Brothers
Cattle Co.'s 50-head herd. Adam said he did not have a problem with
owners who don't have time to prepare their own animals. He said he
had worked for some in the past.
</P>
<P>
   There are few trade secrets when it comes to showing animals,
Lindsey said. The real work takes place before any of the animals
arrive at the show. Breeding, feeding and handling the animals are
just as important, if not more important, than combing the hair the
right way, Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, the people that win have both good management and a
good animal,'' Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just all kinds of things that you have to do before
you get to a show to produce a winner,'' Lindsey said after
blow-drying Sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a whole day clipping their hair,'' said Lindsey. ``All
the clipping and stuff is just to enhance their strong points and
hide their weak points.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping with the shows, Lindsey also helps make
breeding decisions. This is Carrousel Farms' first year at the
American Royal. Scheduling conflicts prevented Carrousel Farms from
attending previous shows.
</P>
<P>
   This year the other Limousin heifers will have to reckon with
Sweetness and all her majestic beauty. After being named supreme
champion at the World Beef Exposition in Milwaukee, Sweetness has a
good chance to take the crown in Kansas City, Lindsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Owen Brothers raise Simmentals, so they will not compete
against Sweetness.

ST. LOUIS WOMAN TESTIFIES AT EPA HEARING ON RADIATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 1 p.m., and Kay Drey is still at the microphone. She's been
there for 40 minutes, testifying to federal officials. Actually,
she's reading to them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the most incredible documents I have in my large nuclear
power and radioactive waste library,'' recites Drey, ``is a set of
technical reports from the 1980s about the need to meet the
challenges of warning human beings ... to avoid the lethal nuclear
electricity wastes we are leaving for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, how will humanity warn its progeny in 10,000
years of the dangerous wastes that may be buried in a mountain in
Nevada?
</P>
<P>
   Drey was the only person scheduled to testify Wednesday at a
national hearing in Kansas City, Mo. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency wanted to hear what the public thought about its
proposed limit on radiation from a nuclear waste repository,
currently proposed for Yucca Mountain in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Drey is a St. Louis environmentalist who has campaigned in
Missouri and across the nation for a quarter-century against
nuclear power and the disposal of nuclear wastes.
</P>
<P>
   To her, the very idea of burying the nation's nuclear wastes in
the ground raises so many questions it makes her dizzy. But the
most basic and unanswerable one, she told the federal officials, is
how to warn those who will follow us.
</P>
<P>
   Will we leave a sign? A video? How about an e-mail? What?
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we keep 300 generations of our descendants away from
these lethal wastes? Is it remotely possible?''
</P>
<P>
   Drey added that she had seen attempts at markers or signs that
could be left to warn of the buried wastes. One shows a figure with
what appears to be a shovel, a dark line slashing through it.
</P>
<P>
   Another, she added, shows a series of panels with what appear to
be men, although one person confused them as cattle, who are
standing near a hole with something liquidlike spewing out. In the
final panel, one of the figures has fallen to the ground, stricken
by some unknown danger.
</P>
<P>
   Drey held up for the federal officials other documents and a
statement she gave once in Washington to the National Academy of
Sciences. ``That day three of us testified,'' she quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Drey's talk inspired one other person to speak to the federal
officials Wednesday, expressing concerns about the hazards of
transporting the wastes through Kansas City and other urban
centers. Indeed, much of it will come through Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite a turnout of just five, federal officials say the EPA's
proposed radiation limit for Yucca Mountain may be among the most
important yet resolved for one of America's most complex problems:
What should be done with the tons and tons of highly radioactive
spent nuclear fuel?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disappointing,'' said Rafaela Ferguson of the EPA's
Radiation Information Center in Washington of the turnout in Kansas
City. ``We did expect more would testify.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the last of four hearings that the EPA has held across
the nation on its proposed radiation limit. The agency should issue
its final rule next summer.
</P>
<P>
   For years, nuclear power plants have given many Americans cheap
electricity; but now the time has come to dispose of the wastes.
The nuclear power industry wants the nation to store it in Yucca
Mountain, a 1,200-foot high volcanic ridge that extends for six
miles in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   In its desert climate, little rain means there should be little
chance for the wastes to leak into ground water. But questions
still remain about Yucca Mountain. Yucca Mountain is still years
away from becoming the final choice for the wastes. If all
government approvals are won, the Department of Energy might seek
an application to build the site in 2002. Disposal isn't expected
to begin before 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's role is to set the limit of radiation that will be
allowed to escape from whatever repository is chosen. By law, the
agency must set a limit that is scientifically sound, reasonable to
implement and protective of human health and the environment, said
Frank Marcinowski, acting director of the EPA's radiation
protection division.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the repository will be judged against,''
Marcinowski said of the importance of the radiation limit.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinowski led the hearing Wednesday, politely allowing the
passionate Drey to continue her remarks beyond the normal 10-minute
limit. There was, after all, no one else signed up to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has proposed a radiation limit of 15 millirem, a
radiation exposure equal to little less than two chest X-rays. The
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, however, has pushed for a less
stringent limit, one that would be easier to meet, Marcinowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA calculates the risk from exposure to 15 millirems as a 3
in 10,000 chance of developing a fatal cancer. The Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's proposal would result in a 5 in 10,000
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Drey actually supports the EPA here, although she has supported
little of what the federal government has done in its dealings with
the nuclear power industry.
</P>
<P>
   Drey's solution to the nuclear waste issue is to not ship the
irradiated fuel rods from more than 100 nuclear reactors by highway
and rail. Keep it at at the nuclear reactor sites until a better
solution is found.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Marcinowski called for a recess until someone wished to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could that be?'' asked one woman in the sparse audience.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes fell on Drey. But Drey just sat. She had made her
point.

PARENTS SEEING RED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All year, Dysart Elementary School's sixth-grade teachers have
complained that they can't teach science and social studies without
books.
</P>
<P>
   They made their point last week by giving every student in the
classes C's on their report cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mouth almost hit the floor,'' Deana Freet, who has a
sixth-grade daughter, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they (the teachers) were being silly and stupid,''
said her daughter, Breanna, an 11-year-old honor roll student.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers, Bob Veigel and Pat Orlinski, told parents that
they decided to give the same grade, a ``C,'' to everyone in those
two subjects because of the shortage of textbooks, Freet said.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers would not comment, but their actions ignited a
firestorm of criticism from parents, teachers and their supervisors
at Dysart Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is not only embarrassing, it is absolutely
unacceptable to all for us,'' Superintendent Margo Seck said
Wednesday. ``It is our strong belief that children should never be
penalized for the actions taken by adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Seck said administrative action will be taken against Veigel, a
long-term substitute teacher; and Orlinski, who started working as
a Dysart teacher this fall. But Seck didn't specify what will be
done. The Dysart Unified School Board is expected to discuss the
incident at its Tuesday meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Seck issued a statement apologizing to the
students and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Seck said there was a book shortage because there were more
sixth-graders than expected at Dysart Elementary, a new school that
opened this year in El Mirage. She said additional textbooks have
been ordered and should be on campus by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Dysart Elementary Principal Marsha Baney said mentors, or
teaching coaches, provided lesson packets for the sixth-grade
teachers to use and photocopy because science and social studies
books had not arrived at the school at 11405 N. Dysart Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books are just one resource,'' Baney said.
</P>
<P>
   She is reviewing the two teachers' grade books to make sure
students are given a ``fair evaluation for their workquarter'' and will send a letter home to parents on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Parent April Allen said she wouldn't mind what grade her son,
Chris Gatti, got on his report card as long as he deserved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so upset,'' Allen said about the teachers' move. ``I don't
feel like (Chris) is getting the same education as kids at other
schools in the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers should use other resources to teach from if there
aren't enough books, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Holm, a Glendale resident whose 4-year-old daughter attends
preschool at Dysart Elementary, said the two teachers were wrong to
give everyone ``C'' grades. Her son, Christopher, is a sixth-grader
at Luke Elementary, and there's a textbook shortage there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is an `A,' `B' student, and I'd be disappointed if he
got a `C,' '' Holm said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believes what happened at Dysart Elementary is part
of a bigger problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a teacher shortage. The pay is so low that they can't
get the teachers out here to teach,'' Holm said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Trujillo, a Surprise resident whose daughter, Alexis, is
a third-grader at Dysart Elementary, said he understands the
teachers' frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to do their jobs, but they don't have the
right resources,'' Trujillo said. ``What they did has drawn
attention, and now everybody knows about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Freet said the sixth-grade teachers took the wrong approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am angry. They're not doing their job. Their job is to
teach, to challenge and prepare the students,'' she said. ``Why
should the child pay for the teachers not doing their job?'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: CLEMENS LEADS THE YANKEES TO THEIR THIRD TITLE IN
FOUR SEASONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Clemens earned his ring, not redemption,
Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late to annul 1986, or other postseason failures, if
that's what he had come here to do.
</P>
<P>
   It was too far along the trail of inevitability, which
dead-ended for the Atlanta Braves into a second straight four-game
World Series sweep for New York. The bandwagon Clemens jumped on
was too tough, too good, too focused on higher callings and
surviving actual trauma, like the death early Wednesday morning of
Paul O'Neill's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``A special day for Roger,'' manager Joe Torre said before
Clemens finally lived up to his billing. Clemens overpowered the
Braves as the Yankees won Game 4, 4-1, and unofficially captured
bragging rights to the 1990s, along with the rest of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming to Yankee Stadium, in the Yankees' uniform,'' Torre
added, ``there will be a lot of emotion, but there won't be a lot
of baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, for that matter, pressure.
</P>
<P>
   As it was all month, the tension created by fear of losing the
series was gone by the time Torre got around to his 37-year-old
future Hall of Fame right-hander. The Braves' manager, Bobby Cox,
had already guessed wrong too many times. The startlingly efficient
Yankees had made too many series-defining plays. All that was left
for Clemens was to toss 7 2-3 four-hit innings to punctuate the
Yankees' 25th title. The heavy lifting had already been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awesome feeling to be back to have this chance
again,'' Clemens had said, 13 years after Game 6 slipped under Bill
Buckner's glove and the 1986 World Series went to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient history, yet indisputably a key element of the Roger
Clemens story. For all his 247 major league victories, his Cy Young
awards, his 20-strikeout games, the postseason had always been his
worst season. He joined the Yankees with one victory in nine
playoff starts, including an embarrassing 1990 league series
ejection against Oakland and his former nemesis, Dave Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion,'' Stewart had said after Clemens left the Blue
Jays for the Yankees, ``Roger hasn't proved anything in postseason
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was mystified that Clemens preferred to pitch for a team
on which he would not likely be the main mound man, as opposed to
making a difference with the young Toronto staff. Stewart, it
turned out, was wrong about the Blue Jays, who never came close to
these playoffs, and right about the Yankees, who slotted Clemens
into their deep rotation as if he were Masato Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez became the regular and postseason ace. David
Cone threw a perfect game. Andy Pettitte stood tall after lifting
his head from the trading block. Mariano Rivera, out of the bullpen
to retire Chipper Jones with two on in the eighth and claim the
last three outs, was this team's Cy Young and the World Series most
valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect, you know, that Roger was going to win the Cy
Young award,'' Torre said. ``We felt he was a good fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was, actually, more of a fitful presence among steady
veterans, a tightly wound Texan somewhat out of step on this
internationally flavored team. ``High-deki,'' Clemens called Hideki
Irabu during the Boston series, as if he'd just been introduced to
the roster. Monday, he was involved in a brief scuffle with a fan,
another unYankee-like occurrence during Torre's four-year reign of
tranquillity that has now brought three titles.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees digested Clemens' struggles, his ``baggage,'' as
they have everyone else's, with only a few hiccups. The true New
York angle of this team was how much it could assimilate, how much
it could absorb. The pregame news that O'Neill's father had died
was the latest in a numbing run of illness and tragedy. With a
damaged rib and an aching heart, O'Neill played on Wednesday night,
the way his team survived cancer in its clubhouse and the deaths of
three players' fathers in six weeks. It made this team's postseason
dominance, its 11-1 run, a breathtaking experience for those lucky
enough to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   As a Yankee, Clemens had the chance to talk pitching last spring
with Catfish Hunter, months before Hunter would die of Lou Gehrig's
disease. He heard Paul Simon honor Joe DiMaggio in verse, from the
very space the departed DiMaggio once roamed. He saw Yogi Berra
come home to throw out the first ball on opening day. Before
Wednesday night's game, he went out to commune with the Babe Ruth
memorial in Monument Park.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens wore the most hallowed uniform in American sports, and
was given the ball with the ring within reach. It was too late in
the series for this to be about personal redemption. It was
something far better than that. It was about winning, as a Yankee.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Devils were hardly at
their best Wednesday night, but they accomplished what they wanted,
a 2-1 victory over the St. Louis Blues in a game at Continental
Arena where the announced crowd of 13,347 seemed to be more
interested in the baseball game in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur was outstanding, making 23 saves and just missing
his second shutout of the season and 38th of his career with 3
minutes 50 seconds left in the game when Scott Young beat him over
the stick from the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur was fortunate on the last play of the game, when Pavol
Demitra missed the goal as time expired with the Devils standing
around watching, thinking that Demitra was off side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird,'' Brodeur said of the last play. ``Everybody
stopped. We were lucky he didn't get off a better shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy McKay and Brian Rolston scored for the Devils, who
improved to 5-3-1. They took 23 shots against Roman Turek, who had
a four-game winning streak coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues came into the game having won 6 of 7 and scoring 27
goals during that span. The Devils had lost their previous two
games, both on the road, including a 3-1 loss at St. Louis on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams were simply awful for the most part, especially
the first two periods, and the crowd seemed more intent on
following the Yankees' World Series clincher on portable radios,
cheering at the Yanks' big moments.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues came out strong and took the first three shots in the
game, but did little after that.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils failed to capitalize on three manpower advantages,
including a two-man advantage for 1:37, but they opened the scoring
with 54.3 seconds left before the first intermission. The goal came
when McKay took a short pass from Petr Sykora and beat Turek to the
short side from the left circle. It was the second goal of the
season for McKay, who got his first last Friday night in the
overtime loss in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston scored what proved to be the winner, at 1:55 of the
second period, when he skated to the front from behind the goal to
the left of Turek and scored with a shot that beat Turek between
the legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he saw the shot,'' Rolston said. ``Sometimes we
get down on ourselves. Sure, there are a lot of things we can do
better. We wanted to go out there and get two points and that's
what we did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jason Arnott, the center for the first line, sidelined with
a broken dental bridge, coach Robbie Ftorek shuffled his line
combinations a great deal again. Sergei Nemchinov started as the
center for the first line, but he moved to another combination in
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Another unusual line combination for the Devils was Petr Sykora
moving to left wing with Bobby Holik the center and McKay the right
wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting better results because we're playing more
physical,'' Sykora said. ``When things don't go well we try to make
too many nice passes and it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek's line combinations will change again once Patrik Elias
and Brendan Morrison are declared fit to play after having signed
belatedly. They practiced with the team for the first time Tuesday
and there is a possibility they will return by Friday or Saturday,
when the Devils play at Carolina and then Philadelphia.

AMERICAN AIRLINES, UNION NEGOTIATE DEBT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The board of American Airlines' pilots union
is considering proposals that could erase the labor group's $45.5
million debt to the carrier in exchange for changes to the current
contract, sources familiar with the discussions said Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The union and American issued a joint release late Wednesday
night, saying the changes could include an extension to the
contract, which is not scheduled to come up for renegotiation until
August 2001. Also possible is a loosening of restrictions on
American's ability to partner with foreign airlines and its
American Eagle commuter affiliate, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The developments marked the most serious effort yet to begin
repairing the contentious relationship between the Fort Worth-based
carrier and the Allied Pilots Association, which represents
American's 10,000 pilots. That relationship exploded in February
when 2,500 American pilots engaged in what a judge later ruled was
an illegal, 11-day sickout that forced the cancellation of 6,700
flights. The dispute centered on American's plans to integrate
pilots from the newly acquired Reno Air into American's pilot
corps.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall assessed $45.5 million in
damages against the union and its top two officers this year after
the sickout. The damage award is to reimburse American for losses
it incurred when the union and its leadership did not respond
quickly enough to an order by Kendall to get pilots back to work.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's vaguely worded joint release _ issued after 9
p.m. CDT _ said the union's board, meeting this week in Fort Worth,
will consider several ``concepts and proposals'' jointly developed
by management and the union board.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are ``aimed at resolving a number of past and
current disputes and improving the working relationship between the
APA and American.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement offered no specifics. But sources familiar with
discussions between American and the pilots leadership said the
board will consider more than one proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The board will consider steps that it could take that could lead
to American forgiving part or all of the union's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that the union board considers will probably be
controversial within the board, which has a history of internal
division, and with its membership. The membership would also have
to ratify any changes to the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said American is probably seeking cost savings and
revenue-boosting opportunities through a contract extension that
would more than offset American's forgiveness of the damages.
</P>
<P>
   A contract extension would allow management to lock in labor
rates over a longer period. Typically, such extensions provide
modest savings to the airline over time, and allow it to do
longer-range financial planning that can reduce financing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, American currently is limited by its Allied Pilots
contract in its ability to partner with foreign airlines and
American Eagle. The APA has resisted efforts by American to align
with other carriers, because the union views such deals as threats
to its pilots' careers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, American last year had to reduce the number of
flights it offered to Canada because it mistakenly allowed its
Canadian Airlines partner to fly a greater percentage of their
jointly marketed transborder flights than was allowed under the APA
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Wednesday night that American will probably seek
more freedom to partner with other carriers. Airlines have
aggressively partnered with other carriers in recent years as a way
of expanding their networks.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the talks will lead to anything concrete is not clear.
The sides have been talking in recent weeks, officially and through
informal channels.
</P>
<P>
   American Chairman Donald Carty has said in recent weeks that he
is very reluctant to forgive the union's debt. Carty has made clear
that he won't do so unless he feels mutual trust has been restored.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, APA President Rich LaVoy and Vice President Brian
Mayhew and other union leaders met with Carty and other American
senior executives to discuss ways to repair the management-pilot
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, LaVoy said he made clear to Carty that the
relationship could not be repaired so long as the company insisted
on collecting the damage award.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Wednesday night that union officials became more
interested in cutting a deal in the past two weeks at least partly
out of concern about an upcoming hearing in Kendall's court.
</P>
<P>
   In early September, Kendall ordered the two sides to appear in
his court in November. The order came a few days after final
negotiations on integrating Reno Air's 300 pilots into American's
operations broke off and American proceeded with the integration
Aug. 31 without a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said one issue Kendall apparently wants to explore
in the hearing is whether additional members of the union board
should be held partially liable for the $45.5 million in damages.
Kendall has held only LaVoy and Mayhew liable, along with the
union.

BRAVES ARE BEATEN BUT UNBOWED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fans had mocked their war chant, and Queen was
warbling ``We Are the Champions'' when Atlanta's John Rocker turned
into the clubhouse as the Yankees celebrated their world
championship on the field at Yankee Stadium last night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Atlanta Braves did not exhibit the devastation that
normally accompanies a World Series loss, choosing instead to focus
on the season of remarkable adversity and triumph that had brought
them close enough for the Yankees to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came up short and it feels bad,'' said Rocker, the verbose
reliever. ``But I'm sure it doesn't feel nearly as bad as some of
the guys who watched us at home on television. I had a great time.
There's nothing like taunting people and then going out and beating
their team,'' he said referring to the Braves' victory over the New
York Mets in the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   And then Rocker laughed and this was clearly not going to be
your normal post-sweep post-mortem. Players looked more tired than
upset and there was plenty of banter among them.
</P>
<P>
   In a perverse way, the Braves' experience with losing World
Series _ this was their fourth loss in five tries in the 1990s _
helped them. Rather than dwell on the potential embarrassment of
being swept by the Yankees, they could comfort themselves with the
knowledge that they had won more games in the decade than any other
team, that few teams had gotten as close to a title once, as the
Braves had over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be good to lose so many World Series,'' pitcher
Greg Maddux said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, but that leads to the inevitable question of what
becomes of the Braves. After a season in which they lost several
key components _ Andres Galarraga, fighting cancer, made his way
through the clubhouse, talking to his teammates _ the Braves felt
vindicated and heroic for just making it back to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   When closer Kerry Lightenberg was hurt, Rocker emerged. With
Galarraga and Javy Lopez lost, Chipper Jones produced a most
valuable player-level season. But this is a team constructed to win
championships. They have had perhaps the best pitching rotation in
baseball and have been to the National League Championship Series
eight times, but they have won the World Series just once.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won three of the last four championships and
the unavoidable conclusion is that the Braves expend everything
they have to be the best team of the regular season, only to come
up short in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're asking guys all year to pick up the lead from the guys
we counted on,'' pitcher John Smoltz said. ``It can get difficult.
There is no solace or reward in knowing how much we scratched and
clawed to get here. The overwhelming feeling from everybody is we
better win or else. And that's the level we have established. We're
trying as hard as we can to win the World Series. When you lose
early it's `Oh well, we'll get `em next year.' When you lose late,
it's not get `em next year. It's a disappointment. This is a
disappointment but it's not the end of the world. The last three
days, with Payne Stewart's death and Paul O'Neill's dad should tell
you that. It's a baseball game. It's important, but it's still a
baseball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Bret Boone figured that the mood in the clubhouse
would have been much darker had the series been closer. But the
Braves knew how much trouble they were in long before Chad Curtis
caught the final fly ball to end the series and most of them, even
in their disaappointment, repeated endlessly their admiration _
even awe _ of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes after the end of their season, before he was even
fully dressed, Chipper Jones began to talk about spring training.
The Braves will likely return the bulk of their team and _ although
the Mets will surely work in the off-season to add the pieces to
challenge the Braves again _ the Braves will be the favorites until
proven otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've won one more championship than 25 or 26 other teams,''
Jones said. ``You can only look at this organization as a
tremendous success. It hasn't worked out in the post-season but
come spring training, and we'll still have the same goal. I don't
see a big overhaul within the organization. A lot of the core
people should be healthy. Everybody comes into spring training the
same way _ eager to start a championship season. And frankly, this
was a championship season for us. Nobody gave us a chance to be
here. We're down for the time being but we'll walk out proud.''

UNCOMMON KITTEN MAKES BRIEF, BUT LASTIN IMPRESSION

<P>
   PHOENIX - I've written dozens of obituaries in my career, but
until Wednesday none for a cat.
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin died Saturday. The cause was feline infectious
peritonitis, an unusual but deadly viral disease. He had orange
stripes and was 6 months old. Survivors include a brother,
Marmalade.
</P>
<P>
   Cats have never been a big hit with me. I'm a dog person, but
I'm married to someone who loves cats, so they've come into my life
unbidden.
</P>
<P>
   They've also come onto my desk, pushing off everything that's
not nailed down; jumped on the breakfast table, poking holes in my
newspaper; laid claim to my recliner, where one has peed several
times; and, of course, presumed our bed exists mainly for their
comfort and enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever lay down to nap and, as you were drifting off,
felt something brush lightly against your cheek, then opened your
eyes to see a cat's face one inch away, staring intently at you?
</P>
<P>
   Or needed to walk downstairs during the night and tripped over a
furtive cat lying at the top of the stairs, seeing you approach and
moving not a muscle, blocking your path with absolute indifference?
</P>
<P>
   It's been said that cats are smarter than dogs because you can't
get eight cats to pull a sled through snow, but that misses a
larger point. You can't get cats to do anything.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Debbie, adopted Pumpkin and Marmalade in June from a
young girl who was giving away a hard-to-resist litter in front of
the Wal-Mart in Payson.
</P>
<P>
   On the bell curve of cats, they were on the right extreme _
frisky, friendly, warm and well-mannered. They chased each other
through the house and, like pro wrestlers, pounced on each other in
mock aggression. They even liked to play with our dogs. When Debbie
worked at her desk at night, Pumpkin often sat in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, however, he seemed less energetic and
looked thinner. He was still eating but wasn't himself. When
Marmalade started to roughhouse, he barely bothered to defend
himself.
</P>
<P>
   We took him to see the vet and were given the grim diagnosis of
FIP, a disease that's rare outside of multicat households and is
nearly always fatal. Dr. Mark Weaver explained there was little he
could do. Pumpkin was current on his shots, but they didn't cover
this disease. Though a vaccine has been developed specifically for
FIP, Weaver seldom recommends it because the disease is so
uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   We took the kitten home, unsure whether it was better to hope
for an unlikely recovery or put him out of his distress. He was a
gritty stalwart, making no sounds, staying alert, resting quietly
by himself in a corner. He reminded me of an observation by James
Thurber about the way many dogs handle their final days:
</P>
<P>
   ``Death, to a dog, is the final unavoidable compulsion, the last
ineluctable scent on a fearsome trail, but they like to face it
alone, going out into the woods, among the leaves . . . enduring
without sentimental human distraction the Last Loneliness, which
they are wise enough to know cannot be shared by anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, he looked worse. His belly was distended, and
he seemed to wince when he walked. Though the Squaw Peak Animal
Hospital was only five minutes away, the drive seemed much longer.
He was just a kitten, he trusted us, and taking him to be put down
felt awful.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver placed him on a table and shaved the hair off a front leg
to find the vein more easily. Debbie held the kitten while the vet
injected a barbiturate called Beuthanasia into him. He didn't make
a sound or even quiver. After no more than 10 seconds, he was gone,
his amber eyes open but still.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, I went to the Arizona Humane Society in search of his
successor. Last year, the society took in 45,295 dogs and cats and
placed 16,623 of them, an adoption total that ranked No. 1 in the
nation, according to a national survey.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Johnsen helped me find a 2-month-old, cream-colored
kitten we named Cloudy. He's got the makings of a fine feline but
has big paws to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin was a prince of a kitten who gave cats a good name. I
think he somehow had a little dog in him. &QL;

AMERICAN AIRLINES, UNION NEGOTIATE DEBT

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The board of American Airlines' pilots union
is considering proposals that could erase the labor group's $45.5

UNDISPUTED KINGS OF CENTURY WIN IN PINSTRIPE STYLE (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A pinstriped curtain dropped on the World Series'
first 95 years Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium. Alone, at center
stage, stands the team of the 20th century: The mighty New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Take a knee and pay homage. It is highly unlikely we will ever
see another sports franchise dominate an era like the Yankees have
the one that ended Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were the century's undisputed kings even before the
95th World Series began, but their relentless four-game sweep of
the helpless Atlanta Braves, capped by Wednesday night's 4-1
triumph, validates their place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens may have finally crossed the invisible threshold
that separates ordinary players and ``Yankees.'' He earned his
pinstripes Wednesday night by giving his team the kind of big-game
performance they've been expecting from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Clemens said, ``I know what it feels like to be a
Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   Indestructible closer Mariano Rivera, named the Series MVP,
flicked the Braves away with a minimal effort in the ninth: three
up, three down.
</P>
<P>
   When Keith Lockhart's routine pop fly settled into Chad Curtis'
glove for the final out, the players rushed the mound and the
sellout crowd went crazy, but it was a subdued celebration compared
with '96, when the entire team did a tour around the warning track
and Wade Boggs leaped up behind a mounted policeman for an
impromptu ride.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was because this one came so easy. It was, incredibly,
the Yankees' 12th consecutive World Series victory and their 25th
World Series championship. No other franchise in the major leagues
has more than nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to win one and now we've won three,'' first
baseman Tino Martinez said. ``I'm still pinching myself. It must be
a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   In postseason play over the past two Octobers, the Yankees are
an amazing 22-3. ``22-3!'' Obviously not all of that came at the
Rangers' expense.
</P>
<P>
   To try to measure the Yankees by mere numbers, however, would be
an injustice, for this is a team of heart and soul, of muscle and
bone, of blood and tears.
</P>
<P>
   No one exemplifies that more than manager Joe Torre, who shared
hugs with his coaching staff, then moved among his players, half
laughing, half weeping.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's third World Series championship in four years may have
been the most satisfying because he wasn't sure, when doctors told
him he had prostate cancer in the spring, that he'd be around to
see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an emotional year,'' Torre had said before the
Yankees clinched Wednesday night. ``I can tell you, in March,
baseball, much less the World Series, was the furthest thing from
my mind at that point in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the word `cancer' and it scares you. You think of
death. I wanted to be around more for (his daughter) than to do
this. Now (baseball) is just as important as it ever was, except
that I think I smell and feel everything more so than I did in the
past. It's' just that I appreciate every single day.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre's story is just one of the many melodramas that have
surrounded the Yankees over the last few years. Since September
three players have lost their fathers, including Paul O'Neill's
dad, who died early yesterday after a long illness. O'Neill played
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with some heavy hearts,'' said Clemens, who carried
a shutout into the eighth. ``I don't know if I could have done what
Paul O'Neill did tonight, to go out there and play, or Luis Sojo,
whose father died last week.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees simply persevere. Their four-year run of
on-field success has been woven with tragedy and illness, from
pitcher David Cone's aneurysm in 1996, to Frank Torre's dramatic
heart transplant during that year's Series, to Darryl Strawberry's
colon cancer, to the deaths of Yankees legends Joe DiMaggio and
Catfish Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   If a soap opera script writer tried to sell us this story, we
wouldn't buy it. Too fantastic. Too unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's victory over the Braves, who had the
misfortune of playing the role of Washington Generals to the
Yankees' Globetrotters twice in the past four seasons, was typical
of the Yanks' run.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' defense wavered briefly in the third, when two
ground balls were misplayed into questionable hits. Martinez's
one-hopper that clanged off first baseman Ryan Klesko's glove
plated two runs and Jorge Posada's line single drove in another.
</P>
<P>
   When the Braves nicked Clemens for a run in the eighth, Torre
simply summoned Rivera to get the final four outs. Pinch hitter Jim
Leyritz bumped the Yanks' lead back to three with a solo homer in
the bottom of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations of this team were probably a little unfair after
we won 125 games last year,'' shortstop Derek Jeter said. ``We just
went out and took care of business and played every game like it
was the last one of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's was the last one of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows which sports franchise will produce the team of
destiny in the next century. As for this one, there is no question.
</P>
<P>
   All hail the Yankees, undisputed champions of the world. nn

PRIDE OF THE '90S: YANKEES SWEEP AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Team of the Decade battle is over. A convincing
knockout has been scored. Time now to place the New York Yankees of
the late 1990s among the greatest teams ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees earned that right with devastating effectiveness in
all areas of the game, completing a four-game sweep of the Atlanta
Braves with a 4-1 victory Wednesday night in Game 4 of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 56,752 at Yankee Stadium roared their approval from
the beginning as Roger Clemens, acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays
just for this purpose, overpowered the Braves for 7 2/3 innings and
World Series Most Valuable Player Mariano Rivera finished it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is everything everybody said it would be,'' said Clemens,
after his first World Series victory ever and first appearance
since 1986. ``I just feel blessed to be a part of this. It's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   The end came when Rivera got Keith Lockhart to hit a weak fly
ball to left. When the ball settled into left fielder Chad Curtis'
glove, catcher Jorge Posada jumped into Rivera's embrace on the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Scott Brosius was right behind them and the rest
of their teammates followed. Light bulbs popped throughout the
historic stadium as fans took pictures of a team that had just won
its third World Series title in the past four years and 25th in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about this team,'' shortstop Derek Jeter
said. ``This is just a team that knows how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won the last two World Series with four-game
sweeps, the San Diego Padres last year and now the Braves, a team
that won 103 games during the regular season. The only two other
teams to sweep two consecutive World Series were the 1927-28
Yankees of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, and the 1938-39 Yankees of Joe
DiMaggio and Bill Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won an American League-record 114 regular-season
games last year, but manager Joe Torre had higher praise for this
team, even though they won 16 less games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be anything like the first one in '96,''
Torre said. ``After what we accomplished last year, to come back
and win it again, it was a better team only because to do it again
to validate what we did last year. There's no question this club is
very, very special.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a strong suspicion throughout baseball that this would
happen when the Yankees acquired Clemens from the Blue Jays at the
start of spring training. Clemens himself said this was why he
wanted to play for the Yankees instead of the Rangers or Houston
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes and fears were realized and Clemens made it happen
by holding the Braves to just four singles through 7 2/3 innings.
The Yankees got him the runs he needed in the third on a two-run
single by Tino Martinez _ a hard ground ball that clanked off the
glove of first baseman Ryan Klesko _ and a run-scoring single by
Jorge Posada off losing pitcher John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the perfect way of ending the World Series,''
Torre said. ``The man came over here because he wanted a World
Series ring I couldn't see it not happening with the way his career
has gone. It just seemed like the perfect setup for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had a chance of finishing with a complete-game shutout
until Walt Weiss, with two outs in the eighth, stepped on his foot
while he was covering first base.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss was safe on the infield grounder and Clemens tried to stay
in the game. But when Gerald Williams lined a single to left,
manager Joe Torre went to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure was going to let him go out in the ninth and go one
batter at a time,'' Torre said. ``But then when he was stepped on
at first base, he seemed to get a little out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried Jeff Nelson first but Bret Boone bounced a single up
the middle to score Weiss. With runners at first and third. Torre
then went with Rivera and he doused the threat by getting Chipper
Jones on a grounder to second. After Jim Leyritz homered for the
Yankees in the bottom of the inning, Rivera pitched a scoreless
ninth and the Braves were finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very fun losing four straight and getting swept,''
said Braves manager Bobby Cox, whose team had to listen to mock
``Tomahawk Chop'' chants for much of the game. ``I thought we
played better than what it showed. We could have won two ... but
their pitching was excellent, they're so strong. That ballclub
deserves to be world champions. They're very good.'' nn

SPORTS COLUMN: BRAVES' GETTING THERE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How will history remember Bobby Cox and the Atlanta
Braves? For the last decade, the manager and his team have done
nearly everything an organization is supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   They lost again to the Yankees on Wednesday night, this time by
4-1, and they were swept from the World Series. Was this a tribute
to the Yankees' might or did the series expose Atlanta's flaws?
Will history remember how the Yankees thoroughly dominated the four
games or will it recall how Atlanta lost much of its offense and
still won more than 100 games in the regular season?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it depends on how we view winning. Do we recognize
greatness in the playoffs and series or consistency during the
regular season? ``We would have liked to make it a better series,''
Cox said on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the decade, while the Yankees were still
struggling, Atlanta came on strong. In 1991, after finishing last
the previous year, the Braves completed one of the most impressive
turnabouts in baseball history. They finished in first place in
their division and made it to the World Series, which they lost.
</P>
<P>
   The following year the Braves also reached the World Series.
They lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Atlanta again made it to the Series. This time the
Braves finally prevailed, winning the city's first professional
sports championship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Atlanta was back in baseball's showcase again, this time
falling to the resurgent Yankees. And, of course, this season the
Braves played their way into the Series _ their fifth of the 1990s
_ despite a succession of injuries that would have crushed a less
resilient team.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of World Series appearances in one decade. A lot of
losses, too.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves now swept out of the decade's last World Series,
the question is simple: can the Braves lay claim any more to being
a great team? Or are they just a good, consistent team that could
not prevail when the games counted most in late October?
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Games 3 and Game 4 were a metaphor for what the
Braves have accomplished and failed to accomplish. After being shut
down by Roger Clemens for seven innings, Atlanta battled back and
cut the lead to 3-1. Then the Yankees went to Jim Leyritz, who
homered in the bottom of the eighth inning to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   A series of more poignant moments took place a day earlier, when
the Yankees effectively ended Atlanta's hopes for the series in
Game 3. In the bottom of the first inning, Chuck Knoblauch led off
with a sharp line drive in the gap between right field and center
field. Brian Jordan, Atlanta's right fielder, made a great effort
to get to the ball and tried a back-handed stab. The ball popped
out of his glove for a tough error.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch wound up at second base and later scored. So which do
we reward: Jordan's effort or the outcome? The Atlanta Braves of
the 1990s are like the Minnesota Vikings of the 1970s and the
Buffalo Bills of the late 1980s and early '90s: teams that
dominated their divisions and consistently reached championship
games, but that were not so adept at winning them.
</P>
<P>
   In the silence of a devastated clubhouse late Tuesday night,
Jordan made an observation about the game that could define the
Atlanta decade. ``We felt like we had the game wrapped up,'' Jordan
said, describing the team's mood as the Yankees came to bat in the
bottom of the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Down by two games to the Yankees, watching a 5-1 lead slip to
5-3, the Braves thought they had the game wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   As they began to shut down, the Yankees geared up. Curtis hit a
home run in the fifth. Tino Martinez homered in the seventh. Then
Knoblauch completed the comeback with a two-run homer in the
eighth. Then Curtis homered again, just over Jordan's outstretched
glove.
</P>
<P>
   How will history remember Bobby Cox and the Atlanta Braves?
About 45 minutes after the game ended on Wednesday night, Chipper
Jones, the Braves' third baseman, spoke admiringly about the
Yankees. He said Wednesday night's loss was tough, but what had
convinced Atlanta that they were in over their heads was Tuesday's
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat on the bus after that game,'' he said. ``And I was
thinking to myself that this was the first time in my pro career
that the Atlanta Braves had done everything that they had to do and
still lost. We played decent. We hit. We got good pitching. And
they still beat us. That was kind of scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes good is good enough. Sometimes good enough doesn't
quite get it. In Atlanta's case, just getting there is about as
good as it gets.

   PHOENIX - I've written dozens of obituaries in my career, but
until Wednesday none for a cat.
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin died Saturday. The cause was feline infectious
peritonitis, an unusual but deadly viral disease. He had orange
stripes and was 6 months old. Survivors include a brother,
Marmalade.
</P>
<P>
   Cats have never been a big hit with me. I'm a dog person, but
I'm married to someone who loves cats, so they've come into my life
unbidden.
</P>
<P>
   They've also come onto my desk, pushing off everything that's
not nailed down; jumped on the breakfast table, poking holes in my
newspaper; laid claim to my recliner, where one has peed several
times; and, of course, presumed our bed exists mainly for their
comfort and enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever lay down to nap and, as you were drifting off,
felt something brush lightly against your cheek, then opened your
eyes to see a cat's face one inch away, staring intently at you?
</P>
<P>
   Or needed to walk downstairs during the night and tripped over a
furtive cat lying at the top of the stairs, seeing you approach and
moving not a muscle, blocking your path with absolute indifference?
</P>
<P>
   It's been said that cats are smarter than dogs because you can't
get eight cats to pull a sled through snow, but that misses a
larger point. You can't get cats to do anything.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Debbie, adopted Pumpkin and Marmalade in June from a
young girl who was giving away a hard-to-resist litter in front of
the Wal-Mart in Payson.
</P>
<P>
   On the bell curve of cats, they were on the right extreme _
frisky, friendly, warm and well-mannered. They chased each other
through the house and, like pro wrestlers, pounced on each other in
mock aggression. They even liked to play with our dogs. When Debbie
worked at her desk at night, Pumpkin often sat in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, however, he seemed less energetic and
looked thinner. He was still eating but wasn't himself. When
Marmalade started to roughhouse, he barely bothered to defend
himself.
</P>
<P>
   We took him to see the vet and were given the grim diagnosis of
FIP, a disease that's rare outside of multicat households and is
nearly always fatal. Dr. Mark Weaver explained there was little he
could do. Pumpkin was current on his shots, but they didn't cover
this disease. Though a vaccine has been developed specifically for
FIP, Weaver seldom recommends it because the disease is so
uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   We took the kitten home, unsure whether it was better to hope
for an unlikely recovery or put him out of his distress. He was a
gritty stalwart, making no sounds, staying alert, resting quietly
by himself in a corner. He reminded me of an observation by James
Thurber about the way many dogs handle their final days:
</P>
<P>
   ``Death, to a dog, is the final unavoidable compulsion, the last
ineluctable scent on a fearsome trail, but they like to face it
alone, going out into the woods, among the leaves . . . enduring
without sentimental human distraction the Last Loneliness, which
they are wise enough to know cannot be shared by anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, he looked worse. His belly was distended, and
he seemed to wince when he walked. Though the Squaw Peak Animal
Hospital was only five minutes away, the drive seemed much longer.
He was just a kitten, he trusted us, and taking him to be put down
felt awful.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver placed him on a table and shaved the hair off a front leg
to find the vein more easily. Debbie held the kitten while the vet
injected a barbiturate called Beuthanasia into him. He didn't make
a sound or even quiver. After no more than 10 seconds, he was gone,
his amber eyes open but still.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, I went to the Arizona Humane Society in search of his
successor. Last year, the society took in 45,295 dogs and cats and
placed 16,623 of them, an adoption total that ranked No. 1 in the
nation, according to a national survey.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Johnsen helped me find a 2-month-old, cream-colored
kitten we named Cloudy. He's got the makings of a fine feline but
has big paws to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin was a prince of a kitten who gave cats a good name. I
think he somehow had a little dog in him. &QL;

DALLAS BURN ROARS BACK, ADVANCES IN MLS PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For all the pregame talk that went into Wednesday
night's decisive Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals
between the Dallas Burn and the Chicago Fire, Burn coach Dave Dir
couldn't find the words to express his thoughts afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that was because so much went into his team's 3-2
comeback victory Wednesday night at the Cotton Bowl, sending the
defending Major League Soccer champion home and giving the Burn a
trip to the conference finals beginning Sunday against the Los
Angeles Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   After taking its worst loss of the season in Game 2 at Soldier
Field, a 4-0 drubbing from Chicago, the Burn appeared headed for
elimination when the Fire went up 2-0 in the first five minutes.
But the Burn rallied for three unanswered second-half goals,
including a 86th-minute game winner from forward Ariel Graziani, to
the delight of 9,795 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually almost out of words, which is unusual for me,''
Dir said. ``I've got two championships in the A-league, and they
weren't anything like this. I don't think there's ever a bigger win
to knock off the champion. It's incredible. I wish we had a little
bit more time to enjoy it, because we've got to get ready for Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burn faces the Galaxy at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at the Rose Bowl
in Game 1 of the best-of-three Western Conference finals, but at
least for Wednesday, some celebration was understandable.
Especially considering the Burn was without two mainstays on
defense _ defender Brandon Pollard, who suffered a broken leg after
a tackle in Game 2, and sweeper Richard Farrer _ and entered the
game with an 0-10 record this season when conceding the first goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn opened the game seemingly still shell shocked from Game
2, as Chicago forged a 2-0 lead in a span of five minutes, leaving
the Dallas defense _ which also included goalkeeper Mark Dodd, in
just his fourth start of the season _ stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Ante Razov struck first, collecting a one-touch pass
from defender Lubos Kubik near the 18-yard line and pulling off a
spin move before slamming the ball into the net. Two minutes later,
a free kick from Kubik found its mark onto the foot of Jesse
Marsch, who redirected the ball around Dodd.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-0 lead seemed to jolt the Burn into the reality of its
season on the line, and Dallas settled into a more consistent
passing rhythm. Ten minutes into the second half, midfielder Chad
Deering was on the mark for the Burn. Midfielder Oscar Pareja laid
out a rolling ball to Sergi Daniv, who chipped a cross a few yards
out of the goal for Deering to head into the net, cutting Chicago's
lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The equalizer came in the 84th minute, off a penalty kick from
Jorge Rodriguez, but not without some controversy. Chicago defender
C.J. Brown was whistled for a hand ball off a shot from Daniv to
set up the kick. The ball bounced off Brown's arm as he slid into
Daniv attempting to block the shot inside the 18-yard line, which
could have been considered an unintentional hand ball that would
not result in a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (the goalkeeper) was down so I dove out to try to
stop the ball,'' Brown said. ``My arms were close to my body, and I
thought (the referee) he wouldn't call a penalty. But he saw it
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty else to call as well, as the teams combined for
a league-record 10 yellow cards in a playoff game. Graziani was
involved in much of the early pushing and shoving, but he stayed
composed enough to break free during a late-game scramble in front
of the net to knock in the game-winner, which landed just over the
goal line after bouncing off the crossbar. nn

BIG 12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL READY TO ASSUME ELITE STATUS

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It is significant that a team with one of the league's
top returning stars and five other players with starting experience
from an NCAA Tournament team is picked to finish fourth this season
in the Big 12 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when that team is Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at our roster and you say we're going to be more
experienced and we're going to be better and let's see how it all
plays out,'' Longhorns women's basketball coach Jody Conradt said
Wednesday. ``Then you start looking at other teams and say, `They
didn't lose anyone and they've got all these great players back'
and it is frightening. I'm trying not to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending champion Texas Tech, meanwhile, is picked to
finish fifth. A reasonable conclusion is that this is a conference
that has come of age approaching its fourth season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growth has been dramatic,'' said Iowa State coach Bill
Fennelly, whose Elite Eight team from last spring is picked to win
the Big 12 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Five Big 12 teams won 1999 NCAA Tournament berths; four others
landed in the Women's National Invitation Tournament. Iowa State
and Tech went as far as the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Southeastern Conference had more teams _ eight _ in the
NCAA Tournament. Nationally, the Big 12 was a consensus No. 2 in
ratings power indexes behind the SEC. And, the Big 12 surpassed the
SEC in total and average attendance, ranking only behind the Big 10
in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of numbers add credence to conference coaches'
contention that the Big 12 is due national respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the country recognizes how good we are except the
SEC,'' Conradt said. ``They continue to be arrogant and think
they're the best. But don't print that because this is our year to
go to Knoxville'' to play Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Conradt was smiling, sort of, when she made that comment.
</P>
<P>
   But other conference coaches didn't leave her out on the verbal
limb when it came time to boast about the Big 12. And with 10 of
last season's top 12 scorers and seven members of the consensus
All-Big 12 first and second teams returning, they can afford to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to our league is that there are no weak sisters,''
said Nebraska coach Paul Sanderford, who took his 1992 Western
Kentucky team to the championship game and has 14 NCAA appearances
to his credit. ``Even in the SEC, there are certain places you go
and can expect to win. That's not true in the Big 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen, said Tech coach Marsha Sharp, who, like Conradt, has a
national championship in her resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Big 12 is the best conference from top to
bottom,'' Sharp said. ``There might be a couple of teams at the top
of the SEC who have been better in postseason play. But from the
strength of all our teams, the numbers that we had in postseason
and the kind of attendance that we're beginning to have at all the
arenas _ the Big 12 is the best. Our job is to prove that to the
rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   That means putting teams into the Final Four. Only Texas and
Tech have played during the NCAA Tournament's last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our next step as a league,'' Fennelly said. ``Someone
from our league has got to get into the Final Four and contend for
the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we obviously have some teams this year who have a
chance to do something in the tournament. Our hope is that our team
is one of them.'' nn

COLTS' MANNING LOOKS SUSPICIOUSLY FAMILIAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The old NFL quarterback was asked Wednesday about the young NFL
quarterback who has the same bloodlines and last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm not objective,'' Archie Manning answered
softly. ``He's my son. But I really like the way he plays. I like
the way he goes about his job. Football is very important to
Peyton. Being a success at football is very vital. He reminds me of
Troy.''
</P>
<P>
   That same echo was coming from Valley Ranch this week as the
Cowboys with ``old-timer'' Troy Aikman prepare to play the Colts
with the ``QB Kid,'' Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us were watching film on Peyton the other day,'' said
personnel director Larry Lacewell, ``and we were all talking about
him being a young Troy. The physical toughness, the mental
toughness, the quick release, the being drafted by a bad team,
playing as a rookie and taking that beating Peyton took last season
_ and now the progress being seen this season by Peyton and by the
team. It's a definite pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   And, according to Archie, maybe not a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back to high school, I never told Peyton to find a hero
or a role model,'' Dad said Wednesday from his home in New Orleans,
``but I did mention long ago if he wanted to pattern himself after
an NFL quarterback to take a look at Aikman. I love Troy's
disposition. He's very even-keel on the field. He's all business,
and he's prepared to handle whatever course a game takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting, huh? An Archie Manning finding a strong positive in
something so many around here term a negative for Aikman _ the lack
of rah, rah, rah.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, did Peyton really need Aikman as a quarterbacking
role model? Young Manning always had a good one at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the Archie influence when he was in college at
Tennessee,'' Lacewell said. ``Peyton learned from his daddy. You
see all these young quarterbacks struggling, but none of them had
at that kind of counseling at their own doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   Archie will forever be known in NFL lore as the
greatest-quarterback-who-ever-lived-who-never-won-nothing. Eleven
years with the New Orleans Saints, and never even had a winning
``season.''
</P>
<P>
   That was back in the '70s and early '80s. Yet bring up Archie's
name today in league circles, and the reverence among football
people remains immense.
</P>
<P>
   Manning was very gifted. Manning was very cursed. The luck of
the draw _ or the NFL draft _ placed him in New Orleans in 1971.
Football-wise, he was doomed to spend almost his entire career with
as woeful an organization as the league has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery sacks over heads were invented by fans of these
``Aints.'' This team was not a saintly bunch. The physical pounding
inflicted upon Archie over the years made him a poster boy for
toughness in pro football.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, however, was blessed by having a fine family. And one
of his sons, Peyton, became a much-heralded product of the
quarterbacking gene machine.
</P>
<P>
   But two Aprils ago, when Peyton found himself headed, via the
draft, for the NFL's never-never land _ Indianapolis _ Archie
admits there was an unpleasant flashback to his own career in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Peyton was in high school, I distanced myself from the
football part of it,'' Archie said. ``There is nothing worse than a
daddy interfering with a high school coaching staff. It was the
same during college recruiting. Peyton could have gone anywhere.
All I told him was `I'm here for you, but you make the call.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was at Tennessee, I may not have said 10 words to the
coaching staff the whole time he was there. He loved it there. My
wife and I loved him being there, but that was it. I stayed out of
the football part.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came NFL draft day in 1998. Peyton going to the Colts was,
well, a worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my concerned parent's cap on, and my Saints cap, too''
said Archie, laughing. `Yeah, I had the flashbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents and other NFL friends of Archie were advising him to
advise Peyton ``to do an Elway.'' John, of course, was originally
drafted by the same Colts, except they were in Baltimore at the
time. Elway refused to sign, and in a bitter power-play, forced a
trade to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Archie also had top marketing firms telling him it would cost
Peyton thousands of dollars, maybe millions, if he played for the
middle-of-nowhere Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peyton would hear none of it,'' Archie said.''He didn't want
to do an Elway. He just did not think it was right.''
</P>
<P>
   And Archie's opinion today? ``Peyton couldn't be in a better
place,'' he said. ``From the owner, to the GM, to the coaches _ not
only Jim Mora but the offensive staff _ this is a great situation
for him to develop as a quarterback for a team that has a chance to
grow into a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is all this father can ask. That his son's
football career follows a different course than his own. nn

LOS ANGELES TIMES STAFF PROTESTS MAGAZINE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senior editors at The Los Angeles Times met with the publisher
on Wednesday and expressed a sense ``of betrayal'' after the
disclosure that the newspaper shared profits from a special
magazine section with the subject of the section, the Staples
Center sports arena, according to a staff member at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon meeting came as about 300 editorial staff members
demanded an apology from the newspaper, contending in a petition
that the financial deal had compromised the newspaper's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, Kathryn M. Downing, apologized for the way she
handled the arrangement, this staff member said. Ms. Downing is
expected to meet with the newspaper's staff at a meeting on
Thursday afternoon, according to the staff member.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the newspaper acknowledged that it had earned
more than $2 million in advertising revenue from publishing a
164-page magazine devoted entirely to the new sports arena on Oct.
10. Such single-issue sections are not uncommon, but it is unusual
for a newspaper to share profits with an institution that it covers
on a continuing basis.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members circulated a petition Wednesday that sought ``a
thorough review of all other financial relationships that may
compromise The Times' editorial heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As journalists at the L.A. Times, we are appalled by the paper
entering into hidden financial partnerships on editorial products
with the subjects we're writing about,'' the petition stated,
according to a staff member in the newsroom who read from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The editorial credibility of The Times has been fundamentally
undermined by the revenue-sharing arrangement between Staples
Center and The Times Magazine issue on Staples Center,'' the
petition continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one swift blow, we've communicated to readers through
articles in New Times, The New York Times, and The Wall Street
Journal that we may have undisclosed financial ties with our
editorial subjects. A newspaper's reputation for integrity is hard
to earn and easy to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The petition was signed by staff members in every editorial
department of the newspaper, the staff member said. The
profit-sharing arrangement was disclosed by New Times, an
alternative newspaper in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the executive editor of the magazine, Drex
Heikes, said that he did not know of the arrangement until after
the issue had been published and that the editorial staff had
complete control over the content of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' editor, Michael Parks, said earlier this week that he
and the newspaper's senior vice president for advertising have
advised Ms. Downing against pursuing a similar magazine section
next year to coincide with the Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The new sporting arena, which cost $400 million, is home to the
Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers professional basketball
teams, and to the Los Angeles Kings professional hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   The Times is one of 10 ``founding partners'' of the center _
similar to a corporate sponsor _ but the Staples Center is
primarily owned by the Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz, the
real-estate executive Ed Roski Jr., and the News Corp.

RIVERA CLOSES OUT THE PERFECT ENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When another situation turned tense for the Yankees
on Wednesday night, Joe Torre did what he has done all season. The
manager summoned Mariano Rivera, he stayed calm in the dugout and
he waited for Rivera to throttle the Braves and help the Yankees
soar to another World Series title. Been there, done that.
</P>
<P>
   It was rather appropriate that Rivera had the ball in his skinny
fingers in what naturally became the most crucial situation of the
season. The Yankees would probably not have reached this night
without Rivera buzzing fastballs past hitters for the last six
months, so it was apt for him to protect one more lead in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera performed his job flawlessly again by retiring Chipper
Jones with the potential tying runs on in the eighth, dousing the
only dicey situation of the evening and helping the Yankees to a
4-1 victory, culminating their second consecutive four-game Series
sweep and their second straight championship.
</P>
<P>
   For the second October in a row, Rivera was mobbed near the
mound by his teammates after collecting the last out of a special
season. Rivera's arms were raised high, his eyes were closed and
his mouth was wide open in the picture of the 1998 celebration on
the news media guide. On Wednesday night, Rivera and his friends
posed for a new picture as the Yankees buried the closer one more
time at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in confidence, and when you feel confidence out
there you can beat anybody,'' Rivera said. ``That's what I was
doing. I feel confident enough to beat anybody. I just made my
pitches. Thank God, everything was good. I was like, `O.K., we got
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees got it because of Clemens at the beginning and
Rivera at the end. Rivera was the most valuable player of the World
Series after winning one game, saving two more and firing four and
two-thirds scoreless innings. Rivera did not allow an earned run in
121/3 innings during the post-season and went 2-0 with five saves.
After Rivera finished the regular season with 302/3 scoreless
innings, he continued to be nearly unhittable when it mattered
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best closer I've ever seen,'' Joe Girardi, the Yankee
catcher, said. ``Obviously, there are some closers who I haven't
caught, but he's the best closer of any that I've ever caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Derek Jeter thought about the right-handed Rivera, who
has not yielded a run in his last 252/3 innings and said, ``When Mo
goes out there, it's automatic.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clemens bagged the first two outs of the eighth, Walt
Weiss reached on an infield single to first and Gerald Williams
looped a single to left. Jeff Nelson replaced Clemens and allowed
Bret Boone's bouncing single over the mound to trim the Yankees'
lead to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and third, Torre bounded out of the dugout
as if he were trying to catch a bus. It was obvious he wanted
Rivera, who had not allowed an earned run since July. Rivera tossed
fastballs and cut fastballs to push the count to 1-2 against Jones.
On the next fastball, Jones lined a ball past first base that was
foul by a few inches. On a 2-2 count, Rivera induced Jones to slap
a ball to second base that Luis Sojo handled for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chipper is a dangerous guy,'' Rivera said. ``I wasn't trying
to give him nothing that he could pull to tie the game. I was just
trying to get something on the corner, and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was wearing a tan baseball cap and a soggy gray T-shirt,
which both had ``1999 Champions'' etched across them, as he stood
in a subdued clubhouse. He is the third reliever to be named mvp of
the World Series, after his former teammate John Wetteland (1996)
and Oakland's Rollie Fingers, who won the award in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivera could be considered the best post-season reliever
ever since he has a microscopic earned run average of 0.38, the
lowest in post-season history, after yielding just two earned runs
over 471/3 innings. Rivera has been almost perfect, which is what
he was on Wednesday night, when he zipped through four Braves and
enabled the Yankees to celebrate again.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Rivera permitted an earned run in the post-season
was Game 4 of the 1997 division series, in which Sandy Alomar
belted a homer off him that helped destroy a season. When he was
asked if he recalled the last time he had been nicked for a run in
October, he smiled and said, ``I don't think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rivera was told it was Alomar's memorable homer, he smiled
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alomar?'' he said. ``That was the last one? That's great. This
is incredible.''  &QL;

NEW YORK _ End of discussion.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call them the team of the decade, call them the team of the
century; heck, call them the team for all time.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, baseball's most storied franchise,
fittingly penned the sport's final chapter of the 1900s, clinching
their 25th World Series championship with a 4-1 victory over the
Atlanta Braves on Wednesday at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The final chapter was no more than a footnote, considering what
little effort it took the Yankees to dispose of the Braves. The
Yankees swept the Series in four games, extended their World Series
winning streak to 12 games and became the first repeat champions
since Toronto in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won their third World Series championship in the
last four years, and their Series winning streak equaled the record
set by the 1927-28-32 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you can get much better than that,'' Yankees
shortstop Derek Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves _ for all their regular-season dominance during the
1990s _ are not the team of the decade. This latest failing left
them 1-4 in the Fall Classic this decade, including a pair of
losses to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The team-of-the-decade debate might continue, although it seems
pointless. One thing is certain: For five days in October 1999,
there was no doubt which baseball team was the best. The Yankees
outhit, outpitched and outplayed the Braves in every facet of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked to have made it a better contest,'' Braves
manager Bobby Cox said. ``That's for sure. We just didn't play as
well as we should have. You have to tip your hat to the Yankees.
It's hard to do what they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's finale was the culmination of a Series that had it
all. Great pitching and exciting finishes defined the Series, which
made Game 4 an appropriate climax.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens, whom the Yankees acquired for moments such as
this, pitched 7 inspired innings, allowing one run on four hits.
</P>
<P>
   The victory may have represented a small step for the Yankees,
who have the celebration _ on average _ every four years. But it
was a giant step for Clemens, who had done just about everything in
his career except win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a perfect way to end it,'' Yankees manager
Joe Torre said. ``The man (Clemens) wanted a World Series ring. I
couldn't see it not happening tonight. It was a perfect setup.''
</P>
<P>
   The sight of the five-time Cy Young Award winner bouncing around
the mound and pumping his fist through the air underscored the
importance of team accomplishments in relation to individual
accolades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what everyone said it was all about,'' Clemens said.
``I finally know what it feels like to be a Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves staged a brief uprising in Game 3, but Clemens put
them back in their place Wednesday. Atlanta didn't advance a
baserunner past first until the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   That one run wasn't nearly enough to support a solid pitching
performance by John Smoltz, who allowed three runs in seven innings
with the critical hit coming on a ball that might have been
fielded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story coming into this Series was how good Atlanta's
pitching was, and rightfully so,'' Jeter said. ``But we've got some
guys on our staff who know how to shut the opposition down, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored two runs in the third on Tino Martinez's
sharp grounder that hit the glove of Braves first baseman Ryan
Klesko and glanced into shallow center field.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada's first hit of the Series, a single to right, gave
the Yankees a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz retired 12 of the last 13 batters he faced after Posada's
third-inning single, and Clemens had allowed the Braves just four
baserunners entering the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   He got two quick outs to open the inning, but the Braves got a
ray of hope when shortstop Walt Weiss reached on a controversial
infield single. Television replays clearly showed Weiss was out at
first base on a play on which Clemens was stepped on.
</P>
<P>
   Torre summoned reliever Jeff Nelson after Gerald Williams
singled off Clemens to give the Braves runners at first and second.
Bret Boone's RBI single off Nelson produced a run, and closer
Mariano Rivera _ the Series Most Valuable Player _ got Chipper
Jones to ground out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added a run in the bottom of the eighth on Jim
Leyritz's pinch homer off Terry Mulholland. It was the 18th
pinch-hit home run in World Series history.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ Success has followed Roger Clemens everywhere he's gone.
But always, it seemed as if Clemens was doing the chasing.
</P>
<P>
   Where there were Cy Young Awards, there also was the same old
deep sigh of frustration at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Where there were strikeout records and a Most Valuable Player
Award in 1986, there also was a deep hole torn from the middle of
his career, like the final pages ripped out of a book.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens knew how he would like the final chapters of his career
to read, but not all stories end happily. He just didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens chased a World Series championship. He chased and chased
until along the way he broke relationships that seemed unbreakable
and left places that seemed perfect for him. Boston. Toronto. He
even splintered ties with his hometown when the Astros came calling
in the offseason and everything crumbled over dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens finally caught up to his happy ending on a breezy,
cool Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium. And when Yankees 4, Braves
1 finished a sweep of Atlanta, it didn't just complete a story. It
completed Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what everybody said it would be,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   The box score said Clemens went 7 innings, struck out four and
gave up four hits, three of them ground-ball bleeders. But really,
Clemens went through a lot more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1986, when Clemens' Red Sox were within one strike
of winning the title but saw it slip between Bill Buckner's legs,
the chase haunted the Katy Rocket. He set record after record but
always heard about what he couldn't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe Roger is conducive to winning,'' longtime
nemesis and Toronto executive Dave Stewart once said. ``He's good
at accomplishing individual goals, but I don't think he's capable
of bringing someone a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   It always hurt Clemens to hear such things because he knew it
was something that would haunt him forever unless he proved
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Few players seem to have the sense of place and legacy that
Clemens always has had. As much as he sometimes shrugged and talked
of not necessarily having to win a title to be a complete pitcher,
he knew otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard people talking,'' he said. ``I knew it's in me to rise
to the occasion. This is one night when I had more pressure than I
could stand.''
</P>
<P>
   And he won. He won with a masterful performance but not in the
classic Clemens style. He got 17 groundouts. He wiggled out of
jams. He defended his position well and even had to shake off
getting stepped on on a hustling play in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was the perfect way to end the World
Series,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``We traded for him
because we felt he could help us do this. He didn't have the kind
of year we hoped he would have, but tonight I couldn't see it not
happening for him. It was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the individual accomplishments and trophies, Clemens
finally reached what he was chasing by simply being a role player,
just another Yankee, just the fourth starter on a dominant team.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, fellow pitcher David Cone marveled at how good a
teammate Clemens has proved to be for the Yankees. Until he put on
the pinstripes, most players in the Yankees' clubhouse figured
Clemens was too cocky, too full of himself.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all about the chase, about everyone knowing that no
matter how much he stuck out his chest, he was a little empty
inside and had to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they got their (1998) rings earlier this year, I was
watching (from the clubhouse),'' Clemens said. ``They all came in
and said, `We're getting you one this year.'''
</P>
<P>
   And they did. As a team, the Yankees picked apart the Braves by
picking one another up at every turn of the Series.
</P>
<P>
   No one thought it would take this long, but Clemens couldn't
care less when the champagne was dripping over his head and he was
swarmed on the field by two of his four sons.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night so unlike what we've seen before from Clemens. It
came in a season that was not one of Clemens' best.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night was Clemens' only chance to contribute to the
World Series for the Yankees. After struggling through a 14-10
year, he knew Cone or Orlando Hernandez would get the call if it
came down to a Game 6 or 7.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens posted the highest ERA (4.60) of his career and went
through long spells of inactivity in the rotation after suffering a
hamstring injury and back problems.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares? The chase is over. Clemens is a complete player.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Clemens was traded to the Yankees on the first
day of spring training, and on the last day of the World Series he
became a Yankee. He and his teammates heard all year how the team
wasn't as good as the record-setting Yankees of 1998, but when it
came to achieving any team's ultimate goal _ winning the World
Series _ the Yankees, and Clemens, were every bit as good.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens shut out the Atlanta Braves into the eighth inning on
Wednesday night and the Yankees went on to win, 4-1, at Yankee
Stadium, clinching a four-game sweep, the Yankees' 25th
championship of the century and their third title in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' victory was their 12th consecutive in the World
Series, tying a record. Mariano Rivera was named the most valuable
player after three scoreless appearances in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera threw the last pitch of the Series in the top of the
ninth inning, and when Keith Lockhart popped a fly ball to left
field, the Yankees lurched out of their dugout, waiting for the
ball to come down. Catcher Jorge Posada began running toward the
mound, where Rivera stood and stared, emotionless, watching left
fielder Chad Curtis settle under the ball and make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   And then they went crazy. Rivera raised his arms, turned and
embraced Posada, and third baseman Scott Brosius joined them. They
all gathered in a circle behind the mound, while security officials
and mounted police officers began rushing onto the field. Clemens,
jacketed, ran onto the field, arms raised. Paul O'Neill, who only
hours earlier had learned in an early-morning phone call that his
father, Charles O'Neill, had died, was the last of the position
players to join the happy scrum, pausing at second base to step on
the bag superstitiously.
</P>
<P>
   They began trading hugs, Manager Joe Torre joining, and it was
in those moments, some of them said later, that the gravity of all
they endured this year began to hit them. Brosius' father had died,
and so had the father of the infielder Luis Sojo, and Torre was
found to have prostate cancer. They had worn the No. 5 in a black
sphere on one shoulder, after Joe DiMaggio died in March, and late
in the season, a black armband was added following the death of the
Hall of Fame pitcher Catfish Hunter. ``We're all family here,''
Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   As O'Neill traded embraces, he burst into tears, and with his
head down, he rushed off the field, seeking seclusion. His
teammates gathered in the Yankees' clubhouse to spray champagne _
Derek Jeter doused the principal owner, George Steinbrenner _ and
share their joy.
</P>
<P>
   With his Yankee-blue undershirt soaking wet, Clemens pushed
through the crowd of reporters and teammates with a bottle of
champagne in each hand, a son under each arm, grinning broadly. No
one can ever say again that he has never won a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Steinbrenner told him to stay within himself,
to be calm. Clemens finished warming up in the bullpen, stepped
among the monuments beyond the outfield fence and pressed his right
palm against the bronze image of Babe Ruth, then walked across the
Yankee Stadium field, fans roaring when they saw him. It was a
blustery fall night, the evening moon was red-orange; this is
Clemens's favorite time of year, and this was the day he had been
waiting for, Torre said before the game, ``for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before he scaled the mound to start the game, Brosius
handed him the baseball. ``It couldn't have worked out any
better,'' Brosius told him. ``You on the mound, in this situation.
You just do what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Jeter jogged in, with his perpetual half-grin, and added:
``This is what you've worked for, this is what you've been wanting
for so long. Now go out there and get it done,'' and with that, he
slapped Clemens on the backside with his glove. Clemens blew on his
clenched right fist to warm his hand, stood on the mound and stared
in for the sign, peering underneath his cap and over his black
glove.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had been conquered by his own adrenaline repeatedly this
year, mostly in the early innings, when he would struggle to throw
strikes, and the Braves' leadoff batter, Gerald Williams, fought
Clemens to a full count before he fired a low fastball below
Williams's wild swing. Bret Boone grounded out to shortstop, and so
did Chipper Jones. Three up, three down.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz, the Atlanta pitcher, also had great stuff, but the
Yankees, as they do better than anybody else, gnawed at him, taking
pitches, spraying foul balls _ 18 in the first three innings _ and
driving his pitch count quickly. Smoltz threw 75 pitches in the
first three innings, and reached three-ball counts on 10 of the
first 18 hitters.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had first and second and nobody out in the second
inning and could not score, as Posada, Ricky Ledee and Brosius all
took fastballs over the outside corner. But Chuck Knoblauch reached
first on an infield single to lead off the third, and Jeter spanked
a broken-bat single to right, Knoblauch sprinting to third and
pulling into the base standing. The Yankee Stadium crowd boomed
aloud, and in the Braves' dugout, Manager Bobby Cox could be seen
shaking his head slightly; there was no score, but it felt as if
the conclusion was foregone.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill struck out, with Jeter stealing second, and the Braves
intentionally walked Bernie Williams. Bases loaded, one out. Tino
Martinez then turned on a fastball, pulling it toward first base,
the ball hit hard. Ryan Klesko, the Atlanta first baseman, waved
his glove at the ball, which bounded off his wrist and rolled into
short right field. Knoblauch scored and Jeter followed, taking the
last steps toward home plate with his right fist raised. Two
batters later, Posada stroked a single to right, and Williams
rambled homeward safely. The Yankees' lead was three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had found a groove by then, throwing comfortably,
freely. Because he was keeping his fastball and split-fingered
fastball low, he was getting an unusual number of groundballs.
Fifteen of the first 21 outs were on grounders, four others were on
strikeouts, and with each subsequent out, the fans at Yankee
Stadium began smelling the championship. Their cheers were louder,
and Clemens's energy increased.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart led off the fifth inning with a single and Clemens fell
behind Eddie Perez, three balls and no strikes; this was the one
moment all night when the Braves appeared to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez eventually chopped a grounder to Brosius, who threw to
the second baseman, Knoblauch, who in turn avoided Lockhart's slide
and threw perfectly to first. Clemens screamed aloud _ ``Yeah,
Bro!'' _ and stalked around the mound, jabbing a finger first in
the direction of Brosius, and then in Knoblauch's. Jeter made a
nifty play on a grounder in the sixth and Clemens thrust a fist in
the air. Two batters later, Brosius ranged far to his right to
glove a ball and throw off-balance, on one hop, to nip Brian
Jordan. Clemens pumped both arms upward, waited for Brosius to run
by and hammered him on the back jubilantly.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens fell while covering first base with two outs in the
eighth inning, came up limping, and with runners at first and third
and two out, Torre emerged from the dugout to relieve him. The
cheers for Clemens began, and they peaked as Torre took the ball
from him and sent him to the dugout with a pat on his back.
Flashbulbs popped, everybody in Yankee Stadium was standing and
roaring and Clemens was moved to take off his cap, wave both hands.
``Roger! Roger!'' they chanted.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' bullpen took over, one run scoring before Rivera
closed out the game, that fly ball falling into Curtis's glove and
Curtis running in, clutching his glove and the ball with both
hands. All year, Clemens heard that he was not as good as David
Wells, the Yankees heard they weren't as good as they were last
year, but there they were, embracing and sharing tears, the
champions of baseball again.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton, a longtime friend of Clemens, found the pitcher
amid the happy humanity. ``Hey, you finally got a ring,'' Stanton
said. ``About time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clemens grinned, having pushed the Yankees over the finish
line that had seemed so distant all summer.  &QL;

WILL COLD NORTH WIND BLOW HOLE IN SOONERS?
</HEADLINE>
 12 FOOTBALL REPORT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dismiss it as wishful thinking from those with less imagination.
Proclaim it as inspired insight from folks who understand football.
</P>
<P>
   Handle it any way you'd like, because no one knows which side is
right. It's much too early for iron-clad conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But be aware that rival Big 12 football coaches envision a day
when Oklahoma offensive coordinator Mike Leach will share a common
bond with actor Clark Gable. Both, it seems, will be the lead
character in separate productions of ``Gone With the Wind''.
</P>
<P>
   Gable, of course, received an Oscar for his role in an epic
movie by that name. Leach, on the other hand, will watch his
prolific passing game disappear once the temperatures drop and the
wind comes sweeping down the plain in Big 12 outposts from Texas to
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Naysayers predict it could happen as soon as Saturday, when the
24th-ranked Sooners (4-2, 2-1) play at Colorado (4-3, 3-1). Sloppy
weather, say the skeptics, always strikes at some point when
playing in the Big 12's northern venues. And the Sooners travel as
far north as the league allows on Nov. 13, when Oklahoma plays at
Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas coach Terry Allen, who spent eight seasons at Northern
Iowa (1989-96) before taking over the Jayhawks' program in 1997,
knows a little bit about the perils of passing the football in
howling winds and freezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather can have a devastating effect, no question about
that,'' Allen said. ``We face it more up here in the north, but
it's always a concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska, of course, built its empire around a ground game that
could function in all kinds of weather. Colorado coach Gary Barnett
plans to emulate that model with the Buffaloes, whose rushing
attack has improved by 28.4 yards per game since the departure of
Rick Neuheisel, Barnett's pass-happy predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, on the other hand, has improved from No. 107 to No. 3
among Division I-A passing teams in its first season under coach
Bob Stoops. Leach is Stoops' right-hand man, the coordinator of a
controlled passing game that is built to maintain ball control with
short, surgical strikes to a wide collection of receivers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no questioning the Sooners' prolific success in their
new offense. Quarterback Josh Heupel completes 66.1 percent of his
passes and averages 340.2 yards per game. He has connected for
touchdowns with 13 receivers. The Sooners have topped 500 yards in
four games, including 552 in last week's 51-6 rout of No. 22 Texas
A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope for future opponents, A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``High wind conditions would affect their offense, without a
doubt,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and the end of the regular season, the Sooners will
not play a contest farther south than Lubbock, home of perpetual 30
mph winds and _ as of Oct. 17 _ a generous dusting of snow. And
it's not even Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Stoops shrugs off suggestions that his high-flying attack could
be grounded in adverse weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has anything to do with anything,'' Stoops
said. ``You can throw the ball in all kinds of weather.''
</P>
<P>
   But effectively enough to win?
</P>
<P>
   Stoops points to the success of the wide-open passing game at
Florida, where he served as the Gators' defensive coordinator from
1996-98, as evidence. But the Gators play mostly in front of
shirt-sleeved crowds in the Southeastern Conference, even in
November. Chances are good that Oklahoma will soon lose that
luxury. But does that mean they will start losing games?
</P>
<P>
   Barnett cited another variable, one more damaging to a prolific
passing attack than an Iowa ice storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more vulnerable to great defenses,'' Barnett
said. ``You look at Purdue in the Big Ten, and they're able to
throw in bad weather. But when they play against Penn State, Ohio
State and Michigan, their yardage isn't the same as it is against
everyone else in the league. When you play against a great defense,
they're able to handle that stuff. That's it more than the
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, three of Oklahoma's remaining opponents rank
among the nation's top 20 teams in total defense: Oklahoma State
(13th), Texas Tech (19th) and Iowa State (20th). Then again, A&AMP;M
ranks 16th and the Sooners just scorched the Aggies for 552 yards
and 51 points.

   Color me neutral on the great weather debate. But expect the

\Nsubheds:SPOTLIGHT ON
BAYLOR'S STEELE INTENDS TO REBUILD K-STATE WAY
</P>
<P>
   Imitation, they say, is the sincerest form of flattery. So,
consider yourself flattered, Kansas State coach Bill Snyder. Kevin
Steele wants his Baylor football program to look a lot like yours
when he's finished putting all the pieces in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't follow that template to exact specifications, but
there are things we'll follow. It's a good template,'' said Steele,
who keeps three coaching handbooks near his desk for quick
reference. One was written by former Nebraska coach Tom Osborne,
another by legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden.
</P>
<P>
   The third author? Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   Steele will square off against Snyder's team for the first time
in his brief coaching career Saturday in Manhattan, Kan. He said he
draws encouragement from the fact that Snyder, in 1989, ``took over
the worst progam in NCAA history and now he's got the only
undefeated team in the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   If it can be done at Kansas State, said Steele, a similar
turnaround can take place at Baylor. In fact, the first building
block already may have been laid. During Snyder's initial season,
his 1989 team finished 1-10. Its lone victory came against North
Texas. Steele's team, at this juncture, is 1-6. Its lone victory
came against North Texas.
QUICK HITS
MR. VERSATILITY
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries in the Texas Tech backfield, Sammy Morris
has become a human Scrabble blank in the Red Raiders' game plan.
Morris, the regular fullback, may see significant time at tailback
in Saturday's game at Missouri if starter Shaud Williams is slowed
by a bruised shoulder suffered in last week's 35-7 victory against
Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he may not. Tech coach Spike Dykes said he has a
``sophisticated system'' he uses to determine when and where to
deploy Morris, who has rushed for a team-high 88.5 yards per game
against Big 12 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just shoot from the hip,'' Dykes said. ``We've got to be
careful not to ask Sammy to do so many things he can't do them all
well. It's tempting because Sammy has so many different
abilities.'' TOP 10 FEVER
</P>
<P>
   By climbing to No. 12 in The Associated Press rankings, Texas
has reached its loftiest status in the polls under second-year
coach Mack Brown. So Brown has given the Longhorns (6-2, 3-1) a new
goal heading into Saturday's game at Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them what they need to do is start working on getting
to 10th in the country,'' said Brown, whose team is coming off a
24-20 victory over Nebraska. ``We've been a great team bouncing
back after losses, but we haven't always played well after big
wins. And we need to play well Saturday to have a chance. That's
why I gave them the extra challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   From his perspective, Iowa State coach Dan McCarney said the
Longhorns ``already look like a Top 10 team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As good as they were last year, Texas is a better team this
year,'' said McCarney, who watched his Cyclones fall, 54-33, last
season in Austin. ``Their defensive line is much improved and they
have more versatility on offense.'' LOVING LIFE WITH LINDSAY
</P>
<P>
   Despite some rustiness in the passing department, Oklahoma State
coach Bob Simmons said his offense should be ``much better'' with
the return of quarterback Tony Lindsay. The third-year starter
played for the first time in six weeks during last week's 44-21
loss to No. 6 Kansas State, rushing for 33 yards and passing for
130 in his first activity since Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (3-3, 1-2) plays Saturday at No. 22 Texas A&AMP;M
(5-2, 2-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony underthrew a couple of passes, but from the mental
standpoint, he was very sharp and gave us a big lift emotionally,''
Simmons said. ``He brings the experience factor to the table that
we need to do more things on offense.''
BURCH's PICKS Staff writer Jimmy Burch picks (against the line)
this week's Big 12 football games:
</P>
<P>
   Texas at Iowa State (plus 10 1/2). Pick: Texas. Longhorns avoid
emotional hangover, put brakes on Cyclones' ground game.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (plus 11) at Texas A&AMP;M. Pick: Oklahoma State.
Aggies win, but it is a hard-earned win.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech at Missouri (plus 1). Pick: Tech. Red Raiders are
rolling, Tigers are reeling. A road win beckons.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (plus 37 1/2) at Kansas State. Pick: Baylor. Wildcats
clear final hurdle before Colorado-Nebraska stretch in ho-hum
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma at Colorado (plus 4). Pick: Oklahoma. Sooners' aerial
circus mystifies the inconsistent Buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska (plus 31 1/2) at Kansas. Pick: Nebraska. Huskers soothe
their aching egos by routing outmanned Jayhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's record: 3-3. Season record: 38-22-1.

SHOWBIZ EXEC DALY TO RUN DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Robert Daly, who spent 20 years building Warner
Bros. into one of the most powerful entertainment companies in the
world before resigning in July, will assume the day-to-day
operations of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, a lifelong Dodgers fan and close friend of former owner
Walter O'Malley and former manager Tom Lasorda, is purchasing a
minority share of the Dodgers from Rupert Murdoch's Fox Group,
several sources said. Though the deal is yet to be finalized, it is
imminent and an announcement will be made today at 10 a.m. at the
Staples Center. Daly will be vice chairman and CEO of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, sources said Bob Graziano, fired as the Dodgers' CEO and
president Sept. 28, will remain with the Dodgers, likely as the
club's president. Graziano agreed to stay with the Dodgers after
his firing to help with the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Daly) will have a small piece of the team, but control the
whole thing,'' a source said. ``He will be the new owner in that
he'll run everything. He's calling the shots. He's running the
team. He'll be there five, six, seven days a week at (Dodger)
Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Welts, president of Fox Sports Enterprises and the man who
fired Graziano, said he wouldn't talk about what's going on with
the Dodgers until today's press conference. However, sources said
Welts wouldn't have a problem with Graziano remaining with the
club.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Daly will purchase 10 percent of the Dodgers. The
value of his share is approximately $30 million. Daly's estimated
worth is $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The move is being made, in large part, because Fox's higher-ups
reached the conclusion that it's too difficult for a large
corporation to run a ballclub on a day-to-day basis, especially by
committee, sources said. With Daly joining the front office, that
changes. Every decision with the Dodgers will stop with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with what's gone on, one singular, strong owner works
the best,'' a source said. ``You can look at Disney as an example.
They've had some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a new philosophy. Jerry Colangelo, a minority owner
of the Arizona Diamondbacks, is responsible for the every-day
dealings of the Diamondbacks. However, Daly will be more involved
than Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   No longer will Fox Group chairman and CEO Peter Chernin or Fox
Entertainment Group co-COO Chase Carey, who made the Mike Piazza
deal, have a say in the every-day decisions. Welts, who oversees
Fox's sports endeavors, also won't be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Daly built Warner Bros. into a multi-billion-dollar company
during his 20-year run that ended with his being co-chairman with
Terry Semel. He was also the chief programmer for CBS television.
</P>
<P>
   But can he run a ballclub?
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the entertainment industry, baseball is
entertainment, but I'm not sure what (Daly) knows about running a
baseball team,'' a baseball official said. ``One thing that will be
better for (the Dodgers) is having someone at Dodger Stadium day-in
and day-out instead of across the country. I just don't know what
he knows about running a baseball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernin and Welts will be at today's press conference. Carey is
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions between Daly and the Fox Group began recently. Daly,
who lives in Los Angeles, knows Chernin from their dealings in the
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Group purchased the Dodgers in March 1998 from the
O'Malley family for $311 million, and there's been speculation
Murdoch would sell some of the club because of the financial
burden.
</P>
<P>
   Running the Dodgers as a spoke on Fox's entertainment wheel
hasn't worked. Even with Chernin and Carey stationed in New York
and Murdoch traveling the world, Graziano, as president and CEO,
always had the specter of Chernin and Carey hovering 3000 miles
away. That won't happen with Daly.
</P>
<P>
   In Fox's two seasons of ownership, the Dodgers failed to make
the playoffs. In 1998, the Dodgers went 83-79 and finished third,
15 games behind San Diego. The Dodgers fired general manager Fred
Claire and manager Bill Russell and traded Piazza during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   In September '98, the Dodgers hired Kevin Malone as general
manager. He hired manager Davey Johnson, and during the offseason
the club spent more than $160 million on free agents and contract
extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the $105 million free-agent signing of Kevin
Brown and an $80 million payroll, the Dodgers went 77-85 and were
never in playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   If Graziano stays with the Dodgers it would be as the club's
president, but his job description would change. He would be second
in command to Daly in running the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   It would also bring an end to a search for the club's president.
John Thomas, who accepted the position of president of the
Sacramento Kings, Sacramento Monarchs (WNBA) and Sacramento Knights
(Arena Football) in July, was considered the front-runner. But
Thomas recently told Welts he would be staying in Sacramento.

EDITORIAL: THE YANKEES WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 28:
</P>
<P>
   Maturity in sports has many looks, but right now it looks like
the New York Yankees, who won their 25th World Series last night
against the Atlanta Braves. Clearly, the Yankees were able to
dominate the Braves, whom they swept, but just as clearly they were
able to dominate themselves and their own fortunes. Patience is a
word that has been much used around the Yankees dugout this season,
and what it means is a privileged manner of looking at baseball.
What this team seems to see is not a game where one event cascades
into another as the innings slip by, the past steadily
commandeering the present. To this team baseball looks like a game
of constant renewal, with each pitch, each batter, each defensive
out.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is, if anything, too rich in the grand themes,
especially during a World Series. You expect television to turn
grandeur into grandiosity, and it does. But a kind of triumphalism
thrives at Yankee Stadium too, where the World Series pre-game
soundtrack included the theme from ``Star Wars'' and the ``1812
Overture.'' But that mood is meant for the fans, not the players.
There is a difference between destiny and opportunity, and the 1999
Yankees know it. They will take opportunity every time, and in this
Series, take it they have.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy, in the high-wattage glare of a Series game, to lose
sight of the fact that baseball, even at Yankee Stadium, can still
have a pleasantly small-town feel to it. Kofi Annan, mayor of the
world if not the city, throws out the first pitch in New York,
which bounces halfway to the plate. Marching bands from South
Jersey assemble on the warning track _ the outfield grass remaining
inviolate _ and play ``Gimme Some Lovin''' and ``Louie, Louie.''
The notes of all the instruments, except the bass drums, gust away
into the evening, just as they would at a local homecoming game.
Hand-lettered signs rise in the stands _ ``Dripping Springs, Texas,
Loves the Yankees'' _ and the stadium sparkles with camera flashes
going off, snapshots of a vortex where a batter steps up to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The fans roar with emphatic, if imprecise, knowledge. They call
balls and strikes from a mile away. The air is barbed with advice,
with schoolyard taunts, and then with the exultation of the moment.
The emotion so latent in the players, so overt in the fans, gives
way at the final out, and at last, in the rejoicing, there is no
distinction between players and fans. We are all fans now. &QL;

`OLD' HULL FEELING REJUVENATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ ``I feel 100,'' Brett Hull moaned, his slow and
deliberate gait lending credibility to his age assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Hull had been passing through an empty Dallas Stars locker room
a couple of days ago when he determined his aching knee, nagging
groin and bruised body necessitated a comment.
</P>
<P>
   That said, he continued walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we are playing, the style this team plays, it's
extremely more fatiguing,'' Hull said later. ``Every game feels
like the seventh game of a playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   The player who brags that he didn't get hit his first 10 years
in the league is now hitting and getting hit on every shift. The
player who once was known only for his goal scoring is second on
the team with six assists and only half as many goals. The player
who Mike Keenan dubbed a locker room problem in St. Louis was
whistled for his first fighting major in his career this season
when he came to Mike Modano's defense against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The player who the Stars thought they were getting when they
signed Hull in July of 1998 isn't the player they got. He's better.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at his play during the Stars' recent spate of injuries
that has played like an episode of ER.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's a different player right now,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``He's a player that for me has been asked and has
done a great job at playing not only within the system but very
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull has been the Stars' best player this season, along with
goalie Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   The best for Hull used to entail scoring goals. He had five
50-plus goal seasons, including three of 70 or better. Best for
Hull as a Star entails being a gritty, two-way grinder. He had 40
goals last season, one of which won the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   His only career record being threatened since arriving in Dallas
is ice bags used in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said he couldn't have imagined himself playing this way 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always fighting the establishment on playing the game
the way I thought it should be played,'' Hull said. ``I can't play
the way I used to, just get loose out there and float in and out.
It's impossible to do. Sometimes, I kind of revert back a couple of
times. `Hitch' is the first guy to grab me and say `No, no, no' and
goes in about the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the system. The one Hull wasn't supposed to ever be able to
fit in; the one Hitchcock said Hull has totally bought into; the
one that brought both the player and the organization their first
Stanley Cups in June.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Hull's transition has been all rah-rah,
happy-happy.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was benched this season in a preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got an assist and a game-tying goal, and I was plus-2,''
Hull explained. ``I asked (Hitchcock) the next day. I said `I can't
figure it out. I got benched. I got two points. I'm plus 2.' And he
goes, `the game isn't about stats anymore. It's the little things
you do away from the stats that really make you a player now.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that within my brain is hard to grasp.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Modano said he has seen Hull's progression happen rather
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either that or he wouldn't be playing,'' Modano said
jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   He'd be playing all right , just not for a defending Stanley Cup
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Winning just hurts a little more than scoring. By the time he
scored the Cup-clinching goal, he had a torn groin and a torn
medial collateral ligament in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Want to guess how Hull spent his summer?
</P>
<P>
   If you said healing, you'd be right. He wasn't able to start
skating until mid-August. So his conditioning has come in games
when injuries to other players have forced him to play more and
harder minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose this, halfway through the season, at least I find,
those players really suffer,'' Hitchcock said. ``So he's having to
do conditioning shifts, plus play 20 minutes, plus play a physical
game. And our biggest fear is that we're going to absolutely wear
this guy out, and we can't afford to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The old Hull would've never let them. The new Hull doesn't mind.
Maybe, it comes with being 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, not that bad today,'' Hull said Wednesday as he walked
through the locker room with the usual ice bags and bandages in
tow. ``I feel, at least, 80. Maybe, younger.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Injured forward Joe Nieuwendyk (back) and injured defensemen
Richard Matvichuk (knee) and Darryl Sydor (groin) skated Wednesday.
They will practice in full pads with the coaches Thursday and with
the team Friday. Ken Hitchcock said they will be evaluated to
determine their status for Saturday's game against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Stars will participate in the NHL skills competition at 7
p.m. Thursday at Reunion Arena. Plenty of $10 tickets remain. Call
(214) GO-STARS. nn

YANKEES CLOSE OUT BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There can be only one way to draw a timeline for this
Baseball Century.
</P>
<P>
   With a pinstripe.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees were a colossus when your grandparents were
in the cradle and the Babe was the original Bomber. They were
compared to US Steel when your parents were dancing to Sinatra, and
DiMaggio defined style. They reigned when The Mick was the man, and
rose up again when Reggie Jax ruled.
</P>
<P>
   And now, it is your children's turn to marvel at the
magnificence of a team that Wednesday night in Yankee Stadium swept
aside the Atlanta Braves in four straight games with an efficiency
and elan every bit as dazzling as the days when Yankee teams were
known as dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is time, at the fin de siecle to elevate the Yankees
of Joe Torre, Boss Steinbrenner, and yes _ the newest Yankee hero,
Rocket Roger Clemens _ to that status, after they erased the
Braves, 4-1, to complete their second consecutive four-game sweep
of the National League's champions and win the Series for the third
time in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is one of the greatest because they overcame so
much,'' said Steinbrenner, reflecting on a season that began with
Torre diagnosed with prostate cancer and designated hitter Darryl
Strawberry busted in a tawdry drug incident in Tampa, and ended
with three Yankee players losing their fathers in the span of just
over a month (outfielder Paul O'Neill's father died early
Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe, to go through what he went through, Straw, to go through
what he went through, and three of our young men lost their
fathers,'' Steinbrenner said. ``It's a mentally tough team.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Yankees won more games (125) than any team in
history. ``This may be a better team,'' a red-eyed Torre said,
``because of the fact we had to do it again to validate what we did
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, a lion in winter mauled by the team to which he once
pledged sole allegiance, the Red Sox, in the American League
Championship Series, summoned echoes of past greatness
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. He allowed four hits in 7 2/3 innings, in which
all 23 outs came either on strikeouts (4) or infield outs (19).
</P>
<P>
   The House that Ruth Built, in the last game of the millennium,
at last was transformed into a place that Clemens, after a
torturous season, could call home. The place where he could leave
the mound, after taking a bad stumble while covering first base on
Walt Weiss's two-out infield hit in the eighth, and wave his hat to
a crowd of 56,752 according him a thunderous ovation as the newest
pride of the Yankees, the last in a glorious chain in this century.
</P>
<P>
   To a Hall of Fame resume, Clemens can now add a World Series
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I normally don't talk about it,'' Torre said, ``but I sure as
hell was going to go with him (Clemens) in the ninth inning, go one
batter at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he stepped on first base and got a bit of a whack. He was
still throwing good _ he threw a few pitches at 96 (miles per
hour).
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was a perfect way to end the World Series,
with a man who came over here because he wanted a World Series
ring. I couldn't see it not happening today, the way his career has
gone. It just seemed like a perfect setup for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, meanwhile, cemented their status as the Brooklyn
Dodgers of their day, an exquisite team that won more games than
any other this decade but in the end, like the storied Boys of
Summer, couldn't hurdle that final obstacle, the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz, who, with a dozen victories has won more games than
any pitcher in postseason, was splendid, striking out 11 while
allowing six hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz struck out the side in the second inning, after the
Yankees put runners on first and second on a walk and Strawberry's
single. He did not allow a hit over the final four innings.
</P>
<P>
   But, ah, the third inning, the only one in which he faltered.
That's when the Yankees scored all of their runs on four singles,
one of which _ Tino Martinez's two-run hit off the forearm of
Braves first baseman Ryan Klesko _ could just as easily have been
scored an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was more emotional, and I don't usually get
emotional,'' said a disconsolate Bobby Cox, the Braves manager who
became the second manager to lose as many as four World Series.
Hall of Famer John McGraw holds the record with six.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees tied a record set by the Ruthian Yanks by
winning their 12th straight Series game en route to their 25th
Series title, the Braves tied the Series record for most
consecutive Series losses with eight (all to the Yankees).
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that's pretty darn good,'' Cox said of the
Yankees' feat. ``You've got to tip your hat. It's hard. They could
have been knocked out in the first round like everybody else. It's
amazing to me. Even with a great ballclub, things can go wrong. I
think it ranks way up there, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning their 25th World Series title, the Yankees won 11 of
12 postseason games, their only loss coming to Pedro Martinez in
the final sweet day of summer for the Sox. In the last two years,
they are 22-3 in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens came out after Gerald Williams lined a single after
Weiss reached. Jeff Nelson replaced him and gave up a run-scoring
single to Bret Boone, cutting the Yankee lead to 3-1 and bringing
Chipper Jones, the odds-on favorite to be his league's MVP, to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Torre summoned Mariano Rivera, who cinched the deal and won
himself the shiniest trophy in the carnival _ the one that goes to
World Series MVP _ by inducing Jones to tap out to second after a
hellacious at-bat in which Jones hit a wicked liner just foul, one
that could easily have tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   There would be one final indignity for the Braves. Jim Leyritz,
whose three-run home run off Braves closer Mark Wohlers is widely
credited for turning around the '96 Series in the Yankees' favor,
hit for Strawberry in the bottom of the eighth and homered off
Braves reliever Terry Mulholland.
</P>
<P>
   From the seventh inning on, the Yankees outscored their
opponents, 26-8, in the postseason. Rivera finished with two wins
and six saves in the postseason, and a streak of 43 scoreless
innings dating to July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought a sweep would tarnish all the Braves have
accomplished _ eight division titles, five pennants, one World
Series title _ Cox said: ``I don't really think about that.
Baseball, to me, this job is a year-to-year proposition, and that's
it. We're paid to win and if we had the best record after the 10
years, that's fine. If we don't, that's fine. I'm looking at what
happened the year before or the past year, and that's as far as I
ever get.''

CLEMENS ENSURES PLACE IN HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was more than John Elway getting that first
Super Bowl ring. This was aging cowboy John Wayne winning the Oscar
for ``True Grit'' in 1969. It was Ernest Hemingway copping an
overdue Nobel Prize in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens . . . Sixteen major league seasons . . . Two
hundred forty seven wins . . . Three thousand three hundred sixteen
strikeouts . . . Tens of thousands of autographs . . . Four
fortunate sons with names that start with K . . . Several
unfortunate statements.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket. All-Century. No rings.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years after his last World Series appearance _ a
controversial outing in which he left too early and watched the
most ghoulish finish in October history _ Clemens returned to the
Fall Classic Wednesday night and clinched the Yankees 25th
championship of the 20th century with 7 2/3 innings of four-hit
ball in a 4-1 victory that completed a four-game sweep of the
Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very blessed to be part of this team,'' said Clemens.
``We played with some heavy hearts out there tonight (Paul
O'Neill's father died Wednesday). I don't know if I could have done
what Paul O'Neill did. It's just been wonderful to play for these
guys. Tonight I feel I know what it's like to be a Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike that hideous night in New York 13 years ago, it took a
lot to get Clemens out of the game and there was no question about
his departure. This time, instead of entrusting his lead to Calvin
Schiraldi, the game was finished by World Series MVP Mariano
Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens has played catch with Mariano Rivera. He has
traveled with Rivera and eaten lunch with Rivera. Mariano Rivera,
sir, is no Calvin Schiraldi. Four hundred miles and three years
removed from Boston, Roger Clemens would not be denied a ring this
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket had a two-hit shutout going into the eighth. When he
retired the first two batters of the inning, it looked like he
might go nine and put the exclamation point on his starry career.
Unfortunately, trouble came when he hit the first base bag
awkwardly while covering on a Walt Weiss chopper to the right side.
Clemens limped around a little and the trainer came out, but the
Rocket stayed in the game and the crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   After blowing two pitches past Gerald Williams, Clemens
surrendered a hard single to left and that was it. Sentiment took a
holiday. Yankee manager Joe Torre wasn't going to let the wounded,
weary Rocket pitch to any batter (Bret Boone) representing the
tying run. Torre came out to get him.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, muttering under his breath, Clemens gave Torre the
ball and walked toward the dugout as hundreds of cameras flashed,
thousands stood, and all humanity in the Yankee dugout greeted him
at the top step. His work was done, his ring was won.
</P>
<P>
   Almost. Jeff Nelson surrendered an RBI single to Boone then the
indomitable Rivera came on to get Chipper Jones on a routine
grounder to second (routine only because Luis Sojo had replaced
skittish Chuck Knoblauch).
</P>
<P>
   It's another stinger for Red Sox Nation, of course. Clemens was
the greatest pitcher in Red Sox history. In 12 seasons he won 192
games and three Cy Young trophies. But like Sparky Lyle and Wade
Boggs before him, he had to go to the Yankees to win his World
Series hardware. His performance in the Bronx Wednesday night fuels
the irrational fears of those who believe in the Curse of the
Bambino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard people talk about how I could be rattled,'' Clemens
said after the win. ``I don't get rattled. I've pitched in big
games and I put pressure on myself to rise to the occasion. Those
guys (his teammates) got me well. I was scuffling a little bit, but
we ran it out there and got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was asked if the ring might be enough to make him
retire. His answer made reference to his four boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll wait and see. This is one night and I had more pressure
than I could stand. I had my two big guys (Koby, 13, and Kory, 11)
here and two little guys (Kacy, 5, Kody, 3) back home telling me I
had to be home for trick or treat.''
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable pregame hype for Clemens's appearance.
The Yankees were on the threshold of their third championship in
four years, and a record-tying 12th consecutive World Series
victory. The Yankees are so deep they were able to turn to one of
the greatest pitchers of the century for the fourth game of the
World Series. It's like the 1985-86 Celtics having Bill Walton as
their backup center.
</P>
<P>
   After warming up, Clemens performed his usual ritual of wiping
sweat on the brow of the Babe Ruth monument in left-center field.
For Red Sox fans, the implications of this little gesture run
deeper than ever.
</P>
<P>
   As Clemens strolled in from the bullpen, Whitey Ford _ who won a
couple of World Series games _ threw out the first pitch to Yogi
Berra.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket was cheered when he finally took the mound and threw
his first pitch at 8:24 p.m. He fanned Williams swinging on a low
fastball. It was his first World Series moment since Mike Greenwell
hit for him in the top of the eighth inning of Game 6, 13 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   He had a good fastball and kept it down in the zone. He had a
one-hitter through four and a two-hitter through seven. In the end,
he allowed only two walks and one earned run while striking out
four. All 23 of his outs came via strikeouts or on balls in the
infield. The Braves hit only two balls hard all night.
</P>
<P>
   After an insurance homer by Jim Leyritz (another ex-Sox _ is
there no end to this stuff?), the Yankees took the field for the
ninth and Clemens sat in the dugout alongside Don Zimmer. Watching
from all corners of the globe, citizens of Red Sox Nation could
only wince.
</P>
<P>
   The final out was a harmless Keith Lockhart fly to Chad Curtis
in left. When Curtis gloved the ball, the PA system blared, ``We
Are the Champions,'' and the Yankees stormed the field to begin
their celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the pile, Roger Clemens stood holding two of
his sons aloft, one on each huge shoulder. Clemens was crying. He
was never so big and strong.

   HOTDOG-RECALL (New York) _ Food-safety inspectors are exploring
whether several recent deaths were caused by contaminated
frankfurters that were produced at a Bronx processing plant, and
the products have been recalled in at least 21 states. In a
national advisory to health officials, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said that it was investigating whether two

   REPUBS-SOCSEC _ Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., has been one of his
party's strongest voices for protecting Social Security. So he
finds it particularly galling that he is one of seven Democrats
under attack in a Republican ad campaign that accuses the Democrats
in the House of raiding Social Security. He complains that a year
before the election, things are already on a campaign footing. And
that is just the point. After years of being clobbered by Democrats

   BROKER-ADS (Undated) _ If ad spending in the series between the
New York Yankees and the Atlanta Braves is any indication, millions
of baseball fans are mainly angst-ridden about which of the
Internet brokerage firms they should use to trade stocks. Online
investment firms, many of which did not exist two years ago, have
collectively bought more World Series ad time than any other

   IMPERFECT-DESIGN (Undated) Were it not largely obscured by a
privet hedge, Gary Guerrette's three-bedroom bungalow might cause a
neighborhood revolt. But in low-key Water Mill, N.Y. _ where
picturesque dilapidation can be a badge of honor _ the rippling
asphalt-shingle roof, buckling wood steps and architectural malaise
pass without remark. ``It needs a little work,'' said a
brightly-smiling Mr. Guerrette, 40, of the house he shares with his
partner, Tom Lawson, 42, a massage therapist. Informally formal,
rough yet elegant, it is a semaphore for design on the century's
cusp _ a lively mosaic of pleasures and passions rather than a
catalogue of aspirational perfections. ``I don't think we own
anything that isn't chipped, rotten, broken or falling apart,''
Lawson said. By Mitchell Owens.
</P>
<P>
   WEEKEND-RETREAT (Delaware, N.J.) _ When Hal Bromm, a TriBeCa
gallery owner, and Doneley Meris, a bereavement therapist, bought
the old yellow clapboard Delawanna Hotel here as a weekend retreat
for themselves and their friends, there were 23 bedrooms. And lest
any of those friends felt left out, there was a stone guest house
on the hill. ``People keep stopping in to ask if this is a bed and
breakfast, and how much does it cost a night,'' said Bromm, a tall
man with dark curly hair, managing to sound both bemused and ever
so slightly annoyed. ``We tell them it's just for us.'' By Tracie
Rozhon.

</P>
<P>
   BARRIER-FREE-DESIGN (Undated) _ I never thought, somehow, that
the Rolling Stones would be the ones to sum up our experience of
installing a new bathroom for our mother on the farm in Maryland.
But they must have known something when they said, ``You can't
always get what you wah-ahnt.'' But after two months of trying, we
got what we needed. What we needed, in the material sense, was a
downstairs bathroom, with a shower. But what we also needed, big
time, was a new attitude. Nobody wah-ahnts to get old, for
instance. My 86-year-old mother certainly doesn't like it _ hates
it, in fact, when it means she can't run up and down the cellar
stairs with 30-pound turkeys, or see Africa again. By Anne Raver.
</P>
<P>
   DESIGN-AWARDS (New York) _ Six futuristic innovators will be
lugging weighty chunks of the here-and-now home as the latest
winners of the Daimler Chrysler Design Award. The awards,
menu-shaped slabs of cast tombasile, or white bronze, weighing in
at more than 15 pounds, are to be presented in a ceremony tonight
at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan. By Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   SALTO-POTTERY (Undated) _ It's rare that pottery can give you a
good scare, or that decorative art disturbs, but Axel Salto's does.
You think twice about touching it. It gives you goosebumps; it
looks like goosebumps. By William L. Hamilton.

THIS TIME YANKEES' WIN A LITTLE TOO FAMILIAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This never seemed like a World Series. Not for a New
York minute. Not for a Roger Clemens split-finger fastball second.
</P>
<P>
   And that can't be all that good.
</P>
<P>
   Not when Atlanta did a Hindenburg at home, going down 0-2 and
looking rung out by their wrenching National League Championship
Series against the killer Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The luster was gone by the time the Yankees came back to this
place they simply call ``The Stadium,'' as if there weren't any
other stadium in the world besides Yankee Stadium, the white
castle, the House That Ruth Built, the Bronx Zoo, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Yankees stunned the Braves in the Fall Classic.
That was a World Series. Or it felt like one. The dominant team of
the early '90s ran straight into the churning, resurgent Yankees,
whose meddling but ever-wiser owner had decreed it was time for the
Yanks to take back October, take back what was rightfully theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us were lucky enough to be sitting in the stands at
Yankee Stadium for Game 6 that night, a perfect autumn night in New
York. Not too hot, not too cold.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had lost the first two games at home to the Braves,
but over the course of three wild games in Atlanta, the Braves were
a team the Yankees psyched out by winning three straight.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees wrapped up the 1996 World Series in New York,
there was a rush of excitment as the world watched the emergence of
a magnificent kid named Derek Jeter. There was made-for-TV drama of
seeing an old stalwart named Wade Boggs win his first ring.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter was the Rookie of the Year, and Boggs celebrated with
convulsive tears and a crazy ride around the Yankee outfield on the
back of a police horse, and manager Joe Torre was the unflappable,
paternalistic leader whose brother had undergone heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   That was something.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in these four games of the 1999 World Series was
something else.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have become the deceptive juggernaut. They have
become General Electric, but with a nicer looking infield, more
patient hitters and a more stable stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Three rings in four years. Three World Series victories in three
tries _ the third one coming Wednesday night, as if there was any
doubt, to give the Yankees 25 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Team of the decade? Team of the century?
</P>
<P>
   Heck, why not just go ahead and stamp them team of the
millenium, the way adjectives and titles were being tossed around
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, there was something a little empty about the
entire World Series procedure _ not that there weren't enough human
stories between Scott Brosius, Luis Sojo, Paul O'Neill and Joe
Torre that these Yankees handled with class and bravery.
</P>
<P>
   Even though these '99 Yanks did not reel off 125 wins like they
did in '98, there was something inevitable and exclusive about what
they did.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees spend more money, use an army of scouts, sign
bunches of position players who would start on any other team just
to sit on the bench, win everything, and the strange thing is the
Yanks still seem like the boys next door.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams _ the anti-stars who look so
graceful and act so respectfully.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez and Mariano Rivera _ the starter and the
closer who can't be beat, who were not beat, not once this
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Even Chuck Knoblauch, with his dippy little throwing disorder,
grew endearing over the course of the postseason, even when he was
in the middle of all those controversial blown calls against the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   There is a toughness and a tenderness about this team.
</P>
<P>
   There is an efficiency and workmanlike attitude that let them
somehow seem better in '99 than they were in '98.
</P>
<P>
   And for all this talk of automatic performances, like that of
Rivera and that of Jeter, who rapped out a 12-game postseason
hitting streak for 1999 and extended his overall postseason streak
to 17 games, there is never anything machine-like about this team.
</P>
<P>
   That is what you have to admire about them, even when you know
George Steinbrenner spends as much as anyone in baseball and you
know he has helped raise the price of winning a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``George has gotten better people working for him in the minor
leagues and in player development,'' old-time Yankee Whitey Ford
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has come up with a better combination of what players he
has to buy. He's just got good people working for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of this World Series, according to the insiders, are
the legions of scouts that the Yankees use to break down every
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The story of this World Series is that Steinbrenner was asked
how long this dominance can continue and he said, laughing:
</P>
<P>
   ``Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Yankees were a feel-good story, a baseball team
emerging from a disastrous '80s and who used the 1995 swoon to the
Mighty Mariners to launch an all-out attack on regaining their
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1999, after dispatching the Padres in four straight in
'98 and then doing the same thing to the punchless Braves, the
Yankees have become too automatic to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Just wondering what it might be like next October if the Reds or
Red Sox, Rangers or Astros, Diamondbacks or Mariners or maybe even
the Expos, Twins, Pirates or Royals get to taste a little of this
champagne, get a whiff of this too rare World Series air.

LAKERS ADJUST TO NEW HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A red and white ``Clippers'' logo was scrawled
across midcourt and the basket standards also belonged to the
building's (begin ital)other(end ital) NBA tenant, but the Lakers
nevertheless got acquainted with their new home for the first time
Wednesday. Several airballs ensued.
</P>
<P>
   The immense height and depth of the Staples Center played tricks
on the eyes. The rims and backboards, borrowed from the Clippers,
were unfamiliar. But the Lakers mostly liked what they saw, even if
it will take time to get used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we missed (begin ital)every(end ital) shot we
took today,'' quipped Rick Fox, ``so that's a good sign,
considering some of us have been missing every shot we've taken the
last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's main impression? ``It's pretty big.''
</P>
<P>
   There won't be much time to get comfortable, either. The Lakers
won't play at Staples again until a shootaround Nov. 3, just hours
before their home opener against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson would have liked more practices or an
exhibition game or two in the new arena but said the Lakers will
adjust over time. Jackson's Chicago Bulls had a similar experience
when they moved in 1994 from Chicago Stadium to United Center _ a
building he likened to Staples.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few things that you have to get used to on a floor
like this, but this is a beautiful place to play and people are
going to enjoy it,'' he said. ``It probably took us a full year to
get used to the United Center. Of course, we lost a couple players
that would have helped us acclimate to that. But we never did shoot
a percentage that was high in the building. It was a difficult
place to actually play in, and I still think that it contributes to
probably a lower shooting percentage than normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Power outage: Robert Horry's stint as starting power forward
Tuesday night produced some decent defense but little offense, and
Jackson still isn't sure who will start in the season opener
Tuesday at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting any productivity out of that position, and
that hurts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Mitch Kupchak said the Lakers continue to search
for a viable starting power forward, either through trade or
free-agent signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any secret that we're a little thin up
front,'' Kupchak said. ``Our frontcourt is an area that we'll
continue to look at ways to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a report out of Orlando, the Lakers have inquired
about 35-year-old Magic veteran Armon Gilliam.
</P>
<P>
   Nice for Rice: Glen Rice's 21-point outburst Tuesday was his
best of the exhibition season, and he called it ``a big step
forward'' in his adjustment to the triangle offense. Rice had been
averaging just 8.2 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have been trying to go out there and concentrate on
running the plays,'' he said. ``I was a little more focused than
normal, trying to make sure I got to my spots. It helps a great
deal more when you've got guys that are really looking for the open
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he had been thinking too much and admitted, ``I was
frustrated. I think that's a part of when you're learning a new
offense. You want to find your niche in the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut: The Lakers waived rookie Andy Panko, reducing the roster to
17.

CLEMENS' EFFORT ENSURES SERIES SWEEP FOR TEAM OF CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It ended where it had to, in the cathedral of
baseball, a house a legend built and heroes still inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   A century of baseball concluded Wednesday night with the New
York Yankees doing what they do best. They won the World Series for
the 25th time, sweeping it for the second year in a row by beating
the Atlanta Braves, 4-1, at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the Team of the Century,'' said Whitey Ford, who threw
out the first pitch to another Yankee Hall of Famer, Yogi Berra.
``There's nobody close.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens was the winning pitcher, adding the only line he
needed to complete his Cooperstown plaque. The 16-year veteran
forced a trade to the Yankees this spring, expressly to win his
first world championship. He accomplished that with an overpowering
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens worked 72/3 innings, allowing four singles and one run.
Mariano Rivera got the last four outs and earned Most Valuable
Player honors with his second save to go with his victory in Game
3. Catcher Jorge Posada was there to greet Rivera at the mound when
Keith Lockhart's fly ball landed in the glove of left fielder Chad
Curtis for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MVP thing _ we are all MVP,'' said Rivera, whose 0.38
postseason earned-run average is the best in history. ``The whole
thing _ manager, coaches, the 25 guys that were on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25th man, Jim Leyritz, agreed. Leyritz, a frequent October
giant and a two-time Yankee, ripped a pinch-hit homer in the eighth
to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I found out when I went away and came back
here, everyone's one of 25,'' he said. ``There's no one who doesn't
stretch, no one who takes a day off. There's no special treatment
for anybody. That's what makes this team great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored three runs in the third, and that was more
than enough for Clemens. Chuck Knoblauch led off with an infield
single that shortstop Walt Weiss backhanded but couldn't snare.
Derek Jeter, who tied Hank Bauer's postseason record by extending
his hitting streak to 17 games, singled.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded, Ryan Klesko couldn't handle Tino
Martinez's smash to first. It went for a two-run single, and a
single by Posada gave New York its third run off Braves
right-hander John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz was mostly masterful. He struck out 11 in seven innings,
improvising with sidearm deliveries and a surprise knuckleball and
retiring 10 in a row in one stretch. Like teammate Greg Maddux in
Game 1, he pitched exceptionally. But his pinstriped opponent
pitched better.
</P>
<P>
   On a 48-degree night with a steady wind, Clemens was the only
player on either side in shirt sleeves. And as the game went on _
especially after the Yankees built a lead _ he became more
demonstrative.
</P>
<P>
   He hopped in excitement after striking out Andruw Jones to end
the fifth, and pumped his fists and raised his arms to celebrate
outs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens pitches on emotion, and he's had problems this year
channeling it. For a few pitches in the seventh, he seemed to let
the scene overcome him. With two outs and an 0-2 count on Lockhart,
the 56,752 fans stood and shouted, and Clemens' next pitch sailed
outside and high. He missed badly later in the at-bat before
inducing a pop-up, and as soon as it was hit, Clemens strode off
the mound, looking relaxed again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard people talk about how I could be rattled and things
like that,'' said Clemens, who was hammered in his last postseason
start and bumped to the No. 4 spot in the rotation. ``I don't get
rattled. Maybe earlier in my career in big games. But what are big
games? I pitched a big game tonight and I put pressure on myself to
rise to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens became the second member of the luckless 1986 Boston Red
Sox to find redemtion with the Yankees. Wade Boggs, who cried in
the dugout after those Sox lost the Series to the New York Mets,
rode a horse around the field after winning with the Yankees in
'96. And now Clemens has the ring he coveted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everyone is excited for him to come up big like that
and get his first ring,'' said Knoblauch. ``He's been waiting
forever for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' night ended in the eighth _ the inning he had not been
permitted to pitch after going seven strong in Game 6 of '86.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the eighth, Clemens couldn't reach an
in-between roller by Weiss. He scrambled to cover first, and
appeared to be spiked by Weiss. He stayed in the game, but when
Gerald Williams fought from an 0-2 hole and singled sharply to
left, Torre called on Jeff Nelson from the bullpen. As cameras
flashed and the crowd roared, Clemens lofted his cap and waved.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson allowed a run-scoring single to Bret Boone, who led the
Braves with a .538 average, then turned things over to Rivera. As
usual, the rest was automatic _ a ground out by Chipper Jones ended
the eighth, and a grounder, pop-up and Lockhart's fly made the
Yankees champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to go all the way every year,'' said Braves
manager Bobby Cox, whose team lost its fourth World Series in five
tries this decade. ``It's amazing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This team, more than any team I've had, represents what New
York's all about,'' controlling owner George Steinbrenner said.
``Nobody was better than this team for heart, courage and hanging
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   And no franchise was better this century than the one cavorting
on the Bronx green Wednesday night.

VAN RAAPHORST RATES COACH'S PRAISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The soundtrack at the Coliseum on Saturday was all
wrong. Mike Van Raaphorst was having an Amazing Grace kind of day,
but the background noise was more along the lines of Anarchy in the
UK.
</P>
<P>
   It was discomfitting, to hear boos dubbed in the place of
applause. Van Raaphorst, making his fourth start in place of
injured Carson Palmer, was putting up numbers for posterity. He was
flinging the football like no USC quarterback before him.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer. Rodney Peete. Rob Johnson. Van Raaphorst outthrew them
all. In a four-point loss to Stanford, he moved the Trojans 415
yards through the air.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter-mile-high club Raaphorst joined couldn't be any more
exclusive if it was located inside the Staples Center. John Elway
had 418 yards on his most prodigious day at Stanford. No UCLA
quarterback save Cade McNown has managed more than 409.
</P>
<P>
   The redshirt junior who in August couldn't be sure he'd take
another snap was launching balls like Mr. October. If not for R.
Jay Soward's bobbling of a beautifully thrown bomb, Van Raaphorst
would have had four touchdowns instead of three, more than 450
yards passing, a huge, confidence-building win and the best table
La Barca, a favorite postgame hangout.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Van Raaphorst walked off the field to the sound of
boos, too tired to lift his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It says here Van Raaphorst deserved better.
</P>
<P>
   Much lip service is paid to sports as a character-building
exercise, but fans' actions often suggest it's more about
dynasty-building.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on USC fans for not seeing the forest for the swaying,
celebrating Stanford tree. It's not Van Raaphorst's fault the
Trojans aren't winning like it's 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In a quainter place and time, the veteran who lost his starting
job but kept at it, who never missed a voluntary summer workout and
made enough plays to win the most critical game of the season would
be a standard bearer, not a scapegoat. His perseverance would be
lauded, his progress duly noted. The airwaves would be alive with
the sounds of a brewing quarterback controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose vs. Jim Gray wouldn't engage us.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson vs. himself wouldn't engross us.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves vs. history wouldn't entice us.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst or Palmer _ that would be our topic on the table.
The Castoff vs. The Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, in this day and age, athletes who never question their
coaches, who work hard because the work is its own reward, who say
things like, ``I feel like I'd be defrauding a lot of people if I
wasn't trying to get better,'' don't impress people much.
</P>
<P>
   Virtue is nice, but victories are the quickest route to
validation.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst, who was being hailed as a terrific NFL prospect
pre-Hackett, is 1-3 as a starter this year. In that span he has
completed 54 percent of his passes and is averaging one
interception every 35 throws (Palmer, before he got hurt, was
averaging an interception every 18 passes.)
</P>
<P>
   Against Stanford Van Raaphorst scrambled for one first down,
completed 25 passes, threw a ball that traveled 60 yards in the air
and showed admirable poise for someone whose offensive line offered
about as much protection as a dozing bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   And all he was made to feel was down.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Van Raaphorst derives his strength and
self-worth from his newfound spirituality and not other people's
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Not that everybody was a boo bird. There was the head coach who
said, ``I'm very happy for Van Raaphorst. To see the way he has
responded (after being unseated by Palmer), that's something every
coach loves to see. I'm kind of proud of the way he's played.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty classy of Cal coach Tom Holmoe to weigh in like that,
don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   USC's second-year head coach Paul Hackett has hung his star on
Palmer and perhaps that clouds everything he says. On Saturday, the
nicest thing he could say about Van Raaphorst's performance was,
``He gave us a chance to win. (Pause) He had chances to do more and
win it himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a rousing review.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, after examining the game videotape, Hackett
was more effusive in his praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say Mike's risen to the occasion well,'' he said.
``He's used his time as a backup to continue to develop his skills
as a passer and a leader. He's doing some things people said he
couldn't do. He's done some marvelous things. It wasn't enough
Saturday, but it was great football.''
</P>
<P>
   A drained Van Raaphorst told people after the Stanford game,
``I'm just kind of numb. I left everything I've got on the football
field.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing to remember is no athlete can do any more than that,
no matter what the scoreboard and the spectators say. &QL;

UCLA LINE PLAY IS TROUBLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For assistant coach Mark Weber, rectifying UCLA's
offensive line problems is like playing Clue. Is it guard Mike
Saffer on the right side, with bad footwork? Or tackle Blake Worley
on the left side, missing an assignment? Or center Troy Danoff
missing his run block? Or tackle Brian Polak? Or guard Oscar
Cabrera?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one guy on a play breaking down, not three or four
guys,'' Weber said. ``The problem is, it's a different guy each
play.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Bruins adjust to life without Kris Farris, Andy
Meyers and Shawn Stuart, two things seem certain: Most of the
mistakes are due to inexperience _ there are three first-time
starters _ and the line isn't UCLA's only problem, just the most
noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, UCLA quarterbacks were sacked six times Saturday
at Oregon State, but only three resulted from bad blocking. Other
times, the quarterbacks held the ball too long, which is a
complicated problem itself: Are they indecisive, or are receivers
struggling to get open? It varies each play.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will think this is crazy, but we had pretty good pass
protection against Oregon State,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges
said. ``We had plenty of time to throw, but it's not just the
quarterbacks. Some was due to our inability to get off bump-and-run
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to separate the offensive problems, but as Weber
knows, an efficient attack starts with effective blocking. If there
are no holes, there's no running game. If there's no running game,
defenses stack the line to pressure the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very talented, but we need to learn to focus on
different situations,'' Weber said. ``If there's one thing I'd like
to see us do, it's cut loose and play. If we're going to make a
mistake, make it full speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar faces: Saffer, the freshman guard, is a Tucson native
and knows several of the Arizona players and coaches who face UCLA
on Saturday in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Like injured receiver Brian Poli-Dixon, Saffer attended Tucson's
Sabino High School, then opted to spend his college career in
Westwood. (Saffer's dad, Don, played basketball at UCLA for John
Wooden.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said there wasn't something special, but it
would mean a lot more if we were going there,'' Saffer said. ``I
took a lot of flack (from friends) for leaving Tucson, and at the
very least, I'd like to show I didn't make a bad decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the day: Put the Bruins' red zone defense on red alert.
Opponents have scored touchdowns on 82 percent of their visits (23
of 28 attempts) inside UCLA's 20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Double-double threat: Arizona has two quarterbacks, Keith Smith
and Ortege Jenkins, and both are equally adept at running and
passing.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, of Long Beach, is the Pac-10's No. 2 passer (148
efficiency rating), while Smith, of Newbury Park, is the league's
No. 3 passer (147.7 rating).
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats probably will use both Saturday. Jenkins also plays
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't rotate as much as we have a starter and a substitute
who we use when we see fit,'' Wildcats coach Dick Tomey said.

SOWARD SHOULD BE READY, BUT ALLMOND IS WAITING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC wide receiver R. Jay Soward's strained left
hamstring isn't expected to sideline him Saturday against
California, but the emergence of freshman Marcell Allmond has made
the injury easier to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Allmond had a 64-yard touchdown reception against Stanford last
weekend and caught a career-high three passes for 90 yards against
the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   He will start Saturday if Soward can't play but should see
plenty of playing time anyway with Soward less than 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Allmond said he didn't expect the 64-yard pass play, which
included bouncing off two Stanford defenders and racing down the
sideline for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of surprised I was that open,'' Allmond said. ``I
was working in practice on not falling down after I got hit. I feel
I'm always part of the offense but it felt great to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after his breakthrough game, Allmond expects Soward to
return against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be back. He always finds a way to come back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer update: Tuesday night, quarterback Carson Palmer
discarded the shoulder harness he's worn for several weeks to keep
his broken collarbone in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to burn it,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was examined by doctors Tuesday, and said he is
recovering ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it's coming along well. Next week, I might start
doing upper body work and maybe even throw,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is still sure he wants to return for the UCLA game Nov.
20. ``Definitely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said he was ``excited'' X-rays revealed
the bone has grown back faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett is still reluctant to say when a decision will be
made on whether to bring Palmer back. He said when he coached in
Kansas City, Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac needed seven weeks to
recover, but was in poor physical condition when he returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm open (to playing Palmer), but when you consider all the
things, and that were not in the hunt for the Rose Bowl ...,''
Hackett said. ``When you look at the big picture, everyone says
it's better to have a third year (starting at quarterback).''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer would have to redshirt to start three full seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking advice: With USC mired in a three-game losing streak,
Hackett said he spoke to Oakland Raiders coach Jon Gruden on
Tuesday, after the Raiders overcame a 17-point deficit to defeat
the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see what they've been through, and you hope a little
something they say will tweak you,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he would also call childhood friend Ron Hudson, who
is the offensive coordinator at Kansas State. The Wildcats have
overcome two 21-point deficits this season.
</P>
<P>
   State of the line: Left tackle Brent McCaffrey sprained his
ankle Wednesday and was carted off the field as a precaution.
Trevor Roberts will probably start at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Donta Kendrick has recovered from his sore ankle
and would probably start at left guard in place of Faasea Mailo,
who is expected to miss the Cal game with a bruised shin.
</P>
<P>
   Another Avenger: Former USC wide receiver Mike Bastianelli said
he will sign with the Los Angeles Avengers, who will play in the
Arena Football League in April. The Avengers have already signed
former USC defensive back Ken Haslip.

IS MIAMI FINISHED AS BEAST OF EAST?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While Miami's come-from-behind victory over Boston
College was thrilling viewers on CBS last Saturday, it brought up a
pressing question. Could it have been one of Miami's last Big East
telecasts?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that has the league in a nervous posture as the
school's presidents meet next week, and with its TV contract about
to expire.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is flirting with joining the Atlantic Coast Conference and
it would affect the Big East's television negotiations with CBS and
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East presidents want an answer on Miami's status at
their annual meeting in Philadelphia next week. Miami's position
with the league is an agenda item, and Big East commissioner Mike
Tranghese said school president Tad Foote will address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Foote said things are ``status quo,'' meaning Miami is a
member of the Big East, but still having informal conversations
with the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he will give Big East presidents a definitive
answer on Miami's status with the league, Foote said, ``Until
conversations (with the ACC) end, we're not going to say
definitively what that status is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful, and I've always been optimistic, that at the end
of the day they'll realize they'll be better off with us,''
Tranghese said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami could cost the Big East its TV contract with CBS. The
league is in the process of renegotiating its football and
basketball television deals. The Big East is negotiating the deals
separately this year, but CBS and ESPN hold the TV rights to both
sports. The football contract expires at the end of the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at a point in our negotiations where we just had to
put it on hold,'' Tranghese said. ``Both networks want to know
where Miami stands.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is already adding more SEC games, at the expense of Big East
games, and the departure of Miami could be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Brees leaves? Purdue junior quarterback Drew Brees said this
summer he might consider entering the NFL draft after this season
if Purdue went 11-1, went to the Rose Bowl and he was projected as
a high draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Although Purdue has three losses, Brees said Tuesday leaving
early is still a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot more I'd like to do (in college), but we
still have four more games left,'' said Brees, referring to three
regular-season games and a likely bowl game. ``There's still a lot
more football to be played.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see. I'd rather not talk about it (the NFL draft)
because I don't know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon further review: The Big Ten finally gave Purdue coach Joe
Tiller an explanation on Penn State's illegal participation penalty
last Saturday. Penn State cornerback Anthony King came off the
sidelines to make a tackle of wide receiver Chris Daniels following
a catch.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions were one man short at the time. If King had
been the 12th man, Purdue would have automatically been awarded a
touchdown. But since he was the 11th, the officials had the
discretion of assessing a 15-yard penalty or awarding a touchdown
and they chose the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to the (Big Ten) director of officials, in all of
college football history, he said you can count on one hand the
times that has occurred and touchdowns have been awarded in the
past,'' Tiller said. ``So my response was, `Why wasn't one awarded
this time?'''
</P>
<P>
   Going to the dogs: Boston College purchased a pair of bird dogs,
Blaze and Tucker, to keep geese off its practice field.
</P>
<P>
   Geese, believe it or not, have been a big problem for BC in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't even walk on the field without stepping in geese
droppings,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs, who have a house to the side of the field and have
been known to wander around the athletic department offices, seemed
to be the most viable option for the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to do something,'' O'Brien said of the geese. ``They're
on there every morning and every evening, and that was the solution
we came up with.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he even interacts with the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I bring them a biscuit every once in a while? Yeah,''
O'Brien said. ``And, I tell them they're doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost Oregon: But for a massive turnaround in 1993, Cal's star
linebacker Sekou Sanyika might have wound up at Oregon instead of
at Cal.
</P>
<P>
   He and his father, a Cal professor, were at the Ducks-Bears game
in 1993, and Oregon held a 30-0 halftime lead. Sanyika, a high
school junior at the time, tried to convince his dad to leave the
blowout, but his father convinced him they should stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right about that time I was starting to think about where I
might want to go to college,'' Sanyika said. ``I told my dad, `If
they come back to win this one, then I'm going to Cal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears won 42-41, ``so I guess that was it for me,'' Sanyika
said. &QL;

NO DAYS OFF FOR KINGS' MURRAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What does a coach do on his night off? If he's
Andy Murray, he goes to a game.
</P>
<P>
   Murray and the Kings coaching staff prepared for tonight's game
against Pittsburgh by watching the Penguins play the Mighty Ducks
on Wednesday in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem pretty standard for a coach, but a pattern is
forming in Murray's first season. Other nights off have included
attending games in Long Beach where the Kings' minor league
affiliate plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for scouting players, but it's also good to sit back
and watch hockey,'' he said. ``It's good to be able to watch a
player miss a pass or get beat on a play and not have your stomach
tied up in knots.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was typical for Murray. He left his home in Hermosa
Beach at 6:30 a.m. to drive to the Kings practice facility in the
San Fernando Valley for an 11:30 workout. He watched a second
replay of Tuesday's 5-2 Kings victory over Washington, having seen
it first after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then he watched video of the Penguins for the first time and had
newspaper articles from Pittsburgh pulled off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the first time I saw them,'' Murray said. ``I think it
is important not to get too far ahead of ourselves and just
concentrate on the game at hand. I don't think there was a need to
see Pittsburgh before we played Washington. The coaching staff and
I go over it and make adjustments with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have the league's top power play but were 0 for 6
against Washington, the NHL's worst penalty-killing team. Assistant
Dave Tippett handles the power-play unit for the Kings and Ray
Bennett works on penalty killing.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray isn't upset with the team's performance. ``The power
play isn't always about scoring,'' he said, admitting it was nice
to get five goals at even strength. ``The most important thing is
maintaining momentum and we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings captain Rob Blake, who played for Murray on the Canadian
national team and was influential in his hire, said one of the
reasons the 5-3-2 club has responded to the new coach is the work
ethic Murray displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players see how much he gives of himself to them and they like
that,'' Blake said. ``They want to feel like he is working as hard
as they are. They want to feel like we're in this together.''
</P>
<P>
   How does the 48-year-old father of three handle all this? His
family is back in Minnesota, where Murray coached last year at a
posh prep school Shattuck-St. Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   His oldest son Jordan plays on the team and his daughter Sarah
plays on the girls' team. Tonight's game with the Penguins will be
special at the school because the son of Pittsburgh assistant Mike
Eaves also plays on the Shattuck team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They canceled study hall for tomorrow night and have brought
in a big TV so everyone can watch the game on the (satellite)
dish,'' Murray said. ``Mike also used to be the coach there. It
will be a big night.''

TRUCKS AND TREATS AT FONTANA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ Racing's version of the Odd Couple _ open-wheel Champ
cars and NASCAR trucks _ promises some tricks and treats this
weekend at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for the CART FedEx Championship Series and NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series driving titles will provide the impetus for
the Halloween weekend activity.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, more than $3 million in prize money will be up for
grabs. Most of the money is earmarked for those competing in
Sunday's Marlboro 500, the weekend's marquee event. The winner of
the 250-lap race, the last of 20 on the 1999 CART schedule, will
take home a $1 million check.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Vasser collected the cash a year ago, passing Greg Moore
on the start of the last lap for the win. Either Dario Franchitti
or Juan Pablo Montoya will collect another $1 million. They are the
only drivers who can win the series championship with Franchitti
holding a nine-point edge over the rookie from Colombia. Alex
Zanardi won the last two titles.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the eighth time since the series conception in 1983
that the points race has come down to the final event. It is
interesting to note that the driver in front has always emerged as
the champ.
</P>
<P>
   There's a greater point separation in the truck race, but three
drivers enter the 25th and final event with the opportunity to
succeed Palmdale's Ron Hornaday as champion. Greg Biffle enters
Saturday's NAPA 200 with a 21-point advantage over 1997 titlist
Jack Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's no longer a Ford vs. Chevrolet battle as Dennis
Setzer, driving a Dodge, trails Biffle by 25 points. That the truck
points battle will be decided in the final race of the year is
nothing surprising. Hornaday won his second crown last year by
three points, finishing second in the season finale at Las Vegas
Motor Speedway behind Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a new look for this year's truck race at Fontana.
While the first two races were conducted under the old mandatory
mid-race break rule, green flag pit stops are now allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Both series have adapted to the 2-mile, D-shaped speedway, which
will complete its third full racing season. Mauricio Gugelmin set a
world's closed-course record in 1997 when he qualified for the
Marlboro 500 at 240.942 mph.
</P>
<P>
   CART moved even quicker thereafter to slow the racers, requiring
the Handford Device in the 1998 race. While it slowed Vasser's
winning average speed to 153.785 mph, nearly 13 mph slower than
Mark Blundell's time in the inaugural, there was considerably more
passing and side-by-side racing.
</P>
<P>
   Two other championships also will be decided during race week.
Oriol Servia has a commanding margin in PPG-Dayton Indy Lights, the
developmental arm for CART. Servia leads Casey Mears 130-116 with
just one race left on the 12-race schedule. The Indy Lights race, a
50-lap effort, is set for Sunday at 9:50 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Another $50,000 will be at stake in the inaugural Craftsman Pit
Crew Challenge. Points were awarded pit crews, on the same scale
used to determine the driving champion, on total time spent in the
pits through the first 19 events.
</P>
<P>
   The four crews _ representing Max Papis, Paul Tracy, Montoya and
Michael Andretti _ will compete today at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The finals will consist of a five-minute warm-up session
followed by 10 minutes of track time, with all four cars on the
track at the same time. During that time span, each driver will be
required to make at least two pits stops, during which all four
tires must be changed correctly. The best average time will win,
which may lead to more than two spots in order to lower the average
time.
</P>
<P>
   For the fans, the treat will be a special musical performance by
Peter Frampton on the infield stage Saturday night, followed by a
fireworks show.

   CROWLEY LAKE, Calif. _ A discussion about the end of trout
season in the Eastern Sierra would be incomplete without a closer
look at the rich reputation for fall fly-angling at Crowley Lake. A
seemingly endless supply of fish are attracted to presentations of
midge-larvae fly patterns offered by boat and float tube at the
massive reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to explain the phenomenon than someone who is on the
water nearly every day? Tom Loe, owner and operator of Sierra
Drifters Guide Service here, took time recently to answer a series
of Daily News questions about the hot bite _ considered by many the
best in the region _ that continues to greet fly-fishermen right up
to the Oct. 31 trout closer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DN: What is the primary difference in the feeding habits of
Crowley Lake trout between the first three months of the season and
now?
</P>
<P>
   TL: ``Crowley trout primarily feed subsurface throughout the
entire year; the areas where they congregate and water column depth
vary with conditions. You will find different types of trout _
Coleman rainbows, Kamloops rainbows and Eagle Lake rainbows _
concentrated at various times of the season as conditions change.
Browns are photosensitive and are more vulnerable during spawning
periods.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: What are some of the basic elements new fly-anglers need to
know about Crowley in fall?
</P>
<P>
   TL: ``Get a seasoned guide and you will be light-years ahead.
(Crowley Lake Fish Camp, (760) 935-4301, can make a
recommendation.) Prepare for all types of weather. Beginning
fly-fishers can expect moderate results by trolling streamer or
baitfish patterns while in a float tube. If there is no inclement
weather, do not worry about getting on the lake prior to 9 a.m.;
morning temps are cold even in good weather and the fish will be
lethargic until warming occurs. Expect wind; this lake is very
prone to diurnal weather changes.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: Offer us some tackle suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   TL: ``The best all-around setup for Crowley is a 5-weight,
9-foot, fast-action graphite rod, a good-quality reel with low drag
start-up and 150 feet of backing. A 15-foot to 25-foot full-sink or
sink-tip fly line matched to your rod will work fine; I use various
types of sink tips depending on conditions and the depth we are
fishing. If you are fishing the surface or nymphing, a floating
line that is one line size up from your rod weight will help you
cast indicators and heavy nymphs; it also will assist you in
dealing with the wind on this lake. When fishing streamers, 2X to
4X fluorocarbon tippets will do the trick. Use a 7-foot to 10-foot
tapered leader.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: Crowley Lake is enjoying an Indian Summer, with daytime
highs in the 65-degree range. Is the warm weather contributing to
the remarkably lively action or would trout eat as aggressively if
the temperatures were lower?
</P>
<P>
   TL: ``Fall is the best time of year for big fish. The lake also
has been planted by the Department of Fish and Game to allow the
hundreds of thousands of stocked fish to grow and acclimate to the
lake (as targets for next year's anglers). You will catch fish
here, but please be extra careful to properly release short fish as
they are very opportunistic and will bite anything. (Late-season
regulations mandate only barbless hooks and artificial lures or
flies be employed and two trout 18 inches and larger may be
kept.)''
</P>
<P>
   DN: Does McGee Bay remain the hot ticket or are there other
productive sites?
</P>
<P>
   TL: ``You can catch fish in all areas of the lake. Some large
fish are being caught just off the Crowley Lake Fish Camp marina.
Try Hilton Bay _ very uncrowded for the ease of access and quality
of fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: Run through what a strike looks like and the set you want to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   TL: ``If you are fishing a streamer, with or without a dropper,
on a heavy sink-tip line, you will encounter numerous takes that
will not result in the bending of the rod. Predatory fish, when
attacking baitfish or smaller prey, will hit and stun the target
first, enabling them to alter the approach and swallow the
unfortunate victim headfirst. Resist the urge to set the hook on
the `drive by,' drop the fly back and wait for the second take;
then set the hook by pulling the fly line. This is called a strip
set, and it works well when fly-fishing from a float tube.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: Can midge-larvae (chironomid) fly patterns be tossed from
shore, or does success rely primarily on casting from a boat or
float tube?
</P>
<P>
   TL: ``When indicator fishing or using a floating line this
method is best achieved from a boat, as you have good elevation to
gaze upon the line or indicator. Fishing from shore is fun as long
as you do not sink in one of the many bogs and mud pools found all
around the lake. Survey the area prior to walking on it; this will
save you money on (float tube) flippers and hernias when you get
stuck in the muck.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: Provide your best advice to float tubers.
</P>
<P>
   TL: ``If you do not know Crowley, go with someone who has fished
here before or hire a guide. Use an approved personal floatation
device whenever you tube. Use tethers on your fins. Stay close to
shore if you are unsure of your physical capabilities; you can get
some fat leg cramps after several hours of kicking. The wind here
comes up very fast, be aware of any wind shifts. Be careful where
you drive your vehicle around the lake. I see lots of cars and SUVs
towed out every weekend due to someone attempting to get a little
too close to the water edge and save themselves a couple minutes of
walking.''
</P>
<P>
   DN: What have we missed that should be addressed in regard to
late-season fly-fishing at Crowley Lake?
</P>
<P>
   TL: ``Please use a soft, unknotted net. Try to handle the fish
as little as possible, and moisten your hands before doing so.
Please fully revive the fish before the release; this can take up
to several minutes on larger fish. Hold them only by the tail area,
and move the fish slowly forward and back until they have regained
strength. Make sure your hooks are truly barbless; this will ensure
an easy release. Keep the fish in the water! Do not hold the fish
out for any length of time after a long fight. Take pictures of the
fish in the net.''

A FUN LOOK AT FISHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The connection between fishing and mental health
has seldom been clearer than in Paul Quinnett's ``Fishing Lessons:
Insights, Fun, and Philosophy from a Passionate Angler'' (Andrews
McMeel Publishing; $21.95).
</P>
<P>
   Quinnett is a fisherman who also happens to be a psychologist
specializing in suicide prevention. His vocation and avocation fit
neatly together in helping him retain perspective in a fast-paced
world. Fishing is therapy, and he advocates plenty of it to stay
sane.
</P>
<P>
   Angling is not just a hobby for Quinnett, who finds time to
tackle his hobby 80 times a year despite a busy schedule. It's part
of leading what he calls the ``unencumbered'' life ... except for
fishing gear and tackle, that is.
</P>
<P>
   He diagnoses this country's ``hurry-up sickness'' and instead
touts the ``quiet time'' he gains: ``Angling is how I get
reacquainted with my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He writes, ``When you are quiet and engaged in unfocused
focusing, things deep in the great unconscious unfetter themselves
and start to drift around, like cotton from a cottonwood tree on a
breezy day.''
</P>
<P>
   In his work, Quinnett sees stressed-out professionals who never
find time for their children or for life writ large. One chapter,
``Big Boat, No Fish,'' centers on men who buy all the right gear
but never can quite squeeze in time for fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington state author takes the right angle when
discussing the lure of the outdoors and what we're all trying to
escape: ``Like a lot of stiffs who work as a slave in the city, I
rocket along, doing what I do, pacing myself against the passage of
time and the competition, as if I were in some great race to
somewhere important. Fact is, if we stand back and study them for a
moment, most of our races are not worth winning, let alone running.
Some days I worry I might just continue to pick up speed until,
around 5 o'clock, I'll just vanish into thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   Many outdoors enthusiasts will find the author's philosophy of
enjoying the present and not obsessing about work as refreshing as
a Sierra Nevada lake at sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishing Lessons'' is entirely readable _ slow-paced yet
lively. Anyone picking up the 311-page book during a leisurely
vacation would get some laughs and more than a few nuggets of
wisdom. Quinnett is a gifted storyteller whose message is never too
didactic; his avuncular, down-to-earth bedside manner is evident.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not just a philosophy book. The tales center on
fishing, and Quinnett spins them as cleverly as a skilled
fly-angler tying a Royal coachman.
</P>
<P>
   There's the story of a teen-age Quinnett who gets a lure
entangled in the sweater of a girl he has the hots for. A tale
about ``fly-fishing Nazis'' who believe there's only one way to
fish. Of piranha fishing in South America. Of the invariable good
luck of greenhorns and indifferent fishermen. Of a frustrating day
with Bonefish Felix in the Bahamas during which, like most in his
party, Quinnett voiced frustrations over the propensity of
profanity only to discover the guide was also a preacher. About a
memorable day when his casting was interrupted by three naked women
floating by in inner tubes. Of funeral chapels that sell coffins
for fly-anglers.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the stories are studies in levity, others are
sobering. He is dead serious when he writes about depression and
the madness of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   Another disturbing entry focused on a silver salmon in Alaska
that stranded itself on a beach finning upstream; Quinnett
struggled over whether to help the doomed fish, eventually deciding
to let nature run its course. ``To witness a death in the afternoon
wakes up in me the mild terror that perhaps the universe in which
we live and love and spend our lives is indeed without clever
design, without purpose or compassion, except as we humans imagine
it,'' he rationalizes. ``What we don't know about how the universe
works we invent, attribute meaning to, and call spiritual.''
Quinnett then watched the gulls ``dine high and handsome'' on the
dying coho salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishing Lessons'' is deceptive. It looks and feels like a
``small'' book one would read in a day or two for sheer enjoyment.
The reader may be surprised to find that the tutorials in this book
stick, containing weighty pearls of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnett's weakness is that often he tries too hard to be too
cute, but it's certainly a forgivable fault considering the many
merits of this fine title. Our rating: HHHH

STRICTER ANGLING REGULATIONS PROPOSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISHOP _ A private inland-fisheries conservation group is
recommending stricter angling regulations to protect rainbow and
brown trout that spawn upstream from Crowley Lake during the early
and late stages of the fishing season.
</P>
<P>
   California Trout is proposing to the state Fish and Game
Commission _ the government agency in charge of reviewing such
matters _ that only two fish 16 inches and shorter be taken before
June and after September on the stretch of the Upper Owens River
known as ``the gauntlet,'' from its mouth at the lake north to
Benton Crossing Bridge. Also suggested is that only barbless hooks
and artificial lures or flies be used, according to a release
issued by the San Francisco-based nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   General fishing regulations _ a five-trout limit without size or
tackle restrictions _ currently apply on river.
</P>
<P>
   CalTrout's proposal appears to coincide with the wishes of many
local anglers who prefer to cast insect imitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important issue to the fly-fishing population,'' said
Eric Hein, a Mammoth Lakes fly-angling guide. ``Allowing (general
regulations) in the first and last month of the season on the Upper
Owens, when the largest concentrations of fish are moving through
the river to spawn, is a problem for rainbows in the spring and
browns and fall-spawning rainbows in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   By adopting the proposed regs, Hein said, ``Hopefully you are
going to get the spawning built back up _ better gene pool,
better-fighting fish, more natural fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Such proposals are part of the public process as a means to
affect change, according to the Department of Fish and Game.
``Requests are all given a due amount of attention as staff time
allows,'' said Bruce Kinney, supervisor of the Wildlife and Inland
Fisheries Program for the Eastern Sierra in the DFG's Bishop
office. ``They are not simply disregarded, regardless of the
sources.''

ELIZABETH: THE QUEEN OF YOSEMITE LAKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUOLUMNE MEADOWS, Calif. _ ``Is the sky bluer up here, or does
it just seem that way against the green trees?'' an unkempt
day-tripper in our party of five wondered.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly seemed bluer, somehow, but what else would you
expect on a cloudless day in Yosemite National Park?
</P>
<P>
   Our destination _ Elizabeth Lake, 2{ miles south of the
campground here in the eastern hub of the park _ would prove the
perfect complement to the heavens, its gradient of depths revealed
in a palette of azure and aqua.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour round-trip venture to this most accessible locale
should dispel any notion Eastern Sierra visitors may hold that the
Yosemite backcountry is too far off the beaten path (read: Highway
395).
</P>
<P>
   The track gains 850 feet in elevation _ less than 350 feet per
mile _ and would be considered moderate for most; its offerings
belie the ease of access.
</P>
<P>
   Shimmering reflections on the shallow east side of the
9,508-foot lake are stellar under rounded 11,064-foot Johnson Peak
and 11,110 Rafferty Peak to the southeast. Lodgepole pines define
the void that is the Elizabeth Lake Basin below the juncture of the
Cathedral Range and the Matthes Crest. Stemming from its namesake
peak, Unicorn Creek and its hushed flows drain the lake in
picturesque fashion. And the northerly views of the Yosemite
Wilderness are unparalleled _ except by tougher treks more hearty
souls may be willing to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few places in Yosemite give so much for so little effort as
this lovely subalpine lakes,'' write Jeffrey P. Schaffer and Thomas
Winnett in ``High Sierra Hiking Guide: Tuolumne Meadows''
(Wilderness Press).
</P>
<P>
   The trailhead is situated at an elevation of 8,460 feet,
alongside the horse camp in Tuolumne Meadows Campground;
consequently the course is heavily used.
</P>
<P>
   Half Moon Bay's Mickey Williams, who made the mild hike a
warm-up for farther pastures, summed up the situation: ``Very
accessible. Beautiful lake with beautiful scenery. Lots of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one must be prepared to sacrifice solitude for ease of
travel.
</P>
<P>
   It's refreshing to note, however, that in spite of the foot
traffic park personnel do what they can to preserve the integrity
of the Elizabeth Lake Basin with trail signs indicating no
overnight camping or making trail shortcuts are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred feet onto the wide, well-groomed track _ that one
would expect from a popular day hike in a National Park _ is the
intersection with the Tenaya Lake-Lyell Canyon Trail, which also is
at once the John Muir Trail. Some 650 feet of altitude gain are to
follow in about 1\ miles. Sure, it's steep, but the rewards include
several verdant meadows _ and the views they afford _ that break up
the widely spaced emerald pines.
</P>
<P>
   Lodgepole roots and dry streambeds crisscross the uphill route.
</P>
<P>
   Survive the ascent and expect a cakewalk for the remainder of
the adventure. The goal is near when a clearing exposes 10,900-foot
Unicorn Peak and 11,065-foot Cockscomb to the southwest. Soon
echoes of human voices can be detected bouncing off the placid
waters.
</P>
<P>
   A loop around the body of water meanders through a woody high
point and a narrow stretch of _ get this _ sandy beach. There,
Fresno's Janet Morello was in a group of 35 visitors who annually
hoof to Elizabeth Lake as a tribute to her late husband. ``It's
gorgeous,'' she said. ``It stays cool. You never get the hot heat
up here in Tuolumne. It's a little more remote.''
</P>
<P>
   Morello recommends the trip for children 5 years and older;
younger kids will likely end up being carried in on the backs of
their parents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas angler Jim Furlong had enjoyed little luck on a Rapala
lure but planned to switch to a fly-and-bubble setup. Three other
anglers picked up a couple of colorful 7-inch brook trout on
fluorescent orange Power Bait.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's the surrounding landscape of the glacier-carved lake
that is most stunning: ``From the east and north sides of the lake,
the views across the waters to Unicorn Peak are classic, and one
can see why this is a traditional lunch spot for people climbing
this glacier-trimmed, knife-edge crest,'' the aforementioned
Tuolumne Meadows hiking guide suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Distance hiker Williams agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's well worth the climb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE GOING ...
</P>
<P>
   Directions: Drive highways 5, 14 and 395 north some 325 miles
past Mammoth Lakes to Highway 120 west, which takes travelers into
Yosemite National Park. Entrance is $20 per vehicle. Continue on
Tioga Road to Tuolumne Meadows Campground and park. Walk through
the campground to the horse camp and the Elizabeth Lake Trailhead.
</P>
<P>
   Allow at least three hours to complete the 5-mile round-trip
hike.
</P>
<P>
   Maps: Vogelsang Peak 7.5-minute topographic, Tuolumne Meadows
15-minute topo and Tom Harrison Cartography's ``Trail Map of the
Yosemite High Country.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: There are no services in Tuolumne Meadows at this time of
year _ overnight parking is not allowed after Oct. 15 _ so visitors
will be on their own. Highway 120 is open only till the snows fly;
it is closed for winter.

THE YANKEES' SUPERB CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The century is coming to a close next year and it is
all different now than it was in 1923 when the New York Yankees
began their mythical legacy of World Series championships behind a
rambunctious fellow named Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes and automobiles were in the curiosity stage. The
motion pictures were silent. Television and the Internet were
beyond human comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one constant that links these two diverse eras.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees continue to win World Series championships.
</P>
<P>
   They earned their 25th one Wednesday night as they have so many
others in their glorious past with a poised, methodical
performance, combining opportunistic hitting with stout pitching _
and, oh, was Roger Clemens stout! _ to consummate a stirring
four-game sweep of the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees, so cool, so calm, so confident, so efficient, so
marvelously good, are slightly more than the Team of the '90s after
their latest bit of postseason mastery in which they impaled Texas
in three straight and beat Boston four of five before scoring their
spectacular knockout over the stunned Braves.
</P>
<P>
   They are the Franchise of the Millennium with their 36 World
Series appearances across the years in which they have provided
such sacred phenomena of sporting lore as Ruth's booming home runs,
Lou Gehrig's durability, Joe DiMaggio's grace, Mickey Mantle's
power, Reggie Jackson's dramatics, Casey Stengel's rhetoric, Billy
Martin's volatility, George Steinbrenner's impulsiveness and Joe
Torre's stability.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to compare teams from different epochs, but
it's now indisputable in light of what these Yankees have just done
to the proud Braves that they rank among the best ballclubs ever
and are the most successful since those Oakland A's of the early
1970s were winning their three consecutive World Series.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the Yankees cut a swath across their sport with
114 regular-season victories, it wasn't a surprise that they rolled
past the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   But what they did this time against the Braves was a far more
impressive accomplishment, considering the Atlantans were making
their fifth World Series appearance this decade and had just come
off a 103-victory regular season and an emotional NLCS triumph over
the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the Yankees had to endure their share of adversities.
</P>
<P>
   Torre himself was sidelined a couple of months after being
diagnosed with prostate cancer and undergoing surgery. Darryl
Strawberry spent most of the season on the disabled list recovering
from colon cancer. Three players, Scott Brosius, Luis Sojo and Paul
O'Neill, lost their fathers, with the strong-willed O'Neill playing
in Game 4 even though his dad passed away early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees had their erratic moments the past summer on the
field and wound up with 98 wins, but Torre has had them in epic
form this month as they put on nightly hitting, fielding, pitching
and thinking clinics against the Rangers, Red Sox and Braves.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees might not have been the overwhelming presence they
were in 1998, but they were a sight to behold in this World Series
as they took advantage of every Braves misstep and played the game
as it's supposed to be played.
</P>
<P>
   From the eighth inning in Game 1 when they erupted for four runs
against Greg Maddux to wipe out a 1-0 deficit to the 10th inning of
Game 3 when the seldom-used outfielder, Chad Curtis, crashed his
second home run of the evening for the dramatic game-winner to the
eighth inning of Wednesday night's affair when Torre once again
made the perfect decision _ he signaled in reliever Mariano Rivera
_ the Yankees never wavered and repulsed every Atlanta challenge.
</P>
<P>
   This was a quintessential team victory for the Yankees against a
Braves club that continually failed throughout the series to make
big plays at vital moments.
</P>
<P>
   Five-time Cy Young-award winning future Hall of Fame Roger
Clemens finally earned his first World Series win at 37 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know what it is to be a Yankee,'' Clemens kept saying in
the joyous Yankee dressing room afterward. ``What a team we are! A
lot of guys were playing with heavy hearts. But we never gave an
inch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just took advantage of every break that came our way,''
said shortstop Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept grinding away, and good things kept happening to us,''
said Torre.
</P>
<P>
   After it was over, the players went through their ritualistic
hugging and shoulder-pounding and the passionate fans sang along to
Sinatra's ``New York, New York,'' which blared over the
public-address system again and again and again.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Lords soon might be extinct in England, but the
Lords of Baseball, the New York Yankees, are flourishing and in
control of their domain as we reach the 2000's.

PROMISING THERAPY FOR CHRONIC PAIN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Molecular neurosurgery, a new approach for treating
chronic pain, is showing considerable promise in early-stage
experiments with animals, pain specialists reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The novel method involves delivery of a toxic compound directly
to those nerve cells that transmit pain messages up the spinal cord
to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers outlined the latest results Wednesday at the Society
for Neuroscience's annual meeting in Miami. They said limited
trials in humans could begin in about two years.
</P>
<P>
   If the therapy works, sufferers of hard-to-treat chronic pain,
as well as severe pain from cancer and other terminal conditions,
would get another alternative to standard neurosurgery or
pain-deadening drugs, both of which can be effective but also carry
risks and side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The new technique offers permanent relief through a one-time
injection into the fluid-filled space surrounding the spinal cord.
Such injections could be given in a doctor's office, without need
for hospitalization or even follow-up shots.
</P>
<P>
   The method takes advantage of a fast-growing body of knowledge
about the peculiar way pain signals travel through the nervous
system. In the case of chronic severe pain, such signals often are
carried through pathways paved by a neurotransmitter known as
substance P. Less severe and short-term acute pain signals _ which
are beneficial because they warn of injury _ move on a different
track.
</P>
<P>
   Molecular triggers in the spinal cord, called receptors, sit on
the surface of neurons until they lock onto substance P. At that
point, the receptor and neurotransmitter move together inside the
neuron, switching it on and allowing the pain message to keep
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers came up with the idea of taking advantage of this
system as a way to mark the chronic-pain pathways for destruction,
while at the same time using the substance P receptors as a gateway
to get inside the target neurons.
</P>
<P>
   So far, experts said, the substance P delivery ploy is working
about as well as they had hoped _ although nobody can predict what
the effect might be in people.
</P>
<P>
   In standard neurosurgical procedures, pain pathways in
particular regions of the spinal cord are destroyed by cutting or
applying heat. But that can lead to loss of motor function or
sensation, and sometimes the spinal cord manages to rewire itself
to once again let the pain messages through.
</P>
<P>
   Molecular neurosurgery could be much more precise, because
``you're letting the cells select themselves,'' said Patrick Mantyh
of the Veterans Administration Medical Center and the University of
Minnesota in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Wiley, a neurologist at the Vanderbilt University and VA
Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn., has been collaborating with
Douglas Lappi of San Diego-based Advanced Targeting Systems to
develop a commercial treatment.
</P>
<P>
   They presented new data at the neuroscience meeting showing that
a combination of substance P and a toxin called saporin had the
desired effect in tests on rats. Pain signals were reduced by more
than 90 percent, they reported, and the effect lasted for as long
as eight to nine months of follow-up observation.
</P>
<P>
   They found no significant side effects once dosages were
adjusted properly, Wiley added. Further studies in primates are
just beginning. If those succeed, Advanced Targeting intends to
seek Food and Drug Administration approval to test it in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sophisticated technique,'' said Lorne Mendell,
pain expert at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, who
called it ``a particularly spectacular example'' of putting
fundamental neurochemistry and spinal anatomy to work on a serious
clinical problem.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped short of predicting ultimate victory in the war on
pain, however. ``I'm just optimistic that we will get to the next
point'' in the development process, he said.

HELMS EJECTS CONGRESSWOMEN BEARING MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Sen. Jesse Helms ordered Capitol Hill police to
remove Lynn Woolsey, Nancy Pelosi and several other House
Democratic women from his hearing room Wednesday after they
demanded hearings on a treaty promoting women's rights.
<P>
   ``Now, you please be a lady,'' Helms, R-N.C., told Woolsey
before calling on police to escort them from the room, according to
a transcript of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey, who represents counties in Northern California, led a
group of 10 House women to deliver a letter to Helms calling for
hearings on the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which Woolsey accused Helms
of bottling up in his Senate Foreign Relations committee since
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The protest drew stinging criticism from a Helms spokesman, who
emphatically singled out Pelosi for engaging in ``a juvenile
political stunt.'' Pelosi, who represents San Francisco, is a vocal
advocate of human rights in China and is now running for a
top-ranking Democratic leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were particularly dismayed to see Nancy Pelosi there as
part of this, because Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Helms have worked long
and hard together to promote the cause of human rights in China,''
said Helms spokesman Marc Thiessen. ``For her to come in and
disrupt the most important hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations
committee this year on China policy and the consideration of the
next ambassador to China to pull a political stunt like this is
appalling. She should be ashamed of herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms was chairing a hearing on President Clinton's nomination
of Admiral Joseph Prueher as ambassador to China, listening to
testimony from China human rights activist Harry Wu and Rep. Chris
Cox, R-Newport Beach, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. treaty dates back to 1979 and has been signed by 162
countries but never ratified by the Senate, where it requires a
two-thirds majority. Often described as an ``international bill of
rights for women,'' it contains 30 articles defining discrimination
against women and calling for the establishment of international
tribunals to monitor alleged discrimination around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, a powerful conservative who has often tangled with gay
activists and other liberal groups, opposes the treaty. But
Thiessen refused to discuss the objections, saying: ``That only
dignifies the stunt they pulled. They haven't handled this in a way
that deserves a substantive response.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi contended that the women were not disruptive, and she
defended the group's tactics. ``We walked into the room, and
whatever the subject matter was, we wanted to get an appointment
with Chairman Helms so he could receive our letter,'' Pelosi said.
``It didn't matter what the subject matter of the meeting was as
long as it was business. It wasn't as if it was a funeral; it was a
public hearing, and Harry Wu was not testifying at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said she could not understand why Helms ``is singling me
out,'' for criticism. Just because she agrees with Helms on China
policy, Pelosi said, he should not expect her ``to water down my
enthusiasm for any idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident started when the women held a news conference on
the House side of the Capitol, and then walked over to Helms'
Senate office to deliver their letter, signed by 100 House members.
Woolsey said she had been trying for more than two months to meet
with Helms to discuss the treaty but had gotten nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said she had notified Helms' office the day before that
the group was coming to his office. But when they got there,
Woolsey said, they were told by staff that the senator was
``indisposed'' and that no one knew his whereabouts or how to reach
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then some nice person whispered that he's down the hall in a
hearing,'' Woolsey said. ``So we went down to the hearing and
walked in and stood quietly _ it's a public hearing, you know _ and
he brought down the gavel and said, `I would like you to sit down
and act like ladies,' '' and, of course, there was no place to
sit.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said she asked Helms from the back of the room if they
could meet to talk about the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with him; he was in the front of the room, and
that was all,'' Woolsey said. ``Nobody else said a word.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Helms repeatedly asked the women to leave and
then ordered police to escort them from the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is first time I've ever seen members of Congress barge
into a hearing room holding signs and yelling at the chairman from
across the room that they demand to be heard on an unrelated
issue,'' Thiessen said. ``If they want to be treated like members
of Congress, they should behave like members of Congress instead of
like a bunch of campus protesters. They were treated like any other
citizen who disrupted a hearing would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said it was ``ironic that he (Helms) is talking about
human rights in China when he doesn't pay any attention to the
rights of people in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey argued that the hearing was public and that Helms had
wrongly refused all other channels of communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can walk in there anytime we feel like it,'' she said.
``Members of Congress are usually treated with some degree of
respect, and it is inappropriate for him not to respond to my
request to meet with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he didn't like it,'' she said, ``but we got his
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said it was Helms who was ungentlemanly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynn Woolsey is very gracious,'' Pelosi said. ``It would have
been more appropriate and would have ended it all in a second if
the senator would have been more gentlemanly and said, `I can't
talk to you now. I'm engaged in other business, but I would be
pleased to receive your message at my earliest convenience.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Woolsey protest was reminiscent of a similar female charge
on the Senate led in 1991 by then-Rep. Barbara Boxer, who led a
group of female House members up the steps of the Senate to protest
male senators' treatment of Anita Hill, who had accused Supreme
Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer drew enormous publicity from the incident, using it to
burnish her credentials as a feminist-barrier breaker and making it
an important part of her successful campaign for the Senate. She
later wrote a book about the protest, called ``Strangers in the
Senate.''

GORE AND BRADLEY HOLD A GENTEEL DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  HANOVER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore used his first televised
encounter with Bill Bradley Wednesday night to raise doubts about
the former senator's campaign promises, warning that the cost of
his health care plan alone could ``shred the social safety net.''
<P>
   Bradley, who seemed determined not to counterattack or appear
defensive, responded only by saying, ``We each have our own
experts, and I dispute the cost figure that Al has used.''
</P>
<P>
   The gentle clash was one of the only moments of discord during a
policy-laden town hall meeting that highlighted the candidates'
similarities _ both in style and policy _ far more than their
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Competing for attention with Game 4 of the World Series, the
debate at Dartmouth College came as the vice president is
struggling for political survival against a candidate who was once
a dark horse but is now leading him in most New Hampshire polls.
</P>
<P>
   On issues ranging from poverty and the environment to gay rights
and the United Nations, Gore and Bradley made parallel appeals to
liberals and other core Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates promised to expand access to health care, enact
campaign finance reform, improve urban schools, direct resources to
poor children and protect civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a gay American can serve openly in the White House, in
Congress, in the courts, in the Treasury Department _ why can't
they serve openly in the military?'' Bradley said in perhaps the
most poignant response of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Bill was very eloquent on that issue,'' Gore said
moments later. ``The time has come for gays and lesbians to be
recognized in the circle of human dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the oratory was nowhere near as vivid as the autumnal
brilliance on display in this first-in-the-nation primary state,
where cerebral and plodding answers to serious policy questions is
not necessarily a liability.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was aggressive, taking control of the floor 20 minutes
before the television cameras went on and asking for questions. He
remained in the hall at least 45 minutes afterward to chat with
audience members.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear Gore was trying to emulate President Clinton _
regarded as a master of such intimate forums _ by asking questions
of his questioners and trying to display empathy for their personal
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was more reserved, pacing the stage and speaking in a
more subdued manner.
</P>
<P>
   However, their similarities were evident even in their wardrobe:
Gore wore a red tie with diagonal stripes, Bradley a red tie with
horizontal stripes.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-minute forum, the first televised meeting between the two
candidates, included questions from audience members selected by
the event's sponsors, CNN and WMUR-TV in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were quick to lump the Democratic candidates under
the single label of big spenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Bradley and Gore would have to spend the entire projected
budget surplus over the next 10 years to keep the promises they
made tonight in less than an hour,'' said New Hampshire GOP Party
Chairman Steve Duprey.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Republican presidential field _ minus Texas Gov.
George W. Bush _ will participate in an identical forum tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who now trails Bradley by several percentage points in
most New Hampshire polls, was quick to criticize Bradley's plan to
expand access to health care _ including a proposal to expand
health insurance to 95 percent of all children.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight minutes into the debate, Gore charged that Bradley's
plan would cost $1.2 trillion over 10 years, more than double what
Bradley has estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is more than the entire surplus over the next 10 years,''
Gore said. ``We have to look ahead and save some of that surplus
for Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Disputing the figures, Bradley nevertheless agreed that it is an
ambitious and costly plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big problem, and it needs a big solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the disagreements were over nuances in policy or prior
Senate votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore challenged Bradley over his former support for school
vouchers, his reluctance to support U.S. involvement in East Timor
and his call to reopen the 1964 Civil Rights Act to expand coverage
to include gays and lesbians. None of the issues seemed likely to
inflame passions in either direction.
</P>
<P>
   Several questioners asked how to reduce the public's cynicism
toward politics, prompting Gore to defend his loyalty to President
Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the disappointment and anger you feel toward
President Clinton, and I felt it myself,'' Gore said, though no
questioner actually brought up the impeachment scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also feel that the American people want to move on and turn
the page, and focus on the future and not the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley passed up an opportunity to criticize the Clinton-Gore
campaign for the many ethical questions raised during their 1996
re-election, saying only that ``there were some irregularities that
were addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain why he quit the Senate after 18 years shortly
after the GOP took control _ a move that has been criticized by
Gore _ Bradley said he felt compelled to do things he could not do
as a senator, and now he thinks the time is right for him to return
to public office.
</P>
<P>
   When the debate ended, the World Series was still scoreless. At
least one local pundit didn't think the game would detract
attention from the political event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox aren't in it,'' said Jeff Woodburn, former
chairman of the state's Republican Party. ``Who cares?'' &LR;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Corruption not just a foreign propensity
 &HT;    (For release Oct. 31, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As October began its waning week, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright was off in Nigeria, telling her hosts that crime
and corruption are hampering Africa's economic potential. Somewhat
wryly, I thought to myself, crime and corruption haven't done
anything to mar the economical potential of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Not content to lecture the world on human rights, the U.S. now
is in the business of moralizing on corruption. Admittedly, there
is an enduring global epidemic of corruption. Like it or not, it
has been a way of doing business going back to biblical days. That
it has survived the eons tells me that while corruption is rampant,
Albright is spitting into the wind when she starts lecturing on it.
</P>
<P>
   There are some things the U.S., despite its military and
financial clout, cannot accomplish. One of them is the elimination
of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than stand behind a podium in Abuja, Nigeria, as she did
last week, she could fly back to the U.S. and give the same talk in
any number of cities where crime and corruption flourish.
</P>
<P>
   In the very week Albright was lecturing the Nigerians, two
elected public officials in Miami were at the mercy of the courts,
a former county commissioner having been convicted of taking a
bribe while in office, a state senator confessing to participating
in defrauding Medicare of close to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, Miami public officials have been parading to the
hoosegow in growing numbers. Miami's city manager took a bribe and
so did one of its commissioners. Off to jail they went. Several
judges are in the slammer, and Miami is in its third year of
reeling politically from a ballot-box stuffing case in its last
mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
   I write of Miami because I know Miami, but I also know that
Miami does not have a monopoly on corruption. It is rife in other
cities. For every one public official who is caught, dozens are not
detected _ or at least not indicted.
</P>
<P>
   The best one can hope for regarding corruption is that it is
contained. It won't ever be stamped out.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's all Albright wanted when she told a 14-nation
African conference in Nigeria that ``the battle against crime and
corruption must be won.'' But, really, it can't be won.
</P>
<P>
   I would be foolish to try to convince you that corruption in the
U.S. is as enormous as it is elsewhere. In Mexico, for instance,
stories have reached us in the wake of the recent earthquake that
many of the buildings there would not have collapsed if built
properly but that authorities were paid off to relax required
construction standards.
</P>
<P>
   Can we lecture the Mexicans on that, or should we still be
looking at the Miami area, where Hurricane Andrew in 1992 leveled
thousands of homes that were built with significant code violations
that had authorities looking the other way _ most likely at
someone's wallet?
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, an anti-corruption organization _ Berlin-based
Transparency International _ just last week released its ``Bribe
Payers Index,'' a ranking of nations vis-a-vis corruption. It was
based, according to the report, on how exporting countries commit
bribery in order to close a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, along with South Korea and Taiwan, were listed as
the greatest villains. Sweden, Australia and Canada were the
cleanest. But the United States ranked only 18th, in the middle of
the pack, a tad ahead of Chile. This corruption barometer is based
only on exports, not on the commonplace day-to-day political and
bureaucratic stealing that goes on behind closed doors in American
cities.
</P>
<P>
   It is one (useless) gesture to lecture other countries on human
rights; our record is better than most but not perfect. But when we
finish in the middle of the pack on export corruption, and when
there is a need for direct nonstop service to prison for elected
and appointed officials, perhaps we ought to think twice about our
``do as I say, not as I do'' predilection.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Headline goes here
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan may be anti-Semitic, but he's got chutzpah.
Imagine: Buchanan calling for ``racial reconciliation'' as he
declared for the Reform Party presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is the same Buchanan, now a newly apostate Republican,
who charmed the nation with his call at the 1992 GOP convention for
a domestic cultural and religious war _ and who, never mind the
absence of much in the way of a volunteer army, has in fact been
fighting one himself ever since.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Grand Conciliator who has been trying to provoke
blue-collar workers into a fight over trade policy with the
corporations they work for. The very same fellow whom conservative
William F. Buckley Jr. concluded, as just about everybody else has
by now, is anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   And the same who, ever rallying Americans against their
government, this year blisters the ``Washington elite'' as in 1995
he denounced ``Washington insiders'' _ although that's exactly what
Buchanan himself has been for 30 years, ever since his days as a
policy agitator and verbal gunsel for President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was reconciling us to one another just a few years ago
by kissing off Hispanic Americans as ``Jose.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely in the matter of race that Buchanan's call
for reconciliation is at its most
</P>
<P>
   jaw-dropping awesome. The man has spent decades eagerly
race-baiting.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his stabs at the Republican presidential nomination,
Buchanan went out of his way to visit the tomb of the unknown
Confederate soldier in Mississippi. He rhapsodized over the
Confederate battle flag and the Confederate ``cause.'' He promised
Tennessee voters he would ``settle accounts for our ancestors'' _
Buchanan had discovered a rebel great-grandfather _ ``with the
Yankees in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has consistently opposed and disparaged civil rights
legislation, and some years ago he called for annexing western
Canada so the United States could get more white people.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to let all this go, dismissing Buchanan, after
his years of off-and-on quixotic presidential ambition and stints
betwixt as a hired pop-off for CNN, as the fringe crank that a
growing number of voters recognize him as being.
</P>

killing any lingering efforts at affirmative action and sticking it

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Buchanan's chutzpah
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes headline, changes whom to who in third graf.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan may be anti-Semitic, but he's got chutzpah.
Imagine: Buchanan calling for ``racial reconciliation'' as he
declared for the Reform Party presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is the same Buchanan, now a newly apostate Republican,
who charmed the nation with his call at the 1992 GOP convention for
a domestic cultural and religious war _ and who, never mind the
absence of much in the way of a volunteer army, has in fact been
fighting one himself ever since.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Grand Conciliator who has been trying to provoke
blue-collar workers into a fight over trade policy with the
corporations they work for. The very same fellow who conservative
William F. Buckley Jr. concluded, as just about everybody else has
by now, is anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   And the same who, ever rallying Americans against their
government, this year blisters the ``Washington elite'' as in 1995
he denounced ``Washington insiders'' _ although that's exactly what
Buchanan himself has been for 30 years, ever since his days as a
policy agitator and verbal gunsel for President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was reconciling us to one another just a few years ago
by kissing off Hispanic Americans as ``Jose.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely in the matter of race that Buchanan's call
for reconciliation is at its most
</P>
<P>
   jaw-dropping awesome. The man has spent decades eagerly
race-baiting.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his stabs at the Republican presidential nomination,
Buchanan went out of his way to visit the tomb of the unknown
Confederate soldier in Mississippi. He rhapsodized over the
Confederate battle flag and the Confederate ``cause.'' He promised
Tennessee voters he would ``settle accounts for our ancestors'' _
Buchanan had discovered a rebel great-grandfather _ ``with the
Yankees in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has consistently opposed and disparaged civil rights
legislation, and some years ago he called for annexing western
Canada so the United States could get more white people.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to let all this go, dismissing Buchanan, after
his years of off-and-on quixotic presidential ambition and stints
betwixt as a hired pop-off for CNN, as the fringe crank that a
growing number of voters recognize him as being.
</P>
<P>
   But if Buchanan can rant his way to the Reform nomination, he'll
have access to $13 million in federal campaign funding. Never mind
whether his candidacy would hurt the Republican nominee by
attracting cultural reactionaries or the Democratic nominee by
luring working-class voters.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG THING?
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty years ago, the first movie ever to spin
through my newly purchased Sony VCR was ``This Is the Army,'' an
Irving Berlin 1943 Technicolor musical in which Ronald Reagan seeks
to bolster the war effort. The Betamax cassette, via mail order,
cost $99.95.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, I watched ``This Is the Army'' via the Internet
for free. The demo wasn't perfect. But it was like the story of the
talking dog: it may not have had much to say, but the important
thing is that it could talk at all.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next June, MeTV.com plans to transmit thousands of
flicks through cyberspace at $1.99 a pop. The people behind this
new venture know that few folks will want to view full-length
feature films on their monitors. So the movie rentals will come
with a wireless device that will beam them through walls or floors
into TV sets or home theater units.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Hollywood studios, it will be just another
distribution channel,'' said Martin French, MeTV's marketing
director. ``It will be possible,'' he claimed, ``for 100,000
viewers to see the same movie at home at the same time. No VCR
rental store can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there's a catch. For MeTV to do its thing, you'll
need an Internet link that's at least six times faster than today's
most common modems. And for the films to look and sound really
good, you'll need one, like mine, that's 16 times as fast as the
current standard.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, all signs indicate that these blazingly fast
pipelines into the home will be the Next Big Thing to hit the
Internet. Several recent studies predict that by 2002, upwards of
10 million U.S. homes will be equipped with so-called broadband
devices such as cable modems, digital subscriber lines, wireless
systems or satellite links.
</P>
<P>
   Video streaming technologies are still so novel that fewer than
50 outfits _ most of them relative unknowns, such as MeTV _ have
signed up for a Dec. 7 industry trade show in Silicon Valley. But
it should come as no surprise that Bill Gates will keynote this
event. Although the Microsoft chairman's image has reached mythic
heights, Gates has an ear to the ground for the Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lewis takes up much the same theme in his latest book,
``The New New Thing,'' (Norton) which seeks to capture the
millennial feel of Silicon Valley in the same sense that his former
best-seller, ``Liar's Poker,'' evoked the ethos of Wall Street in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In his preface, Lewis writes: ``The new new thing is a notion
that is a tiny push away from general acceptance and, when it gets
that push, will change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lewis sees it, that could be a radically different way of
delivering medical services to millions of Americans, one that
could shake up the nation's $1.3 trillion health care industry. Or
perhaps it could be Me-TV's vision of delivering razor-sharp movies
into millions of homes with a mouse click or two.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we haven't progressed much in making better movies
than ``This Is the Army.'' But then again, as Lewis notes,
``progress does not march forward like an army on parade; it crawls
on its belly like a guerrilla.''

   What color is the cosmos? Planets, nebulae and galaxies appear
wan and faint when eyed through a backyard telescope. But
researchers using imaging techniques show us a much more chromatic
view.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the colors in many familiar photographs of the
cosmos are fake. For more than 20 years, space agencies have
embellished images of the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the images have to be enhanced: Photos assembled from
wavelengths beyond the eye's perception have no color, so
researchers paint them anyway they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Venus, for example, has invisible cloud patterns that show up in
infrared photos; NASA depicts them in orange and blue.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, X-ray detectors reveal invisible galactic structures.
Researchers colorcode these features according to wavelength or
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   False color, for the sake of drama, got a lot of reinforcement
when the giant outer planets were photographed during the Voyager
mission in the late 1970s and 1980s. Researchers intensified color
and contrast to maximize detail, and the media fell in love with
the brilliant images.
</P>
<P>
   When Voyager 2 reached Neptune in 1989, the previously pale
planet was promoted to sky blue with red tinges. Uranus was _ and
still is _ presented as lime green.
</P>
<P>
   No scientific principles justify these embellishments; Uranus is
featureless. Without detail to enhance, the planet needed a rich
new color to get the attention of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Mars has been painted circus red instead of pale
pumpkin. And Jupiter's yellow-white bands and light-pink Red Spot
have been tweaked to orange and candy-apple red.
</P>
<P>
   Colorization is not confined to images from deep-space probes.
Consider the celebrated 1995 Hubble photo, dubbed Pillars of
Creation, by Jeff Hester and Paul Scowen of Arizona State
University. This vivid image of the Eagle nebula's spirelike
columns has graced the covers of astronomy magazines and has been
made into a hit poster.
</P>
<P>
   Through amateur telescopes these faint gas clouds appear gray
and unexciting. Larger instruments sometimes show such nebulae as
pale green because the retina responds to that tint in dim light.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, photography brings out a dominant red emitted by
the Eagle's hydrogen atoms. The universe is well stocked with these
lovely cherry-red nebulae, thanks to hydrogen's omnipresence.
</P>
<P>
   But such unvarying red can become tiresome after the first few
thousand light-years of cosmic inventory. To avoid such
monochromaticity, astronomers took separate pictures of the Eagle
through different filters. Coloring each image with brilliant tints
and bleeding them together yielded the spectacular hues of the
Pillars of Creation.
</P>
<P>
   Hester says his celebrated Hubble picture was merely intended to
bring out scientific detail. The real Eagle nebula, he surmises,
would look ghostly faint with pale, feeble colors. He calls his
work an ``artistic rendering of what the scientist sees.''
</P>
<P>
   Such artistic license is so commonplace that the presented
universe bears little resemblance to the real thing. Instead, we
have a cosmos in designer colors.

   What color is the cosmos? Planets, nebulae and galaxies appear
wan and faint when eyed through a backyard telescope. But
researchers using imaging techniques show us a much more chromatic
view.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the colors in many familiar photographs of the
cosmos are fake. For more than 20 years, space agencies have
embellished images of the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the images have to be enhanced: Photos assembled from
wavelengths beyond the eye's perception have no color, so
researchers paint them anyway they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Venus, for example, has invisible cloud patterns that show up in
infrared photos; NASA depicts them in orange and blue.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, X-ray detectors reveal invisible galactic structures.
Researchers colorcode these features according to wavelength or
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   False color, for the sake of drama, got a lot of reinforcement
when the giant outer planets were photographed during the Voyager
mission in the late 1970s and 1980s. Researchers intensified color
and contrast to maximize detail, and the media fell in love with
the brilliant images.
</P>
<P>
   When Voyager 2 reached Neptune in 1989, the previously pale
planet was promoted to sky blue with red tinges. Uranus was _ and
still is _ presented as lime green.
</P>
<P>
   No scientific principles justify these embellishments; Uranus is
featureless. Without detail to enhance, the planet needed a rich
new color to get the attention of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Mars has been painted circus red instead of pale
pumpkin. And Jupiter's yellow-white bands and light-pink Red Spot
have been tweaked to orange and candy-apple red.
</P>
<P>
   Colorization is not confined to images from deep-space probes.
Consider the celebrated 1995 Hubble photo, dubbed Pillars of
Creation, by Jeff Hester and Paul Scowen of Arizona State
University. This vivid image of the Eagle nebula's spirelike
columns has graced the covers of astronomy magazines and has been
made into a hit poster.
</P>

<P>
   He's handsome, he's gifted, he's smart, he's on the verge of
becoming a movie star. But Jeremy Northam would like to voice a
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that people see me as a contemporary guy _ as an
actor OR as a person,'' he laments.
</P>
<P>
   Northam, best known for his portrayals of repressed Englishmen
(``Emma,'' ``Carrington,'' ``The Winslow Boy,'' ``An Ideal
Husband''), is speaking in his perfectly cultivated British accent,
even though he's trying _ really trying _ to be colloquial.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get on my tits and take the piss out of the proper way
I talk,'' he says, ``as if I'm some dinosaur from some bygone
age.''
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that the 37-year-old actor was delighted to
rip off his waistcoat for ``Happy Texas,'' a comedy that was the
talk of last year's Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Northam stars as one of two American convicts who bust out of a
Texas jail. In an extreme case of mistaken identity, the men are
assumed to be a gay couple arriving in town to stage children's
beauty pageants.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that Northam has to do a working-class American
accent _ while convincing the town's closeted sheriff, William H.
Macy, that he wants to date him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he's trying to woo Ally Walker, who believes he's
gay.
</P>
<P>
   So how did writer-director Mark Illsley know that Northam could
veer so far from type?
</P>
<P>
   ``I cast Jeremy because of `Emma,''' Illsley says. ``He's an
actor who does wonderful things in a close-up. In the smallest
ways, he tells you so much. And I do think he was the most
courageous member of the cast: He had to play American and be
funny. He did it brilliantly. And he worked for no money! Only nice
people work for no money. Jerks will never do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Offscreen, Northam does seem like a completely modern, unstuffy
guy, dressed in a short-sleeved shirt, black jeans and
violet-tinted wire rims.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's humorously self-conscious about the danger of
appearing too effete, too British (``I notice if I even use the
words `theatrical' or `poetry' that they have funny overtones these
days,'' he says), he's also reluctant to embrace the role of a
rising Hollywood star. Gossip columns, he says, make him nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no desire to appear in columns that say `He was
there,''' he says. ``It's hard enough just being in a crowd like
the one at the Talk party in New York and being yourself. It's the
work that's the fun thing for me _ if I can say that without
sounding dull and overserious.''
</P>
<P>
   But poor Northam can't help it if he was raised to be a man of
substance. His father is a professor of literature at Cambridge,
and he got his acting chops at places like the Royal National
Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's played a couple of bad guys and heavies in American
films _ opposite Sandra Bullock in ``The Net'' and Sharon Stone in
the ``Gloria'' remake _ he didn't seem to have much fun doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep telling my agent I don't just want to play period
movies or bad guys anymore,'' Northam says.
</P>
<P>
   But he shyly admits he's about to do both _ in the same movie.
He'll be playing Nick Nolte's son-in-law in the Merchant Ivory
production of Henry James' densest novel, ``The Golden Bowl,''
alongside Anjelica Huston, Uma Thurman and Kate Beckinsale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it means going back to old Edwardian costume,'' Northam
says, smiling. ``But I am drawn, I have to admit, to the abstract
and the complicated. I like density of character _ not just a
reduction of motives to one simple thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his busy schedule, Northam says, his own life has
seemed somewhat one-dimensional lately; he's had no real home or
love life to speak of. But the recent death of his mother after a
long illness has made him realize it's time to consider settling
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to share the things I love,'' he admits. ``I'm
desperate for that now. But honestly, I've given up. Most of the
great women I meet are going out with the sexiest men in the world.
And when I go out with non-actresses, they're convinced all actors
are liars.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you convince women you're telling the truth?'' he
continues. ``I've given up now. As they say in London, I've done
myself up like a kipper _ smoked, flattened and tinned.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true Englishman. &QL;

<P>
   SAYING GOODBYE TO UNCLE WILT. Columnist Akilah Monifa remembers
the late Wilt Chamberlain and the legacy he left behind. ``He was
almost like a family member. Uncle Wilt was an integral part of my
family. We embraced him as a hero, just as much as we embraced Dr.
Martin Luther King,'' she writes. Monifa reflects on his
accomplishments, both on and off the court. ``Chamberlain was the
epitome of a strong, uncompromising black man ... Not only did we
perceive Chamberlain as physically dominant, he was also
intellectually dominant. He shattered stereotypes of the big,
stupid athlete. He was extremely articulate and outspoken.''
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA DREAMING AND THE GAY CIVIL-RIGHTS REALITY. California
has become the national front-runner in the march toward full
equality for lesbians and gays. Earlier this month, Gov. Gray Davis
signed into law three new pieces of gay civil-rights legislation.
One creates a statewide domestic partnership registry for same-sex
couples. Another law bans discrimination and harassment in public
schools and universities. A third law expands protection in
employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and adds
protection in housing. Gov. Davis says he wants ``a new California
based on hope instead of fear, tolerance instead of ignorance.''
``That sounds very Californian to me,'' columnist Chuck Colbert
writes, adding ``and quite all-American.''
</P>
<P>
   LEGALIZING THE ILLEGALS. Almost one-third of America's farm
workers are illegal aliens. Yet, due to stricter border
enforcement, the farm-worker labor pool is shrinking, and shortages
of workers are devastating many farm areas. Take, for example, the
San Joaquin Valley, where the most fertile eight counties in the
country suffered a shortage of 80,000 workers last year and
millions of dollars in rotted crops. Farmers and Congress are
working to produce new guest-worker programs that might alleviate
agricultural chaos in the future. A report by columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras.
</P>
<P>
   BILINGUAL EDUCATION CHALLENGED AGAIN. A movement to kill
bilingual education has begun in Arizona. Ron Unz, the Silicon
Valley businessman who fought and beat California's educational
establishment last year, is backing an initiative recently filed by
a Tucson-based group. Members of English for the Children-Arizona
want Latino students who are enrolled in bilingual education
classes to be transferred into a one-year English immersion
program. Unz hopes to get the Arizona initiative on the November
2000 ballot. The effort has frightened some education experts. ``If
polls can predict the future, then the initiative may pass and
affect the way more than 111,000 students with limited English
proficiency are taught,'' writes Rachel Ochoa in this editorial
from Hispanic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   SEN. HELMS' VINDICTIVE USE OF CONFEDERATE FLAG IS FOR REAL. Sen.
Jesse Helms has an agenda all his own, and he is prepared to
sacrifice the goals of his party and its presidential candidates to
his keep his fixations alive, writes columnist Vernon Jarrett.
Currently, Helms is after former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun,
President Clinton's nominee for ambassador to New Zealand. Helms
announced that he would block her appointment unless she apologized
for a speech she made six years ago on the Senate floor. Her speech
reversed the Senate's prior approval of a Helms-backed bill to
renew the design patent for the United Daughters of the
Confederacy. The Confederate war flag was the centerpiece of the
design. She also led the fight to defeat Helms' attempt to stop
renewal of funding for a commission established to promote
recognition of the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday. A
report.

   SEN. HELMS' VINDICTIVE USE OF CONFEDERATE FLAG IS FOR REAL. Sen.
Jesse Helms has an agenda all his own, and he is prepared to
sacrifice the goals of his party and its presidential candidates to
his keep his fixations alive, writes columnist Vernon Jarrett.
Currently, Helms is after former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun,
President Clinton's nominee for ambassador to New Zealand. Helms
announced that he would block her appointment unless she apologized
for a speech she made six years ago on the Senate floor. Her speech
reversed the Senate's prior approval of a Helms-backed bill to
renew the design patent for the United Daughters of the
Confederacy. The Confederate war flag was the centerpiece of the
design. She also led the fight to defeat Helms' attempt to stop
renewal of funding for a commission established to promote
recognition of the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday. A
report.

   SAYING GOODBYE TO UNCLE WILT. Columnist Akilah Monifa remembers
the late Wilt Chamberlain and the legacy he left behind. ``He was
almost like a family member. Uncle Wilt was an integral part of my
family. We embraced him as a hero, just as much as we embraced Dr.
Martin Luther King,'' she writes. Monifa reflects on his
accomplishments, both on and off the court. ``Chamberlain was the
epitome of a strong, uncompromising black man ... Not only did we
perceive Chamberlain as physically dominant, he was also
intellectually dominant. He shattered stereotypes of the big,
stupid athlete. He was extremely articulate and outspoken.''
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA DREAMING AND THE GAY CIVIL-RIGHTS REALITY. California
has become the national front-runner in the march toward full
equality for lesbians and gays. Earlier this month, Gov. Gray Davis
signed into law three new pieces of gay civil-rights legislation.
One creates a statewide domestic partnership registry for same-sex
couples. Another law bans discrimination and harassment in public
schools and universities. A third law expands protection in
employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and adds
protection in housing. Gov. Davis says he wants ``a new California
based on hope instead of fear, tolerance instead of ignorance.''
``That sounds very Californian to me,'' columnist Chuck Colbert
writes, adding ``and quite all-American.''
</P>
<P>
   LEGALIZING THE ILLEGALS. Almost one-third of America's farm
workers are illegal aliens. Yet, due to stricter border
enforcement, the farm-worker labor pool is shrinking, and shortages
of workers are devastating many farm areas. Take, for example, the
San Joaquin Valley, where the most fertile eight counties in the
country suffered a shortage of 80,000 workers last year and
millions of dollars in rotted crops. Farmers and Congress are
working to produce new guest-worker programs that might alleviate
agricultural chaos in the future. A report by columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras.
</P>
<P>
   BILINGUAL EDUCATION CHALLENGED AGAIN. A movement to kill
bilingual education has begun in Arizona. Ron Unz, the Silicon
Valley businessman who fought and beat California's educational
establishment last year, is backing an initiative recently filed by
a Tucson-based group. Members of English for the Children-Arizona
want Latino students who are enrolled in bilingual education
classes to be transferred into a one-year English immersion
program. Unz hopes to get the Arizona initiative on the November
2000 ballot. The effort has frightened some education experts. ``If
polls can predict the future, then the initiative may pass and
affect the way more than 111,000 students with limited English

 &HT;    Only good snakes are dead snakes
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I killed a snake in the yard the other day.
Guess that explains why the dogs were dancing around on their hind
legs and holding up their petticoats.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few days, they had been urgently trying to tell me
about the snake, but I thought they just wanted to come in the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Snakes, as you know, are all six feet long until they are killed
then they tend to shrink. This one shrank to about three feet.
</P>
<P>
   I follow the philosophy that the only good snake is a dead
snake. I probably ended up killing a snake that only eats fleas and
other snakes, but in the heat of the moment, I didn't take the time
to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked later if it had a triangular-shaped head. If a
snake has a tringular-shaped head that means it is either poisonous
or non-poisonous, I forget which.
</P>
<P>
   When I got around to looking at it, its head was shaped more
like a pancake from where I had been hitting it with the flat side
of a hoe.
</P>
<P>
   Is it me or is it the snakes? We just don't seem to get along.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of summers ago, I decided to clean out a storage
cabinet at an old lake house, and get rid of all the busted fishing
tackle, cans of rusted bolts and nails and an old black garden hose
that was rolled up in the back corner.
</P>
<P>
   I was up to my elbows in the cabinet pulling out junk and was
just about to grab that black hose when it started moving.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I started moving.
</P>
<P>
   I got as far away as I could as quickly as I could and wiped a
cold sweat off my forehead. To this day I still shiver at the
thought of that snake lying in wait for me to grab it.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I had composed myself and found a lethal weapon, the
snake had disappeared. I had violated the most sacred law of the
lake: Don't let a snake get away alive.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't about to go looking for a snake I didn't want to see in
the first place, so I closed the cabinet and put thoughts of
cleaning it up out of my mind.
</P>
<P>
   As for that snake I killed the other day, I like to think it was
the same one at the lake. It took him two years to track me down
and now the score has been settled. Snake, 0. Hoe, 1.

 &HT;    Immigrants flood clinics for legal aid
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mohammed Kanneh got up at 3:30 a.m. one recent Tuesday
and boarded a MARTA train in Doraville, Ga. By 5 a.m., he had
joined other immigrants lined up outside the office of Catholic
Social Services on West Peachtree Street in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   They were waiting for someone to open the door to one of two
places in metro Atlanta where large numbers of poor immigrants get
legal advice at little or no cost. Immigrants from Georgia, Alabama
and South Carolina travel to Atlanta all year to meet with lawyers
and paralegals at Catholic Social Services and the Latin American
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Both offices charge a nominal fee _ and sometimes nothing at all
_ to help immigrants deal with a variety of legal problems. The
Latin American Association gave advice to 5,700 immigrants in 1998;
Catholic Social Services saw about 3,400.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin American Association helps immigrants apply for
residency and citizenship. It also explains new laws and helps
immigrants who want to bring relatives to the United States.
Catholic Social Services provides similar services and also handles
requests for political asylum and regularly represents clients in
court.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of those seen at Catholic Social Services come on
Tuesdays and Thursdays, which are set aside for ``immigration
clinics.'' Staff, volunteer attorneys and paralegals at the clinic
advise immigrants on a first-come, first-served basis. Lines
usually form outside the door before sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't come early, you have to come back,'' said Kanneh,
a 33-year-old Liberian who waited in line from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Colussy, who runs the clinic, said workers see people with
all sorts of problems, ranging from a man who lost his green card
to a woman who asked for asylum after soldiers raped her, her
sister and mother and killed her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of any place that's a trouble spot that we
haven't seen people from,'' Colussy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday and Thursday clinics began in 1986, after Congress
granted amnesty to illegal immigrants who arrived here before 1982.
Colussy said many of the first clients entered the United States
illegally and came to the clinic after the law made it easier for
them to become U.S. citizens. The number of immigrants has risen
steadily through the years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kanneh is typical of the clients seeking help. He came to the
United States from Liberia in June with a visa issued so he could
negotiate with American businesses that sell forestry equipment.
Meeting with Robert Marshall, a lawyer who volunteers at the
clinic, he settled into a plastic chair and handed over a sheaf of
paper covered with neat handwriting in blue ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is my story from beginning to end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, this is good,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Kanneh, who belongs to a political party that opposes the
Liberian government, said he barely escaped a government attack in
April. He said he lived in a forest for five days on a diet of wild
fruit and water. When he got home, he said, his 6-year-old son was
dead and his wife was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall quizzed him to see whether he qualified for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you decide to leave? Was it because of the war or were
there people looking for you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people looking for me to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know you? How?''
</P>
<P>
   ``By name and face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are they?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The same people who killed my father.''
</P>
<P>
   As they spoke, voices drifted from the next cubicle in an office
humming with several languages. Agustin Galvez, an immigrant from
Guatemala, and Richard Goodlett, a paralegal for Catholic Social
Services were next door.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlett ran down a list of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never been deported?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never been ordered deported?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvez said he and his wife left Guatemala in 1989 after rebels
killed his brother-in-law, who was a police officer, and threatened
to kill him and his wife. They walked, hitchhiked and rode horses
through Mexico for two months. They entered the United States in
Arizona and spent a week in the desert with little food or water,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Georgia in 1992 and spends at least 60 hours a week
operating a machine in a Dalton carpet mill. He got up at 4:45 a.m.
on a recent Tuesday and drove to the clinic from Dalton. He lugged
a yellow bag with manila envelopes and accordion folders stuffed
with legal records _ a letter verifying his employment, W-2 tax
forms and a birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Galvez, who speaks fluent English, applied for asylum in 1990
and has legal permission to live and work in the United States
while his application is pending. He asked Goodlett whether he
qualified for permanent residency under a new law designed to help
victims of civil wars and political repression in his country and
El Salvador. Goodlett helped Galvez fill out a lengthy application
for residency.
</P>
<P>
   Before the law passed, people seeking asylum from Guatemala and
El Salvador, governed for years by right-wing, anti-Communist
governments, were successful far less often than refugees from Cuba
and Nicaragua, governed for years by Communist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Colussy's staff includes another attorney, two paralegals and an
office worker, but she also gets help from other attorneys who
volunteer. Pat Walsh, who was AT&AMP;T's chief counsel in Georgia and
13 other Southeastern states from 1983 to 1996, traded in a corner
office on the executive floor for a tiny office with a cheap desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``My desk used to be bigger than this office,'' he said with a
chuckle. ``This is training for submarine service.''
</P>
<P>
   He began volunteering in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more than I need, and there's an obligation, I feel, to
contribute in a down-to-earth and useful manner.''

 &HT;    Making a few celestial observations
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the Heart of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ One of my most vivid memories is of sitting
under the stars in Big Bend National Park, more than 20 years ago,
miles away from light pollution, lying flat on my back and staring
goggle-eyed at a sky that one sees all too rarely when living near
a city. My college buddy and I got into this weird riff about how
maybe the whole cosmos was a celestial planetarium in God's
library/study, that what we were seeing wasn't really light years
away, and maybe we were all in miniature _ lots of little
Lilliputians running about with our self-importance and sense of
worth.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe you had to be there _ young, foolish, under the
influence of cheap Mexican beer and unformed minds. Still, the
stars never fail to fascinate me, much like classical music does. I
rarely have a clue what I'm looking at or listening to, but most of
it engages the mind, though not enough for me to go to the effort
to learn more about it. One has to compartmentalize.
</P>
<P>
   So last week's trek to the Stephen F. Austin observatory was a
welcome field trip to a jewel hidden in these Piney Woods. I did a
story for the newspaper a couple of decades ago on the observatory,
the last time I visited. It was impressive then and even more so
now.
</P>
<P>
   The outing was planned by the Grand Poobah of our Nacogdoches
Tennis and Adult Beverage Porch and Deck Club. He runs the physics
department at SFA. Our tennis group has been getting together most
every Thursday night for seven or eight years to play what we call
old men's doubles tennis. That's somewhat of a misnomer since there
are a few female members who generally try not to humiliate us
graybeards too often _ just enough to keep us humble. We have a
rigid schedule: 90 minutes of tennis that is not intended to raise
one's pulse rate any more than, say, trying to dash to the car in
the rain, followed by 90 minutes of socializing at a member's
house, done on a rotating basis, with the schedule carefully
organized by the above-mentioned Grand Poobah. The man is a genius
at organization, and likely will serve as Grand Poobah for life.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to the observatory, we chowed down at a fish fry,
the fish coming from a recent nontennis outing by some members to
the Gulf Coast. I am unwilling to fish, not liking hooks, cleaning
fish or getting seasick, but I'm powerfully fond of eating fish.
You catch it, I'll eat it. That's my motto.
</P>
<P>
   Just after dark, we headed north to the observatory, tucked in
behind the experimental beef farm for a tour conducted by Norm
Markworth, the observatory director, who got a free meal out of the
deal in exchange for conducting the tour.
</P>
<P>
   The observatory boasts a 15-inch telescope, the largest between
McDonald Observatory in West Texas and the East Coast. Markworth
and associates helped build it. There are two other domed
observatories, and a concrete pad with stands for smaller
telescopes. Students had already set up the telescopes oriented
toward stellar attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Markworth first gave a fascinating tour of the sky above,
pointing out constellations with a flashlight that served
surprisingly well as a pointer. He admitted something I've always
wondered about. Hardly anybody sees a bull when they look at
Taurus, or a scorpion, or any of that stuff, save maybe the Big and
Little Dipper. Makes me wonder what those Greeks were smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Through the smaller scopes, one got an amazing glimpse of a
crescent moon, the craters crystal clear. For the first time I saw
Saturn and its rings outside of a photograph, and a hazy view of
Jupiter and one moon that I could pick out. On a computer screen
hooked to one of the big scopes, you could track an asteroid
discovered by an SFA astronomer.
</P>
<P>
   It was beautiful, eerie and fascinating all at once. That cosmos
I once watched while lying in the desert in Big Bend still may be
all one giant planetarium _ God's practical joke _ but that doesn't
make it any less interesting.
</P>
<P>
   I walked out the other night and stared at the sky, trying to
pick out the constellations Markworth pointed out with such
admirable ease. I live far enough out of town to have a decent view
of the sky, though nothing like at the observatory. I spotted the
Big Dipper after first finding the North Star. I'm still hunting
that danged scorpion.

 &HT;    Here's listening to you, kid
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The century was just 27 years old when the
movies learned to talk. The technological advance that allowed the
marriage of picture and sound opened a lot of doors and in many
ways, helped unite us.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the movies is an experience we share with people with
whom we might not otherwise have anything in common. I love movies
and always have.
</P>
<P>
   Movie scriptwriters have given us a cultural shorthand to
facilitate our communication. Movie dialogue can arouse an array of
reactions, from mirth to sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, I asked readers to search their memories and
send me quotes from the century. As I mentioned then, these quotes
don't have to be soaring oratory or rousing rhetoric. I asked for
quotes from the arts, entertainment as well as politics, but mostly
I asked for quotes from life in general.
</P>
<P>
   What I offer today is some of my favorite quotes from the
movies. As was with my previous selection of quotes, these are not
represented as comprehensive. This is a sampler of some of my
favorites. Please send me yours at PO Box 670, Austin, TX 78767 or
at the email address below.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's start at the beginning.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   _ Al Jolson speaking the first line in a sound picture, ``The
Jazz Singer'' (1927).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet your father spent the first year of your life
throwing rocks at the stork.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Groucho Marx to brother Chico in ``At the Circus,'' (1939).
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad always used to say that the only causes worth fighting for
were the lost causes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ James Stewart in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' (1939).
</P>
<P>
   Traveler: ``Is this a game of chance?''
</P>
<P>
   Twillie: ``Not the way we play.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Exchange between W.C. Fields as Cutberth J. Twillie and a
stranger asking about the poker game in progress. ``My Little
Chickadee'' (1940).
</P>
<P>
   ``As God is my witness, I'll never go hungry again.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Vivien Leigh ``Gone With the Wind'' (1939).
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.''

</P>
<P>
   _ Cary Grant in ``His Girl Friday'' (1940).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try
everything I can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Orson Welles in ``Citizen Kane'' (1941).
</P>
<P>
   Ugarte: ``You despise me don't you, Rick?''
</P>
<P>
   Rick: ``If I gave you any thought at all I probably would.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Exchange between Humphrey Borgart as Rick and Peter Lorre as
Ugarte in ``Casablanca'' (1942).
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne: ``Where were you last night?''
</P>
<P>
   Rick: ``That was so long ago I can't remember.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne: ``Will I see you tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   Rick: ``I never make plans that far ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Exchange between Bogart and Madeleine LeBeau as Yvonne in the
same movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be the day.''
</P>
<P>

advice for Travis County Democrats these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Marlon Brando in ``The Godfather'' (1972).
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if
they last long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   _ John Huston in ``Chinatown'' (1974).
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen, we have to protect our phoney baloney jobs!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mel Brooks in ``Blazing Saddles.''
</P>
<P>
   Darn, I just got warmed up and it's time to go, but you should

 &HT;    What seemed like cakewalk is about to get messy for Bush, Gore
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A funny thing is happening on the way to
anointment.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, the drive-through ATM candidate, is driving off
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates who could help get him nominated and/or
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, the automatic Democrat _ some would say automated _ has
another Demo model sharing his showroom, and party regulars are
looking it over.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not prepared to answer this, but: Is it possible that
invincibility could be the downfall of both?
</P>
<P>
   Surely not. Surely Bush and Gore will face each other in the
general election. They have amassed too much cash and name backing
not to.
</P>
<P>
   But they may get the scare of their lives in so doing. And at
some point they will curse Dame Invincibility for making things _
difficult?
</P>
<P>
   The case of Gore and Democratic challenger Bill Bradley is the
perfect example of what can be wrong with having too much momentum.
</P>
<P>
   We can't know what Gore was thinking when prospective Democratic
challengers dropped away: Richard Gephardt, Jesse Jackson, Bob
Kerrey. Maybe Gore felt elation and relief. On the other hand, when
the very solid Bradley stepped to the line, Gore instantly might
have gotten wistful for a crowded field, for a nettlesome Paul
Tsongas, a Tom Harkin, a John Kerry. Come one, come anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the more Democrats in the race, the more diluted
would be the ABG, or anybody-but-Gore, vote (more accurately, it's
the anybody-without-a-hint-of-Clinton's-aftershave vote.)
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Bradley is a mighty threat to Gore. Make no mistake.
And the New Hampshire primary looms like none other. Though he
trails nationwide, the ex-New Jersey senator leads Gore in New
Hampshire, according to a Quinnipiac College poll. Should Bradley
win Feb. 1 in New Hampshire or make it close, Gore's invincibility
will be out the door.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, the monstrous mountain of cash he's amassed is the
equivalent of having canceled half a dozen primaries, so rapidly
has it winnowed the Republican field. But that's not all good for
the Dub.
</P>
<P>
   As William Safire points out, having Elizabeth Dole on the
primary ballot was a way of splitting support of those GOP
moderates who see Bush as a question mark and who now might turn to
John McCain. Similarly, having Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander
jettisoned from the ballot means more face time for Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Having lots of names on primary ballots would have helped Bush
in dividing and conquering his GOP doubters. Now McCain is standing
as Bush's chief threat on an electability scale, while Forbes hangs
around to spend with dispatch and cast doubts about the
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   But the real curse of Invincibility, as pertains to the end
result of this whole exercise, may be in the Reform Party, where
contenders like Pat Buchanan, Donald Trump or maybe Ross Perot
again stand to siphon votes away from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion that a Reform candidate would hurt Gore and Bush
equally is hogwash. The Reform Party remains a refuge for the AWM,
the angry white male vote. A pivotal portion of that vote went to
Perot in 1996. Gore (or Bradley) would not expect to have any of it
in 1999. But Bush is _ was _ counting on every one.
</P>
<P>
   That Trump and Buchanan (and maybe Perot) appear ready to debate
and draw lots of attention to themselves means one of the two will
acquire stature and visibility among angry white males.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush hadn't appeared so invincible, Buchanan would have hung
around to pester him in the GOP primaries, not bolt to bleed
crucial ABG, AWM votes from him in the general election _ or to
make Trump look like Lancelot by contrast.
</P>
<P>
   What's a candidate to do? Even when invincible, sometimes you
just can't win.

   TEHRAN, Iran _ When student revolutionaries stormed the U.S.
Embassy here 20 years ago this week, Hossein Sarbazi was only 1
year old.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is a product of their revolution _ with a twist.

   He serves in the Revolutionary Guard forces established by the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He won a national championship in
wrestling _ Iran's number one sport.
</P>
<P>
   But far from mouthing the revolution's anti-American curses, he
dreams of attending Georgetown University in Washington. Waiting
for a bus last week in front of the old embassy, which now houses a
military high school and his wrestling club, Sarbazi said he hopes
for better relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they put an embassy here again,'' he said, showing a smile
beneath his Georgetown Hoyas ball cap, ``I assure you many young
people will come apply for visas.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the wooded embassy compound is still an emblem of two
countries that have not found common ground.
</P>
<P>
   The echoes of the embassy takeover, which turned into 14-month
hostage crisis, carry emotions and misconceptions that still
reverberate between the two nations. These days, as Iranians openly
and sometimes heatedly reassess the revolution, relations with the
United States are front-page news on an almost daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   The stubbornness of the impasse can be put in perspective this
way: During the last 20 years, the United States has opened an
embassy in Vietnam and Iran has traded official visits with its
former enemy in war, Iraq. But, Iran and the United States still
treat each other as foes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite U.S. oil companies' desire to start pumping in Iran
again, America maintains economic sanctions against Iran. And while
Iranians yearn for business with the world's biggest economy, Iran
continues to stoke anti-American sentiments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy takeover shocked America. It became a deciding
factor in an election _ Ronald Reagan's defeat of then-President
Jimmy Carter. It showed that fundamentalist religion, Islam, had
re-emerged in world politics. Americans also realized that their
Cold War support of dictators carried a high price.
</P>
<P>
   But for Iranians, it was so much more.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Islamic revolution's Boston Tea Party and Battle of
Bunker Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Ayatollah Khomeini called it ``the Second Revolution.'' The
hostage takers became heroes. Their actions the text of college
curricula.
</P>
<P>
   That was 20 years ago. These days, Iran is brimming with debate
about its future. Iranians seek to fit into the world community
without sacrificing its revolutionary identity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate pits the young, like Sarbazi, against the old, like
Mehdi Naeini, a 48-year-old owner of a crafts store across the
street from the old embassy. And America is at the heart of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the Americans who are making things tense,'' Naeini
said, ticking off a list offenses, most recently comments by U.S.
officials accusing Iran of supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Iranians, he blames the United States for the Iraqi
attack that lead to an eight-year war in the 1980s, killing
hundreds of thousands of Iranians. Murals of the martyrs are on
buildings throughout the country. In fact, the United States did
provide intelligence to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Naeini points to the embassy compound wall and notes that the
anti-American murals there were recently repainted.
</P>
<P>
   One reads, ``On that day (sic) U.S. would praise us we will
mourn.'' Another states, ``We will make America face a severe
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, between the hope of youth and the defiance of the
old guard, are many of the former hostage takers. Many are student
extremists-turned-moderates, who say relations with the United
States are desirable, as long as America treats Iran as an equal.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, was a leader of the students who
stormed the embassy and is now a 44-year-old Tehran city council
member who has been physically attacked for his moderate views.
</P>
<P>
   He does not regret the embassy takeover, but has invited former
hostages to return as guests to his country. America and Iran, he
said, do not have to sacrifice their identities to renew relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary to forget the past to build a future,'' he
said. ``We have to accept realities and the future should be built
on facts.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   To him, there was no alternative to the events of Nov. 4, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years before, Carter visited Mohammad Reza Pahlavi _
the detested but U.S.-backed Shah of Iran _ and declared Iran ``an
island of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later there was an upsurge of riots against the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations, street-fighting and murderous reprisals from the
Shah's troops resulted in the return from exile of respected cleric
Khomeini. The Shah fled in February. When Carter allowed him into
the United States for medical treatment, students took to the
streets again.
</P>
<P>
   They marched to the embassy, cut through the gate and
overwhelmed the small security contingent. They expected a siege of
just a few days. Surely, they mistakenly thought, the U.S. would
relinquish the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   But, U.S. officials reacted instead with economic sanctions and
the takeover turned into a stand-off that captured the Iranian
imagination. It provided an opportunity for Khomeini's
fundamentalists _ overshadowing revolutionaries seeking a secular
government _ to energize and unify their supporters around
opposition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 52 American hostages were held for 444 days and
released the day Reagan took office. By then, it was branded into
the identity of the new Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part of the sacred tenets of the revolution,'' said
Iranian political scientist Hadi Semati. ``It is still seen as
current and is very hard to analyze objectively.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Iranians are doing a lot of analyzing these days.
</P>
<P>
   They have gone through the war with Iraq, experienced 20 years
of sacrifice and strict Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
   Though still widely revered, the charismatic Khomeini has been
dead for 10 years. More than half the country's 63 million people
were born after the revolution. They never knew the Shah or his
American patrons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Iranians shocked the world again. They voted 70 percent
to 30 percent to make underdog Ayatollah Mohammad Khatami
president. He promised economic progress and more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But, the country's most powerful person remains Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He controls the army and courts.
</P>
<P>
   A sometimes-violent tug-of-war is underway and at times it seems
Iran has two governments. Reformers have opened hundreds of
newspapers and slightly loosened strict Muslim codes. Conservatives
have closed papers and even killed a few critics of religious rule.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, Iranians live firmly in the modern age. Many have
Internet access. They watch satellite dish broadcasts, though
dishes are technically illegal. The oil-driven economy has been
growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
   But, the population and unemployment are growing faster still
and people yearn for a prosperity many believe can only come with
the end of the U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   There have been tentative steps by both sides. Last year,
Khatami called for more cultural exchange and a ``dialogue of
civilizations.'' That was probably as far as he could go without
inflaming the powerful clerics.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has praised Khatami and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has acknowledged that Iran has
``grievances'' against the U.S. support of the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have long lists of demands. American officials call
on Iran to end its support of terrorist groups, drop its opposition
to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, stop developing weapons
of mass destruction and improve its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, Iranians say that the U.S. Congress has sent
money to the Iranian opposition, a group responsible for
assassinations of Iranian officials. They argue that they are not
developing weapons of mass destruction and that U.S. officials do
not object to Israel's nuclear arsenal or Egypt's chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians call for the United States to drop economic sanctions
and stop trying to discourage other countries from dealing with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   They also call on the United States to release billions of
dollars in Iranian assets and drop opposition to a proposed oil
pipeline through Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But, relations are still marked by missed or poorly sent
signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental problem in American policy is the fact that
they don't realize how their policies are perceived here,''
political scientist Semati said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, analysts expect progress to be slow. Iran has
parliamentary elections in February and the U.S. elections follow
in November. Candidates in neither country want to be seen as soft
on their nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also note, however, that America could use a friend
next to troubled Pakistan, anarchic Afghanistan and rebellious
former Soviet satellites. By comparison, Iran is peaceful and
appears to be moving toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Revolutionary Guard Sarbazi said he got hooked on the
Georgetown Hoyas while watching the school's basketball team on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 60 to 70 percent of Iranians want to have relations
with America,'' he said. ``I am for relations of all kinds _
political, economic.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he fears his position could get him in trouble, he
gives an answer that bodes well for democracy as well as relations
with America: ``I don't care. I believe what I want to.''

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ As a revolutionary 20 years ago, Iranian Mohammad
Ebrahim Asgharzadeh considered it an obligation to take over the
U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Now a popular Tehran city councilman, he is in the forefront of
Iran's reformers. He says it may be time _ given the right terms _
for the two countries to resolve their disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were forced to take over the embassy,'' Asgharzadeh said
recently from his wood-paneled office in Tehran city hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reaction. The Shah going to the U.S. was not
acceptable to us,'' Asgharzadeh said. ``We had to make claims
against what he had done.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Asgharzadeh looks more yuppie than rebel. He's a
trim 44 year-old with salt and pepper gray hair. In his
wood-paneled city hall office last week, he wore a wool sport
jacket, slacks and argyle socks.
</P>
<P>
   He has three children and had to give up his executive post at a
steel company to take office.
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh does not speak for all the hostage takers. Numbering
about 300, they represent the spectrum of opinions in Iran's
current political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some are still ardent defenders of Iran's strict religious rule
and defiance of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   But, Asgharzadeh is one of several former embassy stormers
supporting Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's efforts to open up
the country's economy and strengthen its democracy. Those are just
the moves western leaders look for.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has come from just the types of religious hardliners
who the embassy takeover helped strengthen amid anti-American
fervor. The hardliners, seeking to maintain strict religious
control over government, appear to fear that reformers like
Asgharzadeh could dilute their power.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, shortly after Asgharzadeh used the 19th
anniversary of the takeover to invite former hostages back to
visit, he was badly beaten by a gang. The attackers may have been
trying to keep him from running for the city council.
</P>
<P>
   But, Asgharzadeh is not the only former hostage-taker to speak
out. Abbas Abdi, met publicly with former hostage Barry Rosen last
year in Paris. According to Rosen, Abdi apologized for the personal
pain he caused Rosen and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Abdi were idealists. They were young and they
believed in the Islamic revolution. They believed it was the birth
of a new freedom for them,'' Rosen said. ``Over the years, they
came to realize it was the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh denies that he has changed or mellowed, saying he
has just acted realistically with the changing times.
</P>
<P>
   As a student, he was active in the revolution that overthrew the
dictatorial Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Shah.
</P>
<P>
   When President Jimmy Carter agreed to let the Shah enter the
United States for medical treatment, Asgharzadeh was among a small
group of leaders who organized the embassy takeover. He became the
group's spokesman but says now that he had no idea the hostage
crisis would last for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not possibly predict what would be the main result
and the reaction,'' he said. ``We just wanted to do something, some
kind of a student movement. It was very unprofessional and
amateur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We imagined that the U.S. would return the Shah to us and that
would finish the crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Shah should have faced the same fate as former
Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, who may face a trial for
massive human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh describes a spiral of miscalculations on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   He said the students were quickly disappointed that students in
the United States did not seem sympathetic to their cause. In the
wake of the embassy takeover, he said, the public in Iran and the
United States unified around their country's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, the Carter administration escalated the
tensions and prolonged the crisis with economic sanctions and a
failed rescue attempt in the desert. Many in Iran think the landing
in the desert was an attempt to topple Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
and reinstate the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh continues to be a stern critic of U.S. policy today,
saying America still seems arrogant in its dealing with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. believes that it is the winner of the Cold War, and
if this image will be the basis of its foreign policy with Europe,
the Pacific Rim countries, countries like Iran, they will have
problems,'' he said. ``It disgraces a nation to be put down and
threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the intense animosities of the embassy crisis have
waned and public opinion has become more varied in both Iran and
the United States. That, he said, provides an opportunity for
Khatami to attempt to appeal to the American public and Clinton to
approach the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public opinion and emotions among our peoples would be derived
from the behavior and decision-making of our officials,'' he said.
``A relationship should be based on mutual respect and recognition
of each country's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Asgharzadeh concludes, that America is a world
power that Iran cannot ignore and Islamic Iran has emerged as a
power that America cannot ignore _ regardless of their history of
enmity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessary to forget about the past to be able to
build a future,'' he said. ``We have to accept what has happened in
reality and the future should be built on facts.''

   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala _ The candidates have blanketed the
airwaves with television and radio commercials, and plastered the
countryside with billboards and banners. Teams of their supporters
caravan almost daily through the major cities, loudspeakers blaring
catchy campaign songs.
</P>
<P>
   But away from the small crowds that gather to hear a candidate
belt out his speech, everyday citizens don't hold out much hope
that the upcoming Nov. 7 presidential elections will bring dramatic
change to this troubled Central American nation.
</P>
<P>
   With only a few free elections under their belt after a
long-running civil war left thousands dead, kidnapped or missing,
most people here are loathe to discuss politics at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that just a few years ago, saying the
wrong thing could get you killed,'' said an office manager in her
20s who insisted on anonymity. ``It is better now than before, but
people are still very insecure.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three years ago, hope blossomed in this nation of 11
million when the government and leftist guerrillas signed peace
accords ending the 36-year-old civil war, which left about 200,000
Mayan peasants dead.
</P>
<P>
   The United States _ which earlier this year, was blamed by a
Guatemalan truth commission for supporting the military's campaign
of terror that caused many of the deaths _ stepped in with
international development banks to pledge $2 billion to support the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   But little has been done to institute reforms called for in the
peace agreement, allowing the country's notoriously inefficient
bureaucracy, corrupt judiciary and entrenched military to keep
their hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   The as-yet unsolved murder of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Jose
Gerardi, an outspoken human rights crusader killed in April 1998
after releasing a report blaming the military for many abuses, has
also left a chill. In early October, the prosecutor assigned to the
case resigned and fled the country after receiving death threats.
</P>
<P>
   Observers fear Guatemala hasn't yet emerged fully from the
troubling shadows of fear, corruption and murder that veiled it for
so many decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as Guatemalans must admit to ourselves that we have failed
miserably in building solid institutions _ judiciary, economic and
social _ to counter-balance the arbitrariness heretofore
characteristic of our manner of governing,'' wrote Luis Figueroa, a
columnist for The Siglo News, Guatemala's largest English-language
newspaper. ``We have spent much energy in the creation of
governments of men, instead of governments of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The men who want to take the reins for the next era are an
interesting mix.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show the frontrunner is Alfonso Portillo of the
Guatemalan Republican Front, who is favored by 48 percent of
respondents in the latest survey. Guatemala City Mayor Oscar Berger
of the National Advancement Party trails with 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To many, Portillo's solid lead is a sign of just how troubled
Guatemala's political scene still is: in September, he admitted
killing two men in Mexico in the early 1980s, saying it was an act
of self-defense after a heated argument. He fled Mexico and was
never prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Such an admission might be enough to sink the candidacy of a
presidential hopeful in most countries. Instead, Portillo's stock
has risen, as he has boasted the killings prove his decisiveness
and courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as I defended my life, I would defend the lives of
Guatemalans,'' Portillo told supporters in his trademark gravelly
voice, which has earned him the nickname, ``the Husky Chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Portillo is seen by many as a front man for Gen. Efrain Rios
Montt, a former dictator who ran the country for a year after a
military coup in 1983. Conducting a scorched-earth campaign against
the guerrillas, Rios Montt's regime allegedly destroyed dozens of
rural villages and executed thousands of suspected guerrilla
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time dictator tried to run for president himself in
1995, but was ruled ineligible by the judiciary because of his
participation in the 1983 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Portillo also ran in 1996, but lost to former Guatemala City
Mayor Alvaro Arzu of the National Advancement Party, a coalition of
conservative business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Now Berger is trying to repeat Arzu's feat, vaulting from the
mayorship of the country's largest city to the presidency. He is
campaigning on his record of infrastructure improvements in the
city _ new highways, bridges and other public works _ as well as a
promise to fight crime and increase foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Running a distant third is Alvaro Colom Caballeros, who
represents a leftist coalition that includes the former guerrillas.
Colom has gained a bit recently in polls but still hasn't managed
to top 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With eight other minor candidates running, the election could go
to a Dec. 26 run-off between the top two vote-getters.
</P>
<P>
   The winner faces serious problems. Guatemala suffers widespread
unemployment, stunning poverty, poor health-care, and woefully
inadequate education and sanitation systems for most areas outside
the major cities. United Nations statistics list about 85 percent
of the population as impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   Residents cite those problems, along with a disturbing crime
wave, as their greatest concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unemployment causes the robberies because if people can't
find work, they will steal to feed their families,'' said Eva de
Lorenzi, a teacher who lives near the capital. ``I think most
people won't even vote for president because they are not
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   A referendum in the spring on important constitutional reforms
mandated by the peace accords drew only 18 percent of the country's
4.5 million registered voters. The reforms failed to win a
majority, leaving the status of the peace agreements up in the air
until a new president is elected.
</P>
<P>
   In still another sign of Guatemala's shaky status, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended earlier this month that a
U.N. military observer force overseeing the implementation of the
peace accords extend its mission for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Annan cited Guatemala's failure to carry out judicial, electoral
and fiscal reforms as reasons for the extension.
</P>
<P>
   With so much riding on the elections, citizens _ at least those
who can afford to focus on something more than the daily struggle
for survival _ are surprisingly resigned. Many say it makes little
difference which candidate prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are very much better than during the civil war because
there is no terror or destruction,'' said Lorenzi. ``But people
still don't have confidence in the government or the police. We
need to educate ourselves. We aren't used to living in a
democracy.''

 &HT;    THE CRISIS THAT HELD AMERICA HOSTAGE 20 YEARS AGO
 &HT;    With IRAN-$ADV31.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (k) Commentary categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For two weeks, U.S. diplomats watched from their
office windows at the American Embassy in Tehran as hundreds of
militant Iranian college students gathered each day on
Takht-e-Jamshid Avenue to chant ``Margh Bar Amerika'' _''Death to
America.'' But on that drizzly Sunday morning, the crowd seemed to
be in a particularly ugly mood.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 10:30 on Nov. 4, 1979, their worst fears were realized:
With bolt-cutting shears, a vanguard snipped the chains that
clasped the iron gates while others stormed over the 10-foot
concrete wall. Soon, students were swarming through the 27-acre
manicured grounds. Flak-jacketed Marines sought to hold back the
rampaging mob with tear gas grenades, but they were soon routed.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the diplomats and their security detail were bound
with tape and blindfolded. As TV images of the takeover circled the
globe, the United States began a prolonged ordeal, whose impact is
still being felt today.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, those events permanently eroded the presumed
sanctity of diplomatic immunity. But, more broadly, during the 444
days that the hostages were held captive, America's self-image, as
well as the nation's prestige abroad, plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the public, Iran became a metaphor for everything,'' said
Gerald Rafshoon, then-President Jimmy Carter's media adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance changed to obsession, as Americans found themselves
checking their atlases and tracking the story so closely that the
names and views of the most obscure Iranian mullahs became
household names.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his poll numbers initially surged, Carter made what
turned out to be a fatal error: stating at the outset that his
primary concern was bringing the hostages home alive. By placing
the value of the hostages' lives above all else, Carter himself
became a kind of hostage to an angry public, a setting that would
haunt him throughout his re-election bid and eventually drive him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Fed by a ravenous press corps, the hostage mania proved in time
to be more harmful to long-term U.S. interests than shocking events
in far-off Iran.
</P>
<P>
   For a subsequent generation of Americans, the collapse of the
Soviet Union and the emergence of the United States as the world's
unchallenged pre-eminent power has removed much, if not all, of the
lingering sting. But in many European and Asian capitals, it is
still widely believed that U.S. foreign policy remains crippled,
especially in the Middle East, by the hostage trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Concluded political analyst Daniel Pipes: ``The United States
paid in many ways for the emotionalism of its leaders. Officials
devoted so much time to this issue that their attention to matters
of greater significance was much reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Soviet troops occupied neighboring
Afghanistan, the president remained so consumed by the hostage
crisis that he was unable to act decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Carter resisted pressure to bomb Tehran, unlike
President Clinton who earlier this year approved the American-led
bombardment of Belgrade. One major difference: Carter lacked the
``smart bombs'' that NATO allies could deploy to cherry-pick
targets in the Serbian capital.
</P>
<P>
   When the crisis over Kosovo erupted, former presidential adviser
David Gergen noted: ``The temptation again is to make it an
obsession. And you can't allow that to happen, because it will
suddenly begin to drive your policy in ways that are very
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 4:30 in the morning in Washington when word of the
hostage taking first reached Hamilton Jordan, the president's chief
of staff. Jordan's immediate fear was that it would trigger a war
with revolutionary Iran, incensed because Carter had granted
sanctuary in New York to the ailing deposed Shah.
</P>
<P>
   War didn't come. But neither did a settlement _ at least not
until Jan. 20, 1981, the day Carter left Washington. Ronald Reagan
had been president for 20 minutes when the remaining 52 hostages
flew off to a U.S. military hospital in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the hostage crisis of 1979 gave rise to that
peculiar agony, increasingly familiar to Americans in subsequent
decades, which arises after a major terrorist strike. It is an
agony born of great power, coupled with the knowledge of how little
at times it can accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials empathized with the victims, heightening the sense
of crisis. Passengers of a downed Korean 747 receive more attention
than tens of thousands of Afghan peasants because Americans can
picture themselves sitting in a Boeing jet; similarly, fellow
bureaucrats can see themselves in an embassy surrounded by an
agitated mob.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were matters helped by a fierce policy dispute between
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's activist national security adviser,
and the late Cyrus Vance, who as secretary of state, argued that
diplomacy could resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As historian Douglas Brinkley has written: ``For nearly a year
the crisis handcuffed the administration, which tried everything it
could think of to end the standoff: suspending oil imports,
freezing Iranian assets, expelling Iranian diplomats, imposing
economic sanctions, even conducting clandestine negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, a former naval officer, hoped to repeat the
success of an Israeli commando raid that had freed 103 airline
passengers at Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976. But the U.S. operation
proved a humiliating failure.
</P>
<P>
   As Brinkley noted: ``After the aborted rescue attempt, many
believed that Carter had not only tarnished the nation's honor but
lost control of his own administration in the process. Critics
condemned him for failing to mount a rescue operation sooner, for
not putting enough military hardware into it once he did act, and
then for retreating at the first sign of hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Brzezinski had counseled Carter to bomb Tehran if the rescue
mission caused the deaths of would-be rescuers, hostages and
captors. Although no such attack took place, Vance quit in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Many years after the fact, Carter told reporters that he still
believed he could have been re-elected if he had bombed Tehran
until the hostages were released or incinerated along with the
entire Iranian government. But that kind of ground-zero solution
was morally repugnant to Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of grumbles about my handling of the hostage
crisis,'' he said in looking back, ``but not a single responsible
politician offered a more realistic alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   An echo of such internal quarrels could be heard in Clinton's
1998 decision to launch a cruise missile attack against a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in a bid to punish Osama bin Laden,
the Islamic militant blamed for blowing up two American embassies
in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Brzezinski is hardly alone in believing that the Iran
hostage crisis crushed Carter's prestige. ``I think it was
devastating,'' he said. ``The Iran hostage crisis was one of the
two central reasons for Carter's defeat in 1980, the other reason
being domestic inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Brzezinski contends that the events in Iran heightened
the nation's sense of vulnerability, particularly in the Middle
East. ``Once the Iranian pillar had collapsed, we were faced with
the possibility that one way or another, before too long, we may
have either a hostile Iran on the northern shore of the Persian
Gulf facing us, or we might even have the Soviets there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another lasting legacy of the crisis is ABC's ``Nightline,'' the
media grand-daddy of today's saturation coverage, on cable networks
and the Internet, that arises whenever news blow-outs occur.
</P>
<P>
   Neither medium existed when Roone Arledge, the innovator of ABC
News, created ``America Held Hostage'' to track the crisis in
depth.
</P>
<P>
   When Frank Reynolds left in December to cover the presidential
campaign, his role was taken up by Ted Koppel, the network's
diplomatic correspondent. In time, Koppel began anchoring
permanently, with the renamed ``Nightline'' premiering on March 24,
1980. It remains a stable of light-night TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some grudges that Americans seem to nurse longer
than others,'' Koppel said. ``Lord knows this program no doubt
contributed to that mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the days before it was known as 'Nightline,' when it
was still called 'America Held Hostage,' we tagged a number on the
back, indicating just how many days it had been since the Ayatollah
Khomeini's followers first seized the embassy in Tehran . . . Many
people probably still remember it as the program that highlighted
the indignity and humanized a situation far removed from most of
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking back on the program's first decade, Koppel once
reflected: ``What will never change is that hostages are by
definition a tremendous emotional and explosive domestic issue.
Ideally _ and this sounds very callous _ a president ought to be
able to say, 'We aren't going to deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter did not.
</P>

Washington Bureau, covered the Carter White House and Iranian
hostage crisis.)

 &HT;    Elizabeth Dole may be running for vice president, but not on
Bush ticket
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Now Elizabeth Dole's campaign for vice president
can get rid of its camouflage and get into high gear. That's almost
certainly what she was running for anyway, though it's possible she
actually thought she could be elected president. After all, her
husband had.
</P>
<P>
   But she found out that her name identification, borrowed from
hubby Bob, was no match for George W. Bush's, borrowed from his
dad. Hers didn't carry with it anywhere near the goodwill, the
contacts or especially the fund-raising network that the Texas
governor enjoyed. And she also found that being head of the Red
Cross had very little crossover value into politics.
</P>
<P>
   A similar dose of reality leading up to the 1994 Texas
governor's race had caused several qualified would-be candidates
for the GOP nomination to back out _ including Tom Luce of Dallas
and Rob Mosbacher Jr. of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Both had run statewide before, and both wanted to run for
governor. But they had sense enough to know that running against
the namesake of a former president and vice president of the United
States would pit them against huge inherited name identification
and fund-raising base. They bit their tongues and chose not to run.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, George W. Bush ran for governor of Texas in 1994 not
because he should be governor, but because he could be. No public
record, no previous elected office. Just Daddy's name and friends.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say he didn't run a good campaign to unseat
Democrat Ann Richards, or that he hasn't proven that he is capable
of being governor. But that's not why he was capable of winning the
job. He knows it, you know it, and the American people know it.
</P>
<P>
   George the Younger had not just the advantage of his father's
name but also the organization that his father had mustered by
being on the national ballot every presidential election from 1980
through 1992. The national press seemed somewhat blown away that
the Texas governor's first trips to Iowa and New Hampshire in June,
after the spring legislative session in Texas, came off so well.
But he had the advantage of precision advance work from some of the
same people who'd done it for his dad.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, George the Younger has capitalized on the
combination of his own time as governor of the nation's second most
populous state and his status as former First Son to court other
Republican governors, plus a huge number of state legislators and
congressman. In a well-choreographed succession that must have been
torture for the other Republican presidential hopefuls, Bush has
day after day, week after week, added elected officials with
political organizations to his endorsement list.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to a huge amount of money, and after awhile, it becomes
so overwhelming that even Elizabeth Dole figures out it's time to
head for the sidelines, and get back to hoping to be nominated for
the vice presidential slot her husband was 23 years ago. It was not
a good sign when more women at the National Federation of
Republican Women in Seattle recently said they preferred Bush to
her.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the only major issue on which she's differed with
George W. is gun control _ she's for it, he's against it _ she's
unlikely to be Bush's choice for the second slot.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Doles and Bushes, even though they pay lip service to
each other, have never had a mutual admiration society.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, unlike the situation when Ronald Reagan picked the
elder Bush as his running mate in 1980 after they'd opposed each
other in the primaries, the elder Bush's showing had been good
enough that Reagan considered him an addition to the ticket _
despite Bush's characterization of Reagan's balanced budget promise
as ``voodoo economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Third, and most important, Elizabeth Dole is, to use her
husband's words, ``a bridge to the past.'' Assuming George W. wins
the nomination, he can pick whomever he wants as his running mate.
And if he should choose a woman, he'd be more likely to go for
someone like New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who's proven
herself electorally.
</P>
<P>
   So even thoughshe's now got nothing left but the VP track, even
though George W. says nice things about her, don't expect her to be
on the ticket.

 &HT;    `1,000-watt' girls about to be rediscovered
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Radiophiles, make sure you tune into National Public
Radio's ``All Things Considered'' on Friday. The provocative
news/features show has uncovered a long-lost creation of legendary
Sun Records founder Sam Phillips _ and it's not Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost and Found Sound'' will feature the story of the nation's
first all-female radio station, WHER-AM in Memphis. From 1955 to
1971, the ``beautiful 1,000-watt station,'' as it billed itself,
was on the air with a staff of permed and perky women at the mike,
playing the lush music of Dean Martin, Dinah Washington, Frank
Sinatra, Henry Mancini and Percy Faith.
</P>
<P>
   WHER was the brainchild of Phillips, who hatched the idea of an
``all-girl'' radio station as a novelty a year after he signed
Elvis Presley to a recording contract. While the King was wiggling
his leg on Union Street at Sun, WHER was broadcasting from a
control room decorated to look like a pastel beauty salon. They
called it ``The Doll Den.'' An early investor was Memphis, Tenn.,
millionaire Kemmons Wilson, who founded the Holiday Inn chain and
loaned WHER space at his third motel for its studios.
</P>
<P>
   To find talent, Phillips and Wilson eavesdropped on public
conversations, looking for women ``who spoke in pleasant tones with
good diction.'' WHER went off the air just as the women's movement
was breaking down gender doors in broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the station was largely forgotten. Then NPR producers
Nikki Silva and Davia Nelson overhead Phillips talking about WHER.
Intrigued, they tracked down the original station announcers,
programmers, saleswomen and program directors, who are interviewed
on the show. They also chat with Phillips, as well as play vintage
commercials and station air checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been one of the most amazing stories we've
unearthed,'' Nelson said.

   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala _ On Nov. 7, Guatemala will hold its
first presidential elections since the 1996 signing of peace
accords which ended the nation's 36-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The leading candidates include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ALFONSO PORTILLO, Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG) _ Portillo
leads in most opinion polls, despite his controversial admission in
September that he killed two men in Mexico in 1982 while working
there as a law professor. Portillo insists he acted in
self-defense, but he left Mexico without being prosecuted. Many see
Portillo, who ran unsuccessfully in 1996, as a front-man for former
dictator Gen. Efrain Rios Montt. Montt led the country during a
bloody period in 1983 that saw dozens of rural villages destroyed,
and thousands of alleged guerrilla sympathizers executed.
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR BERGER, National Advancement Party (PAN) _ Berger has been
highly popular in his four-year term as mayor of Guatemala City,
the national capital, concentrating on road construction and other
infrastructure improvements. He represents the conservative
business class, but has been hurt recently by perceived
conflicts-of-interest in the sale of the state telephone company to
a group of investors associated with his party. He hopes to succeed
current president Alvaro Arzu, the PAN candidate who defeated
Portillo in 1996, but Berger trails Portillo by about 10 percentage
points in most polls. No party in Guatemalan history has won two
presidential elections in a row.

   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ I killed a snake in the

past few days, they had been urgently trying to tell me about the
snake, but I thought they just wanted to come in the house. Snakes,

rarely when living near a city. My college buddy and I got into
this weird riff about how maybe the whole cosmos was a celestial
planetarium in God's library/study, that what we were seeing wasn't
really light years away, and maybe we were all in miniature _ lots
of little Lilliputians running about with our self-importance and

 &HT;    Colts' Manning says he strives to be like Aikman
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ After Peyton Manning finishes his career 10 or
12 years from now, after he smashes dozens of NFL passing records,
after he etches his name in history as one of the greatest
quarterbacks ever, he wants to be compared favorably with one man.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman represents everything that Manning strives to be with the
Indianapolis Colts. Aikman probably will never set any meaningful
league passing marks, but three Super Bowl rings have established
him as a champion in Manning's 23-year-old eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For any young quarterback coming into the game, Troy Aikman's
career is the one you want to have,'' Manning said Wednesday. ``He
was a No. 1 draft pick, just like me. Troy is in the game for the
long haul. And both of us struggled in our first seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman and Manning will meet for the first time Sunday afternoon
at the RCA Dome. The Dallas-Indianapolis game will showcase the
past and future of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   It is only natural to compare Aikman and Manning. When Aikman
was drafted in 1989, the Cowboys were 1-15, and he was injured
during the team's only victory, over Washington. Manning fared only
slightly better as a rookie, leading the Colts to a 3-13 record
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and how long did it take before Troy and the Cowboys won
a Super Bowl?'' Manning said. The Cowboys won the 1993 Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys and Colts are compared regularly because each team
has been built around three kings. The Aikman-Emmitt Smith-Michael
Irvin trio is the biggest reason the Cowboys already have been
dubbed the team of the decade. In Indy, there are predictions that
the Manning-Edgerrin James-Marvin Harrison trio will rule the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to disagree? In the latest AFC statistics, Manning ranks
third in passing, James is second in rushing and Harrison is second
in receptions. Manning is second in touchdown passes and Harrison
is first in touchdown catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all built around Peyton,'' said James, a rookie running
back from Miami. ``You have to do everything around him, because
he's the one who's pulling the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning's progress is one reason the Colts might be the league's
most improved team. They are 4-2 heading into Sunday and looking to
reach the playoffs for the first time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   With Manning, James and Harrison, the Colts have a blueprint
that looks remarkably similar to the one Tom Landry and Jimmy
Johnson unfolded more than a decade ago. Irvin was Landry's final
first-round draft pick, and Johnson drafted Aikman and Smith in the
first round the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts' architect is team president Bill Polian, who built
the Buffalo Bills as the team's general manager in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody questioned the Colts for drafting Harrison four years ago
and Manning last year. Both had solid credentials when they left
college. The addition of James this year, however, was questioned
by draft experts from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts unveiled a draft-day shocker by taking James over
Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams of Texas. Polian and
Indianapolis Coach Jim Mora were vilified by many people around the
league who believed Williams was a can't-miss superstar who would
look good in a Colts jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Polian and Mora stood their ground, saying James was ``a better
fit'' for Indy's offensive system. So far, it's hard to disagree.
James leads Williams in rushing yardage (520 to 403), passing
yardage (113 to 22) and touchdowns (four to zero). The Saints have
won just one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Edgerrin and Ricky are going to be great players,''
Manning said. ``Ricky Williams is a guy who truly needs to be
featured in your offense, and that's what the Saints are doing.
Here with the Colts, we don't feature anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very balanced. We try to get the ball in our playmakers'
hands. If they're stopping one guy, we can beat you with another
guy. Edgerrin really fits that mold.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning, the only NFL quarterback to take every offensive snap
with his team last season, remains the most important piece to the
Colts' puzzle. Cowboys coaches and players said their No. 1 mission
Sunday is to contain him.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders: ``Peyton has a quick
release and gets rid of the ball quickly. He almost never takes a
sack. The Colts have a nice scheme for him, which allows him to do
some wonderful things.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Manning's fans will be on the other side of the field
Sunday. Aikman said he has admired Manning since the second-year
pro was at the University of Tennessee. Manning is a good
ambassador for football, on and off the field, Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way Peyton handled himself last year, especially
after defeats,'' Aikman said. ``Having been through that (in 1989),
I know how difficult it can be. But I didn't expect less from him,
after watching him in college. I've always admired the way he has
handled himself and represented himself and his team, and that's
not going to change.''

 &HT;    Art continues to call Parks
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1937, Gordon Parks was waiting tables on a train. During a
layover in Chicago, he saw a newsreel of a Japanese attack on an
American gunboat in China.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to become a photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have guessed that he'd also become a movie director,
composer, choreographer, novelist, memoirist and poet?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, who could have guessed that this largely untutored son
of the Kansas prairie _ this scion of ``confusion and poverty'' _
could achieve his dream to simply wield an artful camera?
</P>
<P>
   In some secret part of his soul, Gordon Parks would have
guessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother had freed me from the curse of inferiority long
before by not allowing me to take refuge in the excuse that I was
born black,'' Parks once wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At 87, Parks is still wielding a camera, and still earning
accolades for a lifetime of work _ and, yes, for overcoming some
very long odds. A major retrospective of his photographs, films and
music opens Saturday at the Norton Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The show contains roughly 180 photographs. The movies, including
``The Learning Tree'' and ``Shaft,'' will be shown at the museum
during the exhibition and at the Kravis Center in December. In
addition, the museum will host a concert of Parks' music and the
artist will appear Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A traveling Parks exhibition appeared at the Norton in 1984, but
the museum snapped this one up because it's the first to include
all aspects of his creative life, not just photography, according
to Norton curator Neil Watson. The show concludes with a 45-minute
film made by Parks that features his photos, music and poetry.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is called ``Half Past Autumn: The Art of Gordon
Parks.'' The title has a nostalgic ring _ elegiac even. Although
already an accomplished memoirist, Parks said the show has given
him another chance to reevaluate his life, and ``to think back on
so many friends that I have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls the exhibition a ``tone poem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strange poetry sometimes,'' he said during a recent
interview by phone from his Manhattan home. ``Sometimes it's
contradictory. You can't tell which way it's going, but it winds up
as poetry. It's not easy, but it's truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Parks' life and work seem intertwined more
than is the case with all artists.
</P>
<P>
   Parks was born in 1912 on a hardscrabble farm in southeastern
Kansas, the youngest of 15 children. ``The memory of that beginning
influences my work today,'' he once wrote. Despite the pain, he
remembers Kansas as his lifelong ``touchstone.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother died when he was 15, but not before putting her stamp
on his character. That fortitude would be tested. Soon after her
death, he was sent to live with a sister in St. Paul. He found work
playing piano in a brothel, and washing dishes in a greasy spoon
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   After marrying, he got a better job as a waiter on the North
Coast Limited, a passenger train running between St. Paul and
Seattle. At a Seattle pawnshop, he bought his first camera _ a
$7.50 Voightlander Brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Possessing an insistent urge to create, he got up the courage to
ask a white dress-store owner in St. Paul for the chance to shoot
fashion. The wife of boxing great Joe Louis saw his work at the
store, and invited him to photograph fashion in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He accepted, but he was more interested in the black poverty of
Chicago's South Side. Those photos led to a fellowship and, in
1942, a call to work at the Farm Security Administration in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by the legendary Roy Stryker, the federal FSA had made
a name documenting rural poverty throughout the United States.
Ironically, the photos of migrant workers and sharecroppers by
Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange had also inspired Parks to pick up
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   In Stryker, Parks found a kindly mentor. ``He was a wonderful
man, a former professor of economics at Columbia University,''
Parks recalled. ``I had to load a camera for him. But he knew in
which direction to shoot. He always sent me off in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks was shocked to find segregation in the nation's capital.
``Stryker had given me some things to do as an assignment around
town, and I was chased from restaurants and couldn't buy a suit of
clothes'' at the Julius Garfinkel department store.
</P>
<P>
   Stryker wasn't surprised, of course. He gave Parks a lecture on
using the camera as a ``weapon,'' and advised him to study the
photographs in the FSA archives.
</P>
<P>
   Parks pored over the images, and made a point of talking to
members of the black community. ``Late one night, the only person
left in the building besides me was this chairwoman, Ella Watson,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks struck up a conversation, spotted a nearby American flag,
and had an inspiration. He asked Watson to pose with a mop and a
broom, and look straight at the camera. The flag hung in the
background. Parks called the photo ``American Gothic.'' This
poignant, ironic take on the famous painting by Grant Wood became
Parks' signature image.
</P>
<P>
   It's also one of his more ``staged'' images. Parks' reputation
as a documentary photographer lies in a kind of blunt honesty. He
never flinched. Although his photos are cleverly composed, they are
also marked by ``a grim directness,'' as Parks himself once put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``His photos are difficult, probing, yet oddly uplifting,'' said
the Norton's Watson. ``They are unblinking, but not depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stryker saw ``American Gothic,'' he was impressed _ but
nervous. ``He said, 'Well, you got the right idea, but you're going
to get us all fired,''' Parks said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The FSA was under political attack from Southern senators
disturbed by depictions of poverty in their region. At the outbreak
of World War II, the agency was quickly absorbed into the Office of
War Information. Parks was assigned to shoot the training exercises
of the 332nd Fighter Group _ black pilots based near Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult for them,'' he said. ``They were training to
fight to defend something that was fighting them _ fighting for a
country that really didn't appreciate what they were trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the point of embarkation (for Europe) with some of
the pilots. A group of white pilots were there who didn't believe
there were black pilots in existence. Trouble was brewing. They had
to get the black pilots on ship and out of port in four days. I
said to myself, 'What the hell is this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Parks began looking for more lucrative work. He was hired by
Vogue magazine. Eventually, he found himself in the odd position of
shooting high fashion in New York and Paris, and low crime on the
streets of New York and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion photography had its own set of problems,'' Parks said.
``It might have been the wrong time of the month for the models, or
they were staying out late with their boyfriends. If you forced
them into a session without talking to them first, you weren't
going to get much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always trying to be experimental. I let the models move,
and then I would move with them, often shooting at a very slow
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as a noted Life magazine photographer, Parks produced
photo essays on U.S. crime; bullfights in Madrid; the lives of the
rich and indolent in Portugal; boxer Muhammad Ali training in
Miami; and the controversial romance of actress Ingrid Bergman and
Italian director Roberto Rossellini.
</P>
<P>
   Two famous photo essays involved the Black Muslims, and a little
boy from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Parks visited Brazil to shoot the squalid slums of Rio
de Janeiro. He found the da Silva family living in grotesque
poverty. A spunky 12-year-old named Flavio da Silva became his
``tour guide.'' After the article appeared, donations poured into
Life to bring Flavio to America to treat his severe asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Parks returned to Brazil to escort the boy to the United States,
and he remained in touch with Flavio and his family over the years.
He recently went back to Rio de Janeiro to visit them for an
upcoming HBO special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flavio is still having his problems. He's 49 now, and he's not
working steadily. The house (bought by Life readers) is still
there, but it's a shambles. He wants to give it to his mother,
brother and family, but they don't have any appreciation of what
he's trying to do. It was a reunion with much laughter and tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Another family mired in poverty turned out even worse. In 1967,
Parks did a photo essay on the Fontenelle family of Harlem. The
wife scalded the husband during the week he spent photographing the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in that family just about turned out badly,'' he
recalled, sadly. ``The girl died of AIDS. The father burned the
house down. The mother died of cancer ... it was just a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, frustrated Life editors asked him to get a story on the
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Muslims were concerned about dealing with anybody from a
white publication,'' Parks said. ``One afternoon, I went up to
Harlem, and there was Malcolm X at a rally cursing out about 40
cops. I introduced myself, and said I would be interested in
writing about the Muslims. He said I would have to get permission
from Elijah Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew out to Arizona with Malcolm, and the first thing Elijah
Muhammad said to me was, 'Why are you working for those white
devils?'''
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 minutes, Parks and Malcolm X were back at the airport
without an answer about the article. ``On the plane, Malcolm said
to me, `I think he likes you.' I said, 'Well, he has a funny way of
showing it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Elijah Muhammad offered Parks $500,000 to do a film and
book on the Nation of Islam. Parks turned him down, but he got his
story anyway. ``I think he was impressed that a young black man
would turn down $500,000 on principle.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Parks moved from photography to writing, publishing his
``novel from life'' called ``The Learning Tree,'' about a boy
coming of age on the Kansas prairie. That led to another occupation
when Hollywood came calling in the person of maverick actor and
director John Cassavetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't try to sell the book,'' Parks recalled. ``John called
me in New York out of the blue, and said the book should be filmed
and I should direct it. I was skeptical, since I knew there had
been no black directors in Hollywood. He just said, 'How soon can
you get out here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Cassavetes introduced Parks to Warner Brothers executive Kenny
Hyman, even though the two moviemakers were on bad terms at the
moment. ``Hyman said off the bat, 'We're ready to make the movie
under your direction,''' Parks remembered. ```Who do you want to do
the screenplay?' I didn't know anybody. He said, `Why not you?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he said, `Cassavetes says you write music. Why don't you
do the score? And since you'll be the first black director, you'll
have to be the supreme boss. I suggest you produce it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks first thought it was all Hollywood hoo-ha. But months
later, he was in the director's chair in his hometown of Fort
Scott, Kan. ``The Learning Tree'' was released to critical acclaim
in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   After ``The Learning Tree,'' Parks got another shot at directing
a groundbreaking film when he was asked to helm ``Shaft,'' which
Parks has described as a ``noisy film about a black, suave,
high-powered big-city detective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice adventure for me,'' he said. ``The film created
a new role for young black kids to admire. Shaft was a hero. Some
think he was too flashy. In either case, I brought him to life.
It's become a cult film, still playing around the country.''
``Shaft'' is being remade by director John Singleton, with Samuel
L. Jackson in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Parks' film ``Leadbelly,'' about the famous blues
singer Huddie Ledbetter, received no support from new MGM head
Barry Diller, who preferred promoting the bomb ``Lipstick.''
``Leadbelly'' even opened in an L.A. porno house. Parks turned his
back on Hollywood, calling it an ``insane place.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Parks enjoys life with his children and grandchildren and
continues to construct new work _ abstract color photographs. He
calls them ``horizons of my imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like souls touching, poetry, music, paint and the camera keep
calling, and I can't bring myself to say no.''

   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ I killed a snake in the
yard the other day. Guess that explains why the dogs were dancing
around on their hind legs and holding up their petticoats. For the
past few days, they had been urgently trying to tell me about the
snake, but I thought they just wanted to come in the house. Snakes,
as you know, are all 6 feet long until they are killed then they
tend to shrink. This one shrank to about 3 feet. (Ernest Murray is
managing editor of The Lufkin Daily News). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ One of my most vivid
memories is of sitting under the stars in Big Bend National Park,
more than 20 years ago, miles away from light pollution, lying flat
on my back and staring goggle-eyed at a sky that one sees all too
rarely when living near a city. My college buddy and I got into
this weird riff about how maybe the whole cosmos was a celestial
planetarium in God's library/study, that what we were seeing wasn't
really light years away, and maybe we were all in miniature _ lots
of little Lilliputians running about with our self-importance and
sense of worth. (Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the
Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) EMBARGOED for Sunday. MOVED.

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Now Elizabeth Dole's campaign
for vice president can get rid of its camouflage and get into high

though it's possible she actually thought she could be elected
president. After all, her husband had. (McNeely, Austin
American-Statesman). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ A funny thing is happening on the
way to anointment. George Bush, the drive-through ATM candidate, is
driving off Republican candidates who could help get him nominated
and/or elected. Al Gore, the automatic Democrat _ some would say
automated _ has another Demo model sharing his showroom, and party
regulars are looking it over. I'm not prepared to answer this, but:
Is it possible that invincibility could be the downfall of both?

just a 90-minute drive from the Washington-Baltimore-Annapolis

   GORDON-PARKS _ In 1937, Gordon Parks was waiting tables on a

attack on an American gunboat in China. He decided to become a
photographer. Who could have guessed that he'd also become a movie
director, composer, choreographer, novelist, memoirist and poet?
Indeed, who could have guessed that this largely untutored son of
the Kansas prairie _ this scion of ``confusion and poverty'' _
could achieve his dream to simply wield an artful camera? In some
secret part of his soul, Gordon Parks would have guessed. At 87,
Parks is still wielding a camera, and still earning accolades for a
lifetime of work _ and, yes, for overcoming some very long odds. A
major retrospective of his photographs, films and music opens
Saturday at the Norton Museum of Art. (Schwan, Palm Beach Post)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ When student revolutionaries stormed the U.S.
Embassy here 20 years ago this week, Hossein Sarbazi was only 1
year old.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is a product of their revolution _ with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   He serves in the Revolutionary Guard forces established by the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He won a national championship in
wrestling _ Iran's number one sport.
</P>
<P>
   But far from mouthing the revolution's anti-American curses, he
dreams of attending Georgetown University in Washington. Waiting
for a bus last week in front of the old embassy, which now houses a
military high school and his wrestling club, Sarbazi said he hopes
for better relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they put an embassy here again,'' he said, showing a smile
beneath his Georgetown Hoyas ball cap, ``I assure you many young
people will come apply for visas.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the wooded embassy compound is still an emblem of two
countries that have not found common ground.
</P>
<P>
   The echoes of the embassy takeover, which turned into 14-month
hostage crisis, carry emotions and misconceptions that still
reverberate between the two nations. These days, as Iranians openly
and sometimes heatedly reassess the revolution, relations with the
United States are front-page news on an almost daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   The stubbornness of the impasse can be put in perspective this
way: During the last 20 years, the United States has opened an
embassy in Vietnam and Iran has traded official visits with its
former enemy in war, Iraq. But, Iran and the United States still
treat each other as foes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite U.S. oil companies' desire to start pumping in Iran
again, America maintains economic sanctions against Iran. And while
Iranians yearn for business with the world's biggest economy, Iran
continues to stoke anti-American sentiments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy takeover shocked America. It became a deciding
factor in an election _ Ronald Reagan's defeat of then-President
Jimmy Carter. It showed that fundamentalist religion, Islam, had
re-emerged in world politics. Americans also realized that their
Cold War support of dictators carried a high price.
</P>
<P>
   But for Iranians, it was so much more.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Islamic revolution's Boston Tea Party and Battle of
Bunker Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Ayatollah Khomeini called it ``the Second Revolution.'' The
hostage takers became heroes. Their actions the text of college
curricula.
</P>
<P>
   That was 20 years ago. These days, Iran is brimming with debate
about its future. Iranians seek to fit into the world community
without sacrificing its revolutionary identity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate pits the young, like Sarbazi, against the old, like
Mehdi Naeini, a 48-year-old owner of a crafts store across the
street from the old embassy. And America is at the heart of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the Americans who are making things tense,'' Naeini
said, ticking off a list offenses, most recently comments by U.S.
officials accusing Iran of supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Iranians, he blames the United States for the Iraqi
attack that lead to an eight-year war in the 1980s, killing
hundreds of thousands of Iranians. Murals of the martyrs are on
buildings throughout the country. In fact, the United States did
provide intelligence to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Naeini points to the embassy compound wall and notes that the
anti-American murals there were recently repainted.
</P>
<P>
   One reads, ``On that day (sic) U.S. would praise us we will
mourn.'' Another states, ``We will make America face a severe
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, between the hope of youth and the defiance of the
old guard, are many of the former hostage takers. Many are student
extremists-turned-moderates, who say relations with the United
States are desirable, as long as America treats Iran as an equal.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, was a leader of the students who
stormed the embassy and is now a 44-year-old Tehran city council
member who has been physically attacked for his moderate views.
</P>
<P>
   He does not regret the embassy takeover, but has invited former
hostages to return as guests to his country. America and Iran, he
said, do not have to sacrifice their identities to renew relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary to forget the past to build a future,'' he
said. ``We have to accept realities and the future should be built
on facts.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   To him, there was no alternative to the events of Nov. 4, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years before, Carter visited Mohammad Reza Pahlavi _
the detested but U.S.-backed Shah of Iran _ and declared Iran ``an
island of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later there was an upsurge of riots against the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations, street-fighting and murderous reprisals from the
Shah's troops resulted in the return from exile of respected cleric
Khomeini. The Shah fled in February. When Carter allowed him into
the United States for medical treatment, students took to the
streets again.
</P>
<P>
   They marched to the embassy, cut through the gate and
overwhelmed the small security contingent. They expected a siege of
just a few days. Surely, they mistakenly thought, the U.S. would
relinquish the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   But, U.S. officials reacted instead with economic sanctions and
the takeover turned into a stand-off that captured the Iranian
imagination. It provided an opportunity for Khomeini's
fundamentalists _ overshadowing revolutionaries seeking a secular
government _ to energize and unify their supporters around
opposition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 52 American hostages were held for 444 days and
released the day Reagan took office. By then, it was branded into
the identity of the new Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part of the sacred tenets of the revolution,'' said
Iranian political scientist Hadi Semati. ``It is still seen as
current and is very hard to analyze objectively.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Iranians are doing a lot of analyzing these days.
</P>
<P>
   They have gone through the war with Iraq, experienced 20 years
of sacrifice and strict Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
   Though still widely revered, the charismatic Khomeini has been
dead for 10 years. More than half the country's 63 million people
were born after the revolution. They never knew the Shah or his
American patrons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Iranians shocked the world again. They voted 70 percent
to 30 percent to make underdog Ayatollah Mohammad Khatami
president. He promised economic progress and more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But, the country's most powerful person remains Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He controls the army and courts.
</P>
<P>
   A sometimes-violent tug-of-war is underway and at times it seems
Iran has two governments. Reformers have opened hundreds of
newspapers and slightly loosened strict Muslim codes. Conservatives
have closed papers and even killed a few critics of religious rule.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, Iranians live firmly in the modern age. Many have
Internet access. They watch satellite dish broadcasts, though
dishes are technically illegal. The oil-driven economy has been
growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
   But, the population and unemployment are growing faster still
and people yearn for a prosperity many believe can only come with
the end of the U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   There have been tentative steps by both sides. Last year,
Khatami called for more cultural exchange and a ``dialogue of
civilizations.'' That was probably as far as he could go without
inflaming the powerful clerics.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has praised Khatami and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has acknowledged that Iran has
``grievances'' against the U.S. support of the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have long lists of demands. American officials call
on Iran to end its support of terrorist groups, drop its opposition
to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, stop developing weapons
of mass destruction and improve its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, Iranians say that the U.S. Congress has sent
money to the Iranian opposition, a group responsible for
assassinations of Iranian officials. They argue that they are not
developing weapons of mass destruction and that U.S. officials do
not object to Israel's nuclear arsenal or Egypt's chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians call for the United States to drop economic sanctions
and stop trying to discourage other countries from dealing with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   They also call on the United States to release billions of
dollars in Iranian assets and drop opposition to a proposed oil
pipeline through Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But, relations are still marked by missed or poorly sent
signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental problem in American policy is the fact that
they don't realize how their policies are perceived here,''
political scientist Semati said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, analysts expect progress to be slow. Iran has
parliamentary elections in February and the U.S. elections follow
in November. Candidates in neither country want to be seen as soft
on their nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also note, however, that America could use a friend
next to troubled Pakistan, anarchic Afghanistan and rebellious
former Soviet satellites. By comparison, Iran is peaceful and
appears to be moving toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Revolutionary Guard Sarbazi said he got hooked on the
Georgetown Hoyas while watching the school's basketball team on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 60 to 70 percent of Iranians want to have relations
with America,'' he said. ``I am for relations of all kinds _
political, economic.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he fears his position could get him in trouble, he
gives an answer that bodes well for democracy as well as relations
with America: ``I don't care. I believe what I want to.''

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ As a revolutionary 20 years ago, Iranian Mohammad
Ebrahim Asgharzadeh considered it an obligation to take over the
U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Now a popular Tehran city councilman, he is in the forefront of
Iran's reformers. He says it may be time _ given the right terms _
for the two countries to resolve their disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were forced to take over the embassy,'' Asgharzadeh said
recently from his wood-paneled office in Tehran city hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reaction. The Shah going to the U.S. was not
acceptable to us,'' Asgharzadeh said. ``We had to make claims
against what he had done.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Asgharzadeh looks more yuppie than rebel. He's a
trim 44 year-old with salt and pepper gray hair. In his
wood-paneled city hall office last week, he wore a wool sport
jacket, slacks and argyle socks.
</P>
<P>
   He has three children and had to give up his executive post at a
steel company to take office.
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh does not speak for all the hostage takers. Numbering
about 300, they represent the spectrum of opinions in Iran's
current political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some are still ardent defenders of Iran's strict religious rule
and defiance of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   But, Asgharzadeh is one of several former embassy stormers
supporting Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's efforts to open up
the country's economy and strengthen its democracy. Those are just
the moves western leaders look for.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has come from just the types of religious hardliners
who the embassy takeover helped strengthen amid anti-American
fervor. The hardliners, seeking to maintain strict religious
control over government, appear to fear that reformers like
Asgharzadeh could dilute their power.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, shortly after Asgharzadeh used the 19th
anniversary of the takeover to invite former hostages back to
visit, he was badly beaten by a gang. The attackers may have been
trying to keep him from running for the city council.
</P>
<P>
   But, Asgharzadeh is not the only former hostage-taker to speak
out. Abbas Abdi, met publicly with former hostage Barry Rosen last
year in Paris. According to Rosen, Abdi apologized for the personal
pain he caused Rosen and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Abdi were idealists. They were young and they
believed in the Islamic revolution. They believed it was the birth
of a new freedom for them,'' Rosen said. ``Over the years, they
came to realize it was the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh denies that he has changed or mellowed, saying he
has just acted realistically with the changing times.
</P>
<P>
   As a student, he was active in the revolution that overthrew the
dictatorial Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Shah.
</P>
<P>
   When President Jimmy Carter agreed to let the Shah enter the
United States for medical treatment, Asgharzadeh was among a small
group of leaders who organized the embassy takeover. He became the
group's spokesman but says now that he had no idea the hostage
crisis would last for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not possibly predict what would be the main result
and the reaction,'' he said. ``We just wanted to do something, some
kind of a student movement. It was very unprofessional and
amateur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We imagined that the U.S. would return the Shah to us and that
would finish the crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Shah should have faced the same fate as former
Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, who may face a trial for
massive human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh describes a spiral of miscalculations on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   He said the students were quickly disappointed that students in
the United States did not seem sympathetic to their cause. In the
wake of the embassy takeover, he said, the public in Iran and the
United States unified around their country's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, the Carter administration escalated the
tensions and prolonged the crisis with economic sanctions and a
failed rescue attempt in the desert. Many in Iran think the landing
in the desert was an attempt to topple Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
and reinstate the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh continues to be a stern critic of U.S. policy today,
saying America still seems arrogant in its dealing with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. believes that it is the winner of the Cold War, and
if this image will be the basis of its foreign policy with Europe,
the Pacific Rim countries, countries like Iran, they will have
problems,'' he said. ``It disgraces a nation to be put down and
threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the intense animosities of the embassy crisis have
waned and public opinion has become more varied in both Iran and
the United States. That, he said, provides an opportunity for
Khatami to attempt to appeal to the American public and Clinton to
approach the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public opinion and emotions among our peoples would be derived
from the behavior and decision-making of our officials,'' he said.
``A relationship should be based on mutual respect and recognition
of each country's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Asgharzadeh concludes, that America is a world
power that Iran cannot ignore and Islamic Iran has emerged as a
power that America cannot ignore _ regardless of their history of
enmity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessary to forget about the past to be able to
build a future,'' he said. ``We have to accept what has happened in
reality and the future should be built on facts.''

 &HT;    THE CRISIS THAT HELD AMERICA HOSTAGE 20 YEARS AGO
 &HT;    With IRAN-$ADV31.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For two weeks, U.S. diplomats watched from their
office windows at the American Embassy in Tehran as hundreds of
militant Iranian college students gathered each day on
Takht-e-Jamshid Avenue to chant ``Margh Bar Amerika'' _''Death to
America.'' But on that drizzly Sunday morning, the crowd seemed to
be in a particularly ugly mood.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 10:30 on Nov. 4, 1979, their worst fears were realized:
With bolt-cutting shears, a vanguard snipped the chains that
clasped the iron gates while others stormed over the 10-foot
concrete wall. Soon, students were swarming through the 27-acre
manicured grounds. Flak-jacketed Marines sought to hold back the
rampaging mob with tear gas grenades, but they were soon routed.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the diplomats and their security detail were bound
with tape and blindfolded. As TV images of the takeover circled the
globe, the United States began a prolonged ordeal, whose impact is
still being felt today.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, those events permanently eroded the presumed
sanctity of diplomatic immunity. But, more broadly, during the 444
days that the hostages were held captive, America's self-image, as
well as the nation's prestige abroad, plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the public, Iran became a metaphor for everything,'' said
Gerald Rafshoon, then-President Jimmy Carter's media adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance changed to obsession, as Americans found themselves
checking their atlases and tracking the story so closely that the
names and views of the most obscure Iranian mullahs became
household names.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his poll numbers initially surged, Carter made what
turned out to be a fatal error: stating at the outset that his
primary concern was bringing the hostages home alive. By placing
the value of the hostages' lives above all else, Carter himself
became a kind of hostage to an angry public, a setting that would
haunt him throughout his re-election bid and eventually drive him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Fed by a ravenous press corps, the hostage mania proved in time
to be more harmful to long-term U.S. interests than shocking events
in far-off Iran.
</P>
<P>
   For a subsequent generation of Americans, the collapse of the
Soviet Union and the emergence of the United States as the world's
unchallenged pre-eminent power has removed much, if not all, of the
lingering sting. But in many European and Asian capitals, it is
still widely believed that U.S. foreign policy remains crippled,
especially in the Middle East, by the hostage trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Concluded political analyst Daniel Pipes: ``The United States
paid in many ways for the emotionalism of its leaders. Officials
devoted so much time to this issue that their attention to matters
of greater significance was much reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Soviet troops occupied neighboring
Afghanistan, the president remained so consumed by the hostage
crisis that he was unable to act decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Carter resisted pressure to bomb Tehran, unlike
President Clinton who earlier this year approved the American-led
bombardment of Belgrade. One major difference: Carter lacked the
``smart bombs'' that NATO allies could deploy to cherry-pick
targets in the Serbian capital.
</P>
<P>
   When the crisis over Kosovo erupted, former presidential adviser
David Gergen noted: ``The temptation again is to make it an
obsession. And you can't allow that to happen, because it will
suddenly begin to drive your policy in ways that are very
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 4:30 in the morning in Washington when word of the
hostage taking first reached Hamilton Jordan, the president's chief
of staff. Jordan's immediate fear was that it would trigger a war
with revolutionary Iran, incensed because Carter had granted
sanctuary in New York to the ailing deposed Shah.
</P>
<P>
   War didn't come. But neither did a settlement _ at least not
until Jan. 20, 1981, the day Carter left Washington. Ronald Reagan
had been president for 20 minutes when the remaining 52 hostages
flew off to a U.S. military hospital in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the hostage crisis of 1979 gave rise to that
peculiar agony, increasingly familiar to Americans in subsequent
decades, which arises after a major terrorist strike. It is an
agony born of great power, coupled with the knowledge of how little
at times it can accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials empathized with the victims, heightening the sense
of crisis. Passengers of a downed Korean 747 receive more attention
than tens of thousands of Afghan peasants because Americans can
picture themselves sitting in a Boeing jet; similarly, fellow
bureaucrats can see themselves in an embassy surrounded by an
agitated mob.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were matters helped by a fierce policy dispute between
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's activist national security adviser,
and the late Cyrus Vance, who as secretary of state, argued that
diplomacy could resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As historian Douglas Brinkley has written: ``For nearly a year
the crisis handcuffed the administration, which tried everything it
could think of to end the standoff: suspending oil imports,
freezing Iranian assets, expelling Iranian diplomats, imposing
economic sanctions, even conducting clandestine negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, a former naval officer, hoped to repeat the
success of an Israeli commando raid that had freed 103 airline
passengers at Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976. But the U.S. operation
proved a humiliating failure.
</P>
<P>
   As Brinkley noted: ``After the aborted rescue attempt, many
believed that Carter had not only tarnished the nation's honor but
lost control of his own administration in the process. Critics
condemned him for failing to mount a rescue operation sooner, for
not putting enough military hardware into it once he did act, and
then for retreating at the first sign of hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Brzezinski had counseled Carter to bomb Tehran if the rescue
mission caused the deaths of would-be rescuers, hostages and
captors. Although no such attack took place, Vance quit in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Many years after the fact, Carter told reporters that he still
believed he could have been re-elected if he had bombed Tehran
until the hostages were released or incinerated along with the
entire Iranian government. But that kind of ground-zero solution
was morally repugnant to Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of grumbles about my handling of the hostage
crisis,'' he said in looking back, ``but not a single responsible
politician offered a more realistic alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   An echo of such internal quarrels could be heard in Clinton's
1998 decision to launch a cruise missile attack against a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in a bid to punish Osama bin Laden,
the Islamic militant blamed for blowing up two American embassies
in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Brzezinski is hardly alone in believing that the Iran
hostage crisis crushed Carter's prestige. ``I think it was
devastating,'' he said. ``The Iran hostage crisis was one of the
two central reasons for Carter's defeat in 1980, the other reason
being domestic inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Brzezinski contends that the events in Iran heightened
the nation's sense of vulnerability, particularly in the Middle
East. ``Once the Iranian pillar had collapsed, we were faced with
the possibility that one way or another, before too long, we may
have either a hostile Iran on the northern shore of the Persian
Gulf facing us, or we might even have the Soviets there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another lasting legacy of the crisis is ABC's ``Nightline,'' the
media grand-daddy of today's saturation coverage, on cable networks
and the Internet, that arises whenever news blow-outs occur.
</P>
<P>
   Neither medium existed when Roone Arledge, the innovator of ABC
News, created ``America Held Hostage'' to track the crisis in
depth.
</P>
<P>
   When Frank Reynolds left in December to cover the presidential
campaign, his role was taken up by Ted Koppel, the network's
diplomatic correspondent. In time, Koppel began anchoring
permanently, with the renamed ``Nightline'' premiering on March 24,
1980. It remains a stable of light-night TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some grudges that Americans seem to nurse longer
than others,'' Koppel said. ``Lord knows this program no doubt
contributed to that mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the days before it was known as 'Nightline,' when it
was still called 'America Held Hostage,' we tagged a number on the
back, indicating just how many days it had been since the Ayatollah
Khomeini's followers first seized the embassy in Tehran . . . Many
people probably still remember it as the program that highlighted
the indignity and humanized a situation far removed from most of
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking back on the program's first decade, Koppel once
reflected: ``What will never change is that hostages are by
definition a tremendous emotional and explosive domestic issue.
Ideally _ and this sounds very callous _ a president ought to be
able to say, 'We aren't going to deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter did not.
</P>
<P>
   (Andrew J. Glass, senior correspondent in the Cox Newspapers
Washington Bureau, covered the Carter White House and Iranian
hostage crisis.)

 &HT;    What seemed like cakewalk is about to get messy for Bush, Gore
 &HT;    EDS: RESENDING--CHANGE OF DATES
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A funny thing is happening on the way to
anointment.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, the drive-through ATM candidate, is driving off
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates who could help get him nominated and/or
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, the automatic Democrat _ some would say automated _ has
another Demo model sharing his showroom, and party regulars are
looking it over.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not prepared to answer this, but: Is it possible that
invincibility could be the downfall of both?
</P>
<P>
   Surely not. Surely Bush and Gore will face each other in the
general election. They have amassed too much cash and name backing
not to.
</P>
<P>
   But they may get the scare of their lives in so doing. And at
some point they will curse Dame Invincibility for making things _
difficult?
</P>
<P>
   The case of Gore and Democratic challenger Bill Bradley is the
perfect example of what can be wrong with having too much momentum.
</P>
<P>
   We can't know what Gore was thinking when prospective Democratic
challengers dropped away: Richard Gephardt, Jesse Jackson, Bob
Kerrey. Maybe Gore felt elation and relief. On the other hand, when
the very solid Bradley stepped to the line, Gore instantly might
have gotten wistful for a crowded field, for a nettlesome Paul
Tsongas, a Tom Harkin, a John Kerry. Come one, come anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the more Democrats in the race, the more diluted
would be the ABG, or anybody-but-Gore, vote (more accurately, it's
the anybody-without-a-hint-of-Clinton's-aftershave vote.)
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Bradley is a mighty threat to Gore. Make no mistake.
And the New Hampshire primary looms like none other. Though he
trails nationwide, the ex-New Jersey senator leads Gore in New
Hampshire, according to a Quinnipiac College poll. Should Bradley
win Feb. 1 in New Hampshire or make it close, Gore's invincibility
will be out the door.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, the monstrous mountain of cash he's amassed is the
equivalent of having canceled half a dozen primaries, so rapidly
has it winnowed the Republican field. But that's not all good for
the Dub.
</P>
<P>
   As William Safire points out, having Elizabeth Dole on the
primary ballot was a way of splitting support of those GOP
moderates who see Bush as a question mark and who now might turn to
John McCain. Similarly, having Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander
jettisoned from the ballot means more face time for Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Having lots of names on primary ballots would have helped Bush
in dividing and conquering his GOP doubters. Now McCain is standing
as Bush's chief threat on an electability scale, while Forbes hangs
around to spend with dispatch and cast doubts about the
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   But the real curse of Invincibility, as pertains to the end
result of this whole exercise, may be in the Reform Party, where
contenders like Pat Buchanan, Donald Trump or maybe Ross Perot
again stand to siphon votes away from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion that a Reform candidate would hurt Gore and Bush
equally is hogwash. The Reform Party remains a refuge for the AWM,
the angry white male vote. A pivotal portion of that vote went to
Perot in 1992. Gore (or Bradley) would not expect to have any of it
in 2000. But Bush is _ was _ counting on every one.
</P>
<P>
   That Trump and Buchanan (and maybe Perot) appear ready to debate
and draw lots of attention to themselves means one of the two will
acquire stature and visibility among angry white males.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush hadn't appeared so invincible, Buchanan would have hung
around to pester him in the GOP primaries, not bolt to bleed
crucial ABG, AWM votes from him in the general election _ or to
make Trump look like Lancelot by contrast.
</P>
<P>
   What's a candidate to do? Even when invincible, sometimes you
just can't win.

 &HT;    FOR HOUSE Y2K WATCHER, IT'S TIME TO WAIT AND SEE
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the members of Congress who have spent years
trying to determine how much harm the Y2K computer bug will do on
Jan. 1, it's time to sit back and watch what happens. Neither the
House nor Senate plan any more hearings; President Clinton will
have to take it from here.
</P>
<P>
   The president ``needs to go out and talk to the American people
like Franklin Roosevelt did,'' said Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif.,
chairman of the House subcommittee on technology. Horn, who last
week held the final congressional hearing on Y2K, believes Clinton
ought to be using the less than nine weeks remaining to urge people
to prepare for possible short-term disruptions in delivery of
water, electricity and other basic services.
</P>
<P>
   Horn did much to publicize the Y2K problem by issuing report
cards assessing readiness among government agencies. He plans to
pass out a final set of marks Nov. 22. His grades have ranged from
straight A's for the Social Security Administration to early F's
for the State Department. Because many department heads were
embarrassed by their lousy grades, the report cards helped spur
reforms in many federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   That government officials needed some cajoling on Y2K was not
surprising to Horn, who initially had a hard time believing the
glitch could cause so much trouble. The software flaw was embedded
in many computers in the 1960s and 1970s when programmers used only
two digits to represent a year. When the date rolls over from '99
to '00 in just weeks, many programs will interpret the new date as
1900, possibly causing computer and chip malfunctions. The glitch
could disrupt power plants, shut down traffic signals and much
more.
</P>
<P>
   When a staff member first told him about the problem in the
early spring of 1996, Horn assumed the story was an April fool's
joke. ``I said, 'You're pulling my leg.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But before long, computer experts persuaded Horn that his
subcommittee should find out whether federal agencies would be
prepared for 2000. Horn discovered that the Social Security
Administration, which calculates payouts based on birth dates, was
hard at work on the problem, but that other agencies were in denial
about Y2K's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the White House to pressure Cabinet secretaries to
address the problem was difficult at first, Horn said, because
Clinton seemed ``blind-sided'' by the technology issue. By early
1998, the administration was moving on Y2K, but ``it wouldn't have
happened if not for Congress'' holding hearings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Horn refuses to make predictions about what computerized systems
will fail Jan. 1. But he continues to urge Americans to have a
small stockpile of food, water and other necessities, in case they
get stuck in their homes for several days because of power
disruptions, traffic tie-ups or other difficulties. He fears people
will wait until the last days of December, then rush to the store
in a panic. He urges the president to ``talk softly,'' but
persuasively to get people to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   And where will Horn be on Dec. 31? In a bunker with beef jerky
and bottled water?
</P>
<P>
   ``On a plane,'' he said, flying from one coast to the other to
help demonstrate the Y2K-readiness of the air traffic control
system. But how can he and his wife party at midnight on a cramped
airplane? ``We've never celebrated New Year's Eve in 44 years of
marriage,'' he said. ``There'll be no party hats this year
either.''

RIGHT ON TO AMMIANO, THE WRITE-IN CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Suddenly, the San Francisco mayor's race is
interesting. Just imagine some of the far-out possibilities raised
by Tom Ammiano's write-in campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What if Mayor Willie Brown decides the schools need more
pencils, so next Monday he borrows them from polling places?
</P>
<P>
   What if Ammiano wins a spot in a run-off election by getting
more votes than Clint Reilly and Frank Jordan? That's my bet, given
how dreary those two have been while Ammiano has been on the
sidelines. But what does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it would start a whole trend of write-in campaigns,
getting rid of campaign consultants,'' said Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. Write that in your dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider the possibility of the two best stand-up comedians
in local politics debating each other for six weeks before a
run-off. What a gas, right?
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it. Brown has been somber for months now, and
Ammiano suddenly isn't good for a single laugh line.
</P>
<P>
   His home answering machine no longer has a joke of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's message gives write-in voters a spelling lesson:
``That's two M's, as in ``Mayor,' and one N, as in ``None of the
above.'''
</P>
<P>
   Give a guy 11 percent in the polls, and he becomes 99 percent
serious. The best he could do was tell me, ``Penmanship does not
count against you.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other day we went out for soda, chips and salsa at Chevy's _
no Chardonnay at Stars, thank you very much _ and in an entire hour
Ammiano didn't say anything funny. After all, he faces some serious
questions.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him, if he thinks he can be mayor of San Francisco, why
he didn't have the guts to become an official candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it took a lot of guts not to do it,'' he said. ``I
don't want to be self-absorbed here, but you can't always give
people what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Physician, spin thyself.
</P>
<P>
   So I asked why it was the right thing to pull a Rosie Ruiz and
enter the race at the last minute as a write-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a write-in campaign was suggested almost
immediately after I decided not to run,'' he said. ``I didn't give
it any credence until the buzz on the street and in the media
indicated that there's nobody to vote for.''
</P>
<P>
   As if there was anybody before.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to decrease voter cynicism and increase turnout
for his measure restricting banking fees on ATMs and other issues.
He said a regular campaign costs too much, both financially and
personally.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a write-in candidate, you can't lose. You can always
say you did pretty well, considering you weren't really trying.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Power to the people, right on, and write in. Right now, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   That might be Ammiano's motto. At times, though, he talked as if
losing was a foregone conclusion, calling his write-in effort an
``alternative campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounded like a '60s student radical smoking the dean's
cigars, knowing he was about to be busted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've shown there is political strength in my position
and my attitude,'' Ammiano said. ``That's a win, and whatever
happens above that is political gravy and hopefully will translate
into not only a successful district election campaign next year,
but also into a good base for the mayor's race four years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Give the guy credit for honesty and not acting like he's going
to beat Willie Brown, who would have gobs of big business's money
to attack the leftish Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   But what if there are enough dissatisfied voters armed with No.
2 pencils to make him mayor?
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano said he'd like to see the power of the mayor's office
reduced, Muni put in the hands of an independent commission, a ban
on chain stores in the neighborhoods and the homeless given real
services and treatment instead of sporadic rousting.
</P>
<P>
   You know, all that leftist stuff many people in San Francisco,
left or right, agree on.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd like to see equity in homeless services, with each
district bearing some burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we ready, Pacific Heights?'' said Ammiano. ``We've got to
bite the bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, we know who won't carry Pacific Heights.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spend time with Ammiano, and you start to see similarities to
Willie Brown. They may have different taste in clothes and food,
and different attitudes toward those with big money, but they seem
fired by comparable angers, resentments, ideals and egos.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the poor African American kid from a small town in
Texas who became mayor of a great city, and it makes him the better
mayor for it.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano is the working-class gay kid from New Jersey who became
president of the Board of Supervisors, and the board is better for
his questioning of authority. This is a man driven by economic
issues like live-work lofts displacing the poor and a living wage
for city workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about family values, but if you're working three
jobs, you have no family life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Ammiano left Chevy's, a young waiter came up to me and said,
``Excuse me, sir, but I wanted to ask Mr. Ammiano how to write his
name in on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   I told him there will be instructions and pencils at polling
places. He went back to work in order to pay who knows what kind of
exorbitant rent.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of people in San Francisco like that waiter.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how many, but I do know they all can write.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the late 1920s, stock speculation had become
a national pastime, penetrating both the high salons and the low
saloons.
</P>
<P>
   Stock-market talk ceased to be considered un-feminine. Brokerage
houses created separate rooms where women could watch the ticker
tape without being distracted by men.
</P>
<P>
   The market was doing very well. The Standard Statistics index of
common stock prices doubled in the two years between September 1927
and September 1929.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could talk about Prohibition, or Hemingway, or air
conditioning, or music, or horses, but in the end you had to talk
about the stock market, and that was when the conversation became
serious.''

<P>
   On Tuesday, Oct. 29, the big crash came. It was the most
devastating day in the history of the stock market.

   The frenzied selling went on for two weeks, until the value of
the stocks on the Wall Street Exchange had declined about 40
percent. In the three years between September 1929 and September

money by funding new companies _ and do well when these companies
fly high _ admit many of the Internet companies are probably
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring, a respected Internet-industry publication, reports
that to justify their current stock prices, high technology
companies which went public in the last four years would have to
see their revenues grow on average by more than 80 percent every
year for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they will have to do better than Microsoft and
Dell did during their first five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet stocks trade at prices that anticipate sales and
earnings growth unparalleled in financial history,'' says Anthony
Perkins in Red Herring. So what, one may argue, if there are no
parallels in financial history? Since the Internet itself
constitutes a revolution, a search for parallels is flawed at the
outset. Since the Internet so profoundly changes the way we
produce, consume, communicate and play, past patterns don't apply.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, on the other hand, maintain that the Internet does not
defy the law of physics and probability. While some Internet stars
may in fact do better than Microsoft and Dell did in their
adolescence, some are likely to fail, and others will do just OK.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, there'll be a lot of wreckage, losses and
investor pain. Summing up the America he saw 70 years ago, British
correspondent Claude Cockburn denied that what he found reflected
excessive materialism.
</P>
<P>
   What he found was ``a brief enactment of what was essentially an
old American dream. If the attitude of Americans to the stock
market boom proved anything, it proved that they believed in
miracles that if you try hard enough you can make wonderful things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   October has a bad reputation in the history of stock market. We
should be glad it is about to end. But let's remember what Mark
Twain said in ``Pudd'nhead Wilson'': ``October. This is one of the
peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are
July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June,
December, August and February.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the late 1920s, stock speculation had become
a national pastime, penetrating both the high salons and the low
saloons.
</P>
<P>
   Stock-market talk ceased to be considered un-feminine. Brokerage
houses created separate rooms where women could watch the ticker
tape without being distracted by men.
</P>
<P>
   The market was doing very well. The Standard Statistics index of
common stock prices doubled in the two years between September 1927
and September 1929.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could talk about Prohibition, or Hemingway, or air

RANGERS' GM MEETS WITH GONZALEZ'S AGENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rangers will make an attempt to sign Juan
Gonzalez beyond next season.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin met with Gonzalez's agent Jim
Bronner on Wednesday for preliminary discussions on what it would
take to sign the two-time American League MVP to a contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said Gonzalez's situation could depend on other
superstars who can be free agents after 2000, including Seattle's
Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, Cleveland's Manny Ramirez, and
Carlos Delgado and Shawn Green of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find out in Juan's case where the industry is
going,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin refused to say the Rangers have to trade Gonzalez in
order to keep their payroll under control. He is also not concerned
about the possibility of Gonzalez playing out his final year with
the Rangers and having his contract situation become a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners found that to be the case with Randy
Johnson in 1998 and ended up trading him to the Houston Astros at
the July 31 trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said he's trying
to work out contract extensions with second baseman Craig Biggio,
outfielder Carl Everett and pitcher Mike Hampton before they become
free agents after next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like guys going into a season in the final year of
their contracts,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   But Melvin said: ``Every situation is different. It can be a
distraction if you make it a distraction, if you talk about it all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronner is declining to discuss Gonzalez's contract publicly.
Alex Rodriguez's agent, Scott Boras, said his client won't sign an
extension this off-season but Melvin said Bronner has not taken
that position with Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expressed that Juan would like to stay with us,'' Melvin
said. ``Mainly we talked in generalities.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as trading Gonzalez, Melvin said: ``The No. 1 goal is to
put the best team on the field and he's a part of that. I'd like to
sign him, he's a very good player.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern is Gonzalez, who will make $7.5 million next year,
could command $15 million or more per year, which would mean one
player could take up 20 percent of the overall payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also have other needs. They have nine potential free
agents, including pitcher Aaron Sele, third baseman Todd Zeile and
second baseman Mark McLemore. Melvin talked with the agents of all
three during the World Series, trying to gauge what it would take
to keep them.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin would like to sign one or two free-agent pitchers and
Sele is at the top of the list. But the Rangers are also
considering left-handers Chuck Finley, Darren Oliver and Kenny
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin hasn't forgotten about closer John Wetteland, who is in
the final year of his four-year contract and can be a free agent
after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to keep John here,'' Melvin said. ``He's never been
an issue. It's more of an issue with Juan.'' nn

BREEDERS' CUP LURES RECORD 128 HOPEFULS (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fueled by the addition of a new race _ the $1 million Filly and
Mare Turf _ the Breeders' Cup championship received a record 128
horses during pre-entries Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That includes 21 horses that made their most recent start in
Europe. Seventeen European horses raced in South Florida the last
time the Breeders' Cup was conducted at Gulfstream Park in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   There are eight races on the $13 million Breeders' Cup
championship card on Nov. 6. The races will be televised on NBC
(KXAS/Channel 5) from noon-4:30 p.m. The fields for the races will
be set Wednesday when final entries are taken and post positions
are drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the most anticipated race is the Juvenile Fillies,
where undefeated Chilukki has been entered against Surfside and
Darling My Darling. Chilukki is trained by Bob Baffert and Surfside
is the daughter of 1991 Juvenile Fillies champion Flanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be a great race,'' said D. Wayne Lukas, who
trains Surfside and also trained Flanders. ``It has a lot of fan
appeal and has great implications for deciding the (2-year-old
fillies) championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights from the pre-entries include:
</P>
<P>
   A field for the $4 million Classic that includes Behrens, Cat
Thief, Ecton Park, General Challenge and Lemon Drop Kid along with
the former claimers Budroyale and River Keen.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen horses from the barns of Baffert and Lukas. The two
races where Baffert does not have a horse is the Turf and the Filly
and Mare Turf.
</P>
<P>
   Daylami, considered by many to be the top horse in Europe, could
race in the Turf. Owned by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin Stable,
Daylami had a three-race winning streak snapped in the Arc de
Triomphe when he encountered a soggy course that didn't appear to
his liking. Others in the Turf are defending champion Buck's Boy,
1997 runner-up Borgia and Dark Moondancer, recently purchased out
of Italy by Oaklawn Park owner Charles Cella. nn

HAWAII 5-2: NEVER A DOUBT ABOUT OL' JUNE
</HEADLINE>
 REPORT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in August, when the Western Athletic Conference held its
football media day, first-year Hawaii coach June Jones ascended the
podium and delivered the perfect line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, ``you're all probably wondering why I'm
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, not at all, June. We all thought it made perfect sense to
turn down the head coaching job with the San Diego Chargers to take
over a program that has lost, what _ 18 games in a row, the longest
losing streak in America? Or for that matter, the Philippines,
Indonesia and Rarotonga? A troupe that has not won a WAC game on
the road since somebody named Bush was president?
</P>
<P>
   Naw. Sounds like the work of a fertile mind, buddy. What's next,
circumnavigating Antarctica on a hula hoop?
</P>
<P>
   There was a contrite moment when Jones spoke eloquently of his
love for the islands, developed as a player and assistant coach,
and the desire for him and his family to return to his ``second
home'' near the end of his career. There were impolite snickers
when he unveiled his grand design _ resurrection via the
run-and-shoot.
</P>
<P>
   He bristled a bit, pointing out that it worked pretty darn well
for the Oilers, Lions, Falcons and Chargers when he installed it as
assistant or head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but that was when you had guys getting ``paid'' a whole
lot to be good at it, June. What you got out there in Time Zone X
are, shall we say, the rankest of amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   No problemo. In a whirlwind courtship, Jones brought in 50 new
players, including an army of walk-ons. He also informed 20
incumbents that, while their scholarships would be honored, their
services were no longer needed. The only guy in Hawaii who still
has his job is the governor.
</P>
<P>
   On opening day, those heartless toughs from Southern Cal arrived
and pretty much had their way with the residents of paradise. We
will demurely refrain from repeating the final score, as it was a
bit tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Rainbow Warriors _ yes, it is once again
appropriate to call them ``Warriors'' _ have played six games and
won five of them. The only defeat was at the hands of a Rice team
that might not lose again. The Rainbow Warriors have won twice on
the road _ acclimating themselves to the five-hour time difference
_ by ``staying on Hawaii time,'' a trick Jones learned from former
Hawaii coach Dick Tomey. ``Our games on the road are at about the
time we normally practice, so we just stay on schedule,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   They survive with a simple offensive plan _ a large, hostile
line protecting a strong-armed quarterback (Dan Robinson) throwing
selectively to one of 6,439 wide receivers, spread sideline to
sideline and executing the zig here, the zag there.
</P>
<P>
   They are 5-2 and if they win twice more they are guaranteed the
Oahu Bowl on ESPN. Another win or two and they could upgrade to the
Aloha, the same day on ABC. Win the WAC title _ still a possibility
_ and they could cause a bowl flip-flop with Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   June, you're a genius. We always said so.
AROUND THE LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   Rice coach Ken Hatfield, on the firing of Tulsa coach Dave Rader
on Monday: ``I am saddened completely. If there's a better man to
do the job at Tulsa, I don't know who he is. He gave his blood,
sweat and tears to that program for years, and nobody in America
had less to work with. They'll probably have to give the next coach
twice what they gave him, and that just brings up the question of
why didn't they give it to a guy who loved Tulsa?''
</P>
<P>
   SMU coach Mike Cavan, on the blowout of a transformer that
rendered the San Jose State stadium lightless and caused the
probable cancellation of the Mustangs-Spartans game: ``I've been
doing this nearly 30 years and I've never seen anything like it.
But it's typical of the way our season has gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The game is rescheduled for early December ``in the event that
it has bearing on the championship or bowl eligibility,'' in the
league explanation; an unlikely possibility.

terminally ill patients. No mention is made of guns, one of the
principal methods of choice for suicide. Congress finds no need to
explain the moral distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is, of course, against intrusion of government into
private lives. That must be it.

 &HT;    Autumn is right before your eyes at 3 state parks in the Georgia
foothills
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arrayed in a lopsided arc across North Georgia, Red Top
Mountain, Amicalola Falls and Unicoi state parks form sort of a
holy triumvirate for Atlantans who like to head for the hills in
the fall _ to do some hiking, view deer and other wildlife or just
sit back and watch the leaves change.
</P>
<P>
   The parks' lodges are ideal for people whose idea of roughing it
is no room service. For those who'd rather get closer to nature,
there are also RV and tent campsites and cottages.
</P>
<P>
   All three lodges are managed by Denver-based AmFac Parks &AMP;
Resorts, which took over in 1997 when the state decided to reduce
its number of ``nonessential'' workers by privatizing some park
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, AmFac invested $2 million to spruce up the
lodges, replacing carpet and lampshades, reupholstering furniture,
redesigning some common rooms and buying new kitchen appliances for
the restaurants. The company, which also runs lodges at Mount
Rushmore and the Grand Canyon, among other sites, promises ongoing
improvements, such as refurbishing more common areas at Unicoi
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   AmFac's makeover has resulted in a certain sameness among the
lodges. The rooms at each have nearly identical layouts, and the
restaurants all serve similar comfort-food buffets. Still, each
lodge clings to a distinct personality, and the parks themselves
offer very different experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Red Top Mountain Lodge
</P>
<P>
   Rooms: 33, including three handicapped accessible and one junior
suite.
</P>
<P>
   Rates: Standard rooms, $79 Sundays-Thursdays, $89
Fridays-Saturdays, April 1-Nov. 15; $69 Sundays-Thursdays, $79
Fridays-Saturdays, Nov. 16-March 31. Suite, $99-$109.
</P>
<P>
   Dining: The Mountain Cove Restaurant offers a full breakfast and
lunch menu daily. During the off-season, a limited dinner menu is
available Sundays-Thursdays; buffets are offered Friday and
Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Extras: A pool, a video game room, gift shop, meeting facilities
and rope course program, access to the park's hiking trails, tennis
courts, marina and swimming beach.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby attractions: Etowah Indian Mounds State Historic Site,
Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, Pickett's Mill
Battlefield State Historic Site.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations: 1-800-573-9658 or www.Amfac.com.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooking one of Lake Allatoona's most picturesque coves, the
Red Top Mountain Lodge makes for a tranquil retreat ... for two-
and four-legged visitors. Numerous white-tailed deer roam the
grounds, noshing on grass in the dewy meadow behind the main
building, sipping from the trickling streams that run off the lake
and even pausing to pose for a picture or two.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you just may see more deer than people this time of
year. The 1,428-acre Red Top Mountain park draws 1.2 million
visitors annually, but because the lake figures so heavily in
activities, attendance drops considerably as the weather cools,
particularly on weekdays. Services at the lodge are cut back _ the
restaurant offers only pizza on weeknights. Hungry guests are
steered to nearby Cartersville, with its ever-expanding sprawl of
chain eateries (Longhorn, Red Lobster, T.J. Applebee's ... .)
</P>
<P>
   But if you're looking for plenty of peace and quiet, along with
some gorgeous lakeside vistas, it's hard to beat Red Top in the
fall. There's something about strolling along Allatoona's banks and
not hearing the constant buzz of speedboats that does wonders for
those knots of tension. For another guaranteed soother, amble along
the loop trail that runs behind the lodge, down by the inlet and
around a reconstructed 1860s log cabin, which stands high and
lonesome in a thicket of pines.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf-watching here is a mixed blessing. Evergreen Georgia pines
dominate, so the park's color patterns aren't as vibrant as at
Amicalola or Unicoi. But that also means you can go in the dead of
winter and still see green, and the lower elevation means the fall
color season begins and ends later _ perfect for procrastinators.
</P>
<P>
   Amicalola Falls Lodge
</P>
<P>
   Rooms: 57, including one executive suite, three junior suites,
six loft suites, and four handicapped-accessible rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Rates: Standard rooms, $79-$89 Sundays-Thursdays; $89-$129
Fridays-Saturdays. Suites $99-$199.
</P>
<P>
   Dining: The Maple Restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner
buffets daily. Beginning in mid-November, a la carte breakfast and
dinner on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   Extras: Gift shop, meeting facilities and rope course program,
short hike to top of falls, access to other hiking trails
(including the Appalachian Trail approach) as well as playgrounds
and picnic shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby attractions: Dahlonega, Appalachian Trail, Burt's Pumpkin
Farm, North Georgia Premium Outlet Mall, the Funky Chicken Art
Project (a chicken barn converted into an art gallery, featuring
the works of more than 200 painters, sculptors and fabric artists).
</P>
<P>
   Reservations: 1-800-573-9656 or www.amfac.com.
</P>
<P>
   There are three reasons to visit the lodge at Amicalola Falls:
the view, the view and the view.
</P>
<P>
   The four-story window that makes up the back wall of the lobby
draws leaf-lookers like flypaper. On any given weekend afternoon in
October and November, you may see a dozen or so pressed up against
the glass, gazing blissfully at the rumpled quilt of scarlet,
amber, pumpkin and sienna that blankets the Blue Ridge foothills.
Other visitors can be found making their way down the short trail
to the right of the lodge that leads to the top of Amicalola Falls
or standing on the waterfall's observation bridge, watching the
rushing water disappear into an endless expanse.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the fall color season promises to be quite a show _
for a while. ``It'll be short and sweet,'' says park naturalist
Jennifer Pack. She estimates that the leaves should be at their
best between this weekend and next, but that the trees should be
all but bare by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife watching is another popular pastime here. Signs along
the trail to the base of the falls, down the mountain from the
lodge, tell visitors to be on the lookout for pileated woodpeckers,
white-tailed deer and black bears. A trout pond at the beginning of
the trail beckons fisherfolk to drop a line in the water.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge encourages these outdoor adventures. Indoor activities
are scarce, limited to lingering over a buffet plate in the
restaurant or poking around the gift shop. And though the lobby
boasts that lovely view, it's not a place for a peaceful respite,
often filling up with guests checking in or out and with visitors
on bus tours. There is a common room with a fireplace and a lovely
stone patio on the first floor, but it may be reserved for
corporate meetings. Better to bundle yourself against the chilly
fall weather and head for one of the scenic trails or picnic areas
around the 1,021-acre park.
</P>
<P>
   Unicoi State Park Lodge
</P>
<P>
   Rooms: 100, including 30 loft rooms and four
handicapped-accessible rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Rates: $89-$119, Sundays-Thursdays; $109-$129,
Fridays-Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Dining: The Unicoi Restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner
buffets daily.
</P>
<P>
   Extras: Gift shop, meeting facilities, access to hiking trails,
picnic areas, tennis courts, playgrounds and small lake.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby attractions: Helen, Brasstown Bald, Anna Ruby Falls,
Smithgall Woods Conservation Center.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations: 1-800-573-9656 or www.Amfac.com.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear the strains of ``Edelweiss'' drifting over
the Unicoi Lodge's sun-kissed courtyard. Just two miles north of
Helen, the sprawling inn offers quick access to the city's
faux-Bavarian excesses _ the knackwurst-and-sauerkraut emporiums,
the fudge ``shoppes'' and the beer-guzzling Octoberfest revelers.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers a refreshing retreat from same. Snuggled between
voluptuous lumps of Blue Ridge foothills, the lodge plays a serene
counternote to Helen's commercial cacophony.
</P>
<P>
   Comfortable common rooms abound. There's a huge den with plump
chairs and a fireplace in the main building and cozy lounges in
each of four outposts that house the guest rooms. The courtyard's
swings lure guests who want to finish that novel or just loll a bit
and breathe in the fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   At 1,023 acres, Unicoi State Park can't boast a single dominant
natural attraction like Red Top Mountain or Amicalola Falls;
instead, it offers a little bit of each. Its 53-acre Unicoi Lake
can't begin to match a 12,000-acre monster like Allatoona, but a
canoe or paddleboat ride on this placid pond can still be quite
pleasant, particularly as the surrounding trees reach their full
fall spectrum. The park is also adjacent to the two cascades at
Anna Ruby Falls. Neither is anywhere near as high as Amicalola, but
they're breathtaking nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   And though leaf-peepers won't find Amicalola's panoramic vistas
here, there are plenty of pretty views. Park ranger Ellie McConnell
estimates the fall colors will peak next week, noting that the
sourwoods and poplars have already shown their full reds and
yellows, respectively. Wildlife lovers will want to plan a trek
down one of the park's hiking trails, where they may spot black
bears, deer, possums, wildcats, beavers, otters or snapping
turtles.
</P>

 &HT;    Maryland's Eastern Shore: Crab cakes galore
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By Susan Laccetti Meyers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Md. _ Having married a foodie, the allure of good
regional cuisine has become important to me in deciding where to
travel. That's why when visiting Washington recently, I suggested a
jaunt to the Eastern Shore of Maryland _ for the area's top-notch
crab cakes, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The two prominent symbols of the Eastern Shore are crabs and
ducks. Both are abundant on the eastern side of the Chesapeake Bay,
an easy drive from the nation's capital. Hand-carved wood ducks are
sold in restaurants, shops and inns in honor of the real ones that
make the bay home.
</P>
<P>
   Crabs reproduce in the deep waters of the Chesapeake in
unfathomable numbers, creating a flourishing industry for fishermen
and seafood dealers. Consuming and preparing crab is the talk of
the Eastern Shore. No visitor leaves without an opinion of where
the best soft-shell crab or crab cakes are served.
</P>
<P>
   Having my priorities straight, just after crossing the
Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Grasonville, I stopped for a taste of
local crab at the Narrows (410-827-8113), a restaurant on a marina
at Kent Narrows. The thick crab bisque with lumps of meat was the
creamiest I've ever had, served with a bottle of sherry, if
desired, to add flavor. I also had never seen this type of crab
cake common to the Eastern Shore _ a large crab meat ball, like a
huge scoop of ice cream, that is broiled instead of fried.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of tourism on the Eastern Shore is in Queen Anne's and
Talbot counties, south along Md. 50. The townships and villages are
reminiscent of New England with Colonial, Federal and Victorian
architecture, historic inns, churches and town squares, undisturbed
marshes and historic waterfront ports, particularly St. Michaels
and Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to take in the Eastern Shore and absorb its
serenity is by bicycle. The state has designated a wide lane on
roadsides (main and smaller streets) for cyclists to pedal the flat
countryside, planted with soybean and corn, between towns and
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling by four wheels, I stopped in the town of Easton, one
of the largest on the Eastern Shore. Locals boast that Easton is
one of the best small arts towns in America. That's primarily
because of the Academy of the Arts (410-822-0455), which hosts
traveling exhibits featuring nationally respected artists. It's a
town with quiet neighborhoods and a few inns in Victorian homes,
but lacks the appeal of being on the water.
</P>
<P>
   I much preferred exploring St. Michaels, which dates to the
mid-1600s. Once a commercial boat-building center, the township,
population 1,301, is a collection of reasonably priced specialty
shops, flea markets, antiques stores and novelty boutiques along
Talbot Street. There is also the interesting 1879 Hooper Strait
Lighthouse, home to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum
(410-745-2916).
</P>
<P>
   In the War of 1812, the town narrowly escaped bombardment by the
British. This area is also where abolitionist Frederick Douglass
was born. Douglass conducted clandestine schools for slaves in the
St. Michaels area before he escaped slavery and fled north. A
historical marker on Talbot Street notes his contribution to the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Most visitors to St. Michaels congregate at the marina and the
waterfront inns. Several inns, including the luxurious Inn at Perry
Cabin, have views of the Miles River and the town's little harbor.
The Inn at Perry Cabin is the place to stay if money is no object.
Rooms average about $500 a night on weekends at this manor, sold
earlier this year by Sir Bernard Ashley, co-founder of the Laura
Ashley Co. It is bedecked accordingly, with eclectic European and
American antiques and the exclusive company floral and check
fabrics _ from the window treatments to rugs.
</P>
<P>
   Many day-trippers and weekenders end their journey along the
Eastern Shore at St. Michaels. In doing so, they deprive themselves
of quiet little crossroads like Royal Oak or Bellevue, with
traditional country stores and historic chapels. They also miss the
15-mile bike ride or drive to the sailing hot spot of Tilghman
Island.
</P>
<P>
   To get onto Tilghman, cyclists and motorists frequently have to
wait for the short drawbridge to close, as sailboats often move in
and out of Knapps Narrow Marina, separating the mainland Eastern
Shore from the four-mile-long island. Tilghman was settled in 1608
and is home to 700 residents. This is where visitors can sign up
for a sail on a skipjack boat or a fishing charter.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is little commercialism on Tilghman, there are only
four places to eat _ but several places to spend the night. The
Black Walnut Point Inn is on the island's southern tip and is
almost entirely surrounded by the bay, dotted with sailboats and
featuring breathtaking scenery. A waterfront inn with a touch of
Southern hospitality is the Chesapeake Wood Duck Inn, owned by a
couple formerly of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The village I hope to visit again soon is Oxford, on the Tred
Avon River where it feeds into the Chesapeake. One route there is
to drive through Royal Oak to Bellevue and catch the
Oxford-Bellevue ferry. The ferry has been running since 1683 and
takes bicyclists and automobiles for the 15-minute crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1683, Oxford is one of the oldest towns in Maryland.
Its Colonial architecture and brick sidewalks leave visitors
looking for men dressed like George Washington in knickers and
white tights. It is home to the Robert Morris Inn (410-226-5111),
the place James Michener, the
</P>
<P>
   late author of historic novels such as ``Chesapeake,'' cited as
having the best crab cakes. I couldn't
</P>
<P>
   agree more.
</P>
<P>
   The crab gumbo served at the inn's dark tavern is legendary. And
the broiled Morris crab cakes, served with homemade potato salad
and local green beans, were so tender I ordered an extra one. I had
never tasted such pure, delicate crab meat.
</P>
<P>
   After a filling meal at the Robert Morris Inn, Oxford and its
handful of shops can be explored on foot or by bike. Bicycles can
be rented at the Oxford Mews Bike Boatique (410-820-8222). The
streets offer million-dollar views of the bay, a waterfront park
and homes with white-picket fences.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: To Baltimore, fly nonstop for $162.50 round
trip on Delta and USAirways. To Washington-Dulles, it's $118 round

   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino)40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Bats'' R (profanity and intense sequences
</P>
<P>
   of bat attacks)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lou Diamond Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to have bats in your belfry to enjoy this cheesy
horror flick about genetically altered, man-eating bats. For the
record, Lou Diamond Phillips is the fearless sheriff of the Texas
town where the bats have come to roost; Dina Meyer is a
bat-ologist; Leon is her assistant; and Bob Gunton is a shady
scientist. (ERG)1 hour, 30 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedrooms &AMP; Hallways'' Not rated, but contains nudity
</P>
<P>
   and sexual situations.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin McKidd,
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Weaving and Jennifer Ehle.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny look at a series of revolving bedroom doors in modern
London, Rose Troche's new comedy widens her focus, from Chicago's
lesbian dating scene to a view of sexuality (gay and straight)
that's constantly in flux. Robert Farrar's satiric script concerns
an attractive bunch of young people whose love lives reflect the
title: sex experienced as a constant mix of journey and arrival at
a destination. (SM)1 hour, 36 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Taye Diggs,
</P>
<P>
   Nia Long and Morris Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Better than ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' In Malcolm D. Lee's
often funny, sexy and prickly new comedy-drama, Taye Diggs heads a
talented ensemble cast in a glossy wedding film punctuated with
soul-stirring music (Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder, Me'Shell
Ndegeocello, Maxwell), flurries of flesh and real dramatic bite.
The ensemble cast is all good. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Streak'' PG-13 (profanity, violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   A decent, disposable Martin Lawrence vehicle. He's a crook
posing as a cop to recover a $17 million diamond he stashed years
ago. Basically a series of quick skits, there's enough action
scenes to mollify audiences who can't get enough of gunfire and
breaking glass. While it doesn't exactly streak along, at 93
minutes ``Blue Streak'' gets the job done. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Body Shots'' R (profanity, sexual content, violence,
</P>
<P>
   alcohol abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Patrick Flanery,
</P>
<P>
   Jerry O'Connell and Amanda Peet.
</P>
<P>
   Here's proof positive that being 20-something isn't pretty.
Eight party-hearty 20-somethings (including ``Scream 2's'' Jerry
O'Connell) traipse L.A. nightlife, get superdrunk and start having
rampant sex. The big question for two in the group: was it
consensual sex or rape? Quick, brutal and ugly, the movie may not
be any fun, but it sure delivers the dramatic goods. (Bob Longino)1
hour, 42 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' R (sex, profanity, nudity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hilary Swank
</P>
<P>
   and Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   This intense, rawly unsettling film is based on the true story
of Teena Brandon, a 21-year-old woman who fiercely believed she was
a man. She cut her hair short, reversed her name and started
hanging out with some hard-drinking rednecks in rural Nebraska. The
movie, a bit unrelenting, a bit too low-budget
rough-around-the-edges, is still a remarkable achievement, and
Hilary Swank gives a stunning performance. (ERG)1 hour, 54 minutes.
B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead'' R (profanity, violence and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Patricia Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Scorsese offers a savage, sorrowing look at a few days in
the life of a paramedic whose beat is Hell's Kitchen. As played by
Nicolas Cage, he's alcoholic, burnt-out and haunted by the spirits
of those he couldn't save. A kinda romance with Patricia Arquette
doesn't work, but there's excellent work by John Goodman, Ving
Rhames and Tom Sizemore as Cage's various partners. (ERG) 2 hours,
1 minute. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy in Alabama'' PG-13 (violence, thematic material,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Melanie Griffith,
</P>
<P>
   David Morse and Lucas Black.
</P>
<P>
   An odd mix of civil rights drama and Southern Gothic comedy that
goes down just fine. The movie splits time between the wild
adventures of Lucille (Melanie Griffith), who breaks out of a small
Alabama town and heads west, and a graver story back home. Griffith
does her best work since ``Working Girl.'' Antonio Banderas'
direction throws off some sparks, even if it doesn't fully catch
fire. (SM)1 hour, 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Thierry Lhermitte
</P>
<P>
   and Jacques Villeret.
</P>
<P>
   A feast of foolishness. Snotty Paris yuppies hold a weekly
dinner to see who can bring the biggest idiot as a guest. Publisher
Thierry Lhermitte thinks he's got a sure thing when he meets
Jacques Villeret, who builds scale-model monuments out of
matchsticks. Fate intervenes when Lhermitte throws out his back and
is forced to spend the evening with Villeret who systematically
wrecks his life. (ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd plays a woman out to wreak justice on the husband
who framed her for murder, and Tommy Lee Jones is the parole
officer on her trail in this action flick with a gender twist. For
better and for worse, the movie is as professional, efficient and
aloof as Judd's performance. (SM)1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' R (violent antisocial behavior, sexuality
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Norton,
</P>
<P>
   Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Bound to be this fall's most controversial studio release, the
Brad Pitt-Edward Norton flick will have as many people loathing it
as liking it. Either reaction is justifiable. The film, about a
pack of guys beating each other to bloody pulps, is violent,
nihilistic, intoxicated by its own bad-boy humor. But it's still
one of those rare films that creates an electrifying alternate
universe onscreen. (SM) 2 hours, 21 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``For Love of the Game'' PG-13 (sexual situations, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard it tries to hit, Kevin Costner's baseball
flick whiffs a lot. Costner plays Billy Chapel, a Detroit Tigers
pitching god in his waning years who first learns his team is being
sold and he'll be traded and then that his girlfriend is dumping
him. As he pitches what could be a perfect game, he flashes back
over his life. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 18 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grandfather'' PG (profanity and thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Fernan-Gomez
</P>
<P>
   and Cayetana Guillen Cuervo.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the camera's crawl through a drawing room at the
start of this Spanish film begins to bore you: not a good sign.
Count Don Rodrigo (Fernando Fernan-Gomez), the penniless patriarch
of a noble family visits an estate that once belonged to his
family. It's now owned by former servants, whose petty treatment of
the old man reflects the film's class-conscious, conservative
politics. In Spanish with subtitles. (SM) 2 hours, 27 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinevere'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Rea, Sarah Polley
</P>
<P>
   and Jean Smart.
</P>
<P>
   A college grad (Sarah Polley) moves in with a 50-ish bohemian
photographer (Stephen Rea) who's made a career out of introducing
much younger women to the joys of sex, Sartre, jazz, art, etc. But
what sounds like grist for a feminist diatribe against our
culture's wink-wink approval of such liaisons is actually a sweet,
rueful love letter. The writing and direction is sharp as a tack
and the acting is gorgeous. (ERG)1 hour, 47 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeremy Northam,
</P>
<P>
   Steve Zahn and William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon get ``Happy.'' This sunny crowd-pleaser stars Jeremy
Northam and Steve Zahn as escaped convicts who hide out in a small
town by posing as a gay couple who stage beauty pageants for little
girls. A last-minute plot device is a bad idea, but by then the
picture has built up so much good will you can't help but go along.
The cast is excellent, especially William H. Macy as the sheriff.
(ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe the King'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Noah Fleiss
</P>
<P>
   and Val Kilmer.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy is the head that wears the crown in this ``400 Blows''
wannabe. Actor-turned-filmmaker Frank Whaley has fashioned a
hopeless memoir about growing up in the '70s with an abusive,
alcoholic father (Val Kilmer). Noah Fleiss is good in his role as
the neglected, rebellious adolescent. But the movie strikes one
note _ a blend of blighted poignancy and stark injustice _ and
stays there. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Limey'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Terence Stamp
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   A Cockney ex-con (Terence Stamp) comes to L.A. to avenge the
supposedly accidental death of his daughter. He hones in on a slimy
record producer (Peter Fonda). Plotwise, this is a revenge movie,
but thematically, it's an off-beat meditation on the nature of
Hollywood, especially what's left of '60s Hollywood as it demands
attention from an increasingly disinterested '90s Hollywood. Both
stars are superb. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Music of the Heart'' PG (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Meryl Streep
</P>
<P>
   and Angela Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   The Meryl Streep Show _ and what a show it is. Streep and
director Wes Craven (``Scream,'') have delivered a rarity: an
inspirational movie that is actually inspirational. The film
follows a single mom (Streep) who overcomes reluctant kids,
confrontational parents and an indifferent school board in her
battle to teach violin to inner-city kids. It's a glorified
TV-movie, but it's got Streep and that's all it needs. (ERG)2
hours, 3 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``My Life So Far'' PG-13 (sexual content and nude pictures)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Colin Firth,
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio
</P>
<P>
   and Irene Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   If this story of a 10-year-old boy and his family had the
emotional charge to match its gorgeous Scottish scenery, it could
be a small classic. But under the pretty-but-prim direction of Hugh
Hudson (``Chariots of Fire''), it's not much more than a twee
highland travelogue. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code'' PG-13 (several scenes of shootings)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Casper Van Dien,
</P>
<P>
   Michael York, Catherine Oxenberg
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Ironside.
</P>
<P>
   Michael York and Casper Van Dien star in this overly talkative
tale reminiscent of the book of Revelation. As wealthy businessman
Stone Alexander, York steals and uses a secret biblical code to
effect a world takeover. The hammy Van Dien plays Gillen Lane, a
glam gadabout and motivational leader who uncovers York's plot and
must act to save the globe. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 39 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Random Hearts'' R (violence, sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Harrison Ford
</P>
<P>
   and Kristin Scott Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   A meandering mystery/drama/romance that never hits the right
groove. Harrison Ford is a cop and Kristin Scott Thomas a
congresswoman who discover their spouses, both killed in a plane
crash, were having an affair. The stars' ensuing romance never taps
beneath the surface. (SM) 2 hours, 11 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy:
</P>
<P>
   The Magic Box'' Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Siegfried Fischbacher
</P>
<P>
   and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Cirque du Surreal. Siegfried and Roy _ those
hocus-pocus, Las Vegas glam guys _ star in this dumbfoundingly
watchable 3-D Imax that's girded like some weird Wagnerian opera.
Elephants disappear. Furry white tigers leap over your head. Giant
metal dragons spew fire. Obviously, the concept of garish didn't
die with Liberace. (Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Us'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis
</P>
<P>
   and Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rob Reiner's breezy, laugh a lot, cry a lot, big hankie
of a movie with Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer as a couple
wondering if they'll survive after 15 years of marriage. It's a
steady stream of sex jokes, butt jokes and guy and gal pals
dispensing weak-willed truisms. It may not be deep, but it is
entertaining. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 38 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Suburbans'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Craig Bierko
</P>
<P>
   and Donald Lardner Ward.
</P>
<P>
   A bland project that can't decide whether it's a music-biz
satire or a midlife-crisis comedy-drama, ``The Suburbans'' concerns
a one-hit-wonder teenage band from 1981 (named the Suburbans) that
gets rediscovered by a music industry executive, played by Jennifer
Love Hewitt, who wants to market their retro-music to the
``post-boomer, pre-millennial demographic.'' (SM) 1 hour, 21
minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar'' PG-13 (sex-related humor and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Molly Shannon,
</P>
<P>
   Will Ferrell and Elaine Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Saturday Night Live'' big-screen transfer that doesn't bite.
As the ebullient Catholic schoolgirl Mary Katherine Gallagher,
Molly Shannon delivers a memorable mix of adolescent brazenness and
self-mortification. It's clear Shannon loves this character, but
she's never afraid to push the envelope of outrageousness, whether
talking baby talk to her breasts, or fantasizing that a tree is her
lover. (SM) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Third Man'' Not rated but there is implied violence.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Cotten
</P>
<P>
   and Orson Welles.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be missed. To honor its 50th anniversary, Carol Reed's
cynical, gorgeously photographed film noir has been re-released in
a spruced-up print that adds 11 minutes. In post-war Vienna, a
well-intentioned American (Joseph Cotten) tries to solve the
mysterious death of his old pal Harry Lime (Orson Welles.) Funny
and smartly acted, Reed's thriller is a bittersweet eulogy for a
long-gone idealism. (ERG) 1 hour, 34 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Renee Russo's film. As the
solo investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring
a smart, sexed-up character. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' R (graphic war violence, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney,
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube play three U.S.
soldiers in the Persian Gulf War who go after Saddam Hussein's
stolen Kuwaiti gold. Their consciences are tested when they see
anti-Saddam civilians rounded up by Iraqi soldiers. While the
film's script cynically bashes George Bush's political stance, its
visuals pop with energy. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 51 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Three to Tango'' PG-13 (sex-related situations
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Perry,
</P>
<P>
   Neve Campbell and Dylan McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   A perfectly pleasant extended sitcom trumped up with TV stars
and begging for belly laughs. Matthew Perry (``Friends'') headlines
this mostly slapstick, throwaway love story about Oscar Novack, a
heterosexual Chicago architect who everybody thinks is gay. The
comedy is mostly a physical joke: spastic running, tripping over
coat trees, accidental pokes in the crotch and just plain barfing.
(Bob Longino) 1 hour, 38 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some Imax films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again. (Jill
Vejnoska)41 minutes. B-

 &HT;    Settle into the past at quiet B&AMP;B on Chesapeake
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 31
 &HT;    By Susan Laccetti Meyers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. MICHAELS, Md. _ As I'm lying in bed with the windows open,
dawn breaks and an orange sky illuminates the Chesapeake Bay.
Seventeen swans float by the barrier rocks that separate the grassy
property from the water _ just 30 yards from my window. Three
stragglers swim by a minute or two later, then two more of these
graceful beauties.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly, I see a handful of sailboats cruising by. Despite the
lack of wind, they're heading for a day of sailing on the navy
waters of the mighty Chesapeake.
</P>
<P>
   The view from this room at the Wades Point Inn is no different
from 100 years ago, when Wades Point became a popular summer resort
for Maryland-area elite. Today it is a relaxing, affordable
bed-and-breakfast inn, a 90-minute drive from the Washing-
</P>
<P>
   ton-Baltimore-Annapolis corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Wades Point is also a great home base to explore the Eastern
Shore of Maryland, an area rich in Colonial history and boasting
some of the best seafood (especially crab cakes), sailing and
cycling on this part of the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, urban sprawl has not consumed the fabled Eastern
Shore. The Chesapeake serves as a natural barrier, and despite the
Chesapeake Bay Bridge, the Eastern Shore and Wades Point have
remained somewhat isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Wades Point Inn is on the outskirts of the vintage port town of
St. Michaels. The 120-acre estate was dedicated by the king of
England as a land grant to Zachary Wade, an early British explorer
of Maryland, in 1657. The house was not built until 1819, when the
farm and natural area along the bay were purchased by Baltimore
shipbuilder Thomas Kemp of clipper ship fame.
</P>
<P>
   Additions made to the house in 1890 include the rustic summer
wing where I lodged. For almost a century, Wades Point served as a
summer resort and guest house. The present owners turned it into an
inn in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Wades Point is pleasing not only because of its views _ all 23
rooms face the bay _ but because of its isolation down a country
lane. Hosts Betsy and John Feiler, who don't go out of their way to
chat it up with the guests, offer visitors a map of the waterfront
farm. You can take a walk on the nature trail and see the old
family cemetery, crops (organic soybeans, corn, tomatoes) and farm
animals, including chickens and goats.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife you may spot include deer, rabbits, raccoons,
terrapins, eagles, herons, egrets, geese and ospreys. A red fox
startled me as I hiked the one-mile nature trail one morning,
crossing 10 yards ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After exploring the two-story home _ with its many balconies,
aging porches, Colonial art and antiques _ guests are always drawn
to the water. Here, you can settle into an Adirondack chair and
pass the day soaking in the changing scenery on the bay. Or you can
fish or crab off the inn's pier.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Not much scares British actor Bob Hoskins.
 &HT;    Actually, he's usually the one who does the scaring _ with a
series of almost impossibly diverse roles, he's become a maestro of
menace on the big screen, though he's also proven that he can be
sweet and tender if the role calls for it.
 &HT;    But even maestros of menace have their fears, and Hoskins admits
that he was plenty scared when he met Atom Egoyan, the Cairo-born,
Canadian-based director of Hoskins' newest film, ``Felicia's
Journey.''
 &HT;    Egoyan, the independent filmmaker who won rave reviews for his
dark drama ``The Sweet Hereafter'' (1998), wanted Hoskins to play a
serial killer who preys on young prostitutes.
 &HT;    ``Atom knew I expected to meet this intense Armenian, which is
the perceived reputation he has through his films,'' Hoskins
recalls during an interview at the recent Toronto Film Festival.
``So, the moment we were introduced, he came on like Bela Lugosi.
He was babbling on about how he wanted me to find the soul of the
character, all the time riveting his eyes on me. He frightened the
life out of me.
 &HT;    ``Then he started to laugh. He was sending me up, and he could
see it had worked,'' Hoskins says with a laugh. ``At that moment I
knew I had to work with him.''
 &HT;    Hoskins may not have known what to expect from Egoyan, but he
was under no illusions about ``Felicia's Journey,'' a dark
psychological thriller about a lonely, middle-aged bachelor named
Hilditch (Hoskins), who conceals his inner torment as he befriends
a young girl (Elaine Cassidy) who has come to an industrial area of
England to track down the father of her baby.
 &HT;    ``I'd read the novel when it first came out. `Felicia's Journey'
is every parent's worst nightmare, especially if you have daughters
_ and I have two,'' says Hoskins, who has been married to
schoolteacher Linda Banwell since 1982.
 &HT;    The scariest aspect of the story, Hoskins says, is that
``monsters like Hilditch exist all over the place. England has more
than its fair share. I've met men like him _ they're nice, boring
people who seem so noble, kind and caring. You just know there are
some dark recesses in their lives.''
 &HT;    Exploring those dark recesses was tricky business, the actor
adds. It would have been easy to have gone over the edge into
slasher-movie excess, or to have been so realistic as to be boring.
 &HT;    ``It was a bit like building a house of matches without any
glue,'' he says. ``It's so delicate that, at any moment, everything
could fall apart.''
 &HT;    It was Egoyan who ultimately supplied that glue, Hoskins adds.
 &HT;    ``He didn't treat the material simply as a thriller, which is
what most directors would have done,'' the actor says. ``Instead,
Atom wanted to show that both Hilditch and Felicia are victims _
she is a victim of his kindness, he is a victim of her innocence.
He's an emotional cripple, very, very damaged, and Atom and I
discussed his different mental states.''
 &HT;    Always a versatile actor, Hoskins continues to tackle a wide
variety of roles, with ``Felicia's Journey'' _ which will open Nov.
12 _ representing possibly his best chance of picking up a second
Oscar nomination to match his nod for ``Mona Lisa'' (1986). He's
one of the busiest international actors around, but he remains
devoutly devoid of prima-donna attitude.
 &HT;    ``There is always a huge separation between my work and my
life,'' he says.
 &HT;    Actually, Hoskins says, he's an accidental actor. One evening in
London, back in the 1960s, he tagged along when a pal went to a pub
to try out for a local theatrical group. The director suggested
that Hoskins also audition. He got the part, and has never looked
back.
 &HT;    ``The moment I stepped on the stage for the first performance, I
knew I was supposed to be an actor,'' he says. ``That stage was the
most peaceful place on Earth.''
 &HT;    The barrel-chested Cockney credits his pal Michael Caine with
breaking down class barriers for actors in Britain, thereby making
Hoskins' own ascent possible.
 &HT;    ``He opened doors for people like me who dropped their Hs and
didn't speak in Shakespearean, stentorian tones,'' he says. ``There
was a time when, as soon as you opened your mouth, they'd lock up
the silver and send the women upstairs.''
 &HT;    Hoskins has moved well beyond playing Cockneys, however. He
played a Napoleonic London mobster in ``The Long Good Friday''
(1979) and a tough-guy private detective in ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit?'' (l988). He was a genial Smee in Steven Spielberg's
``Hook'' (1991) and a gay J. Edgar Hoover in Oliver Stone's
``Nixon'' (1995). He's played both Mussolini and Churchill, and
essays another former world leader in Showtime's ``Noriega: God's
Favorite,'' which will air next year.
 &HT;    Playing Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega was a stretch for
Hoskins, especially in Roger Spottiswoode's intricate film, which
is told in flashbacks after Noriega, surrounded by American troops
and tanks, has taken refuge in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City.
 &HT;    The style is darkly comic, which is pretty much the way Hoskins
recalls his first dinner with Spottiswoode.
 &HT;    ``He told me, `Listen, Bob, this was the ugliest man in South
America,''' the actor recalls. ```He was a total megalomaniac, an
appalling man, and you are the only actor in the world that can
play it.'
 &HT;    ``I didn't know whether to be flattered or to hit him.''
 &HT;    But after reading the script, Hoskins says, he realized that
Noriega was ``absolutely insane.''
 &HT;    ``Insanity has always attracted me,'' the actor says cheerfully.
``He was quite a ridiculous figure. He was funny _ I mean, whether
the audience like him more because he's funny, it's up to them. I
just played what was there.
 &HT;    ``But what interested me about this character was that he was
capable of every kind of extreme,'' he adds, ``extreme cruelty and
extreme violence and extreme tenderness at the same time. And it
was great to play all those elements.
 &HT;    ``I love playing bad guys,'' he concludes with a smile. ``Good
guys are boring.''
 &HT;    Well, maybe not all good guys. Surely Hoskins would offer an
exemption to the character he only recently finished playing, in a
film recently shot in Spain for Turner Network Television and due
to air early next year. It's a part Hoskins seems born to take on:
the loyal-if-befuddled Sancho Panza to John Lithgow's ``Don
Quixote.''

<P>
   Crossing the Sunshine Skyway Bridge never failed to depress Max
Timlin, even on this perfect morning when squadrons of brown
pelicans flew across a sky so blue it looked digitally enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate nature!'' he screamed at the windshield and smacked the
palm of his hand against the steering wheel so hard it stung.
</P>
<P>
   Max sat in his dream car, a 1965 Mustang convertible, black with
a cream-colored interior, purchased as a consolation prize after
his second divorce. The top was down, and as he gunned the car's
famous oversized 289 engine, a balmy breeze became a windstorm that
whipped through the ravaged wasteland that once was his hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate nature, I really do,'' he said calmly now, and clicked
on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   It was tuned to 92.1, the ``Rock Till You Drop'' station, but
instead of the Stones he got the whiny voice of Skeeter Davis,
``Don't they know, it's the end of the world? It ended when you
said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned the tuner in disgust to National Public Radio only to
hear some windbag doctor singing the praises of another new miracle
drug to cure male impotence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to revive a lot of dead marriages,'' said the
voice with an ugly little laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too late for me,'' thought Max, whose male potency drug of
choice had always been the Apalachicola Bay oyster. Suddenly his
favorite restaurants stopped serving them or served them with
doomsday warnings: ``If you eat these oysters, you'll enjoy the
hell out of them, but then they'll make you sick and you'll die.
Still hungry?''
</P>
<P>
   As he flipped a few random stalks of dirty blond hair out of his
blue eyes, his hand brushed against the scar on his forehead, a
result of a surgical procedure to remove skin cancer, basal cell
carcinoma. It was his sixth, nothing more than a disfiguring
nuisance, he thought, adding some twists and turns to the road map
of his face.
</P>
<P>
   His dermatologist would be furious to know that Max was riding
with the top down, but Max would not deprive himself of one of his
few remaining pleasures. He never worshipped the sun, but as a
teen-ager he had suffered from pizza-face acne, a condition his
parents hoped to ameliorate with weekly treatments under a sun
lamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that burning and peeling may have helped your acne,'' said
Dr. Fishbine, some 35 years later, ``but they also gave you skin
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame it on the hole in the ozone, said the mischievous
doctor, blame it on your parents.
</P>
<P>
   Fishbine explained how years ago there were these shoe stores
called ``X-Ray'' shoes. You'd put your new shoes on and then slip
your feet into an X-ray machine to see how the shoes fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing we don't have a generation of people whose toes
are falling off,'' said Fishbine. ``How many things have we thought
were really good for us,'' he said, ``and they turned out to be
really bad?''
</P>
<P>
   Max thought about a generation of men taking male potency drugs.
Who could predict what one day would fall off?
</P>
<P>
   He was at the top of the Skyway now, and his mood darkened.
Forget the view of the Gulf of Mexico flowing into Tampa Bay, and
forget the bright white triangles of sailboats, followed by
dolphins at play. All he could remember now _ he shuddered when he
thought about it _ was that this was the spot in 1980 that the old
bridge was hit by a huge oil tanker.
</P>
<P>
   Blinded by gale-force winds, the harbor pilot steered the Summit
Venture into the Skyway, a sledgehammer crushing a sculpture made
of toothpicks. Much of the towering bridge was destroyed, and 35
people, most of them on a Greyhound bus, rode over the jagged end
of the bridge on a collective bungee jump without a cord, more than
175 feet down to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It took years and millions of dollars, but they built a
beautiful new bridge, one with a system of bumpers to protect
against runaway tankers.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge was so attractive, in fact, that more than 60 people
had killed themselves jumping off of it, nine in the last six
months alone. They were young and old, rich and poor, black and
white, straight and gay, drunk and sober, all coming and parking
and climbing the rail and looking down and letting go and falling
into that eternity or abyss that, in the end, is the only equality
the world offers.
</P>
<P>
   The last guy to jump tried to take his dog with him, but the
Rottweiler, named Daisy, survived. Max had tried to adopt that dog,
but the county didn't think, with his lifestyle, that he could give
the dog a good home. Why couldn't he get that Skeeter Davis song
out of his head?
</P>
<P>
   As he crossed the bridge north into St. Petersburg, he couldn't
rid himself of a pervasive sense of dread that the good things in
his life were behind him, that his hopes and aspirations had
expired, that he was driving off the 18th tee after playing a
miserable round.
</P>
<P>
   He was bright enough to recognize these as middle-aged angst, he
knew the Mustang was part of that, but they combined now in 1999,
with the end of a decade, the end of a century, the end of a
millennium. He was tired of things ending: his youth, his
marriages, his reporting job in Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he was headed to St. Pete Beach, to meet a man named
K.J. Banks, a new editor with the Florida Sun, a newspaper Max very
much admired. Max had received an e-mail message the day before
asking him to meet Banks at the Gold Coin on a stretch of beach
called Pass-a-Grille, where, legend has it, pirates once landed to
grill their meat and drink their rum. The pirates were replaced by
tourists, the meat by grouper and shrimp, the rum by margaritas and
pina coladas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet me at 11,'' said the message. ``I've heard good things
about your work and know you are at loose ends. We can have a late
breakfast or early lunch. _ K.J. Banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Max had been speeding, and the traffic was light, so he arrived
early. He remembered the Gold Coin from years ago, a delightful
little hole-in-the-wall now replaced by a grotesque three-story bar
with connecting restaurants, lounges and discos.
</P>
<P>
   He sat at a patio table overlooking the Gulf and waved at the
sea gulls diving at scraps left behind by previous customers. Max
pointed his finger and cocked his thumb at one and made a sound as
if he was firing a gun. K-choww! The noise scared the gull away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice shot,'' said a woman's voice. Max turned and looked up to
see the figure of a tall woman standing between him and a blazing
sun. He shaded his eyes to block out the sunlight not already
eclipsed by a crown of dark wavy hair. She stepped aside so Max
could see her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Max, I'm K.J. Banks. My friends call me Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   From experience, she knew that he was expecting a man, an
old-fart of an editor with patches on his sleeves and nicotine
stains on his fingers, or maybe one of those young corporate types
with the hundred-dollar haircuts and thousand-dollar suits. She
enjoyed his surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Max stood to shake her hand, which met his firmly. She looked
like someone famous, Susan Sarandon, maybe, but not the voluptuous
Atlantic City lemon-bath model. The woman before him was his age,
perhaps, but not _ like him _ a burnt-out shell of a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a tan pantsuit over a white silk blouse, she looked
healthy and successful and could project both intelligence and
humor in a single ironic smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come with a proposition,'' she said, still shaking his
hand, ``and I know you won't disappoint me.''

<P>
   ``Do you like the movies, Max?'' said Kate Banks as if she were
going to ask him on a date.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a trick question, and he wondered if there was a
right answer. Maybe she was going to offer him a job as a movie
critic. He had filled in years ago for an aging critic recovering
from retinal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   At first Max had liked the idea of taking this little vacation
from real journalism, until the Christmas week he had to view 12
films _ no, not films, movies _ in six days. It turned his eyes to
black holes, his mind to mush, and his fingers to stone, and it
made him increasingly cranky about each movie, so that the ones he
saw early in the week got five stars, down to three, down to one,
down to a minus 2 for a Barbra Streisand flick, a grade his editor
refused to register.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just run the wire synopsis,'' she said, and never asked
him to review again.
</P>
<P>
   Max later came to see that time as an emblem for his life, that
experiences once chosen freely and with joy became soured by
obligation. It had happened with his two marriages and a cycle of
newspaper jobs. He wondered why this woman _ he was suddenly
intimidated by her _ would be interested in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I like the movies, especially the old ones, so I mostly
rent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your favorite movie, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked the early Bond flicks, but I'd be hard
pressed to choose between `Goldfinger' and `Thunderball.' How about
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My three older brothers would take me to the movies almost
every Saturday, and they liked the horror and monster movies, and
they would scare me to death, so that I would be crouching down
between the seats and looking with one eye through the cracks. My
favorite was `Godzilla,' the one with 10,000 Japanese actors and
extras and Raymond Burr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big lizard is back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, Max, that's what bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   She stopped talking for a minute and took a dragon-sized bite
from a blackened grouper sandwich, and wiped a stream of sauce from
the corner of her lip with the back of her hand. Max decided that
he liked her, even though he could not imagine where this
conversation was going or what she wanted of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese released `Godzilla' in 1954,'' she said, ``a
decade after we dropped the atomic bomb on them.''
</P>
<P>
   She reminded Max that the movie was about a prehistoric monster
brought back to life by the testing of hydrogen bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched all the sequels, Max: `Godzilla vs. the Thing,'
`Godzilla vs. King Kong,' `Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster,' `Godzilla
vs. the Smog Monster,' `Rodan,' `Mothra,' I couldn't get enough.
When I got older, my friends told themselves I was being weird or
ironic, that I thought movies dubbed badly into English were funny.
But they weren't funny to me, Max. They weren't funny because
underneath all the rubber monster suits, they were all about
Hiroshima and mushroom clouds and radiation and mutations and, the
destruction of cities and civilizations, and the end of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing what to say, Max took a long slug from his glass of
ice tea and leaned forward as if about to hear the solution to some
ancient puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla's back, Max. You can't go to the freakin' movies
anymore without something destroying the world. If it isn't
lizards, it's dinosaurs. It if it isn't dinosaurs, it's aliens. If
it isn't aliens, it's comets, or meteorites, or asteroids. Next
thing it'll be hemorrhoids.''
</P>
<P>
   Max coughed and let out a laugh, and Kate Banks was laughing
too, and she took off her sunglasses, and revealed eyes so dark you
couldn't make out the pupils. She was close to his age, the
wrinkles around her eyes told that story, but the eyes themselves
were bright and youthful. This woman, 30 years ago, might have
inspired Van Morrison to write a song.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about `Titanic?''' he asked. ``A nice, sweet love
story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about the love story, Max. The ocean and the dark sky
full of stars _ that's the universe. The ship is the world. The
poor people are in the bottom, the rich on top. But nothing can
save them. Not hope, ambition, money, or technology. The ship goes
down, Max. The world goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   She took a breath and changed her tone, back from the doomsday
prophet to the teaching editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sitting here on the beach Max, and God has not made a
more perfect day, and it's the middle of 1999, the last year of a
decade, the last year of a century, the last year of a millennium.
Do you know what that word means, Max, I mean the Latin roots?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I was an altar boy once. It means a thousand years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And how about the word millenarian?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that someone who is a thousand years old or someone who
makes women's hats?''
</P>
<P>
   She knew he was joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``A millenarian is someone who is waiting for the world to end.
Who looks for a date like the year 2000 and expects the end will
come, that history, time, life as we know it, is over. In the eyes
of these people, any bad things that happen are signs of the last
days. Floods. Famines. War. A bear market. A shooting star. Or Ken
Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   To his surprise, she reached over across the table and grabbed
one of his hands with her hand, pressed her nails into his flesh
and looked him straight in the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes these people are not just waiting for things to
happen. They want the world to end, and they can't wait for God to
make it happen. They're ready to take action themselves. They lead
others astray.''
</P>
<P>
   She read his look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not paranoid, Max. I know what I'm talking about. It
happened with Jonestown and Waco and Oklahoma City. And I think
it's happening again _ and I think it's happening here _ now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want from me, Kate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know your work, Max. You're not afraid of dangerous stories.
You covered the narco-terrorists in Miami. And everyone knows that
you were responsible for bringing to justice the church burners in
Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Max shook his head modestly. Like other reporters he found it
hard to give or receive praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever heard of a group called The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Weren't they a rock group from the British Invasion?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're thinking of The Searchers. They did `Needles and Pins.'
The Watchers are an international group that set up shop in town
about two years ago, and word is they are recruiting young people,
and that their numbers are growing. I want you to investigate them
for me. Here's everything you'll need to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   She reached into her purse and pulled out a silver key and a
single black computer disk and placed them carefully in his hand.

   LAST INSTALLMANT: Max and Kate discuss why every movie seems to
be about the end of the world, then Kate offers Max a job
investigating a millennium cult called The Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a perfect morning, and no one was more surprised
at his cheeriness than Max Timlin. He was not a morning person _ or
an afternoon person, or an evening person, for that matter. But on
this summer morning, his coffee was strong and sweet, the breeze
off the Gulf was comforting, and an item in the morning paper made
him laugh:
</P>
<P>
   Television evangelist Curtis Woodson criticized the city of
Orlando for permitting gays and lesbians to carry rainbow-colored
banners, symbolizing diversity, in a Fourth of July parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no prophet,'' said Woodson, ``but I would not be waving
those flags in God's face if I were you. It'll bring about
terrorist bombs; it'll bring earthquakes, tornadoes and possibly a
meteor!''
</P>
<P>
   Max did not like Orlando much _ too much traffic, and too many
mouse ears. He chuckled at the idea of a meteor striking a theme
park, and how quickly it would take Disney to turn the huge crater
into a new attraction.
</P>
<P>
   He was still laughing _ he was almost giddy _ as he stood,
stretched, and leaned forward on the balcony rail. He looked to the
left and could see the Skyway Bridge, close enough to make out tiny
cars heading south.
</P>
<P>
   One week ago, he lived on that side of the bridge, but now he
had a new place on St. Pete Beach. Kate Banks, editor of the
Florida Sun, had handed him a key to a condo on a stretch of sand
called Land's End.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gorgeous place, with cathedral ceilings, polished wood
floors, and expensive Florida art on the walls. He had never lived
anyplace like it. The place had two huge bedrooms, each with a
bath, one bath with a hot tub, a fancy office, a well-stocked
kitchen, and a living room extended onto a balcony with a
fifth-story view of the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   If the world was about to end, this was the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   That thought slapped him sober, like the old after-shave
commercial, and reminded him of why he was here. He had accepted a
strange proposal from Kate Banks, to investigate a group of
doomsday types called The Watchers. That was not so strange _ he'd
investigated and written about wackos and Wacos before. He
considered it a specialty. But Kate had added some stipulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to work out of my beach condo, not the newspaper
office. I live in a great old house not far from the paper. You can
phone me there. Only two people at the paper besides me will know
you are on the job: a photographer and a researcher. Here are their
names and numbers. You'll love working with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the secrecy, Kate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may remember that we won a Pulitzer in the 1970s for
covering the activities of the Science of God cult. They
infiltrated the newspaper. Stole files. Gathered dirt on the
reporters and editors, not a hard thing to do as it turns out, and
are still, after all these years, a pain in the butt. So just think
of us as a little gun-shy.''
</P>
<P>
   Max was not to come into the Florida Sun at any time. He could
access the newspaper's files and records electronically. The condo
office was completely wired. He could call Kate with any special
needs, and she would visit him once a week to check on him, and to
deliver his pay _ in cash.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed more than cautious to Max; it seemed paranoid. But he
was not about to complain. He had a wallet bursting with money,
paradise for a pad, and, most important, a story to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Max reached into a desk drawer for an unlabeled black disk and
slid it into the slot in his computer. He called up a file named
``Leader.'' A color image slowly rolled from top to bottom until it
filled the screen and sharpened into focus. It was the face of a
man in his early 40s, perhaps a bit older. He had black wavy hair
atop an oval face. The jaw was strong, a cleft in the chin. The
eyes were narrow, deep-set, and dark brown, framed by dark brows.
The complexion was very pale, almost white.
</P>
<P>
   The full effect was severe, even threatening, except for the
smile, which was wide and inviting, so wide you were tempted to
count the teeth.
</P>
<P>
   A text file revealed that this was Raoul Glaber, sometimes
called Roy Glaber, the founder and leader of The Watchers. There
was little known about Glaber outside of his association with his
religious group. He seemed almost like a man without a history. He
had turned down many requests for interviews, and became
increasingly reclusive, even as the work of The Watchers became
more public.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Banks was right. This was, by all its manifestations, a
millenarian group. From its creation, in 1977, Glaber had targeted
the year 2000 as climactic and apocalyptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day is coming,'' he had written in an early pamphlet
``when the world as we know it will be shaken to its foundations.
The house of this world will crumble so that a new house can be
created. We will watch for the signs of the new world. We watch for
signs in the heavens, and for signs in the hearts of men. We, The
Watchers, will be ready when the Great Day comes. The date of the
Great Day is no mystery, but comes into our sight, only 23 years
down a narrow road which will end at a bridge which will cross from
a dark, decaying world into a bright new one.''
</P>
<P>
   Max clicked on an audio file enabling him to hear the voice of
Raoul Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will come as a thief in the night,'' the voice said,
evoking what sounded like a biblical text familiar to Max. ``Woe
unto you who are working in the fields. Woe unto you if you are
great with child. Woe unto you who are not watching and waiting,
waiting and watching. For only those who watch will be ready, and
only those who are ready will cross over to a world remade. A world
washed in water. A world washed in fire. A world washed in blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Max was mesmerized. His mind carried him back to a fifth-grade
class in Catholic School when Brother Brian Mahoney played
recordings of speeches by Hitler. Max didn't understand German, of
course, but the rising and falling intonations of the speaker
hypnotized and energized at the same time. When Der Fuhrer reached
a crescendo, the crowd roared _ how many people would it take to
raise such a cheer? When the recording ended, it snapped Max out of
what seemed like a trance.
</P>
<P>
   Then Brother Brian explained that this man had used his gift of
oratory for an evil purpose, to kill millions and millions of
people he hated: Jews, Gypsies, political opponents, homosexuals,
the physically handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Brian turned off the lights. For a dramatic minute the
room remained dark until he clicked on a slide projector. On a
white wall flashed image after image from something he called a
``concentration camp'': piles of skeletal bodies ready for plowing
into a mass grave, soldiers pointing rifles at terrified children,
naked women, old and young, being herded into a brick buildings,
living corpses standing behind barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   Raoul Glaber's oratory had the same mesmerizing effect as
Hitler's_ but with one important difference: Glaber didn't sound as
if he were speaking to thousands upon thousands. His voice was not
thunder, but a zephyr. He sounded as if he were talking to one
person. He sounded, Max thought, as if he were whispering in your
ear. The Serpent in the Garden.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max begins his research on The Watchers, and
their charismatic and menacing leader, Raoul Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max Timlin couldn't remember a better meal, or a more congenial
partner, Ralph Rizzo, an iconoclastic Catholic priest with an
appetite for Cuban food. Their hunger brought them this Saturday
night to a favorite eatery, No Dinero, in the historic Ybor City
district of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Father Rizzo was one of several friends Max had met in St. Pete,
people he had written about while working in Gainesville, Miami and
Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was known for his dogged investigations, tracking
down bad guys, Max was no cynic. He knew that cynic was the Greek
word for ``dog.'' It was true, Max liked dogs, and sometimes felt
like a 14-year-old bloodhound, his best hunting days behind him,
but with a nose that could still pick up a scent.
</P>
<P>
   But Max was no cynic. In his own view of things, he was a
skeptic. A cynic could not believe that human beings were capable
of goodness. A skeptic doubted they were, but was always willing to
be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your mother says she loves you,'' Max would quote an old
newspaper saying, ``check it out.'' But if it checks out, send her
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   There were no saints and no heroes, thought Max, but there were
people of virtue and they were worth writing about. Sometimes he
had to fight his editors to make sure the story didn't get buried
deep in the paper, with the tire ads. But Max was stubborn and
liked the challenge of going against the grain.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of stories, ``Breach of Trust,'' came out about
priests and ministers who molested children, Max did a profile of
Father Ralph Rizzo, who in Max's words, ``combined the intellect
and sensibilities of a college metaphysics professor with the guts
and instincts of a union leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Ralph, Brooklyn-born and the son of a longshoreman and a
schoolteacher, had abandoned university teaching and scholarly
writing for community organizing. He preached that there were only
two ways of reforming institutions: ``through the ear or up the
rear.'' He was good at both approaches.
</P>
<P>
   In five years, he had set up a free medical clinic, a food bank,
an AIDS hospice, a last-chance school for dropouts and an emergency
shelter for runaway teens. One television reporter dubbed him
``Father Teresa.'' Ralph bloodied his nose. This act won him
national attention, and no few admirers. Father Ralph was 62 years
old, wore a halo of curly, snow-white hair, and weighed about 140
pounds, but you didn't mess with him. He was Billy Martin in a
cassock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph, you ever heard of The Watchers?'' Max and Ralph began
their postprandial stroll down Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doomsday cult, no doubt about it,'' said Ralph. ``We've seen
kids at the shelter with Watcher T-shirts, even one with a `W'
tattooed on his arm. It's a sin to lure young people into something
like that, Max. These children need comfort and hope. When you're
16 and addicted to crack and HIV positive and living on the street,
it's pretty easy to believe that the world is coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe it, Ralph? I mean that something big is about
to happen. In the year 2000?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max. Read the gospel. Jesus says the Kingdom is now. If you
don't believe me, ask the Man Himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Max looked down the street to see a man
surprisingly like Jesus in appearance, long brown hair and full
beard, a robe made of rough tan cloth, tied at the waist with a
rope. The man wore sandals. And, here was the real tip-off. He was
carrying a cross.
</P>
<P>
   The cross bore written messages, on both the vertical and cross
beams. ``Unless a man be born again in water and the spirit,''
``The Kingdom of God is at hand,'' and ``God so loved the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, on the long street in the heart of Ybor spread a
scene that was ripe for redemption. Hundreds of tourists,
teen-agers, music lovers and street people patrolled a district
that tried hard for a Bourbon Street effect, but came up
considerably short.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Ybor was without its charms. Once the bustling center
of the Cuban-American cigar industry, Ybor still projected a quirky
ethnicity, including Latin dance clubs and wonderful little
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Max and Father Ralph were sluggish from a feast of chicken and
rice, washed down with too much sangria, and polished off with a
delicious custard desert, and some sips of strong Cuban coffee.
</P>
<P>
   But as they made their way down the street, they walked past
strip clubs and tattoo parlors and thrift stores that gave the
place a seedier, more Bohemian flair. Father Ralph loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people Jesus would be hanging with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On one corner stood a nameless shop that sold holy objects,
blending traditional Catholic candles and sacramentals with the
trappings of voodoo and Santeria.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street was a nudie bar called Anytime Atoll, a garish
storefront awash in neon lights the color of lilacs. A young woman,
her hair dyed shoe-polish black and packed into a black-leather
body suit, stood, looking bored, in the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you look at that,'' said Father Ralph. ``That young girl
has implants. I'd bet my collar on it.'' He wasn't wearing one.
``God gave that woman a beautiful body, and look whats she's done
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the kind of offbeat perspective that Max found charming
about Ralph. In fact, an evening with Father Ralph was enough to
tempt even as lapsed a Catholic as Max back into the fold. ``Check
this out, Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   A framed newspaper clipping in the window reminded passers-by
that this club was the home of an exotic dancer named Thrill Hills,
a woman who boasted a 65-25-35 figure.
</P>
<P>
   A Tampa man was suing her for a ``whiplash injury incurred at a
bachelor party, where the curvaceous Ms. Hills allegedly whacked
him on the head with the most pendulous parts of her anatomy.''
Even Ralph was speechless.
</P>
<P>
   Down the block they stopped at a shop called The Branding Iron,
which might best be described as a tattoo and body piercing
factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baptism leaves an indelible mark upon the soul,'' said Ralph.
But why would someone want to leave indelible marks upon the body?
``Perhaps I can understand it in the young, given their desire to
set themselves apart as members of a group, but look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   They stared at a photograph in the front window _ three women of
three different generations with matching rose tattoos on their
butts. A caption said they were grandmother, mother and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to all this, a sidewalk Jesus seemed almost normal, so
Max and Ralph rushed over to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a hundred dollars a night, plus tips,'' said the man,
who, after brief conversation, said his real name was Jacob
Coleman. He wore Birkenstock sandals. ``I'm Jewish,'' he offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``So was Jesus,'' said Father Ralph, ``a good Jewish boy, real
name Joshua, with a wonderful Jewish mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then it happened. The front doors of The Branding Iron
burst open, almost as if there had been an explosion, and a group
of about a dozen young people rocketed out, so loud and so animated
they seemed part of the same reptilian organism, like Medusa's
head.
</P>
<P>
   The overall impression was black and white, boys and girls,
shaved heads, pierced nostrils, and serpentine tattoos. One carried
a music blaster, and it played something that sounded less like
music than a jagged, metallic vibration. A few toted skateboards
and roared, clumsily, into the street toward the three of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch out, hippy dude,'' shouted what might have been the
leader and clipped the sidewalk Jesus at the ankles. Jacob Coleman
fell backwards and hit his head against the pavement. Max and
Father Ralph twisted out of the way to avoid the collision.
</P>
<P>
   A girl in the back of the pack held something that looked like a
toy rifle _ a super squirt gun maybe _ and pointed it at the prone
figure. Pop. Pop. Pop. Three paint balls hit Jesus in the chest,
soaking his robe in red. Just as quickly they turned the corner and
were gone.
</P>
<P>
   A figure stood on a nearby roof with a video camera and took in
the scene through the viewfinder. There, in the harsh street
lights, the camera captured the image of Father Ralph cradling the
body of the sidewalk savior in his arms, the poor man's Pieta. And
on one knee beside them, carrying the fallen cross over one
shoulder, was a dazed Max Timlin.

</P>
<P>
   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max and his friend Ralph Rizzo, a Catholic
priest, enjoy an evening in one of the wilder parts of town,
ill-prepared for an encounter with a young group of Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In a funk, Max would yell that he ``hated nature,'' but, truth
be told, he hated technology more. Not all technology, of course.
He loved his car, a 1965 Mustang convertible. And he loved his VCR
although he never could figure out how to program it. And he loved
his little CD player, although he once told a friend that CDs made
music sound ``colder and more brittle'' than old vinyl records.
</P>
<P>
   On most days, he loved his computer and the ease of revision it
offered the writer, instead of the endless retyping he could still
feel in his fingers from the 1970s. But tonight he could not get
his printer to work.
</P>
<P>
   He retried and retried and finally hollered ``I hate
technology'' and pounded his fist on the desktop. The printer
suddenly bleeped to life _ flashing green and yellow lights and a
burble of R2D2 noises _ and printed out the day's work.
</P>
<P>
   That morning he had read yet another news article about the
millennium's most frustrating technological glitch, known to
insiders as the Y2K problem. Y2K stood for the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a computer,'' the story read, ``1998 is merely 98, 1999 is
just 99, and so on. The trouble will arrive when 1999 rolls over to
2000 and computers get confused about how to interpret the double
zeros. The computers may think we've flashed back to 1900.''
</P>
<P>
   Max couldn't figure out why this problem would take more than 10
minutes and 10 dollars to fix, but experts insisted it would take
billions to kill the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Without a fix, great computer networks would crash, plunging
air-traffic control, nuclear power plants, military installations,
international banking systems into chaos. Max could almost hear
computer after computer failing, clicking down, click, click,
click, like an equator of dominoes around the globe, click, click,
click, click ... click ... and then silence.
</P>
<P>
   The idea reminded Max of one of his favorite old books, ``Cat's
Cradle,'' by Kurt Vonnegut. Max remembered two details from the
story, that in a future world men and women made love through the
soles of their feet, and that the world ended when a renegade
element is loosed into the environment, turning all the world's
water to ice, slamming the future shut like a great iron door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Max, glad I found you decent.'' It was Kate Banks, and
even her soft voice made Max jump. ``Sorry I startled you. I buzzed
in at the front. When you didn't answer, I let myself in with my
key.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fighting with my damn printer _ I mean your damn
printer.'' He handed her a file with about 30 pages of text. Not a
bad day's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go over it on our way to dinner,'' she said. ``Let me
treat you. Do you like Italian?''
</P>
<P>
   Kate drove an old, gold Volvo sedan, vintage 1978 _ a quarter of
a million miles on her, said Kate proudly _ and Max enjoyed
watching her at the wheel. The car was in great shape, and Kate
looked wonderful driving it, wearing a pair of comfortable jeans, a
Florida State University T-shirt, white socks, and the only
extravagance, what looked like a $200 pair of running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   She snapped off the radio, which was playing classical. ``Tell
me what you've found out, Max.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well you were right about The Watchers, Kate.'' It was the
first time he had used her name in conversation and wondered
whether it marked some kind of turning point. ``They are a classic
doomsday cult. Better yet, let's use your word: They are
millenarians. They don't seem to be Christians, in the conventional
sense, but they tend to quote the Bible _ especially the
apocalyptic stuff. They are very specific about the date Jan. 1,
2000. They associate it with something big, but it's not clear
what. The end of the world? A new world order? The Buccaneers win a
Super Bowl? Lions lying down with lambs? Lambs eating the lions?
What I can't tell you yet is how dark this thing is, or whether
they pose a risk to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about members?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of their pamphlets make one of those unprovable claims _
more than a million members worldwide. We'll know a little more in
the fall. They're planning a huge convention _ at the Star Dome if
you can believe that. But I don't think there are more than a
thousand in the area, and most of them live in Gulfport. They
actually own the Conquistador Hotel on Cosmos Key.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of corporations is listed as the owner, but they all
trace back to Raoul Glaber, their leader. He's the one who scares
me. By all accounts he has this mesmerizing effect on people _
especially the young. The Watchers come in all ages, color and
sizes, but his recruiting efforts seem targeted toward the
alienated young, the kids we ran into _ or who ran into us _ in
Ybor City last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate nodded as they pulled into the parking lot of a restaurant
called Meat Balls. The place was owned by three Italian brothers
from the Bronx. In one room, which had about 12 tables, they served
the best Italian food Max had ever eaten _ a veal cacciatore,
tender beyond imagination, like butter. Max closed his eyes with
pleasure. Kate devoured the linguine with red clam sauce, and they
split a bottle of cheap Chianti.
</P>
<P>
   There were three large rooms in the back. One had a bowling
alley with only two lanes. You could use it at no charge, but you
had to replace the fallen pins by hand, like the old days. An
adjacent room had four pool tables, and Max and Kate shot two games
of eight ball.
</P>
<P>
   Max was winning the first, but scratched on the eight ball. Kate
won the next game in a rout. She was full of surprises, Max
thought, as he watched her lean over the table to kiss the winning
ball in the side pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think they call me Kate Banks?'' she said, laughing
at her own pun.
</P>
<P>
   The final room was a lounge with an old juke box and a tiny
dance floor. If you wanted to dance, you had to take off your shoes
to protect the shiny old wooden floor. Max couldn't believe how
relaxed he was feeling, or the renewal of his good spirits at a
time he assumed his life and work would be in continuous decline.
</P>
<P>
   They shared more wine and conversation, until Kate reached under
the table, undid the laces of her shoes and kicked his shin with a
stockinged foot. ``You up to a dance, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   He loved music, but not what was playing, some corny old disco
number by the Bee Gees. He had told himself, over the years, that
more than nature and technology, he hated disco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much of a dancer,'' he said, ``especially after a long
day of writing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suit yourself,'' she said with a smile, and scooted off to the
lady's room. Max suddenly felt oafish and over-the-hill, and walked
dejectedly over to the juke box, staring into its yellow light,
glancing for several minutes at the selections. One caught his eye,
an old favorite. The Stones had done the most famous version, but
the original was recorded by the great Stax-Volt artist, Irma
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   He felt a hand on his shoulder. ``See one you like?'' It was
Kate, and her touch was like a jolt. He popped the number K-24.
``Ti-i-ime is on my side, yes it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Irma sounded like she was singing with a thousand-voice choir,
and Max felt like a parishioner in the Church of Soul. ``You'll
come runnin' back ... you'll come runnin' back, to me-e-e.''
</P>
<P>
   Max turned and Kate's hand slid across his shoulders. He glided
one arm around her waist, and the other down her arm to her hand.
They locked fingers. Her cheek touched his, and he inhaled some
delicate flowery fragrance behind her ear. Max slipped off his
loafers and kicked them free. She put her feet softly on his. They
rocked gently back and forth in the light of the juke box like two
teen-agers transported back to the past, with a thousand years of
time ahead of them.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max ponders the Y2K computer bug before a
rendezvous with his editor Kate, an evening that turns to romance.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max Timlin was known as a fearless journalist, but, truth be
told, he was afraid of two things: lightning and high places. He
traced these phobias to a single event in his childhood, when a
baby sitter dragged him onto a roller coaster at the Georgia State
Fair. He could not have been more than 5 years old. He was so
terrified he could neither close his eyes nor scream. A bolt of
lightning crashed out of a dark blue sky. He wet his pants. And
that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, he lived in the lightning capital of the world.
Three golfers were already dead this summer, the result of ignoring
the warning signs or trying to seek shelter under a tree.
</P>
<P>
   What a way to go, he thought, imagining some poor duffer raising
his sand wedge above his head, only to be zapped in midswing.
</P>
<P>
   He had read that a lightning strike could heat the surrounding
air to a temperature hotter than the sun. And this, it seems, had
been a record year for strikes, many of which had ignited forest
fires around the state.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, the El Nino water currents in the Pacific were
being blamed for disaster after disaster. Tornadoes. Floods.
Droughts. Fires. Hurricanes. If one were looking to the skies for
signs of the last days, you didn't have to look too long or too
hard.
</P>
<P>
   But Max had more immediate concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think we should go in, Kate?'' He turned a weather
ear to some distant rumblings over the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a while longer, Max. This breeze is so beautiful. And
look, there's a rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, to the southwest, a glorious rainbow arced from
Tampa Bay into the Gulf of Mexico, right over the Skyway Bridge. A
bridge over the bridge. But across the sky, blue-black clouds
gathered and billowed cinematically, illuminated from the inside by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Mississippi ... two Mississippi.'' He counted to six. A
faint rumble. They were still safe, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, will you answer me please?'' She reached up and punched
him on the arm.
</P>
<P>
   He now had proof that Kate was one hell of a journalist. Either
that, or she really was interested in him personally, and, in spite
of last night's slow dance, he found that hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   They had been walking along the beach for more than an hour now,
and she had asked him only a dozen questions. In return, he had
revealed to her all his secrets, including that he was petrified by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he had been born in Atlanta, to a Catholic mother and a
Jewish father. That made him something of an outsider in a land
full of Protestants. He attended a small parochial school, St.
John's Elementary; a public high school in Buckhead; and got into
Emory on an academic scholarship, but left after a year.
</P>
<P>
   He hustled a job at a community weekly paper, the Auburn Caller,
covering high school sports. The decision broke his mother's heart
_ she thought of her only son as a doctor, or lawyer, or maybe even
a priest. His father, a criminal defense attorney, thought writing
would suit Max just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Max himself considered becoming a lawyer, mostly because his
favorite television show was ``Perry Mason.'' He imagined himself
the center of some dramatic courtroom scene, getting an arrogant
witness to admit that, yes, yes, he was the one who had committed
the murder, and that the beautiful, shapely blonde was _ in a
manner of speaking _ innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I visited my Dad's courtroom. I was about 12, and
realized that all that Raymond Burr stuff was just a crock. That
most trials were really boring. Then it occurred to me that what
had fascinated me was not the law, but the stories, the
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   The breeze picked up and the sky lit up. ``One Mississippi, two
...'' This time the thunder rolled in at four. ``Let's go in,
Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until you tell me about your marriages.'' Not a topic he
usually talked about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short version is that I married and divorced twice. And
you'll find this interesting. Both times my wife ran off with the
same guy.'' More thunder. Kate looked at him in disbelief, and
tried to suppress a little laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's true. His name is Lionel Cropper, but, of course, I
call him Crapper. He was my best friend _ once _ an editor who gave
me great assignments, but while I was all over the country, he was
all over my first wife, Helen. She died in a car crash. He was
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate reached over and squeezed his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the rebound, I fell in love with a young reporter, Jamie
Nelson, a beautiful, talented kid who I think was infatuated with
what she perceived to be a big-time reporter. We were married less
than a year, before Crapper managed to get her assigned to his
desk. As far as I know, they're still together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you thought of putting a hit out on this guy?'' A flash
of lightning. Louder thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to think that maybe it's all been for the best, that
I'm not cut out to be with somebody _ not in marriage anyway. At
least we were smart enough not to have any kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you regret that, Max? About the children, I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to being alone, finally. My mom's still alive and
well _ I've got few friends _ but good ones. I love dogs. Wish I
had one. But sometimes I wonder about being the end of the line,
the last of the Mohicans.'' He looked at the sky. ``What about you,
Kate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good marriage. Jonathan died 10 years ago. Lung
cancer. He was a terrible smoker. But those fierce blue eyes made
up for it. We made a baby, little Cassandra Banks. A wild child. A
great athlete, soccer and volleyball. She's off on her own. I don't
see her very often. I miss her.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate began to cry. It took Max by surprise, until he realized
that his eyes were burning with tears too, not from crying, but
from the salty wind off the Gulf that was now whipping into a
mini-gale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you ever think about dying, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   He had to speak louder now over the sound of the wind. ``Not
every day, if I can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean do you think that when you die, it's, it's _ all over _
like the way it was before you were born _ or is there something
waiting for us?'' Flash. One Mississippi. Crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy, Kate. I'm shaking. Please let's go in. At least
to the car.'' She threw herself on him and kissed him hard. He
caught her. And held her perfectly still, and sustained her weight,
and let her kiss him until she was through. One Mississippi ...
two... he counted to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Zzzzznnappp! A lightning bolt snapped so close, there was no
time to count. So loud it knocked them both to the sand. He could
smell it.
</P>
<P>
   He gathered her to her feet and raced toward the top of the
beach, it was raining hard suddenly, huge drops driven by the wind
into full sheets of water. He opened the door of the Mustang and
hustled her into the back seat and climbed in after her. The rain
drove down even harder, what he once called ``tarantula rains,''
his childhood mistake for ``torrential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No more existential questions, Kate.'' Max tried to catch his
breath. ``You've brought down the wrath of the gods on us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, Max, but I miss Cassandra.'' She buried her head in
her hands as Max put his arm around her shoulder. ``I miss my
daughter.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max reveals his fear of lightning, which does
not deter Kate from leading him on a walk through a storm. She
reveals to him her concerns about her daughter. Max ponders the Y2K
computer bug before a rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Kate had assigned Max two helpers from the newspaper, the only
other people who knew he was on the trail of The Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Violet Rose was a crack researcher with an uncanny technical
instinct. She was in her mid-30s, tall, elegant and slightly
exotic, looking a little like NBC anchor Ann Curry. Violet was born
in Singapore, her father a British journalist, her mother a Chinese
translator.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Darling _ she received a lot of kidding after Bruce
Springsteen wrote a song with that title _ had been snapping photos
since she was a little girl in Cuba. She had a reputation as
inventive, independent, relentless and courageous, all the traits
Max appreciated in a photojournalist. Sherry was a short woman with
a delicate face and a surprisingly muscular body.
</P>
<P>
   Max knew her work and admired it. Sherry was a Pulitzer finalist
for her photographs of the 1980 Skyway Bridge disaster. A huge
tanker had hit the bridge in a fierce storm. At the exact moment
the storm cleared, Sherry was leaning out of a helicopter,
capturing startling images of the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in town still talk about her picture of the yellow Buick
Skylark, stopped dead on a span of ragged metal, dangling 175 feet
above Tampa Bay. The driver escaped, but had to be restrained from
returning to the car to rescue his golf clubs from the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tee time is in three hours!'' he exclaimed, turning him into a
folk hero for a battalion of men wearing shiny white shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Max knew the Skyway disaster story well. He had written a
profile of the only man to fall from the bridge and survive. He was
Elmo Polonski, a man in his 50s, who had been driving south in a
pickup truck, on his way to work, when the oil tanker crashed into
the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Driver and truck soared through the air, heading down, down, the
ship getting closer and closer. His instinct was to hit the brakes.
The wheels of the truck hit the bow of the tanker and bounced off
into a choppy Gulf of Mexico. The truck submerged and the driver
escaped the cab, dazed and battered, but with just enough energy to
reach up and hook his arm over a rung of a rope ladder that had
been lowered to him. He blacked out and came to on the deck of the
ship, surrounded by strangers speaking Korean.
</P>
<P>
   Max remembered his lead for the story: ``Something interesting
happened to Elmo Polonski Friday on his way to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Given their shared history as chroniclers of the Skyway
disaster, Max was delighted to hook up with Sherry and her
colleague Violet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been all over the Internet,'' said Violet, ``and the
feeling I get is an increase in activities about The Watchers. More
Web sites, more conversation in New Age chat rooms, and Kate is
right _ much of the buzz centers on West Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Violet tapped out a few commands on her laptop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're planning a big convention _ you know about that, Max _
but they're talking like it's a Stones concert or something _ 30
maybe 40 thousand. They've booked the Star Dome. And they're making
a big deal that this is for `initiates' only.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Initiates? I haven't come across that word with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like it sounds. Someone who has passed through an
initiation _ or joined the club _ or learned the secret handshake
or something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've checked all the photo files,'' said Sherry. ``Not much on
The Watchers _ a few photos of the leader _ but I went out and shot
some scenes around their headquarters at the Conquistador Hotel.
Take a look at these. The hotel is pink, but I might as well have
shot them in black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   The images were of young people, from late teens into their
early 30s. They were entering the hotel or standing in small groups
in courtyards, or walking along the beach. What was remarkable was
that most were dressed in black, but some in white. The contrast
was startling in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   The black tribe tended to be younger, like the kids he had seen
in Ybor City. The picture showed bald heads or spiky hair in weird
colors, tattoos, body piercing, lots of leather, even in the
Florida sun. If they were from the dungeons of Uranus, their
counterparts came from a yacht club on Neptune, neat white sports
clothes and shiny white running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The women wore white barrettes, or scarves, or headbands, the
men white sports caps with familiar logos. Their hair was short and
neatly groomed, their postures like models in a Spiegel catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory,'' said Sherry, ``is that we're seeing the before
and after effects of initiation.'' She explained that she dressed
like a tourist, took shots from a safe distance with a big lens,
pointing mostly at the water and sailboats.
</P>
<P>
   It was Violet's turn again. ``The Watchers draw from an odd mix
of mythologies and liturgies, on a spectrum from medieval
Catholicism to New Age Druids. I found out that initiation rites
are conducted _ all over the world _ on the eve of a full moon, and
always near the confluence of two bodies of water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When is the next full moon?'' asked Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three nights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So Thursday is the eve?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The odd thing is that these are public events. They are not
clandestine. They're even advertised in the alternative weekly.
Check this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Violet had clipped a small ad from the back page of Fishwrap, a
free and funky paper popular, because of the music news, with young
people.
</P>
<P>
   Are you watching?
</P>
<P>
   Tired of watching alone?
</P>
<P>
   Then come watch with us.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   South end of Cosmos Key.
</P>
<P>
   Dress in black.
</P>
<P>
   Max knew that location well. The south end of Cosmos Key is the
closest point of land to the center of the Skyway Bridge, the exact
point where the Gulf of Mexico flows into Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that you'd look mighty fine in black, Sherry,
darlin'.'' She played along. ``Only way for you to find out, Boss,
is to rent a tux and take me to the dance.''

<P>
   THE STORY SO FAR: Reporter Max Timlin, out of a job and down on
his luck, is hired by editor Kate Banks to conduct a secret
investigation of a doomsday cult called The Watchers. Max begins
his research, focusing on the cult leader Raoul Glaber, a
charismatic man with a troubling message, who seems to be targeting
the young for recruitment. Max and a Catholic priest, Ralph Rizzo,
encounter a group of young Watchers in one of the wilder parts of
town. Kate begins to take a romantic interest in Max, much to his
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max and Sherry arrived for The Watcher initiation ceremony
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll pretend to be this biker couple hangin' with the punky
kids.'' It was Sherry's idea. She owned a Harley, and brought over
some biker gear for Max to wear: black jeans, a black and gold
Harley T-shirt, and a black helmet with a swirling snake design on
the sides. Sherry wore tight black shorts over a black bathing suit
and looked ``damn good,'' Max told her.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Max had never been on a motorcycle before, so he
was stuck riding behind Sherry, and though he enjoyed holding on to
her, he was glad they were riding at night so no one could get a
good look at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like Pee-wee Herman,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   As they approached the south end of Cosmos Key, Sherry slowed
down so the roar of the bike would not attract too much attention,
and then parked it near a palm tree at the north edge of the park.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, they could see that a crowd, maybe 200 to 300
people, had gathered. Most looked young and were dressed in black,
although they were mixed with a few onlookers dressed like tourists
attending a bonfire on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had lit a fire, which was illegal, although there was no
sign of the police. In general, Max hated beach cops. He'd received
too many petty parking tickets over the years, but, as Max and
Sherry walked hand in hand toward the site, not knowing what would
happen, he wished for some token of security.
</P>
<P>
   It was about an hour before midnight, a calm and cloudless
night. An almost round moon _ it would be full tomorrow _ had made
</P>
<P>
   its climb into the sky, turning colors from orange, to yellow,
to ivory. It was now positioned just to the southeast of the Skyway
Bridge. It made a nice photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry had rigged a small backpack with a hidden camera. She had
used the device before, usually chasing down corrupt politicians or
scam artists or gangsters. Her most famous ``gotcha'' photo was of
a well-known televangelist soliciting a teen-age prostitute. Sherry
and a policewoman, dressed like hookers, stood on a corner across
the street and caught the rat in the trap.
</P>
<P>
   So as Max and Sherry walked through the crowd, which continued
to grow, Sherry silently snapped dozens of images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, old biker man, can I score a smoke?''
</P>
<P>
   Max was startled by the approach of a tall, thin kid dressed
only in a pair of black Speedos and black flip-flops. His head was
shaved, but, more startling, he was completely hairless, even on
his arms and legs, and didn't appear to have any eyebrows or
eyelashes.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry pulled a pack of Camels from the front of her backpack
and handed him a cigarette and a light.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to your hair, man?'' she asked. ``You look like
an Olympic swimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaved it all off, biker lady. Getting ready for my
initiation.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he ran back toward a circle of friends and sat on the
edge of the beach looking out at the moon and the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   It was now about 10 minutes before midnight and the crowd had
grown to about 500 and pressed toward the water. A few boom boxes
had been playing the same strange metallic vibrations Max had heard
in Ybor City, but they were silent now, and the crowd calmed down,
and there was almost no noise, except for the sound of surf and the
croaking of sea birds, until the young man with no hair yelled,
``Watch! Over there!'' and pointed a long arm and skinny finger
toward the middle of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   A sleek, white vessel sliced through the sea, the boat and its
wake brilliant in the moonlight. As it came closer, its huge
engines roaring, Max recognized it as something called a
``cigarette'' boat. Fast and powerful, it was favored by drug
runners in the tropics. This one was big, a 40- or 50-footer.
</P>
<P>
   The boat ate up the distance between the bridge and shore, its
engines now in a deafening roar, and Max could make out its full
size and elegance. He counted 12 figures on deck. Eleven men,
dressed in white, and what looked like a woman in a black, hooded
robe. Sherry had moved away from Max to a location where she could
snap away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome you all to the initiation rite of The Watchers,
here on the eve of the full moon, at the confluence of two great
bodies of water.''
</P>
<P>
   The boat was wired for sound, although no speakers or
microphones were visible. The young man who issued the greeting
must have been wearing a wireless mike. He was not Raoul Glaber,
but a much younger man with hair so blond it looked almost white.
</P>
<P>
   The other men on deck looked equally young, blond and very
athletic, like TV infomercial models for exercise machines. ``Will
the candidates for initiation please come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   At various points, the crowd parted to let through several
aspiring Watchers. Max counted 24 in all, 12 men and 12 women. He
estimated that they were in their late teens to early 30s. They
formed an awkward line at the shore where sea foam washed against
their feet.
</P>
<P>
   The men on board, except the speaker, climbed down from the
anchored boat into the water, which was up to their chests, and
walked forward to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand before this bridge, an image of the world's
transformation. We watch for signs of the last days, and for that
day to come _ it is just before us _ when all that once was will
disappear, and time, newly born, will begin again.''
</P>
<P>
   He gestured toward the initiates. ``But first you must strip
yourself of the vestiges of the old, dark times.'' As if on cue,
the initiates began to remove their jewelry, most of it silver. One
man unpeeled several chains from around his neck. A girl took off
rings from each finger.
</P>
<P>
   The tall hairless kid removed earrings. One young woman, with
barbed wire tattoos on both arms, removed clips from her nose, ears
and an eyebrow. They dumped the jewelry into bags carried by the
men in white.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next startled Max, and by the buzz in the crowd,
several other onlookers. The initiates began to remove their
clothing. Off came bathing suits, and T-shirts, and caps, and black
jackets, and flip-flops, and even a pair of Doc Martens, until two
dozen figures stood in the moonlight, tall and short, doughy and
angular _ and completely naked. Sherry noticed that three of them
had the letter W tattooed on their snowy butts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a glorious new beginning, for once you wore black,
when your hearts and minds were dark, but now, washed in this
water, you will wear white.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a roll call: ``James Weeks, Sasha Britton,
Bethany Davis ...''
</P>
<P>
   Each initiate was escorted by a Watcher out toward the boat,
leaned backwards like a dancer being dipped, and submerged in the
waters of the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha Kronauer, Russell Major, David Poynter ...''
</P>
<P>
   It reminded Max of the old-timey baptisms he remembered from the
evangelical South _ except for the nudity, which made this ceremony
look like a scene in a Salvador Dali painting.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the initiates were ushered back to the shoreline,
where they donned gleaming white robes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this day forward, you will wear white,'' declared the
young man, ``until the day comes, and it will come soon _ watch for
it _ when we all will be clad in red _ the color of fire, the color
of Raoul.''
</P>
<P>
   A cheer went up from the crowd, which evolved into a chant,
something you might hear at a political rally or a soccer game.
``Ra-oul ... Ra-oul ... Ra-oul.''
</P>
<P>
   It lasted for more than a minute, followed by another cheer, as
emerging from a cabin in the center of the boat, dressed in a dark
red running suit, emerged a man with dark hair and skin so pale it
looked ghostly in the moonlight. He stood behind the woman on the
deck, reached around her shoulders, and removed her hooded robe.
</P>
<P>
   Max was startled by the action and the cheer that went up from
the crowd, for there before him stood the most beautiful woman he
had ever seen, wearing nothing but long chestnut hair that cascaded
across her shoulders. He found himself embarrassed by this intimate
vision of her and lowered his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That girl's name is Angela Powers.'' Sherry was back now,
whispering in his ear.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd began chanting her name: ``An-gel-a. ... An-gel-a
...'' until the man beside her raised his hands, silenced the
crowd, and began to speak.

   Max watched in fascination as the young woman, Angela Powers,
stepped elegantly down a ladder off the side of the boat and into
the water of the Gulf, which came up almost to her chin. She
executed an athletic surface dive and took three strong strokes,
stood, the water was now waist high, and walked unself-consciously
naked toward the shore.
</P>
<P>
   She looked maybe 21 years old, thought Max, about 5-foot-7, with
chestnut hair, wet and pulled back now, and skin that emitted a
healthy translucent glow even in the moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   Max imagined the most beautiful model and the best woman athlete
merged into a single body. No gaunt, skeletal clothes hanger here,
but a woman who looked both voluptuous and chiseled _ how was that
possible? _ and as comfortable with her own body as a person could
be. Her eyes glowed blue, very blue.
</P>
<P>
   All the Watchers on shore stepped forward to greet her, and one
wrapped her in a dark red robe, the same color worn by Raoul
Glaber, who watched with a toothy smile from the boat. He began:
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela, our special angel, is now sheathed in red. It is the
color of blood, flame, Pentecost, the rising sun, the new
millennium, and, of course, the Florida State University football
team.'' The crowd burst into laughter at this unexpected bit of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see before you the bridge. A bridge to the sky. But also a
bridge of death, the place where too many have ascended and then
thrown their lives into the deep. It is a symbol of our times, of
our century.'' His voice was soft and steady, amplified perfectly
by an invisible sound system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is the century that created the automobile and the
airplane and the television and the computer. Alan Shepard landed
there,'' he pointed to the moon, ``and hit a golf ball into space
right there. We created penicillin and cures for thousands of
diseases. People have hope of living longer and happier lives. So
maybe we should call our time the Age of Hope and Creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, not to think of something to say, but as if preparing
to lift some great weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what have we done with the powers that have been given us?
We have become the masters of disasters. In 1915 the Ottoman Turks
killed a million Armenians. By 1933, Josef Stalin had caused the
death of more than 11 million of his countrymen, through systems of
starvation and torture. In three years, Pol Pot murdered more than
2 million, one out of every four Cambodians. If you committed the
crime of having a high school education, you could have been one of
his victims. In Uganda, thousands of victims of Idi Amin could be
found, their bodies mutilated, floating down rivers. In this very
decade hundreds of thousands of Rwandans have been hacked to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what can we say of Hitler and the crimes of the Third
Reich? Just 22 Nazis were tried at Nuremberg for grotesque crimes
against humanity, crimes that separated, deported, tortured,
starved, gathered into concentration camps, gassed, and incinerated
6 million Jews and 5 million others. How do we begin to understand
this without declaring ours the Age of Hatred and Genocide?
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up believing in the God of Christians and Jews, but no
more. How does a just and merciful God rest amid the glories of
heaven, angelic music ringing in his ears, in the face of such
atrocities? Would a loving father permit such pain to be visited on
his children? How can this race of people think of itself as saved
or redeemed?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not worthy. And we cannot be worthy until this age
passes away, as a man walks across a bridge and leaves one side
behind and heads off for another. Our time must come to an end, and
a new age begin. An age of blackness must be purified, washed in
blood, healed by fire, before we can achieve an age of purity,
peace, and harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are false prophets who have come before me with similar
messages. But salvation cannot be found in the poisoned potions of
Jonestown. Heaven is not behind the Halle-Bopp comet. It is not on
a faraway planet. You will not be whisked away there by friendly
aliens patting you on the back. And salvation is not in the
violence of Waco, or Oklahoma City, or Ruby Ridge. If I lead you
down those paths, walk away from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 2,000 years ago, a Jewish child was born in a tiny
village and given the name Joshua, although we know that man as
Jesus. His followers believe he died and rose from the dead and
ascended into heaven, but that he would return. One of them _ his
beloved friend John _ had a vision and wrote down what he saw in
what we now call the Book of the Apocalypse:
</P>
<P>
   ``And I saw an angel come down from heaven, and he laid hold on
Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the
bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him. And I saw
the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and
they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. And when the
thousand years expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four
quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to
battle. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured
them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of
fire and brimstone. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand
before God; and the books were opened. And whosoever was not found
written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children, look, I have inscribed your names into my book of
life.'' He held up what looked like a laptop computer. ``I accept
you as my own. I embrace you as a father. I gather you up and
shield you. I sit and watch with you for the time that is coming. I
heal you from the wounds placed upon you by your parents. Wounds of
abuse. Wounds of neglect. Wounds of addiction and dependency.
Wounds of crass materialism. They left you alone. They let you be
raised by strangers. While you were crying with grief or
loneliness, they dropped you off at the mall. They stood by while
you scarred your own bodies, or stuffed them to obesity, or starved
them to oblivion. They aborted you before you were born. And then
they went out and bought themselves a nice dinner, some dessert, a
carafe of wine. They created the Age that Hated Children.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love you, and I'LL LOVE YOU FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time that Raoul Glaber raised his voice, and
the crowd echoed back its cheers. Max looked and saw people holding
each other, tears streaming down faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come,'' he said, ``and follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   He stepped down into the cabin of the boat and disappeared from
sight. In the next few minutes, his original 11 disciples, with
Angela Powers, waded out to the boat, climbed aboard, and prepared
to embark. The engines roared to life, the boat turned back toward
the bridge and sped off toward the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Back on shore, the new initiates greeted and hugged each other,
and were approached and congratulated by friends in the crowd, like
Jewish kids after their bar mitzvahs. Then they marched across the
park, stepped into three white vans _ with Conquistador Hotel on
the side _ and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   Max and Sherry walked slowly, heads bowed, not touching now,
back toward her Harley, their every stepped being watched my a man
sitting on the branch of a nearby oak tree.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   If the world was going to end, thought Max, the best place to be
was in a traffic jam on U.S. 19, one of America's ugliest roads and
biggest parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more tourists and ``snowbirds'' flocked to West
Florida, the development and traffic clotted Route 19 to the point
of arteriosclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a good day to die,'' said Max to his Mustang,
quoting an old Native-American saying, and looking north toward
Clearwater and an endless line of traffic. Apocalypse today might
be considered a form of euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   For the next half hour he inched by one strip shopping mall
after another, their stores offering everything from lawn furniture
to used cars to fast foods to lingerie modeling. Finally, he came
upon the landmark he was looking for, a large billboard inviting
one to stop in for a ``Quick Lube.''
</P>
<P>
   Max pulled the Mustang, its temperature gauge pointing toward
hot, into a big lot and parked it under a shady tree and pulled up
the top to avoid bird bombing runs. He had come here to meet Father
Ralph Rizzo and to sort out the things he had seen and heard at The
Watchers' initiation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   He could not erase from his mind the image of Angela Powers,
naked as a newborn, shimmering wet in the moonlight. He told
himself that his thoughts about her were not lustful, that they
aroused in him a different kind of yearning, a fatherly desire to
save a lost daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Father Ralph stood in the parking lot wearing sandals, khaki
shorts, a Hawaiian shirt, and a Yankees cap. As Max approached him,
Ralph swept his hand and pointed dramatically: ``Behold. There she
is. Our Lady of Clearwater. The Rainbow Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   It clicked now in Max's mind. He looked up to see on the glass
panels of a bank building the most remarkable image _ a
multicolored pattern of wavy bands that formed the familiar cloaked
outline of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Max remembered reading about
it. How a palm tree had been removed. How water from the sprinkler
system had washed upon the glass. How chemicals had bonded to form
this startling icon of red, blue, gold and violet. How this was now
a destination for pilgrims and preachers and miracle seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Max noticed about 100 votive candles before the image, along
with dozens of handwritten messages tacked to the fence. ``Dear
Mother of God. I am only 10 years old. My dad is sick and doesn't
have any money. Please help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph told Max that he came here once in a while to collect
messages, to greet pilgrims, and to minister to those seeking help.
He often directed them to food banks, or hospices, or AIDS clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two stories from the Gospel that always impressed
me,'' said Ralph, leading Max to a white plastic bench under a
tree. ``The first one is about this sick lady who figures that if
she can just touch the hem of His garment, she would be healed. It
says that Jesus felt the power going out of Him. In another town,
Jesus can't perform any miracles because the people there had no
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get it,'' said Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think God reached down from the sky and with some big
magic marker drew a picture of Mary on that glass? No. I think the
sprinkler system did that. The power is not in that image, but in
the faith of that 10-year-old boy who wants to help his father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But people can believe in the wrong thing. The Nazis had faith
in Hitler. The Watchers have faith in Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does that name sound familiar to me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking about him for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the first time I've focused on his name. Is this
the guy you saw on the boat _ with that beautiful girl?'' Max
nodded. ``Do you think Glaber has the hots for her?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a funny expression for a priest to use, and it evoked
from Max a muffled laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph turned professorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing in The Watchers turns out to be a very old
story, Max. Social movements inspired by the millennium take many
shapes, but they always have two distinct features _ it's been that
way since the Middle Ages. I taught this stuff for years. First,
you need an alienated, disenfranchised, impoverished group _ in the
Dark Ages it was the peasants. And then you need a charismatic
leader who is self-important and usually a little loony. This Raoul
Glaber has obviously targeted the dispossessed young for
indoctrination. And he holds himself up as a kind of savior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What amazed me, Ralph, is that I know this guy's a jerk, but
he makes a kind of perverse sense. It's hard to deny that we've
sort of screwed over a generation of young people. And we've
committed such atrocities over this century, some in the name of
religion. Maybe we've lost the chance to be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bull----,'' said Ralph. ``There are only three kinds of people
in the world. The ones like Glaber who look at things and see the
end. The ones, like that 10-year-old boy, who have hope even in the
dark days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the third kind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like you, Max, who can't make up your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How could a just and merciful God allow something like the
Holocaust to happen? I'm not trying to be disrespectful, Ralph. I'm
just trying to get inside Glaber's head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the oldest trap in the world, Max. It's shows that, deep
down, you're a believer. If you believe only in chaos or accident
or biology, then you can account for someone like Hitler _ a crazy
person in a crazy world. If you believe in God, you've got some
work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you're not supposed to understand. Maybe you're just
supposed to act. To investigate this Glaber guy. And write a great
story. And save the life of that beautiful young woman. Maybe
that's the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here for a counseling session, Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you come here for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to learn more about this millennium stuff. We may be
entering a new era, but I think I'm beyond the kind of rejuvenation
you're preaching, Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You once had so much energy and passion. I admired that in
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've collected too many barnacles, Ralph, even for a good hull
scraper like you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't you ever seen a piece of driftwood polished into
something glorious? Maybe God ain't done with you yet, Max.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph got up from his seat to greet a tall, thin man with long,
unkempt hair, and a scraggly beard that flowed to his breastbone.
His face was gaunt, and Max could see that his belongings were
piled nearby in a grocery cart.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph, a foot shorter than this man, locked him in a bear hug
and dragged the man by the arm into the shade of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max,'' he said, ``I want you to meet Louis. He's a friend of
mine.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max meets up with Father Ralph and questions
the priest about the millennium, but Ralph dispels a doomsday
attitude with acts of kindness.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   As Max cruised down Gulf Boulevard through Madeira Beach and
toward Treasure Island, he glanced down and noticed the odometer
had, some miles ago, crossed the 99,000-mile barrier. He reached
out and patted the dashboard of the old Mustang as if he were
stroking a pony's mane.
</P>
<P>
   Although exhausted from his encounter with Father Ralph, Max
decided to keep another appointment he had made for that afternoon.
He turned toward the beach and stopped at a lovely house with
weathered shingles and a xeriscaped yard. Dr. Evelyn Hamilton lived
here, a retired veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Max had read in the Florida Sun that this kind woman had adopted
Daisy, the Rottweiler who survived a fall from the Skyway Bridge.
Daisy's former owner, quite deranged, had tossed her over on his
own journey toward the big deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me Evie,'' she insisted and extended her hand. She was a
lovely woman rk eyes and silver hair who had been chosen
from among more than 100 suitors to take care of Daisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always tell how a person will treat people by how they
treat animals,'' she said. Daisy was doing fine, except for the
slightest limp, the effects of neurological damage to one of her
paws.
</P>
<P>
   Max lowered himself to one knee, reached into a bag and took out
a handful of gourmet doggie yummies. Daisy devoured these and
nuzzled Max's hand for more. The next half hour was spent on the
rug with generous amounts of ear rubbing, back scratching and
slobbery kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Evie told Max he could visit any time. He congratulated her on
her fine work and said he'd like to write Daisy's story some day.
He waved from his Mustang _ the top was down _ and drove happily
down the beach until his thoughts turned to the young man who had
ended his own life and wanted to take his dog with him.
</P>
<P>
   What had she done for him but be a faithful companion even into
the abyss? Did he think he needed her in the afterlife like some
Egyptian pharaoh? Could he not stand the thought of someone else
taking care of her? Maybe God watched over the sparrows and the
Rottweilers, the lilies of the field and the Daisies. Maybe that
cagey Father Ralph was getting to him.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the road, Max heard an amusing story on National Public
Radio. A man entered a betting emporium in London, where they'll
lay odds on almost anything: ``What are the chances my 5-year-old
son will grow up to play for England in the World Cup?'' A 100,000
to 1, minimum bet 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But one man wanted to bet 1,000 pounds that the world would end
on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' explained the manager, ``we can't take a bet where we
couldn't pay the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The bettor looked puzzled. ``If the world did end, how would we
pay you?''
</P>
<P>
   That bit of British honesty _ along with his visit to Daisy _
lifted Max's spirits, a feeling that intensified when he thought
again of Angela Powers, a young girl so beautiful and strong, whose
physical presence projected a sense of purity and purpose
inconsistent with her attachment to Raoul Glaber and The Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   As he made his final turn toward Land's End, his thoughts moved
to Kate Banks. He needed to see her again to report on all he had
learned about the Watchers and _ more urgently _ to test whether
there was anything between them.
</P>
<P>
   Max clicked the radio to a music station, only to hear Michael
Bolton's overwrought version of ``When a Man Loves a Woman.'' He
took it as a bad sign. He changed stations and a true miracle
occurred: It was Percy Sledge's original version of the same song.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired, he pressed his foot on the accelerator and, in the
three minutes it took to finish the song, he looked in his rearview
mirror to see the lights of a police car. He pulled over and a
tall, imposing officer with ebony skin approached the Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry if I was speeding, officer, I ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to worry about that, Mr. Timlin. You are Max Timlin. Or
have you just stolen his car?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm him. I mean he.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, sir, could you follow me?''
</P>
<P>
   More curious than fearful, Max followed the police car for about
a mile, then turned down a side street in front of a tiny
restaurant called Red Beans. The officer held the front door open
without a smile and Max walked in, his eyes adjusting to the
darkness. Finally, at an isolated corner table he saw a familiar
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, my man, what the hell are you doin' muckin' around with
The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   The question was so direct and had such conviction behind it, it
caught Max off guard. He decided on a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the hell do you know that, Sam? You been followin' me?''
</P>
<P>
   Sam was Samson Lockhart, one of the top cops in the state of
Florida. Max had written a long profile of Lockhart, who had
arrived in St. Pete from New Orleans, La., to become its first
African-American chief of police.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart was the son and grandson of police officers, and had
been credited with easing tensions between the police and the black
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to follow you, little brother. We been watchin'
the Watchers. Special investigative unit. We've got you on tape in
Ybor City when those kids knocked over the Jesus guy, and we got
you during the latest initiation ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart let out a big laugh. He was almost 6-foot-5, and the
laugh echoed through the empty restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funniest thing I ever seen. You looked like a candy-ass
dressed in that biker stuff. But the lady you were with looked
mighty fine. Who was that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman named Sherry ... '' Max regretted it as soon as the
name left his lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherry Darling? So you workin' for the Florida Sun now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly, I ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you not exactly work for a newspaper? Do you hear
that?'' he turned to the other officer, ``He doesn't exactly work
for the Sun. Well, who the hell are you workin' with, then? I know
you ain't datin' Sherry Darling because she's a bright and talented
woman who wouldn't be seen dead with a burnt out old dog like
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Max couldn't bring himself to laugh under this harangue though
he wanted to. ``Sam, I can't tell you any ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, why don't you call me Chief Lockhart, just for today,
just so I know you're payin' attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir, Chief Lockhart, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You still drivin' that old piece of junk? When you gonna get
yourself a proper car?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What does this have to do with The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well if you're gonna catch Raoul Glaber and those pretty blond
boys he hangs with, you're gonna need a car that goes more than 45
miles per hour and gets better than eight miles to the gallon.''
</P>
<P>
   `You know the kind of car Glaber drives?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what kind of toothpaste he uses, but we ain't gonna
tell you unless you start tellin' us some things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you, Sam, I mean Chief Lockhart, that I'm working
as a journalist. It's not some personal thing. But I can't tell you
who hired me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to tell me. It's Miss Kate Banks, another fine
woman who should know better than to have anything to do with the
likes of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want from me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothin' much. I just want you to go to the Conquistador Hotel,
go into that lion's den, and interview Raoul Glaber, the Number 1
Big Daddy Watcher himself.''

<P>
   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max meets up with Daisy, the dog that survived
a fall from the Skyway Bridge, and then is summoned to a meeting
with Sam Lockhart, chief of police.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me to do what?'' Max Timlin squinted his eyes and
scratched what was left of his hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to screw your courage to the sticking post,'' Sam
Lockhart, police chief, reciting this line in a mock Shakespearean
accent as if rehearsing for a Mel Brooks production of Othello,
``and I want you to go in amongst the Watchers and interview Raoul
Glaber, their king.'' He bowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you just send your best detectives in there? Or why
not just bring him in?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he's much too dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Max looked at him, his eyes now wide in disbelief. ``He's too
dangerous for the cops, so you want me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam relaxed his demeanor and pointed to the chair across from
him. He called to someone in the kitchen and began ordering Cajun
food, large steaming bowls of it: red beans and rice, andouille
sausage, shrimp jambalaya, crawfish etouffe, blackened grouper, all
washed down with sweet iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   The talking and the eating took almost two hours. Some of Max's
favorite music played in the background: Fats Domino, Professor
Longhair, Dr. John, the Neville Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to the sweet voice of Aaron Neville, Max, you've just
got to `Tell it like it is....' You're a macho newspaper man,''
said Sam, pushing back from the table. ``You'll get a big story out
of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't cut deals with cops,'' said Max, eating a bite of
bread pudding soaked in rum. ``And I don't do their work for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't like reporters,'' said Sam, ``but we've got
something important here, and I'm willing to dispense with some of
the old rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a huge file on our ongoing investigation of The
Watchers. It goes back more than a year. And I'll open it just for
you. It's got loads of stuff in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And what do I have to do in return?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just be yourself. Go in and ask for an interview. Get as close
as you can, which will not be easy. Light a little fire under him
and see if he jumps. Just be your old, stank reporter self. And
then just answer a few of our questions about what you saw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get no access to my notes. I tell you whatever I want to
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I get to see the file anytime I want to from now until the
Second Coming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a good man, Max Timlin, and deserve a fine cup of
chicory coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Max debated the big cop's proposal with himself for two days
before meeting up with his editor.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Banks showed up at the condo on Saturday evening, just in
time to enjoy a bright-orange sunset, which she and Max watched
from the balcony while sipping Heineken from bottles and nibbling
on slices of Sicilian pizza. They fought over the crust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought you a present,'' said Kate, reaching into her purse.
``Call it a bonus for your good work so far.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a video copy of ``Goldfinger,'' which Max had told her
was one of his favorite movies. He peeled off the plastic wrapper,
popped it into the VCR, and curled up on the couch to watch it.
About 90 minutes and two beers later, by the time James Bond is
rolling in the hay with Pussy Galore, Kate had kicked off her
sandals, pulled up her knees, and rested her head against Max's
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the coolest thing,'' Max clapped his hands in delight
as Bond defeated Odd Job, and the counter on the nuclear device
stopped at exactly 007. ``Fort Knox and the economies of the Free
World _ saved!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldfinger was not your average terrorist,'' said Kate. ``I
wonder what Bond would do if he encountered Raoul Glaber?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably go right into the lion's den.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same phrase that Sam Lockhart had used, and it gave
Max a moment's pause. He had told her over the phone the details of
the plan, and she now approved, ``As long as you report to me first
_ before you talk with the cops.''
</P>
<P>
   She opened a folder filled with photos, the ones Sherry Darling
had shot at the initiation ceremony. They were splendid. The
cigarette boat in the moonlight, with the Skyway Bridge as a frame.
The initiates lined up on the beach. Raoul Glaber waving from the
boat. And Angela Powers, like a postmodern Venus, rising from the
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume you'll want to keep this one for your private
collection,'' said Kate.
</P>
<P>
   Max raised his hand in honest protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, but she's
young enough to be my daughter. Father Ralph thinks I've been put
on this earth to save her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' said Kate, and looked into his eyes earnestly.
``Thank you, Max. You're one of the good guys.'' And with that she
kissed him, first lightly on the cheek, and then lightly on the
lips. And again. He kissed her back, very softly, like a beginner,
then more firmly, and then, as if a door had finally opened, with
passion.
</P>
<P>
   He took in the warmth of her breath, the smell of her hair, and
the wonderful feel of a strong woman's body pressed against his.
They kissed nonstop for what might have been 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang. It was on the near table, and it startled them
both, so that they separated, looked at each other and laughed.
Kate picked it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, hello, Father Ralph. Yes, this is Kate Banks. Yes, Max is
here. We were just watching a movie.'' Kate winked at Max, who took
the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, tell me again, the name of this Watcher guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The priest's voice was loud and excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raoul. Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spell it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``R-a-o-u-l G-l-a-b-e-r.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've got two pieces of news for you, buddy boy. First,
that's not his real name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the second piece?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in more trouble than we thought.''

<P>
   LAST INSTALLMENT: Police Chief Sam Lockhart persuades Max Timlin
to infiltrate The Watcher headquarters and obtain an interview with
the secretive Raoul Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   It took Max Timlin three full days in the musty old library of
St. Pius College, north of Tampa, to make sense of Father Ralph's
revelations: Raoul Glaber was not the real name of the leader of
The Watchers. Max wasn't as convinced as Ralph that this was true,
but he devoured the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He began by reading the Book of Revelation, sometimes known as
the Book of the Apocalypse. He always thought the word
``apocalypse'' meant some great final cataclysm, as in the movie
``Apocalypse Now.'' But it was actually the Greek word for
``revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Father Ralph's tutelage, Max came to realize that the
revelations of the last book of the Christian scriptures are
shrouded in mysterious and symbolic language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if the Apostle John was dropping acid with Picasso,''
said Max, irreverently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dreamlike visions of this book have left so much open to
interpretation that any tinhorn prophet can use it to predict just
about anything,'' explained Ralph. ``One thing we know for sure,
that for at least a thousand years, people who look at their own
times, and see dark things, return to this book as a kind of
mystical map.''
</P>
<P>
   Max pored over the text and some commentaries on it. In one
tradition, he learned, Christ would return to rule over the Earth
for 1,000 years. The Latin word for this was ``millennium.'' The
story of this return contains several subplots, including the
appearance of false prophets and antichrists, a time when Satan
would rule, a great battle between God and his enemies, and the
Last Judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great problem,'' explained Ralph, looking at Max over his
reading glasses, ``was how to calculate the time when Jesus would
return. There's evidence in the Gospels that the disciples thought
it would happen right away _ perhaps in their lifetime. But when it
didn't happen, it opened the door for people to reinterpret the
Scriptures for their own purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Max learned that the historical Jesus was actually born between
6 and 4 B.C. _ the first calendar makers goofed _ which means that
even if you were thinking about an era of 1,000 years, what would
be the starting point? The moment Christ was conceived? His birth?
His death and resurrection?
</P>
<P>
   Max read a gospel passage in which Jesus describes a time of
judgment when ``the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not
give her light, and the stars will fall from heavens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' said Max to Ralph, ``Jesus said that `this generation
will not pass away till all these things have been accomplished.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But listen to this next part,'' said Ralph pointing down the
page and reading aloud: ```But of that day and hour no one knows,
not even the angels of heaven.' Jesus is urging his followers not
to calculate the precise time, but to do good all the time, to be
prepared for their own deaths and the end of the world, which would
sneak up on them, `like a thief in the night.'''
</P>
<P>
   That led Max and Ralph to a discussion of the year 1000, the
only historical precedent for what the world was about to
experience. Ralph stood on tiptoes and pulled a thin volume off a
high shelf. ``This is the smoking gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The innocent book was called ``The Year 1000,'' written by a
French art historian named Henri Focillon. The text tried to settle
an ancient intellectual argument: Was there any hard evidence that
people living in 10th century Europe were obsessed by the terrors
of the last days? Did they think they were living in a time when
the end of the world was at hand?
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer was no. The historical records and artifacts
do not reveal a population in panic. Early in the next century,
after the millennium had passed, there was an intense period of
church building.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might suggest,'' said Ralph, ``that some people were
holding their breath, waiting a bit before undertaking any big
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were some notable exceptions, some 10th century
``lunatics,'' as Ralph called them, who were prophets of doom, who
saw signs of the last days everywhere. The most notable of these
was a radical French monk. ``His name was Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber wrote of a great meteor or comet he saw in the night sky
in the year 1000: ``It appeared in the month of September, not long
after nightfall, and remained visible for nearly three months. It
shone so brightly that its light seemed to fill the greater part of
the sky, then it vanished at cock's crow. What appears established
is that this phenomenon in the sky never appears to men without
being the sure sign of some mysterious and terrible event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think Glaber saw Halley's comet?'' asked Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Focus on the more important point, Max. We're not talking
ancient superstitions here. Remember what the Heaven's Gate cult
did upon the appearance of the Hale-Bopp comet. They followed to
the death a wacky old guy, who apparently had himself castrated,
who told these bright young people _ they were computer experts,
for God sakes, they had their own Web site! _ that there was a
spaceship waiting for them behind the comet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All they had to do to get there was to put plastic bags over
their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Read this,'' said Ralph and pointed to a passage in the text.
It said that the old French monk saw Satan everywhere, including
right beside his pillow, and that Satan was a ``small black monster
of human shape,'' and that ``Satan will soon be unleashed because
the thousand years have been completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Max leaned toward Ralph and whispered: ``Isn't it possible that
Glaber's daddy just named him Raoul?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And what? That just by coincidence he turned into Doomsday
Dick? Have you been able to track back on this guy? Do you know his
family's history?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a researcher at the Sun working full blast on it. So
far there's just a black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tell you, Max, this guy, whoever he is, adopted the name
of a man who, 1,000 years ago, was trying to scare people to death.
And I predict that this guy will do the same. Unless we stop him.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: What Father Ralph teaches Max about the Year
1000 leads Max to a startling conclusion: that Raoul Glaber is not
the real name of The Watcher leader.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   From a distance the Conquistador Hotel looked like a friendly
old soul, a small but elegant pink lady, born in the roaring 20s,
and preserved with several discreet face lifts. For 150 bucks,
tourists could buy the right to lay themselves out in the sun and
burn to a crisp _ ensuring, if they lived long enough, skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point of Max's Mustang, driving through
Gulfport toward the beach, it was hard to imagine anything more
malevolent happening here than, say, a post-prom booze party or
your standard adulterous affair. Even the president of the United
States once spent the night here. ``It sure is pink,'' he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But as Max drove closer and closer, the look of the place got
weirder and weirder. An attendant dressed in white stopped him at
the front gate and with friendly insistence pressed Max to learn
the nature of his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a guest at the hotel, Mr. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Timlin. No, but I've heard this was a special place, so I
thought I'd take a look for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man, he looked bleached blond, took Max's license and
recorded his tag number, slid a pass onto his dashboard, and
pointed to a place in the shade where he could park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enjoy the day, sir, and don't forget to stop into the Globe
Room. You'll enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Max saw lots of tourists, and a few Watcher acolytes dressed in
black, and many more initiates in blazing white regalia.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was warm, Max dressed in black for dramatic effect. As
he walked around he got the impression of a gilded cage, a
too-perfect community in which everything was Watched. It reminded
him of the resort in Wales that became the set of the 1960s British
TV series ``The Prisoner.'' He started whistling the theme song,
``All You Need Is Love.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent about two hours scouting the place, its little
restaurants, shops, tennis courts, boardwalk, cabanas, and down one
end a dock for boats. He could see Glaber's cigarette boat in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, behind the dunes, he could see a large round white mark
along the beach with concentric circles _ like a target _ or
perhaps a landing pad for hang gliders or even a small helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   What interested Max most was the absence of Watcher insignias or
other public displays that might indicate who owned the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   He took an elevator to the fifth floor, which opened to a
mahogany reception desk behind which sat an attractive young woman
dressed in a handsome white suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in white and I'm in black,'' said Max, still wearing
his sunglasses. She smiled at him blankly. ``The prince of parking
told me I should check out the Globe Room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please sign in here, sir, and then take those steps to the
right.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed her directions and stepped into a remarkable
setting. The room was the world, or to be more precise, a globe.
Inside, Max could see a map of the world rendered in magnificent
stained glass, lit from behind. You could only move across the room
on a thin walkway which served as the sphere's diameter.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to a spot that marked the center of the Earth. A
recorded voice came on. It was Raoul Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand beside you, watching our magnificent world. But what
shall become of it?'' What followed was five minutes of standard
Watcher fare _ apocalyptic doom softened by New Age mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked up and noticed a security video camera. He smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can turn back and walk out the way you came in,'' said
Glaber's soothing voice, ``or you can move forward beyond this
great world to something ever more glorious.''
</P>
<P>
   Max shrugged and walked 10 steps toward the door beyond him. It
opened automatically. The hall beyond had a great W on the wall.
This was The Watcher sanctum, busy with Watcher workers in white,
moving in and out of offices, or stretched out before banks of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Max was approached by a handsome black woman with her short hair
dyed blond. ``Dennis Rodman's sister,'' he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to The Watchers, sir. I'm Denise and you're ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Timlin. Max Timlin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome, Max. I'm here to watch over you so you can learn more
about The Watchers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'd like that. I'm a reporter and would like to interview
Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   Her expression darkened. ``Wait right here, sir. Don't move.''
She ran off.
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 seconds, Max was surround by burly blond attendants;
they resembled personal trainers in dress and physique, but Max
guessed they constituted the palace guard.
</P>
<P>
   An older man, his head shaved bald, approached him. ``I
understand you are a reporter, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct. I'm a free-lance writer and I'd like to
interview Mr. Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider ourselves to be a very open organization. We
conduct much of our business in public.'' Max pulled out his
notebook and began scribbling. ``I'm afraid I'm going to have to
ask you to put that away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure. I'm not here to make a scene. I'm Max Timlin. And
your name sir is?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not required to give you my name, sir, but it's Monty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``May I write that down?''
</P>
<P>
   Monty shook his head sternly. ``Mr. Timlin, have you read
stories in the press about The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, of course, I've been doing research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen a story about us that didn't portray us as some
kind of kooky cult? We've been so badly used, we've had to ban
reporters from our premises. I'll give you all the literature
you'll need to understand who we are and what we stand ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, Mr. Full Monty, I don't take handouts from flacks, and
I'm not intimidated by blond Nazi boys dressed like ice-cream
vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to flex as one, but Monty held up a hand to restrain
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't I have you escorted from the premises _ and
roughly?''
</P>
<P>
   Max reached in his pocket and pulled out an index card and
clicked his pen and scribbled two quick sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's why. Be so kind as to show this to Mr. Glaber. I'll
wait here with your goons.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty took the card, read it, his face flushing with anger.
``Watch him,'' he said, and spun away. Max put his shades back on,
crossed his arms, and smiled.

   THE STORY SO FAR: Reporter Max Timlin is hired by editor Kate
Banks to investigate a doomsday cult called The Watchers and their
leader, Raoul Glaber. Max witnesses a Watcher initiation rite and
hears Glaber's dark view of the world and its future. Max seeks the
counsel of Father Ralph who becomes suspicious that Glaber is not
who he says he is. Police Chief Sam Lockhart persuades Max to enter
The Watcher's inner sanctum.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max's adrenaline had kicked in now, and his heart raced as he
was escorted through a glass automatic door, down a narrow hallway
and through two heavy wooden doors. A burly, grimacing attendant
pointed him through.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked up to see Raoul Glaber wearing a red University of
Alabama T-shirt, sitting at the far side of a round table and
holding Max's index card in one hand and flipping it with the
middle finger of his other.
</P>
<P>
   I KNOW YOUR NAME IS NOT RAOUL GLABER!
</P>
<P>
   SURRENDER DOROTHY.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very amusing, Mr. Timlin. That's an interesting name, Max
Timlin. Just add a few letters and you could become Maximum
Timeline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You seem fascinated with names, Mr. Glaber, and with time. Or
shall I call you by your real name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know my real name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, no. But I do know that Raoul Glaber was a
10th-century French monk who saw Satan standing by his pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be so harsh on visionaries, sir. I believe in Satan _
how can you look at the world and not _ but I don't see him as an
ugly little gremlin. I think that he takes a much more reassuring
human form, like yours, for instance, ... or mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is your real name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please call me William, if you like, William Miller. How's
that for a classic American name. Don't you love those double l's
in the middle? Almost like the Latin word for one thousand: mille.
I love beautiful and interesting names. But I've told you that.''
</P>
<P>
   He reached for a button near his chair. Max flinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, not to worry, sir, there is no shark pool under your
feet.'' A side door opened. Max was not prepared for the sight of
Angela Powers (though he had her in mind when he wrote ```Surrender
Dorothy'').
</P>
<P>
   She, too, was dressed in red: tank top, soccer shorts, and
thongs. She padded gracefully into the room, holding a tray with
glasses of cold iced tea and some ginger snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Timlin. This is Angela Powers, but I assume you already
know that. Isn't that a wondrous name _ the power of angels _ she
is my helper and my archangel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pleasure to meet you _ please, help yourself,'' said
Angela to Max. ``Aren't you broiling in that black suit? You look
like one of the Blues Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber or Miller or Whoever came around the big table and took a
seat with Max and Angela near a window overlooking the water.
</P>
<P>
   Glaber took some hard swallows of tea. ``I like it Southern
style,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you not from the South?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' some impatience passed through the charm. ``I'm from the
West. And I don't talk to the press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And why not? Some publicity might gain you more followers.
Isn't it natural that, given your message, people would turn their
interest toward you as we approach the millennium?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, come now, Mr. Timlin,'' the voice came from Angela Powers.
It was deep for a young woman, and filled with character and
intelligence. ``The interest of the press is not in informing or
enlightening, no matter what you say. It is to appeal to the
largest and the lowest audience. Is any other institution more
responsible for the decline in standards, for cynicism about the
country, for spreading hopelessness, for fear of crime, for a
picture of the world that debases anything noble?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, Ms. Powers, don't The Watchers espouse a philosophy that
is the ultimate pessimism, that the world as we know it will
disappear?''
</P>
<P>
   ``God is no magician, Mr. Timlin. He's not into vanishing acts.
We see the world as it is. You see it as better than it is _ and
then portray it as worse than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You fascinate me, Ms. Powers.'' Max was sweating profusely.
Why had he worn this darn black suit? And why did he choose a chair
in the direct sunlight? He finished his tea, and held the frosty
glass to his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a good writer, Mr. Timlin?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if you listen to my old editors. But I am fast. I think
for reporters fast is better than good. Are you a writer, Ms.
Powers? You are very well spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber smiled at the compliment to Angela like a proud parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about becoming a writer, but I saw what it did to my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mother's a writer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was. But she's an editor now. Mr. Timlin, are you all
right? You look a little pale. Can I get you some more tea?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your ... mother?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, perhaps you know her. Her name is Kate Banks.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have been this revelation that unsettled him because the
image of her, the beautiful image, suddenly went out of focus.
There were two magnificent angels in red _ no there were three, and
then someone must have turned the lights out, or closed the blinds,
because wasn't it just daylight _ a moment ago _ or maybe an
eclipse of the sun _ or maybe this room was a revolving bar at
night _ spinning, darker and ... darker.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max meets Raoul Glaber and the beautiful
Angela Powers, but a sweet glass of ice tea and a startling
revelation render him unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there had been an eclipse, or maybe Max had fallen asleep,
because when he awoke the sky was still dark, but now a light rain
splattered across his face. He wiped it with his hand and clumsily
sat up.
</P>
<P>
   He looked around to get his bearings and found himself in the
back seat of his Mustang with the top down, and yes it was raining
and his head hurt and his leg hurt, too.
</P>
<P>
   This must be what a migraine felt like: a pain both dull and
sharp, pressing a thousand pounds against the side of his skull.
But he had never had a migraine before.
</P>
<P>
   His memory came back slowly now and then snapped into focus: the
visit to the pink hotel, the incursion into enemy territory, a cool
drink with Raoul Glaber and Angela Powers. The drink.
</P>
<P>
   He had been drugged, carted to his car, driven to an empty spot
on Cosmos Key, and left there for how long? Hours? His face felt
sunburned. This was the punishment for his arrogance. But at least
he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at the dashboard. ``They left the keys,'' he said
aloud to no one. ``My head hurts! And my leg!''
</P>
<P>
   Max drove slowly back to the condo, gripping the wheel and
blinking his eyes. He let himself in, clicked on the lights, and
looked around suspiciously. He blamed himself for letting down his
guard against Glaber _ not Glaber, but William Miller _ and what
had Angela Powers said to him, just before the eclipse? Now he
remembered. He picked up the phone and dialed the home number of
his researcher, Violet Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet, this is Max.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What time Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, Violet, it's 1 a.m. I've had a bad day. Violet, I
talked to Glaber today. Got him to admit his real name was William
Miller. But I don't believe it. Look up that name. Check not only
personal and legal stuff _ it's a common name _ but look at
historical references _ check the damn World Book Encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, you woke me up to tell me to look something up in the
encyclopedia?'' She was groggy, but laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick with me, Violet. He named himself after one doomsday
guy. Let's see if he picked another. One more thing. Do you know
much about Kate Banks? I mean her personal life?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this about, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick with me, Violet. Does she have a daughter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, one daughter. Cassandra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is her middle name Angela?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kate Banks was married, right. Her husband died. What was his
name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael, I think, Michael Powers. Max, are you all right?
Please. Do you want me to come over?''
</P>
<P>
   Her concern made Max feel guilty that he had awakened her. There
was something special about her, he had discovered. He had met
highly intelligent people before. And compassionate ones. But never
in quite the combination that Violet offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A megabyte mind,'' Kate had said of her, ``and a heart of
gold.'' Sherry offered her own appreciation of Violet's character:
``She's got the hardware and the software.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, are you hurt? I'll come over if you need me to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Violet. You are a kind person. I'm sorry I woke you
up. It could have waited until tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me what happened, Max.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did. Detail by detail in chronological order. It helped
him clear his memory, make sense of the day, and rehearse the long
memo he would write to himself tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, and one more thing, Violet. He says he's from the West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``William Miller. From the West. Well that narrows it down.''
Max found Violet's laugh comforting.
</P>
<P>
   Max hung up. He stripped quickly, leaving his clothes in a pile
on the tile floor. He turned on the water in the shower until it
steamed up the room. The water hit his face _ he was sunburned _
just what a guy with skin cancer needed. But in a minute it felt
great, down into his muscles to the bone, steaming the pain and
poison from his body.
</P>
<P>
   Max turned to let the water hit his back. He let out a howl. As
the water sprayed the top of his leg, it stung like a horde of red
ants. ``What the ...?''
</P>
<P>
   He turned off the shower and stepped out onto the floor. A
full-length mirror on the back of the door was steamed up. He wiped
his hand across it and turned his body. And there it was. On his
right hip. A tattoo. The letter ``W.'' Sign of The Watchers.

   Sam Lockhart, police chief, had seen a lot in his day, but
nothing quite like this. A man stood in front of his desk, his
pants around his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my reward for doing your dirty work,'' said Max
Timlin. ``The letter `W' tattooed on my rear end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be laughing if it weren't for this.'' Sam slid an
investigative file across his desk. It contained autopsy photos,
and they were gruesome _ a young man and woman so broken apart they
look like they had imploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens after you've jumped off the Skyway
Bridge, and flown like a birdie 200 feet or so, and hit the water,
which is like concrete from that height. They were probably in the
water for a couple of days before they washed up.''

<P>
   ``What do you know about them?''

<P>
   ``White male and female. Probably a suicide pact. Drugs in the
system. Speed _ the kind of stuff that makes you aggressive and
paranoid. And check out this little detail.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief slid another photo across the desk. A close up showed
that each victim had the letter ``W'' tattooed above an ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to hate the look of that tattoo, so what say,
when this is over, the department springs to laser your sorry ass
and remove that nasty thing and all that it stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think it stands for, Sam?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe nothin' but a bunch of folks who like to dress up in
white for a New Year's Eve party. But my responsibility is to be
suspicious and stay that way. I don't know what Glaber is watchin'
for _ but I'm watchin' him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is he capable of? That's what I can't figure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just assume he could blow up a federal building, or burn
down his hotel with everyone in it, or hold a big party at the Dome
and make everyone drink poisoned lemonade, or that he might blow up
a 747, or car-bomb an embassy in Africa. Now that the Commies are
all gone, these nuts are turning their anger against their own
countries _ even their own people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember how I thought the Oklahoma City bombing was caused
by terrorists from the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And, surprise, it turned to be some pasty lookin' white boy
with a grudge against his own country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But how vulnerable are we here? We're just a quiet little city
in West Florida. The land of snowbirds and retirees and tourists.
The city of the newly wed and nearly dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got no imagination, Max. You want doomsday scenarios.
They could poison the water supply. Or hijack nerve gas or
biological weapons. They could sabotage our Air Force base _ which
would appeal to fellow terrorists around the globe since we have a
special strike force stationed in Tampa. On any given day, how many
people are in one of our amusement parks? What's the Big Mouse
gonna do, let Goofy carry an Uzi?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I write this story _ if I write it _ I'm gonna put all
that stuff in it _ make you sound a lot smarter than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean if you write it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well I may not have a job after I tell my boss what I think of
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Max drove now as fast as the Mustang would carry him across town
to the offices of the Florida Sun, a 10-story marble tower
overlooking Tampa Bay, housing Florida's best and biggest
newspaper. Max had always wanted to work there. And now he did _
sort of.
</P>
<P>
   He strode briskly through the lobby and right past the security
guard, who was looking down reading the paper, and into the
elevator. A large woman eating a doughnut told him Kate Banks'
office was on the ninth floor. He walked in through a cluster of
secretaries, ignored their questions, and strode into Kate's
office. She looked up from her desk and sensed right away that Max
had learned the truth. In fact, she had hoped he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela Powers is not her real name,'' said Kate. ``It's
Cassandra Powers. Cassie. Powers was my husband's last name, but
this Glaber guy got off on the idea of `angelic powers,' and she
must have gone along for the ride. I've been desperate about her,
Max. This girl has been messed up since her father's death. Please.
Don't walk out on this. I couldn't bring myself to tell you about
her and make you think I was hiring you as some kind of private
eye. I'm up to my ears with conflicts. How could my own paper cover
this when my daughter's so involved?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about full disclosure _ and then trusting your people to
do the right thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never been a parent, Max. You saw my daughter, didn't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she spiked my ice tea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean in the water, without her clothes, with Glaber and the
others looking on.'' Max nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sherry showed me those photos, I turned to ice. I've lost
my husband. I'm afraid of losing my daughter. And now I don't want
to lose you, at least as a dance partner. At least as a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Kate. I could use a pal. But one who, from now on, tells
me the whole truth. I know you've been hurting for your daughter,
so let's just say that I'll stay on the story ...,'' he dropped his
pants to show her the tattoo, `` ... to the bitter end.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate picked up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell, this is Kate. Please assemble the staff for a
meeting. I'll be down in an hour. There's something I want to tell
them, and someone I want them to meet.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max shows Sam Lockhart his Watcher tattoo and
gets a lecture on the potential dangers of a doomsday cult. Max
then confronts Kate about her daughter, but promises to stay on the
story.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A great thing happened to Max. His new friend Evie Hamilton
called him. She was going to visit her daughter in Santa Barbara,
Calif. Would Max like to take care of Daisy the dog for a week or
so? ``Of all her visitors, she liked you the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Daisy loved the beach, but shied away from the water. She walked
along the sand beside Max with a slight limp, which disappeared
when she broke into a jog. She was so attentive and so pleased to
be out, sniffing dead fish and clumps of seaweed, that Max didn't
bother with a leash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, there are no dogs allowed on the beach. We can't make the
sign any bigger. Are you a German tourist who can't read English?''
The harsh words came from a tall beach cop with a mean sneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I read the sign. And I ignored it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't any ordinary dog, copper.'' Max did a bad imitation
of Edward G. Robinson. The cop looked at him in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Max said in his own voice, ``This is Daisy _ the dog that
survived the fall from the Skyway Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The cop's features changed instantly. In a second he squatted to
pat Daisy's head, and apologized to Max, and walked with them down
the beach, explaining to sunbathers that they were in the presence
of royalty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they returned to the condo, Daisy collapsed on the
cool tile, sated with exercise, attention and affection.
</P>
<P>
   A knock at the door announced the arrival of Violet Rose,
looking smashing in a purple sun dress and strappy sandals. Her
long black hair was pulled into a ponytail, drawn neatly through
the back of a St. Pete Rays baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   She flashed him a bright smile, her face glowed, which could
mean two things at the same time: She was glad to see Max, and her
research had discovered something important. She arrived with a
chew toy for Daisy, some Chinese takeout for her and Max, and a
file under her arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were right, Max, about the name William Miller _ if that
is Glaber's real name, it's another weird coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The photocopies in Violet's file revealed that William Miller
was the most famous American doomsday prophet of the 19th century.
He claimed 100,000 followers. From his reading of the Bible, Miller
predicted that the Second Coming would occur on Oct. 22, 1844.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, they waited and waited and the day came, and it
went, and the Millerites, what was left of them, referred to that
time as `The Great Disappointment.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a few of those in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So have I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to try out the hot tub? Kate's got some stuff out
there you can wear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can Daisy join us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She seems a little shy of water right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daisy surprised them, hopping right in and splashing around
a minute and hopping out and shaking hard, sending a healthy spray
over Max and Violet.
</P>
<P>
   Max told her now about the Watcher tattoo, but did not show it
to her, and she did not ask to see it. He told her that Sam
Lockhart, feeling a little guilty about what had happened to Max,
had the entire police investigative file on The Watchers
photocopied for Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you take it, Violet, and have another copy made for
yourself? Pay special attention to Glaber. I have a hunch that if
we can find out who he is, even a little something about his
background, some big mystery will be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, there are lots of ways to track someone's background
online. You know that. It helps, of course, to have a real name or
date of birth or Social Security number. But I'll start with a
cross check of the names Glaber and Miller and see what turns up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get this guy's real name, I'll buy you a dozen roses _
violet roses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll settle for a foot massage. Right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Max granted her wish, a job that took a surprising length of
time. Each foot demanded careful attention. This was no hard labor,
he decided early on, but work that still commanded his best effort,
which meant not ignoring the Achilles tendon stretching up to a
firm but slender calf, and pressing his thumb hard up into the
arch, so that Violet closed her eyes and tilted back her head and
moaned and told him that it hurt but not to stop, and then pulling
on the dainty toes until they popped and making sure not to forget
to slide his fingers through the slips of skin between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about a kiss?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we get Daisy to join us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not this time.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max takes care of Daisy the dog, then receives
a visit from Violet Rose, who is tracking down the real identity of
Raoul Glaber. A foot rub leads to something more.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max Timlin woke up with a warm breath on his neck and rolled
over to see Daisy the dog on the next pillow. He let out a laugh
that startled Daisy from her sweet doggie dreams. Max offered her a
good morning ear rub and took a licking in return.
</P>
<P>
   This display of affection caused him to reflect on his
surprising good fortune with women, not a condition, after two
divorces, that he was used to.
</P>
<P>
   He got up and looked into the mirror and could not imagine what
anyone might see in him. A once athletic body had gone to seed.
Thinning blondish hair was down to a cluster of unruly stalks. He
had random scars from skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's invisible, he mused, or my after-shave. Kate Banks
was more attentive and earnest than ever before, but Max could look
into her dark brown eyes and see, clearly circumscribed, the
difference between friendship and love. That was fine with him. He
needed her passion and intelligence in mounting the investigation
against The Watchers. And she clearly needed him, at least for her
daughter's sake.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed his meetings with Sherry Darling, who continued
surreptitious photographing of The Watchers, not only around the
Conquistador Hotel, but also around the Star Dome, where
preparations were under way for an international gathering of
Watchers, now just a fortnight away. Sherry had become a great
buddy, a kindred spirit, a true partner to Max.
</P>
<P>
   And now came the delicious surprise of one Miss Violet Rose, who
had visited him for evening walks on the beach, each night for the
last five nights. Her purported mission was to fill him in on the
day's search. Along with gathering string on Glaber's background,
Violet was vacuuming the Internet landscape on news of the upcoming
Watchers event, billed as ``The New Awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, Violet taught Max some yoga stretching
exercises, which he found relaxing, cooked a meal for him, and
grabbed his hand during their sunset strolls.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, came the news from Evie Hamilton in California
that she would extend her visit to her daughter for a while. Max
assured her that Daisy would be in good hands until her return.
</P>
<P>
   The week had brought one disturbing development. Two more
Watchers were found floating face down in Tampa Bay. The couple _
another man and woman _ lacked the identifying tattoos, but they
were clean cut and dressed in white.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Sam Lockhart had sent his investigative unit into the
Conquistador Hotel, but the detective turned up little to indicate
why two healthy young people _ just before the New Awakening _
would choose to sleep with the fishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We presume they jumped,'' Sam told Max, ``except for one
little detail. There was no abandoned vehicle near the top of the
Skyway. How the hell did they get up there? Take a little stroll?
Or did someone give them a lift? And maybe a little push?''
</P>
<P>
   Max was writing furiously now every day, sometimes as much as
5,000 words or more. Kate had arranged a small team to cover the
daily activities of The Watchers. It was agreed that Max would
write the blockbuster, which would appear after the first of the
year, or the first of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The world was a month away from the biggest New Year's Eve party
of all time, and you could not turn on TV without seeing Dick Clark
hyping the annual Times Square event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join us for The Biggest Ball of All,'' he said, still looking
like the world's oldest teen-ager. And you couldn't turn on the
radio without hearing Prince or the Artist Formerly Known As _
heck, he had more names than Glaber _ singing ``1999'': ``Two
thousand zero zero, party over, oops, out of time ... We're gonna
party like it's 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Max sang along to the radio as he drove the Mustang toward the
St. Pete Municipal Airport, a flying club for rich people, really,
but convenient for journalists.
</P>
<P>
   There he met Sherry and a pilot. They boarded a helicopter _ Max
hated helicopters and high places _ but in he went after a
reassuring hug from Sherry. They circled the beautiful waterfront
district, and shot across the city, hovering over the roof of the
amazing Star Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where The Watchers will be gathering,'' said Sherry.
``This is the site for the New Awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   The great white roof was a structural marvel: six acres of
strong but flexible fiberglass coated with Teflon, translucent to
affect the light in the stadium, supported by 180 miles of cables
connected by struts, yet puffy, like the world's largest throw
pillow.
</P>
<P>
   The chopper banked and cut south. Max's heart raced and his
mouth went dry and he gripped his seat and closed his eyes.
Meanwhile, Sherry was gabbing and pointing and leaning out to shoot
images of the Skyway.
</P>
<P>
   Max found the courage to look down at another engineering marvel
_ a gorgeous bridge, its golden cables rising to the heavens in two
steeples, as if to sanctify the blue-green marriage of sky above
and water below.
</P>
<P>
   But he could never view this without thinking of the destruction
of the old bridge, and the 35 people in cars and a bus who had gone
off the end to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about bridges?'' he wondered aloud. He knew many
people had nightmares about bridges. He had interviewed people who
could not drive across the Skyway themselves. They needed friends,
or chauffeurs, or Valium to get them across.
</P>
<P>
   Then he thought of those who had made their way to the top, who
had looked down at this beauty, only to feel betrayed by it and the
world. Then it came to him in a flash of images. Maybe the drowned
Watchers hadn't jumped. Maybe they hadn't been driven to the top
and pushed over. Maybe they had been flown over and dropped from
the sky.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Two Watchers are found floating in Tampa Bay.
Max ponders if they jumped off the Skyway Bridge, or were pushed?
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by Max, the police began an inquiry into whether the
dead Watchers could have been dropped from a plane or helicopter to
make it look like a suicide leap off the Skyway Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injuries on these folks were unusually devastating,'' Sam
reported to Max over the telephone. ``The medical examiner says the
injuries are consistent with a drop of more than 200 feet _ but so
many things can affect this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any comment from Glaber?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Through a spokesman he said that young people, even Watchers,
killing themselves was a horrible thing, and a clear sign of a
troubled world tumbling toward its end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What an ass----.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says The Watchers don't own a plane or helicopter. Only
boats, vans and cars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I saw something that could be a landing pad for a
helicopter _ out beyond the dunes near the Conquistador.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll check it out. What are you up to?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm writing like crazy, but today I'm going to call on a
friend, so I can get into the Star Dome and view the New Awakening
with my own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Max found himself on the southern tip of St.
Petersburg, in a neighborhood called Pinellas Point, where great
oak trees hung shade over lovely wide streets that for decades had
been paved with pink concrete. Most people called this place ``The
Pink Streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Max's face was as pink as the streets. He was jogging _ feeling
flabby and out of breath _ next to a tall, young black man, who
happened to be one of Florida's most beloved athletes, James
``Choirboy'' Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had grown up in St. Pete, one of the nation's only
five-sport athletes and an honors student at Lakewood High. At
6-foot-4, both nimble and strong, James played quarterback, point
guard and center field. He ran track. And he once joined the soccer
team to step in for an injured goalkeeper. He went to Florida
State, where he decided to concentrate on baseball. He was now in
his second season playing with the St. Pete Pelicans.
</P>
<P>
   Max had written about him after James' father was murdered in a
convenience-store robbery. The father, Charles Jones, was a great
preacher and pastor _ earning his son the nickname ``Choirboy'' _
and his death stunned the community.
</P>
<P>
   In his father's honor, James had committed half of his huge
salary to charitable work. He built houses for the working poor,
sponsored the construction of athletic fields in the poorest
neighborhoods, purchased books for a new library branch and could
often be seen on Sunday mornings at local churches, working with
pastors on their most pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you want me to sneak you into the Dome for this Awakening
event. Don't you know I'm the Choirboy. I'm not exactly the sneaky
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``James, I didn't know where else to turn. You know everybody in
that place _ and The Watchers are barring the press, and they know
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max. I like you, my friend. The story you wrote made my mother
cry her heart out over my father _ but in a good way. So I'll help
you. But, to ease my Choirboy conscience, I must impose two
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Name them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you have to come with me to church early Sunday
morning. Then for the rest of the day, you have to help me build a
house. Then, if you can still stand up _ by the way, you are way
out of shape _ we'll go to the Dome.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday afternoon, every muscle in Max's body, including
some he didn't know he had, ached. Seven hours of bending, lifting,
hammering, lifting, bending, had taken their toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I've worked like that, James. I
think I remember now why I became a writer. No heavy lifting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Words can be heavy, very heavy. But this is good for your
body, Max, and your soul. I can see that God ain't done with you
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   They hugged and Max remembered that Father Ralph had said the
same thing, using almost the same words.
</P>
<P>
   It was no trouble for James to get into the Dome, even on a
night when the building was closed to the public. They trusted him
with his own key. ``Max, you came to church with me. You helped me
build a house.''
</P>
<P>
   They were standing at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm gonna add one more stipulation. I've got a great idea
for how you can get in here, see everything you need to see and
still not be seen by a single Watcher. But it's gonna cost you.''
</P>
<P>
   Max could see mischief in the eyes of the Choirboy. ``Max,
you've got to beat me in a race around the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean I run and you crawl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, easier. You start at second base and I'll start out at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Max lost. His legs, tight from the day's work, slid out from
under him rounding third base, and by the time he recovered, he
could hear the fastest man in baseball whooshing by him. ``You've
got to promise you'll write about this, Max. Not now. But someday,
when I enter the Hall of Fame.'' Coming from the Choirboy, it did
not sound like bragging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll write your life story, James Choirboy Jones. I've never
met an athlete _ a man _ like you. Now where are you going to hide
me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Max lifted his eyes from the tip of his friend's finger, up, up,
up, till his head was bent back, staring at a thin catwalk leading
to a circular bank of huge speakers. Up, up, up, more than 250 feet
to the domed roof of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up there?''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max makes plans to sneak into the huge Watcher
convention, with the help of James ``Choirboy'' Jones, a great
athlete and champion of social justice.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   To get Max to the top of the Dome would require three things: a
guide, a rehearsal and a counter-phobic energy he did not believe
he possessed. James Choirboy Jones hooked Max up with the Dome's
master sound engineer, a short, silver-haired Italian man named
Rocky Como. From a distance, Rocky was the spitting image of Father
Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ain't the first guy to say so,'' said the man known as The
Rock. ``In fact I know the Good Father. If you are friends with the
Good Father and the Choirboy, maybe I can be your friend some day,
cause you got great taste in friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocky, I'm afraid of heights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to worry. You don't look down. You follow me and stare
right into the middle of my back. And breathe nice and steady.
Don't forget to breathe, or you'll die. But first you wear this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocky gave him a bright orange jump suit that said Star Dome
Sound on the back. It was a little big for Max, but he found it
light and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   He stared up at the Dome roof. He saw four concentric circles _
metal catwalks that allowed workmen access to different parts of
the roof. The outer ring was the lowest, circling most of the
inside of the stadium. Only a few hitters could reach that catwalk.
The next ring in was also a home run, requiring a long, high fly to
reach it. The next ring in was higher still. A high pop-up could
reach it, but not often. The ball was in play.
</P>
<P>
   And then at the center, like the bull's eye in a target, was the
smallest and highest circle, home of the Dome's speaker system. A
person could hide behind those speakers, invisible to the crowd
below.
</P>
<P>
   Each circle was connected to the next by a thin metal gangplank
_ with protective sides _ acting as a kind of ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll come in through the service entrance, wearing that
gear. If anyone stops you, have them call me. I'll clear you.
You'll take Service Elevator 11 _ that's this one _ and it will
take you to the first catwalk. From that point on, it's a piece of
pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The march that followed looked like a dog trying to follow a cat
across a circus tight rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow down, Rocky. Take it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Max gripped the hand rails on the first ramp so tight it gave
him blisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stare at my back,'' Rocky said, over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, they had reached the final ramp, steeper
than the others, but shorter in distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't look down!'' But Max couldn't help it. Step, step ...
step ... step ... step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, you got here. One more step. Look up.''
</P>
<P>
   And there he was, but his heart raced like a fast ball, a
burning sweat stung his eyes and soaked through his clothes all the
way through the jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, that ain't so hard,'' said Rocky, pointing to a safe
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Max regained his breath and composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perfect, Rocky. I'll be able to see everything. But
just one thing? How do I get down?''
</P>
<P>
   That night Max Timlin had a dream, and it was a doozy. It began
with the sound of a helicopter: tucka tucka tucka tucka tucka, and
he was the only passenger, but no one was at the controls. He was
sitting next to an open door, gaping wide, and the copter _ it was
black _ circled and circled over the Star Dome, till Max was dizzy
from the motion.
</P>
<P>
   An unseen hand pushed him in the back and he tumbled over, down,
down, head first, but then upright, waving his arms. He looked down
to see the great white roof of the Dome, like a lovely marshmallow
pie.
</P>
<P>
   He would be safe, he thought. But his body sliced like a hot
knife through the marshmallow, through layers of roof, and into the
stadium where he grasped at air until his hands locked on a piece
of metal, the third catwalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now batting for the Pelicans, James Choirboy JONES!'' But Max,
facing home plate could see it wasn't the Choirboy, but Glaber _
only huge _ on steroids.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch. The crack of the bat _ deafening _ and a shot like a
missile, the ball hit so hard it traced a path in the air, coming
at him, at him, hitting his right hand with the force of a grenade
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging by one hand now, and all the fans dressed in white
cheering as Glaber rounded the bases, the fans looking up at him
and laughing and pointing and chanting his name in derision:
``Max-well, Max-well.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing the grasp now and falling down, down, and gazing down, in
this dream, he saw not the green of the outfield turf, but the
night-black waters below the Skyway Bridge.

   THE STORY SO FAR: Reporter Max Timlin is hired by editor Kate
Banks to investigate a doomsday cult called The Watchers and
succeeds at penetrating their inner sanctum. Max confronts The
Watcher leader, Raoul Glaber. Max suspects that is not his real
name. He then learns that Glaber's protege, the beautiful Angela
Powers, is really the daughter of Kate Banks. Two Watchers are
found floating in the sea, suspected suicides. Violet helps Max
track down Glaber's real identity and earns his affection. Max
overcomes his fear of heights to spy on The Watcher's convention at
the domed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The crow's nest behind the speakers turned out to be the perfect
vantage point to view The Watchers' so-called ``New Awakening.'' A
work crew had erected makeshift bleachers across the outfield. The
doors had opened at noon, and Max watched as a sea of white
streamed in noisily, trying to get as close as possible to a
central stage, erected near home plate.
</P>
<P>
   White banners were hung everywhere with slogans such as WATCH
THIS! and WATCH WITH US and AWAKE AND AWARE.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers pumped stadium music. Rocky told Max to wear
earplugs, but all the sound was directed out from where he was
sitting. Whoever picked the music and big screen videos had a sense
of humor because all the songs had ``white'' in the title _ from
``White Christmas'' to ``A Whiter Shade of Pale'' to, amazingly,
Billy Idol's ``White Wedding.'' Max curled his lip reflexively.
</P>
<P>
   The lights went out, and the crowd hushed and then became more
excited, like a rock concert, anticipating the featured act. Then
more music, the familiar throbbing of that great rock anthem of
paranoia and stalking, the rhythm like a heartbeat over Sting's
persistent voice: ``Every step you take, every move you make ...
I'll be watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a blast of crisscross laser beams, as bright white lights
shone on Glaber and his minions _ all dressed in blood-red tuxedos
_ almost 30 of them _ all blond or bald, except Glaber whose hair
was dark _ and one woman in a red, skintight, formal dress. Angela
Powers.
</P>
<P>
   Glaber raised his hand for silence. ``You know,'' he began,
``I've been following the stock market recently ...'' He paused,
and the crowd laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So here we are less than a month before a new millennium, and
the market is down. Now where is Wall Street's confidence? My
children, the economies of the world are about to crumble. Those
who put their stock in gold, now have rust. Those who put their
stock in lust, now have AIDS. Those who put their stock in the
religions of your fathers, are left with empty promises. Pie in the
sky when you die.'' More laughter and applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about all of you who have put your stock in me? What
do you all have?''
</P>
<P>
   The Watchers rose as one in prolonged waves of cheers and whoops
and cries, morphing finally into a chant of their leader's name:
``Ra-ool, Ra-ool.'' It shook the stadium, and Glaber put his hands
on his hips, nodded up toward the cheap seats, and smiled, looking
every bit the presidential candidate about to give an acceptance
speech.
</P>
<P>
   They showered him with love, dancing and jumping up and down the
aisles, waving placards that pronounced their place of origin: New
York, California, Montreal, Brazil, Denmark, even Japan.
</P>
<P>
   From Max's watchtower it looked like he was staring into a
microscope at some strange organism, vibrating with energy,
changing shape, a source of fascination and mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you have been through the rite of initiation _ you have
shed the garments of darkness for robes of white. And let me say
that some of you look better without your clothes than others.'' He
glanced toward Angela. Waves of laughter. ``We on this stage wear
red, as you all will wear red in a new dawn, blazing with blood and
fire.'' That quieted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you will experience a New Awakening. If there are any
among you who still slumber _ if your right eye is closed _ it will
be opened. With opened eyes we will watch together. For it is
ordained that we shall not watch alone. And so today, before you, I
will take unto me a bride.''
</P>
<P>
   The news caught the crowd by surprise, until people started to
point and call out, and before long they were cheering and chanting
her name: ``An-gel-a, An-gel-a.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber reached out her hand for her. She stood slowly, holding
her hands over her face, but Max could not tell the nature of the
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let that poor girl go! Let her go, I say. Give her her
freedom. Freedom, I say, freedom!'' The new voice was loud and
strong, coming clearly through the sound system. The voice was
familiar to Max, but it was not Glaber's.
</P>
<P>
   The group on stage stood and looked at each other and around the
stadium in search of the phantom voice. People in the crowd were
pointing. ``Up here, Glaber. Up here, on the catwalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Max turned to see a solitary little man, dressed in an orange
jump suit, wearing a halo of silver hair. He was looking down, like
Moses descending from Sinai, and was holding a wireless mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God,'' said Max aloud, ``it's Rocky, the sound engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Glaber,'' the voice boomed again. ``This is the day of a Great
Awakening, all right. And it's time for all these people to wake up
and see you for what you really are. A no-good stinker. A coward. A
bum.''
</P>
<P>
   Max stood up straight in his crow's nest, this interloper's
words ringing in his ears, vibrating from the speakers through his
body. It was not Rocky Como after all, he realized. ``It's Father
Ralph.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: The Watcher convention is a giant party for
Raoul Glaber until it is crashed by a little man with silver hair _
Father Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, time meant nothing for Max. It did not matter to him
whether it took two minutes or two days to climb down from his
crow's nest atop the domed stadium. When he got down during his
rehearsal, he had Rocky Como's back to stare at, and his
encouragement. But now it was just Max in an empty stadium, the
event he had witnessed so extraordinary, he couldn't get it out of
his head, even as he inched down the gangplanks and across the
catwalks towards the safety of sea level.
</P>
<P>
   He even prayed, which was not his style. ``Dear Lord, who so
inspired Father Ralph, please get me down off this damn thing.
Sorry about the damn.''
</P>
<P>
   As he descended _ always trying to look out, not down _ Max
replayed the events of the last few hours, again. He could not even
estimate how long they took. Time stood still. Or it sped up. Or it
reversed its field, creating a moment fit only for history,
mythology, or literature: the Knight playing chess with the figure
of Death; Christ facing the Grand Inquisitor; Clarence Darrow
cross-examining William Jennings Bryan during the Scopes Monkey
Trial; Don Juan in Hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Satan?'' Raoul Glaber had asked Father Ralph, who
stood safe and solitary on a catwalk above the crowd, wearing the
orange jumpsuit of a sound engineer, clutching a wireless mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm just a man. I'm not Satan. I'm not an angel. I'm not a
prophet. Just a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And why have you come here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To save that young woman.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to Angela Powers, who stepped back from Glaber and
looked down, as if in shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is loved here. But she is free to leave,'' said Glaber,
who gestured to the crowd. ``They are all free to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you know about freedom, Mr. Bigshot Watcher, Mr. Red
Tuxedo? There is no true freedom without responsibility. And you
act with no responsibility toward that woman, or to any of these
young people. If you did, you would not hide behind a false mask
and a false name. You would not offer them despair in the guise of
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I offer them despair, old man?'' Max sensed a subtle
shift in Glaber's voice, an erosion of his arrogance and
self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say that the human race has proved unfit for saving. I say
you're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You say this, old man, in the last days of a century that gave
us Hitler and Stalin and Pol Pot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not deny it. But can you deny that it also gave us Gandhi
and Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela and Jonas Salk and Dr. King
and my mother _ the woman was a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around you, old man, look at the world with your eyes
opened, and not through the nostalgic blindness of your senility.
Your generation left these children with ashes.'' This brought
scattered applause from a crowd that seemed unsure how to respond
to this debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What year were you born, oh great leader of The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I tell you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you afraid of me? An old man, as you say. Can't you answer
a simple question? The truth cannot harm you here _ with your many
followers, surrounded by your guards and cronies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in 1950.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so you'll turn 50 in the year 2,000. And you've chosen a
bride young enough to be your daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph paced as he spoke now, and raised his arms to the crowd
melodramatically. ``Kids. Don't you get it? Your leader is about to
turn 50. He's over the hill. He's playing the back nine. He wants a
trophy bride. He rides around in a power boat. Your prophet is not
ushering in a new millennium. He's having a midlife crisis!''
</P>
<P>
   This remark brought some scattered bursts of laughter, but these
were shouted down, until an angry murmur spread throughout the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't I send my helpers up there and have you thrown
into the street?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you are afraid of me, son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I an NOT your son.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber lost his cool, Max could hear it in his voice and see it
in his body language. ``You are NOT my father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're God's son. Just love God, and love these children
enough _ love that young woman enough to free her. Free them all.
Let them go. Young lady ...''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph's voice was comforting now, as if he were sitting across
the table from her, sharing a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young lady. You're free to go. Go ahead. Go.''
</P>
<P>
   With that Angela Powers dashed off the stage, her hand across
her face, as if to hold back tears. She ran like an athlete, even
in that slinky red dress and high heels, past a confused palace
guard, down a runway and out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tolerated your intrusion, old man _ I think you are
Satan _ but now you have gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber was beginning to rant. He gestured to three burly blond
men at the edge of the stage who ran off. To find Angela? To get
Ralph? Max couldn't tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing you can do to harm me,'' said Ralph. ``I do
not fear you. And, children, I do not fear the world. Embrace it.
Do not hate it. Walk out now. Go find a phone. Call your parents.
Wish them a Merry Christmas. Go visit them on New Year's Eve. Bring
some nice pastry. Buy them a Tony Bennett or a Frank Sinatra CD.
Watch the football games. Enjoy. Listen to that word. Enjoy. It has
joy in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber stared up, speechless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those fingers in my hair, That sly come hither stare, That
strips my conscience bare _ It's witchcraft.'' Max was laughing
now, wanting to leap from his perch down to Ralph, to hug him and
lift him up like a prizefighter and raise his hand in victory.
Ralph was breaking into his Frank Sinatra medley. ``I've got the
world on a string, Sittin' on a rainbow, Got the string around my
finger, What a world, What a life, I'm in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber screamed and twisted around, ``Is there no one here who
will rid me of this Satan in the guise of an old man?''
</P>
<P>
   At that remark the crowd grew angry. People stood and shook
their fists at Ralph, or threw cups or plastic water bottles at
him. But it appeared as if a few others were trying to restrain
them. A fight broke out in the upper deck, and then another in the
mezzanine. Glaber's entourage tore off the stage, running to the
trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked down at the chaos. From his vantage point, it looked
like an illuminated manuscript of Dante's Inferno, a vibrating mass
of humanity, trapped in its own confusion and agony. And there, in
the middle, standing on the stage alone, his arms held wide, his
head down, like a crucified icon, was Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one more thing before I go,'' said Father Ralph. ``A
little something from the poet T.S. Eliot: `In the end is my
beginning ... In the beginning is my end ... And the end of all our
exploring / Will be to arrive where we started /And know the place
for the first time.' Have a nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a group of Glaber's men appeared on the lower
catwalk, and just as quickly Ralph disappeared through a doorway,
his voice an echo in the great stadium.
</P>
<P>
   More fights broke out in the stands, with two men clutching at
each other, leaning dangerously over a high railing. A new
commotion raised the decibel level higher as city police streamed
into the stadium, wearing yellow vests and riot gear.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Father Ralph debates the leader of The
Watchers, and, along the way, secures the freedom of Glaber's young
bride-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max rushed back to the newspaper office, where Kate and her team
had assembled. They debriefed him on what he had seen at the
stadium, but not before he had a quick private conversation with
Kate about how Glaber had announced that Angela would become his
bride, how Father Ralph had dramatically intervened, how Angela was
last seen running out of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Kate crossed her arms and bit her lip, worried more than ever
about her daughter's safety and her mental state.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted but driven by adrenaline, Max wrote a 3,000-word memo
on what he had witnessed and turned it over to an editor. He picked
up the phone and dialed Violet's extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Max,'' she said sweetly. ``I guess this means you made it
down from the dome ceiling safe and sound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Check your e-mail for my memo, Violet. It was amazing. I'm
heading back to the condo. But I want to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see you, Max,'' said Violet, and then, ``and not
just see you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet. Glaber says he was born in 1950.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's telling the truth, that will help.''
</P>
<P>
   Max cruised home, still replaying the events of the day. The
police had arrested 50 Watchers. Angela Powers was missing. Raoul
Glaber had to be led from the stage by one of his followers. Father
Ralph Rizzo was _ well, for all Max knew _ he was eating lasagna
and listening to a Frank Sinatra CD.
</P>
<P>
   When Max let himself in to the condo, he knew right away that
something was wrong. All the lights were on, and the television
blared, turned to the local station, which was reporting news of
the arrests at the Dome. He heard music coming from the back.
</P>
<P>
   Max suddenly wished Daisy had been there as a watchdog, but Evie
had returned from California and retrieved the famous Skyway pup.
``HEY!'' barked Max, ``who's here?''
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed a golf club _ a 2-iron _ from the front closet and
hefted it with two hands over one shoulder as if it were a baseball
bat. He stepped cautiously through the place, peeking around
corners, into one bathroom, the bedrooms, the office. All the
lights were on.
</P>
<P>
   Then finally he poked a door open with the end of his club. It
squeaked, and Max could see that someone had lit candles beside the
Jacuzzi and was listening to classical music. Bach, he thought. The
candles flickered from the gulf breeze, sending odd shadows across
the room, shadows of a human figure, whose body now made ripples in
the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can come in, Max. It's only me.''
</P>
<P>
   He took one more step, and there she was, still beautiful and
once again in the water without the benefit of clothes. He gazed on
the face and body that could distract even the head of The Watchers
from his millennium watch. Angela Powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do me one favor, please,'' said Max. ``Put something on.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she turned a dial which sent bubbles across the surface
of the water, concealing her nakedness. She slid down, so only her
face and kneecaps were visible. ``How's that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine. Why did you drug me at the hotel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know they put a drug in your ice tea, Max. I swear I
didn't. I didn't know a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That he wanted me to marry him, for goodness sake. There's
been nothing like that between us. That came out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or that Watchers were going to start jumping off the bridge. I
knew those four people. I thought they were looking forward to a
new life _ I can't imagine what drove them to suicide. When I
started asking questions, all I got back were strange vibes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand one thing. From what I've learned, you
could be a brain surgeon or an Olympic athlete or a Victoria's
Secret model. What drove you to a windbag like Glaber?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could answer that, a lot of my problems would be solved.
Maybe my mother could tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does she know you're here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. But she gave me a key to the place. I'm glad I kept it. I
love my mother. Can you believe that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's heartsick over what's happened to you. And frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went off the deep end when my father died. I admit it. We
were so close. He raised me, directed me, coached me, cared for me,
while my mom was off working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So Glaber became your substitute daddy?'' Max said it with
sarcasm, and then regretted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ridicule me, Max. It's not that simple. Raoul was
charming and persuasive _ and his challenges about the world
stimulated my thinking. Why not become part of something big and
important? When he took an interest in me, started calling me
Angela, it raised my status in the group. It was like I was Chelsea
Clinton, or a beautiful princess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've hurt a lot of people for a little bit of attention and
celebrity, Angela Powers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please call me Cassie. I want my old name back. And my old
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good first step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you hand me that robe, please?''
</P>
<P>
   Max picked the blue one, instead of the white, handed it to her
and turned away, and closed his eyes for good measure as she slid
out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry you were hurt, Max. And I'm sorry my mom ...'' She
began to sob. ``And I'm afraid something really bad is going to
happen on January 1st _ and if anyone else gets hurt _ I'm sorry.
So sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   She dropped her head straight forward till her forehead hit Max
in the shoulder blade. It hurt. Max put his arm around her and
ushered her back inside. ``Come on. Let's call your mother and let
her know you're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they stepped through into the living room, there stood
three burly blond men, dress in white. Angela screamed. Max grabbed
the lamp and threw it at them. One blocked it with his forearm then
grabbed Max, spun him around and locked the vice of his arm against
Max's windpipe until the room got darker and slipped from under
him.

<P>
   An article in Sunshine magazine a few years ago mentioned the
way most people talk. It said that they use Ds instead of Ps.
</P>
<P>
   According to the article, the string of Ds that people vocalized
every day included debt, doubt, disease, disaster, depression,
danger, defeat, dread, destitution and desolation.
</P>
<P>
   The article went on to say we would be much better off talking
about the Ps: peace, prosperity, plenty, purpose, persistence,
promotion, proficiency, progress, perseverance, prayer and
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Which of the two types--the Ds or the Ps--do you think lives in
a more heavenly state of consciousness?
</P>
<P>
   A story is told about a man who went to call at the place of
business of one of his friends, a jeweler with a large clientele.
The jeweler showed his friend a store filled with superb diamonds
and other precious stones. Among them was a stone so lusterless
that the friend said, ``That one has no beauty at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasn't it?'' asked the jeweler, lifting the stone from the
tray and closing his fist over it. In a few minutes, when he opened
his hand, the stone glowed with all the splendor of the rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, what have you done to it?'' asked the friend.
</P>
<P>
   The jeweler smiled. ``That is an opal,'' he said. ``It is what
we call a sympathetic jewel. It needs only to be gripped with the
human hand to bring out all its wonderful beauty!''
</P>
<P>
   Living on the ``right'' side of life, or the ``heavenly'' side,
can bring sparkle and beauty to the many facets of our
individuality and the way our life unfolds. Maybe you know someone
who lives in a ``heavenly'' state of consciousness, and things seem
to work out well for them. They enjoy splendid health. The affairs
of their life seem to be happy and harmonious, and the much-desired
``good things of life'' have a habit of coming their way.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are others who somehow manage to get on the
``wrong side of life,'' regardless of their desire for things to be
otherwise. They experience times when nothing seems to work out in
their favor. The harder they try, the farther away they seem to be
from good health, happiness, success, or whatever good they may be
seeking. What makes the difference between these two seemingly
opposite ways of life?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that our attitude of mind can actually help the
good things of life either to gravitate toward us or move away from
us. Our mind and our thinking processes can make a heaven into a
hell, or a hell into a heaven.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, can one cultivate and develop the right attitude of
mind?
</P>
<P>
   The first step can be to pause right where we are, stop the
chattering noise of our thoughts, and allow our thinking to become
rightly adjusted. To pause for a moment in your activities does not
mean to give up, quit, or ``lie down on the job.'' Far from it!
Such a pause can help you regain the proper perspective of life and
to get your thoughts going in a positive direction again.
</P>
<P>
   A second step can be to reaffirm your faith, lift your
consciousness--and your thoughts--to a higher level of expression.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at an example. Suppose you are experiencing some
difficulty. Daily living may seem to be hard going at the moment,
and you may feel uncertain about what you need to do next. Instead
of beginning to panic and put pressure on yourself, pause for a
moment and affirm, ``Spirit goes before me, guiding and directing
my efforts and my direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifting your thoughts to a higher level can renew and restore
the peace and serenity of your awareness--and your life!
</P>
<P>
   One further step is often necessary. This is to go forward with
confidence and courage, trusting the inner guidance that you
receive and know that the way is clear.
</P>
<P>
   A minister tells a story about a little boy who was supposed to
be helping him straighten chairs and place hymnals in the sanctuary
in preparation for the Sunday service. The two had been working
side by side for about 20 minutes. The boy was working a little and
whistling a lot, while the minister simply worked. Finally, the
minister called the boy over and asked, ``Whatcha doing?''
</P>
<P>
   The boy paused, and answered, ``Passing out hymnals and
whistling.'' Another pause, and he continued, ``but mostly
whistling!''
</P>
<P>
   After a moment of reflection, the minister decided the boy had a
pretty good idea--to whistle in the midst of the work at hand. In
fact, whistling may well be one of the most redemptive activities
we can take part in. This capacity to whistle, to flow freely, and
to enjoy what we're doing in the middle of a busy day could be an
art that needs to be cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us can take our activities pretty seriously most of the
time because we are searching and trying to contribute creatively
to life. But how much whistling do we do in the midst of this?
</P>
<P>
   While life may be serious, it doesn't need to be somber. It does
not have to be hellish; it can be a heavenly experience. It can be
a great challenge or adventure; like mountain climbing, it is meant
to be an exhilarating experience every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Life involves both ``passing out hymnals'' and ``whistling.''
And perhaps there are times when we need to be ``mostly
whistling.''

`DELIVERANCE' AND MORE ON DVD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director John Boorman's career is one that is not easy to
categorize or assess. In his 30-plus years as a filmmaker he has
made one genuine critical and commercial success _ ``Deliverance''
(1972). Meanwhile, the rest of his films have ranged from the
sublime, such as ``Hope and Glory'' (1987); to the sloppy (to be
kind), such as ``Exorcist II: The Heretic'' (1977); to the simply
odd, such as ``Zardoz'' (1974).
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Boorman was thought of as a man's director,
especially with his two films with Lee Marvin, ``Hell in the
Pacific'' (1968) and the marvelous ``Point Blank'' (1967), which
was remade into this year's Mel Gibson film ``Payback.''
``Deliverance,'' which was recently released on DVD, hammered home
the perception, though Boorman would prove to have a warm side as
shown in ``Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Deliverance,'' which starred Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ronny
Cox and Ned Beatty, tells the story of four Atlanta businessmen's
ill-fated rafting trip in the wilds of Appalachia. What begins as a
fun adventure, an attempt to relate to nature, turns dark as the
wilderness becomes their enemy. As they are pursued by vengeful
mountain men, the businessmen's fight for survival tests their
notions of what being civilized means as they are confronted with a
brutality in nature and in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deliverance,'' based on the late James Dickey's novel, is a
visually stunning film, thanks to the cinematography of Vilmos
Zsigmond, and remains as provocative and shocking as it was at the
time of its release. The DVD (Warners, $24.95) includes a making-of
featurette called ``The Dangerous World of Deliverance,'' which
shows the arduous task of making the film, which was shot along the
Chattanooga River in Georgia. It also has a remastered soundtrack.
Remember ``Dueling Banjos''?
</P>
<P>
   After a few filmmaking detours, Boorman returned to form with
``Excalibur'' (1981), a retelling of the legend of Arthur. With
clanking armor, knights being whacked in half, betrayal, lust,
liberal sex and dollops of mysticism and magic, ``Excalibur'' is a
lusty sword-and-sorcery treat. Based on Sir Thomas Malory's ``Le
Morte D'Arthur,'' Boorman's film is a much more intelligent use of
myth than ``Star Wars,'' which is just a sword-and-sorcery fable
set in space. The reason the legend of Arthur has survived for so
long is that it is a quintessential tale of good vs. evil as man
tries to find grace (or deliverance?) in the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   The film was a return to form (and themes) for Boorman, and it
was apparent that he relished the challenge. While ``Excalibur''
can be a bit confusing at times on first viewing, the director (he
was also co-writer) managed to turn a complicated story into an
entertaining and thoughtful film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excalibur'' has also been released on DVD (Warner; $24.98). It
includes an audio commentary by Boorman. In one interesting tidbit,
the director talks about how the studio originally didn't want
Nicol Williamson for the key role of Merlin and how Williamson
didn't want the part when he found out Helen Mirren had been cast
as Morgana (Arthur's half-sister). When Mirren found that out, she
said she wouldn't work with Williamson. Eventually Boorman
persuaded the British stage stars to join the film, and it's
interesting to note that the pair, who play an antagonistic
cat-and-mouse magic game, give the most interesting performances in
the film _ with Williamson at his twitchy best and Mirren at her
most devilish. The film is also notable for early performances by
Patrick Stewart, Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Boorman's latest film, ``The General'' was
released on video. It is also a return to form after a while out of
the public eye, winning Boorman the best-director award at Cannes.
It tells the true story of Irish crime boss Martin Cahill, who
actually burgled Boorman's house. The film shows Cahill (Brendan
Gleason) trying to fence Boorman's gold record of ``Dueling
Banjos.'' In another tie to ``Deliverance,'' Voight plays the man
in pursuit of Cahill. And, as with ``Deliverance,'' it's among
Boorman's best, and that means it shouldn't be missed. &QL;

CLINTON IN NORWAY: SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE VISITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALEX A. VARDAMIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL, Calif. _ For the first time in history, a sitting
American president will visit the land of lutefisk and lefse.
President Clinton travels to Norway on Tuesday to attend a memorial
ceremony for Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who was
assassinated four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute will once again position Oslo in the center of the
Middle East peace process. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat plan to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians invited Clinton. He declined. On Oct. 15,
Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, during a visit to
Washington, repeated the invitation. Again, Clinton was too busy.
</P>
<P>
   But four days later, on Oct. 19, came the surprising
announcement that the president had changed his mind. Sandy Berger,
the national security advisor, spoke of a new American summit to
take place in Oslo. Suddenly, it seemed as if a guest at a party
had declared himself the host.
</P>
<P>
   Startled Norwegians are scrambling to prepare for the visit.
That a busy American president would take time to visit Oslo is
seen by the Norwegian press as a tribute to the Land of the
Midnight Sun and to its role in bringing together the Palestinians
and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Why has Clinton changed his mind? Could there be a breakthrough
in the peace process? Or could it be that presiding over a
handshake between Arafat and Barak is a photo op too good to pass
up?
</P>
<P>
   Other factors might be in play. A respite from the quotidian
congressional salvos might seem tempting. A cruise on the fjords
might be more soothing than midnight golf. And what is more calming
than a nostalgic trip into the past? Certain it is that the always
polite but ever tenacious Scandinavian press will have an
opportunity to address a number of unresolved issues.
</P>
<P>
   These are a few of the questions the American president might be
asked. The responses would, of course, be of interest only to
Norwegian admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. President, we Norwegians are a modest bunch, reluctant to
enter the spotlight. However, we have occasionally noticed that our
own efforts in advancing the peace process in the Middle East seem
to have been subsumed into the achievements of your administration.
</P>
<P>
   We were disappointed, for example, that the Oslo peace accords
were signed, not in Oslo, but in Washington. Will these current
negotiations similarly be transferred across the Atlantic after the
heavy lifting is over?
</P>
<P>
   Must we always take the risks while others hog the glory? We
Norwegians, as you know, Mr. President, are proud of our socialist
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   All of us, from the Labor Party to the Conservatives, believe
that it is the government's duty to provide citizens with
cradle-to-grave security. Universal health care is a basic human
right.
</P>
<P>
   You, as a good liberal, share our views. You do, don't you? Open
up, Mr. President. Acknowledge the debt you owe to Scandinavian
socialism. Explain why you've fallen so far short in implementing
reforms in your own country.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. President, you know that Norway and the rest of the
civilized world consider capital punishment a crime against
humanity. We are sure that you, as a closet socialist, share our
views.
</P>
<P>
   But Mr. President, we're confused. Rumors have surfaced on the
Internet that, in 1992, during the presidential campaign, you flew
back to Little Rock to attend the execution of a mentally retarded
inmate. Say it isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   Tell us that you oppose the death penalty. Assure Norwegians
that you loathe the barbaric yen for vengeance that seems to plague
so many of your citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. President, in 1997, your fellow American, Jody Williams,
here in Oslo, received the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the
International Campaign to Ban Land Mines. Williams later excoriated
you for your refusal to sign the Land Mine Treaty. Why did you do
that? Don't you know that all right-thinking nations have signed
onto the treaty? You say you'll sign up in 2006. Won't you be out
of office by then? Will your successor be bound by your promise?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a pen. Sign the Land Mine Treaty right now. Surely you'll
have no problem convincing Congress to ratify it when you get back
home. That's what moral leadership is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. President, there are rumors that you, yourself, are hoping
to accept a Nobel Peace Prize one of these years. Could that be why
you've come visiting us? Are you looking forward to schmoozing with
the committee?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a word of advice. Anyone who campaigns for the award is
guaranteed not to receive it. We Norwegians are pragmatic and
unemotional. Spin does not decide who wins the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   A willingness to take risks might. Ask Mr. Arafat about that. He
and Rabin were recipients in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mr. President, we understand that this is your second
visit to Norway. Some say that, when, as a student at Oxford, you
visited the land of the fjords in the late 1960s, it was to confer
with Scandinavian peace activists opposed to U.S. military
involvement in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Could you provide us with a list of names? Surely some of your
Norwegian friends are still alive and would be happy to shed light
on your youthful exuberances.
</P>
<P>
   Also, word has it that the American ambassador is planning a
wing-ding of a reception in your honor. Wouldn't it be fun to get
together with old comrades and reminisce about the past over a
bottle of aquavit and a platter of pickled herring?
</P>
<P>

LIVING WITH LIARS INC. 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Fred Shuster's weekly ``Sharps &AMP; Flats'' music column) 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Single-named singer-guitarist Raile of the
modern-rock band Liars Inc. says the Hollywood lifestyle almost
knocked him out of the game permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing in a band called Dusted,'' he explained. ``Two
friends had OD'd and I was going to be the third. I finally left to
figure out what I was going to do with my life. Finally, my old
drummer came around and asked if I was ready to start another
band.''
</P>
<P>
   That project became Liars Inc., which recently released its
debut album, ``Superjaded'' (Foodchain).
</P>
<P>
   ``The name seemed to describe what my reality had become,''
Raile said. ``My life was a big lie and I was chasing the ultimate
lie. I'm not a liar today but the name still describes many aspects
of the world that surrounds us.''
</P>
<P>
   Liars Inc.'s album has attracted attention on alt-rock radio for
such catchy and aggressive tracks as ``Anybody,'' ``After I Begin''
and ``Always.''
</P>
<P>
   Raile is plainly grateful for the second chance he was given.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very humbled now in my life,'' he said. ``Even at your
most hopeful, there's always a bit of doubt somewhere. Maybe that's
why I think people relate more to pain than happiness. I guess it's
best to just say it in the music. It's easier to say with guitars
and drums.''

   U2 producer Steve Lillywhite plays bass with Boston's Guster on
Nov. 11 at the House of Blues. Lillywhite, who produced Guster's
acclaimed ``Lost and Gone Forever'' disc, hasn't appeared on stage
in 20 years. ... Van Dyke Parks and Joe Henry will perform at noon
Saturday at Starbucks in Westwood Village. KCRW's Mike Morrison

Young, whose composing credits include ``Hellraiser,'' ``Species''

established in 1997 to recognize an artist whose career has been
characterized by community service and charitable activity. &QL;

pressures remarkably tame. The Labor Department's Employment Cost
Index rose just 0.8 percent in the quarter following a 1.1 percent
second-quarter gain, which was the biggest in eight years. And the
GDP price deflator grew at a 0.9 percent pace in the third quarter,
down from a 1.4 percent rate the previous quarter. Stock and bond

AUTHOR OF `JANE' STORIES RELATES TO HER CHARACTER'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CELINA OTTAWAY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Melissa Bank speaks with a voice that runs from soft
(``I have a black Lab'') to fast and edgy (``follow my advice and
you'll be sleeping with a black Lab'') to paced and contemplative.
Like when she talks about love.
</P>
<P>
   Banks was in her mid-20s when she started staying late at her
advertising job to write short stories about a girl called Jane.
Twelve years and a headline-making book deal later, the Jane
stories entered the national talk fest about single angst as ``The
Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing'' debuted this year, a
collection of short stories that track Jane Rosenal from her
14-year-old tortured teen-age self through her 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The reader follows Jane through her father's death. Boyfriends
who flirt with ex-girlfriends. An older lover. Other people's
weddings. And an editorial cartoonist who is turned off when Jane
forsakes her natural sense of humor and tries to snag him with the
lure of female mystery and manipulative wiles.
</P>
<P>
   The book is autobiographical in parts _ both Jane and Bank have
doctors for fathers, both grew up in suburban Philadelphia, both
have had a relationship with an older man. But Banks says it goes
both ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``In writing a book you sort of live through everything your
characters live through,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first story, Jane speaks in the unmistakable voice of a
14-year-old:
</P>
<P>
   ``Julia chose her words carefully and used ones I'd never heard
spoken _ she sounded to me like she was trying out for a job as a
dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wrote more than 1,000 pages before I found that
voice,'' Bank said.
</P>
<P>
   To find the voice _ slightly bored, but full of longing masked
in wry wit _ meant going back to being 14 again, said Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In the later stories when Jane falls for a guy, Bank found
herself falling, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was writing that last story, I was so in love with
Robert (Jane's love interest),'' the author said.
</P>
<P>
   Bank caught herself wishing Robert would call. Down in the dumps
when Jane was lonely. High when Jane was caught up in a fresh new
romance.
</P>
<P>
   Bank was in her mid-20s when she started the Jane stories.
Today, she is a successful author (think movie rights and a
six-month international book tour) who just turned 39. Love looks
different now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought that a man would save my life,'' Bank said,
in an interview from her home in Manhattan. ``I guess I don't
anymore. It's not that I don't think that I'll fall in love or get
married. It's just that I'm not expecting the same thing. ... I
really thought a man would change my life in a way that would help
me not have to live with myself. I thought a man is actually going
to lift you outside yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank isn't looking to be lifted anywhere anymore.
</P>
<P>
   She lives in a apartment building she loves in Chelsea. Her
brother and his wife live in the same building, as do several of

   Bank's success has allowed her to write full time. She just
finished the screenplay for the book's title story, ``A Girl's
Guide to Hunting and Fishing,'' a story about Jane's experiment
with ``The Rules''-like dating advice. Bank plans to write more
fiction, but hasn't settled on a story yet.

   ``I'm single,'' she said. ``But I guess I don't think of myself
as single. I mean I know that I am, I've got a black Lab in my bed,
but I just sort of think of it as a good life.''

THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN CONVERTED RICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For many, Uncle Ben's is the only rice there is.
And while there are plenty of reasons to recommend it _ it's easy
to cook, nutritious, fast to prepare _ converted rice isn't the
only amazing grain out there.
</P>
<P>
   A little browsing through grocery stores, specialty shops and
Asian markets yields a variety of rices to make meals more
interesting. But before deciding which rice to buy, it's best to
know a few things about rice in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rice grains are the fruit of the rice plant,'' write Jeffrey
Alford and Naomi Duguid in ``Seductions of Rice'' (Artisan books).
</P>
<P>
   Each stalk bears many grains of rice, each grain encased in a
protective outer layer known as the husk. Inside the husk is the
whole grain, known commonly as brown rice because the outer bran
layer of the grain gives the rice its color. Brown rice can be a
variety of hues, from light tan to mahogany. Red rice is rice that
happens to have a red bran layer.
</P>
<P>
   White rices are milled to remove the bran layer, and
subsequently the color, leaving the endosperm, which makes up most
of the grain's weight and volume. Converted rice is rice that has
been boiled prior to milling to force nutrients out of the bran
layer and into the endosperm.
</P>
<P>
   When buying any kind of rice, look for grains that are clean,
free of stones and mostly unbroken. Uncooked rice should be stored,
tightly sealed. Since the bran on unmilled rice contains oils that
can become rancid, it should be stored in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Many varieties of cooked rice can be stored in the refrigerator
also, but not for more than three days. Most rices will harden
slightly if they are refrigerated after cooking but sticky rices
will become too difficult to revive the next day. Therefore, it's
best not to cook more sticky rice than you need.
</P>
<P>
   If using another type of rice, the more you cook, the better.
Leftover rice can be added to soups and stews, used in fried rice
dishes, combined with beans or used to make pilafs. To reheat
leftover rice, add 2 tablespoons liquid to each cup of cooked rice.
Cover and heat 4 to 5 minutes on top of the stove or microwave on
high power for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per cup.
</P>
<P>
   One cup of uncooked rice will yield 2 to 3 cups of cooked rice,
depending on the variety of rice used. A single serving of plain
rice is equal to 1 cup.
</P>
<P>
   Here are descriptions of a few rices and how they are used:
</P>
<P>
   _ Arborio, the most widely available Italian rice, has short,
squat, white kernels. It's frequently used for making risotto and
as a base for other dishes. Look for arborio labeled superfino to
buy the top grade.
</P>
<P>
   _ Basmati is a milled, long-grain, needle-shaped rice that stays
separate and firm when cooked. South Asian and Indian-grown basmati
rices are more fragrant than the American-grown varieties.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brown rice is unmilled grain with the outer covering of bran
still intact. Brown rice takes longer to cook than milled rice and
has a chewier texture. Brown rice's nutty flavor combines well with
salty cheeses such as feta, crisp peppers and winter squashes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Himalayan red rice is one of the many rices with a red-colored
bran layer. Chefs like it for its unusual color. Use it in salads
and other mixtures where it can show off against other ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jasmine rice is usually one of a group of aromatic rices that
cook to a soft, clingy texture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pecan rice is an aromatic long-grain rice harvested in
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sticky rice is also known as glutinous rice or sweet rice
since it is often served sweetened in puddings and other desserts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Texmati rice is a basmati-type rice harvested in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _ White rice is rice that has been milled to remove its bran.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wild rice isn't actually rice but the rice-like seed of a
certain type of grass. Though marketed as ``wild rice,'' much if it
is cultivated.

EGGS FOR SALE: THERE'S HYPOCRICY IN THE UPROAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bits and pieces that cannot go by without
comment: How bizarre is the uproar over the on-line sale of a bunch
of models' ovarian eggs? You would think we were a deeply ethical
and religious society instead of one that just talks a good game
and goes right on worshipping and sacrificing for its one true
deity: Money.
</P>
<P>
   How can anyone in a country where thousands of people have no
homes and thousands of others drive around in $35,000 sport utility
vehicles cry ``Foul!'' at the sale of a few dozen ovum?
</P>
<P>
   Every year Americans spend more on cosmetics ($8 billion-plus)
than it would take to provide a basic education for the illiterate
of the entire globe ($6 billion). But it's immoral for a Playboy
photographer to peddle the eggs of physically beautiful women to
anybody who chooses to pay for them?
</P>
<P>
   If we really held conception and its probable human result as
something above all mercenary taint, why isn't in vitro
fertilization free, or at least cheap, instead of an option for
only the upper-middle class and rich? In other news . . .
</P>
<P>
   Make way for the latest entry in the Tell Me Something I Didn't
Already Know hall of fame _ also known as the ``No (bleep),
Sherlock'' place.
</P>
<P>
   (A recent entry was the revelation by the National Center for
Health Statistics that _ quelle surprise! _ middle-age, suburban
white men are the least likely of all Americans to suffer from
depression or other negative moods.)
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Women's Leadership Fund announced that, in a
recent study, surveyors found that the news media are inclined to
highlight the appearance, personality and domestic life of female
political candidates more than they do male candidates. Imagine!
</P>
<P>
   Here are two examples, gleaned from 3,326 paragraphs and 891
quotations in 311 newspaper stories:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Gov. Jane Hull was described as a ``grandmotherly
red-head.'' Elizabeth Dole was chronicled on the campaign trail in
``a red suit and matching pumps.'' Nowhere did a reporter feel the
need to mention Bill Bradley's black wing-tips and two-color
striped tie or depict John McCain as a ``patronly silver-head.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of politics, did anyone else's skin crawl at hearing
Pat Buchanan _ the doubting Thomas of our role in defeating Nazi
Germany _ bark at his Reform Party candidacy kickoff: ``You don't
know this peasant army! We have not yet begun to fight!''?
</P>
<P>
   Another spine chiller . . .
</P>
<P>
   In a long essay in the morning paper on what life will be like
as baby boomers age, psychologist Ken Dychtwald examined the
estimated 44 million American households that will be involved in
``elder care'' in the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though today's business leaders and government policy
makers avoid this issue,'' he wrote, ``caring for elders and
lovingly supporting them in their final years could become the
social and economic ``sinkhole' of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Given how little our current U.S. culture already values the
infirm old _ people who can no longer carry their economic load,
let alone produce at ``optimum'' levels _ the prospect of such a
sinkhole conjures up sci-fi nightmare scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, U.S. society may well be 100 percent converted to the
corporate model that has so enthralled our business folks and
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   What does the corporate model dictate be done with ``non-
performing assets,'' people and things that do not contribute to
maximized profit? Pronounce them ``liabilities'' and cut them
loose.
</P>
<P>
   How pretty do you think the cutting will be for the many of us
geezer millions who'll have caused what is viewed by the productive
young as ``the social and economic sinkhole of the 21st century''?
How much money do you expect they'll want to spend on caring for
and lovingly supporting us in our final years?
</P>
<P>
   Why, we'll look back on the era of marketable models' eggs and
see a humanitarian belle epoque.

GETTING READY FOR BEDTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bedtime is nigh in the garden. And like other children,
gardeners facing bedtime suddenly get active.
</P>
<P>
   GardenPathways
</P>
<P>
   This gardener has been busy getting things ready for winter. And
I haven't been alone.
</P>
<P>
   Removing a pile of stones, I notice a tiny snake with a yellow
band around its neck (a deadly banded krait, no doubt, or perhaps
just a ringneck snake, common hereabouts). The pile of stones is
perfect winter cover for a small serpent. It wiggles down among the
stones, and, fearing I will accidentally cleave the poor thing, I
abandon that job.
</P>
<P>
   A job I had abandoned for too long was the removal of pots of
poinsettias that I had thrown into a corner of the deck when their
time had passed last winter. Leaves and dirt had accumulated there
over the summer, and by the time I removed the sodden mass, it
resembled the forest floor (not good to replicate on wooden decks).
It was such a close match that it attracted three red salamanders,
which wriggled about, perturbed at having been disturbed as they
prepared for their seasonal slumber. They got tossed under the
``Golden Showers'' rose, where they can burrow to their tiny
hearts' content.
</P>
<P>
   A closer encounter, at least a mammal, was with a mouse that
stood its ground in a crate I was emptying in the shed. It had
built itself a nice fluff-and-stuff nest and looked at me with
proportionately huge black eyes. It ran off as I removed the items
I needed from the crate, but I know it is back there now, curled
up, snoozing.
</P>
<P>
   In animals, shorter days and cooler nights trigger instincts to
hunker down. They trigger plants to suck nutrients from leaves,
shut them off, and let them go. They trigger the gardener to
reseed, rework, remove _ really a lot of work, the busiest time
since spring.
</P>
<P>
   The devil may be in the details of what is to be done, but even
more so in the priorities. Manuring the veggie garden is vital, but
that can be done later, much later, January even. Removing plant
detritus, especially any that might have been diseased, is more
pressing. More urgent still is digging tender bulbs that have to be
stored for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   That's because once their tops have died down and disappeared,
the only way to find them is to dig. And sure as shooting, every
trowel thrust will be right through a big, fat,
up-until-then-healthy canna rhizome.
</P>
<P>
   The caladiums are all but gone, the tuberoses are tender and
wanting no further cold, and the gladiolas would like to come in
now, please. I must get at this chore. After removing the rhizomes
and corms (it is tempting to simply call them all bulbs), they will
dry in the shade for a couple of days, then get popped in boxes
filled with that ubiquitous plastic-foam packing ``popcorn.''
They'll spend the winter in a cool, dry spot in the cellar. (I
check once or twice to make sure they're not too dried out; I can
give them a spritz of water from a spray bottle.)
</P>
<P>
   The lawn has rebounded from the drought, except for some dead
patches, which I have reseeded (rake, add topsoil, rake, scatter
seeds, water for two weeks). With autumn rains, everything has
rebounded. The garden has a certain lushness in a decadent way, for
while some plants thrive, others are yellowing and shriveling.
Rugosa and English roses are in bloom and fill the October air with
heady scent. The hibiscus, which were tall and spectacular with
giant tropical-looking pink flowers, are withering.
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``between time.'' Not winter, not summer; not on, not
off; not grow, not go.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the gardener. The veggie garden must come out.
Collapsed, slimy squash vines, brittle, dead bean stalks. Into the
compost with them. Peppers may bear a flower or two, but they'll
produce no fruit. Nor will the cucumbers. Unreasoned greed prompts
me to leave the tomatoes; those cherries may ripen.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic goes in now. Two inches deep, in good soil. First,
though, I remove the garlic missed in the harvest, for some of
those tops, too, had disappeared. Recent wet cool weather prompted
regrowth, so I dig those bulbs; they get dried and go to the
kitchen, not the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Small boulders come out, headed for the front stone wall that,
chunk by chunk, is taking shape. A pile of boulders half up the
hill is surrounded by poison ivy, but I take care to not bruise the
foliage and get those rocks out, too.
</P>
<P>
   There is still weeding to do, plant locations to mark on my
garden plan, plant absences to note on my list of plants to
replace. All the beds must be patrolled, inspected (imprinted
mentally for long winter nights), readied for next season.
</P>
<P>
   It's bedtime, and the gardener is getting tuckered.

RUSSIAN MOTHERS MARCH IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ Alexandra spends her days outside the
barricades surrounding the barracks of Russia's main military base
in the North Caucasus. Inside, the boys of the 245th motorized
brigade await the day when they will be sent into battle.
</P>
<P>
   When they go, Alexandra is determined to make sure that her boy,
Kostik, is not with them. So each week, she makes the trip from
Moscow to Mozdok, where she pleads with military officers for a
transfer. When that fails, the 50-year-old widow begs her son to do
what so many of his comrades have done: leave his unit and follow
his mother back to their home in the remote Tyumen region of
Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra, who did not want her last name used, is not alone. As
the death toll mounts in Russia's war in Chechnya, the mothers of
Russian soldiers are traveling to Mozdok to take their sons out of
the line of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kostik, they are inexperienced army draftees whose units
are involved in the latest conflict against Islamic militants in
the restive southern Russian Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is reminiscent of Russia's disastrous 1994-1996
campaign in Chechnya, when mothers of Russian soldiers captured or
killed by rebel fighters traveled to the war zone, risking their
own lives to do what Russia's generals and politicians could not
do: bring their boys home.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the mothers' desperate effort captured the futility of
sending raw Russian draftees to fight hardened separatist rebels in
Chechnya. It was also a poignant statement of public distrust of
the once-proud military, and it helped crystallize public
opposition to the disastrous 1994-1996 war.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is happening again. Only this time, the mothers are not
waiting for the sons to be killed in action or taken prisoner. They
are taking them out of front-line units before they are sent into
battle. And the army is letting them do it.
</P>
<P>
   Natalya Zhukova is one of those women. Two weeks ago, she led a
group of mothers from the Volga region of Nizhy Novgorod to Mozdok,
the staging center for Russia's military operation in the Caucasus.
The group found 230 recent draftees; the generals agreed to
transfer them back to their home region, to be replaced by more
experienced troops.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers like Zhukova believe the army betrayed its tattered,
ill-prepared soldiers during the 1994-96 Chechen war. Hundreds of
servicemen are still missing from that conflict, while the corpses
of dozens more, their bodies mutilated beyond recognition, lie
unidentified in a morgue in the southern Russian city of
Rostov-on-Don.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the public, terrified and angry over a wave of deadly
terrorist attacks, supports the government's campaign against the
Chechen militants, whom it blames for the attacks. Russian officers
say the military's mood also has changed for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally different from the last war,'' said Major Igor
Melnikov, who served in Chechnya in 1995 and 1996, as he rode over
the region at treetop level in a helicopter that darted left and
right to avoid rebel fire. ``We don't have the guilt complex we did
then. We are sure of ourselves, and of our abilities. We understand
the goals.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Russia's ground offensive escalates into a full-scale
conflict, the mothers fear the Russian generals will repeat one of
the big mistakes of the last war _ sending into battle soldiers who
have barely learned to fire their weapons or drive their troop
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them have held weapons only when they took the
military oath, but it is as if'' the generals ``don't care,'' said
Valentina Melnikova of the Soldiers' Mothers Committee, a
grass-roots organization founded during the last Chechen war.
``They are sending green 18-year-olds. From a military point of
view, it is crazy and stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also inevitable. The reason is that Russia's
draft-based army has few other troops to rely on to conduct its
operation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's armed forces number 1.2 million, but Moscow military
analyst Ruslan Pukhov recently estimated that no more than 100,000
Russian troops are ready for combat. For years, Yeltsin has made
promises to end the unpopular draft and turn the military into a
professional fighting force, but the promises have not been kept.
</P>
<P>
   General Vladislav Putilin of Russia's general staff said last
week that Russia expects to build its force in Chechnya up to
100,000 to counter a rebel force the military estimates at 20,000
men. But while Russia would like to send only professionals, he
said, the army has only about 150,000 professional soldiers, and
men of them are administrative and support staff.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster the ranks, last week President Boris N. Yeltsin
reversed an earlier decision that banned draftees from the war zone
until they had served at least a year. Yeltsin originally imposed
that limit as an election campaign promise in 1996, as a response
to public indignation over heavy casualties among Russian troops.
His decree last week, which generals have just received, has not
been publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Since the new Chechen conflict began four weeks ago, the
generals have been pressuring the government to cancel the
restriction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we took away all the new draftees from units in Chechnya,''
said one officer in Mozdok, who wished to remain anonymous, ``we
would have to abandon our equipment and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Melnikova estimated that about 30,000 troops in Chechnya are
recent draftees.
</P>
<P>
   While the mood among the troops, as well as the general public,
is far more robustly in support of the current Chechen campaign
than in the last war, their relative inexperience is a built-in
defect of the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are so few experienced troops, Moscow has to
cobble together combat forces from police and paramilitary units
around the country. The problem is not that these units are not
tough; the problem is they have not trained with other military
units, such as artillery and aviation. The result is numerous
friendly fire incidents and poor coordination, mishaps that result
in high casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Federal commanders say they have lost 480 men since they began
battles with Chechen-led rebels in August in the southern Russian
region of Dagestan, fighting that spread to Chechnya three weeks
ago. But the Soldiers' Mothers Committee says the army is hiding
its real losses to avoid public dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Even the official toll of 480 dead is a lot, given that federal
commanders are trying to minimize casualties, and that at the
moment, the Chechens are not offering heavy resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not call this a war,'' Russian Information Minister
Mikhail Lesin, who last week traveled to Chechnya, wrote in a
Moscow newspaper column. How many men does Russia expect to lose
when it is a war?
</P>
<P>
   One indication can be found in the city of Rostov-on-Don, 400
miles northwest of the combat zone. There, said Zhukova, of the
Soldiers' Mothers Committee, the Russian military has built a new,
larger morgue to accommodate soldiers killed in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They prepared for this war in advance,'' Zhukova said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhukova said she was able to persuade a local commander in
Mozdok to transfer out 230 green troops because he was getting 600
experienced troops that day.
</P>
<P>
   Some other mothers quietly have spirited their boys away from
units, essentially helping them desert. Melnikova said she knows of
at least 50 troops who have deserted and then appealed to the
Soldiers' Mothers for help.
</P>
<P>
   While the generals have warned the mothers publicly not to help
their boys desert, the military prosecutor has decided quietly to
drop all criminal proceedings against soldiers who go back with
their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Desertion, like draft-dodging, is something the Russian military
command has grown to accept. Putilin said he expected the number of
draft-dodgers in this autumn's call-up to climb from last year's
20,000 as young men try to avoid Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   And Maria Fedulova expects that more mothers will have to do
what she did on a bleak January day four years ago. Then, Fedulova
was one of a group of Russian women who strode onto a central
square in Chechnya's capital, Grozny, seemingly oblivious to the
rockets and mortar crashing around them, drawing stares of
amazement from Chechen rebels and Western reporters hiding from the
barrage.
</P>
<P>
   Fedulova was able to rescue her son, Denis, who was being held
prisoner by rebel commander Shamil Basayev.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev is now Russia's most-hated commander, wanted for leading
attacks on Russian cities this summer and accused of setting off
terrorist bombs in Moscow and other cities. Russian leaders say
they want to kill Basayev, but Fedulova has stayed in phone contact
with the Chechen commander.
</P>
<P>
   Fedulova was asked if she feared she would need to use that
number again. ``I don't fear it,'' she said. ``I have no doubt
about it.''

 UNDATED: ...in our society.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The queen, whose college degree is in business, said that
microfinancing, a method of seeding grass-roots industries
throughout the region, is ``a good example of empowering women
within their own households. Not only do they become
income-earners, they become decision-makers. They begin to
influence the way their lives are run, how decisions are made about
their children, and how they want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drawing the line
</P>
<P>
   The memory of King Hussein was often invoked _ sometimes
somberly, sometimely playfully _ during an hourlong interview
marked by relaxed banter between the royal couple. The king clearly
relished sharing the spotlight with his accomplished spouse, while
the queen spoke with the assurance of someone who respects
tradition, yet looks at political and social issues with very
contemporary eyes. Both emphasized that their marriage was
conceived as a strong working partnership from the start. And each
laughed when asked if the two `pillow talked'' issues at the end of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does happen,'' said the queen, ``but I'm realizing I have
to draw the line somewhere. He's exposed to that all day, in the
office, at the Royal Court. I feel that when he comes home, he
needs to be sheltered. If it's something urgent I just say it to
him. Then it's, `Let's talk about something happier.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The king nodded. ``There are issues that are close to Rania's
heart,'' he said. ``The economy is really the future for Jordan,
and she has some very interesting input in this area. I've been
more traditionally involved in military affairs, so there are lots
of areas where she speaks as `we.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Switching to more personal matters, Abdullah tacitly
acknowledged his former reputation as a globe-trotting sportsman
and playboy. He and Rania met by chance in early 1993, he said, at
a dinner party given by his sister when he was briefly on leave
from his army battalion. A month later the couple met again at
another dinner party, and two months later they were engaged. They
married on June 10, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Life in the public eye
</P>
<P>
   ``My father had given up on me,'' said Abdullah, glancing in the
queen's direction as she laughed. ``He was very romantic in that
regard, always wanting to play matchmaker. When he heard I was
interested in someone, he got very excited. The day before we got
engaged, he actually showed up at the airport when I flew in, which
is something he never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so nervous,'' the king added, ``he wanted us to get
engaged that day and married a day later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We managed to keep it quiet for a while,'' the queen
interjected. But a long courtship was impossible, she said, given
her future husband's high public profile.
</P>
<P>
   That profile also encompasses eight years of school in
Massachusetts, first at Eaglebrook School in Deerfield, then
Deerfield. Though he was sent away at an early age (at 7, to
boarding school in England) for security reasons, the king said,
getting to lead what he called a ``normal teenager's life'' was one
experience he would never trade, even if it raised doubts back home
that he took his royal responsibilities seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At Deerfield, Abdullah was a self-described ``average student''
who competed in soccer, wrestling, and track. A graduate of
Sandhurst, England's Royal Military Academy, in the 1980s he also
attended Oxford and Georgetown, where he took courses in
international politics.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than downplaying his years abroad now that he has
succeeded his father, the king said, ``It's completely the
opposite. I think the secret of our success is being able to hold
onto the years we had being normal. They are years I've kept in my
heart,'' and he tapped his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Without that perspective, he noted, ``It would have been easy to
go back to Jordan and forget who you are and what you are'' in a
world where his every adventure (and misadventure) had national
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through my whole life with this feeling, and I miss it
right now,'' he continued. ``For us, the biggest shock is the
loss'' of freedom. ``Having so many people and so many minders
working around you.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned to his wife and both chuckled again, joined nervously
by some of those who make their livings as royal minders.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Recharging' together
</P>
<P>
   Let it be noted that Abdullah has not put aside all his youthful
passions. His hobbies include motorcycling, auto racing,
parachuting, and scuba diving, while Queen Rania enjoys bicycling
and water skiing. At sporting events, the royal family frequently
shows up to root like any other fans, father and son dressed in
jerseys marked with number 99, King Hussein's old race-car number.
King Abdullah also delighted in recounting how his father, a former
racing champion, liked to ditch the palace guards and sneak off for
a good fast drive, doing so as recently as three years before his
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father called it recharging,'' said Abdullah, who went on
to describe the family weekends he and Queen Rania now spend at the
couple's seaside residence in Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a favorite place of my father's,'' the king offered
with a smile. ``The kids play on the beach. We take them jet-skiing
or play in the pool together, put our shorts on. I need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a typical day in the royal household?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't found that routine yet,'' said her majesty with a
twinkle in her eye. ``But I'm looking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Circling back to the subject of child-rearing, the queen said
more seriously that, like Americans, Jordanians are concerned about
issues like violence and drug abuse, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we share the same concerns all over the world,'' she
said. ``I worry about my children just like every other mother
worries about her children. About keeping them close, about keeping
contact with them. Going out of our way to make time for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding very much like every other young mother, she added,
``For me, it's an investment in the future. I don't want to
suddenly look at my children and think, they've become teenagers
and I've missed a very important part of their lives.''

<P>
   Crossing the Sunshine Skyway Bridge never failed to depress Max
Timlin, even on this perfect morning when squadrons of brown
pelicans flew across a sky so blue it looked digitally enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate nature!'' he screamed at the windshield and smacked the
palm of his hand against the steering wheel so hard it stung.
</P>
<P>
   Max sat in his dream car, a 1965 Mustang convertible, black with
a cream-colored interior, purchased as a consolation prize after
his second divorce. The top was down, and as he gunned the car's
famous oversized 289 engine, a balmy breeze became a windstorm that
whipped through the ravaged wasteland that once was his hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate nature, I really do,'' he said calmly now, and clicked
on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   It was tuned to 92.1, the ``Rock Till You Drop'' station, but
instead of the Stones he got the whiny voice of Skeeter Davis,
``Don't they know, it's the end of the world? It ended when you
said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned the tuner in disgust to National Public Radio only to
hear some windbag doctor singing the praises of another new miracle
drug to cure male impotence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to revive a lot of dead marriages,'' said the
voice with an ugly little laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too late for me,'' thought Max, whose male potency drug of
choice had always been the Apalachicola Bay oyster. Suddenly his
favorite restaurants stopped serving them or served them with
doomsday warnings: ``If you eat these oysters, you'll enjoy the
hell out of them, but then they'll make you sick and you'll die.
Still hungry?''
</P>
<P>
   As he flipped a few random stalks of dirty blond hair out of his
blue eyes, his hand brushed against the scar on his forehead, a
result of a surgical procedure to remove skin cancer, basal cell
carcinoma. It was his sixth, nothing more than a disfiguring
nuisance, he thought, adding some twists and turns to the road map
of his face.
</P>
<P>
   His dermatologist would be furious to know that Max was riding
with the top down, but Max would not deprive himself of one of his
few remaining pleasures. He never worshipped the sun, but as a
teen-ager he had suffered from pizza-face acne, a condition his
parents hoped to ameliorate with weekly treatments under a sun
lamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that burning and peeling may have helped your acne,'' said
Dr. Fishbine, some 35 years later, ``but they also gave you skin
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame it on the hole in the ozone, said the mischievous
doctor, blame it on your parents.
</P>
<P>
   Fishbine explained how years ago there were these shoe stores
called ``X-Ray'' shoes. You'd put your new shoes on and then slip
your feet into an X-ray machine to see how the shoes fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing we don't have a generation of people whose toes
are falling off,'' said Fishbine. ``How many things have we thought
were really good for us,'' he said, ``and they turned out to be
really bad?''
</P>
<P>
   Max thought about a generation of men taking male potency drugs.
Who could predict what one day would fall off?
</P>
<P>
   He was at the top of the Skyway now, and his mood darkened.
Forget the view of the Gulf of Mexico flowing into Tampa Bay, and
forget the bright white triangles of sailboats, followed by
dolphins at play. All he could remember now _ he shuddered when he
thought about it _ was that this was the spot in 1980 that the old
bridge was hit by a huge oil tanker.
</P>
<P>
   Blinded by gale-force winds, the harbor pilot steered the Summit
Venture into the Skyway, a sledgehammer crushing a sculpture made
of toothpicks. Much of the towering bridge was destroyed, and 35
people, most of them on a Greyhound bus, rode over the jagged end
of the bridge on a collective bungee jump without a cord, more than
175 feet down to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It took years and millions of dollars, but they built a
beautiful new bridge, one with a system of bumpers to protect
against runaway tankers.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge was so attractive, in fact, that more than 60 people
had killed themselves jumping off of it, nine in the last six
months alone. They were young and old, rich and poor, black and
white, straight and gay, drunk and sober, all coming and parking
and climbing the rail and looking down and letting go and falling
into that eternity or abyss that, in the end, is the only equality
the world offers.
</P>
<P>
   The last guy to jump tried to take his dog with him, but the
Rottweiler, named Daisy, survived. Max had tried to adopt that dog,
but the county didn't think, with his lifestyle, that he could give
the dog a good home. Why couldn't he get that Skeeter Davis song
out of his head?
</P>
<P>
   As he crossed the bridge north into St. Petersburg, he couldn't
rid himself of a pervasive sense of dread that the good things in
his life were behind him, that his hopes and aspirations had
expired, that he was driving off the 18th tee after playing a
miserable round.
</P>
<P>
   He was bright enough to recognize these as middle-aged angst, he
knew the Mustang was part of that, but they combined now in 1999,
with the end of a decade, the end of a century, the end of a
millennium. He was tired of things ending: his youth, his
marriages, his reporting job in Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he was headed to St. Pete Beach, to meet a man named
K.J. Banks, a new editor with the Florida Sun, a newspaper Max very
much admired. Max had received an e-mail message the day before
asking him to meet Banks at the Gold Coin on a stretch of beach
called Pass-a-Grille, where, legend has it, pirates once landed to
grill their meat and drink their rum. The pirates were replaced by
tourists, the meat by grouper and shrimp, the rum by margaritas and
pina coladas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet me at 11,'' said the message. ``I've heard good things
about your work and know you are at loose ends. We can have a late
breakfast or early lunch. _ K.J. Banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Max had been speeding, and the traffic was light, so he arrived
early. He remembered the Gold Coin from years ago, a delightful
little hole-in-the-wall now replaced by a grotesque three-story bar
with connecting restaurants, lounges and discos.
</P>
<P>
   He sat at a patio table overlooking the Gulf and waved at the
sea gulls diving at scraps left behind by previous customers. Max
pointed his finger and cocked his thumb at one and made a sound as
if he was firing a gun. K-choww! The noise scared the gull away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice shot,'' said a woman's voice. Max turned and looked up to
see the figure of a tall woman standing between him and a blazing
sun. He shaded his eyes to block out the sunlight not already
eclipsed by a crown of dark wavy hair. She stepped aside so Max
could see her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Max, I'm K.J. Banks. My friends call me Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   From experience, she knew that he was expecting a man, an
old-fart of an editor with patches on his sleeves and nicotine
stains on his fingers, or maybe one of those young corporate types
with the hundred-dollar haircuts and thousand-dollar suits. She
enjoyed his surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Max stood to shake her hand, which met his firmly. She looked
like someone famous, Susan Sarandon, maybe, but not the voluptuous
Atlantic City lemon-bath model. The woman before him was his age,
perhaps, but not _ like him _ a burnt-out shell of a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a tan pantsuit over a white silk blouse, she looked
healthy and successful and could project both intelligence and
humor in a single ironic smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come with a proposition,'' she said, still shaking his
hand, ``and I know you won't disappoint me.''

<P>
   ``Do you like the movies, Max?'' said Kate Banks as if she were
going to ask him on a date.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a trick question, and he wondered if there was a
right answer. Maybe she was going to offer him a job as a movie
critic. He had filled in years ago for an aging critic recovering
from retinal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   At first Max had liked the idea of taking this little vacation
from real journalism, until the Christmas week he had to view 12
films _ no, not films, movies _ in six days. It turned his eyes to
black holes, his mind to mush, and his fingers to stone, and it
made him increasingly cranky about each movie, so that the ones he
saw early in the week got five stars, down to three, down to one,
down to a minus 2 for a Barbra Streisand flick, a grade his editor
refused to register.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just run the wire synopsis,'' she said, and never asked
him to review again.
</P>
<P>
   Max later came to see that time as an emblem for his life, that
experiences once chosen freely and with joy became soured by
obligation. It had happened with his two marriages and a cycle of
newspaper jobs. He wondered why this woman _ he was suddenly
intimidated by her _ would be interested in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I like the movies, especially the old ones, so I mostly
rent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your favorite movie, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked the early Bond flicks, but I'd be hard
pressed to choose between `Goldfinger' and `Thunderball.' How about
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My three older brothers would take me to the movies almost
every Saturday, and they liked the horror and monster movies, and
they would scare me to death, so that I would be crouching down
between the seats and looking with one eye through the cracks. My
favorite was `Godzilla,' the one with 10,000 Japanese actors and
extras and Raymond Burr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big lizard is back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, Max, that's what bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   She stopped talking for a minute and took a dragon-sized bite
from a blackened grouper sandwich, and wiped a stream of sauce from
the corner of her lip with the back of her hand. Max decided that
he liked her, even though he could not imagine where this
conversation was going or what she wanted of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese released `Godzilla' in 1954,'' she said, ``a
decade after we dropped the atomic bomb on them.''
</P>
<P>
   She reminded Max that the movie was about a prehistoric monster
brought back to life by the testing of hydrogen bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched all the sequels, Max: `Godzilla vs. the Thing,'
`Godzilla vs. King Kong,' `Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster,' `Godzilla
vs. the Smog Monster,' `Rodan,' `Mothra,' I couldn't get enough.
When I got older, my friends told themselves I was being weird or
ironic, that I thought movies dubbed badly into English were funny.
But they weren't funny to me, Max. They weren't funny because
underneath all the rubber monster suits, they were all about
Hiroshima and mushroom clouds and radiation and mutations and, the
destruction of cities and civilizations, and the end of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing what to say, Max took a long slug from his glass of
ice tea and leaned forward as if about to hear the solution to some
ancient puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla's back, Max. You can't go to the freakin' movies
anymore without something destroying the world. If it isn't
lizards, it's dinosaurs. It if it isn't dinosaurs, it's aliens. If
it isn't aliens, it's comets, or meteorites, or asteroids. Next
thing it'll be hemorrhoids.''
</P>
<P>
   Max coughed and let out a laugh, and Kate Banks was laughing
too, and she took off her sunglasses, and revealed eyes so dark you
couldn't make out the pupils. She was close to his age, the
wrinkles around her eyes told that story, but the eyes themselves
were bright and youthful. This woman, 30 years ago, might have
inspired Van Morrison to write a song.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about `Titanic?''' he asked. ``A nice, sweet love
story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about the love story, Max. The ocean and the dark sky
full of stars _ that's the universe. The ship is the world. The
poor people are in the bottom, the rich on top. But nothing can
save them. Not hope, ambition, money, or technology. The ship goes
down, Max. The world goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   She took a breath and changed her tone, back from the doomsday
prophet to the teaching editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sitting here on the beach Max, and God has not made a
more perfect day, and it's the middle of 1999, the last year of a
decade, the last year of a century, the last year of a millennium.
Do you know what that word means, Max, I mean the Latin roots?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I was an altar boy once. It means a thousand years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And how about the word millenarian?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that someone who is a thousand years old or someone who
makes women's hats?''
</P>
<P>
   She knew he was joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``A millenarian is someone who is waiting for the world to end.
Who looks for a date like the year 2000 and expects the end will
come, that history, time, life as we know it, is over. In the eyes
of these people, any bad things that happen are signs of the last
days. Floods. Famines. War. A bear market. A shooting star. Or Ken
Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   To his surprise, she reached over across the table and grabbed
one of his hands with her hand, pressed her nails into his flesh
and looked him straight in the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes these people are not just waiting for things to
happen. They want the world to end, and they can't wait for God to
make it happen. They're ready to take action themselves. They lead
others astray.''
</P>
<P>
   She read his look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not paranoid, Max. I know what I'm talking about. It
happened with Jonestown and Waco and Oklahoma City. And I think
it's happening again _ and I think it's happening here _ now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want from me, Kate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know your work, Max. You're not afraid of dangerous stories.
You covered the narco-terrorists in Miami. And everyone knows that
you were responsible for bringing to justice the church burners in
Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Max shook his head modestly. Like other reporters he found it
hard to give or receive praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever heard of a group called The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Weren't they a rock group from the British Invasion?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're thinking of The Searchers. They did `Needles and Pins.'
The Watchers are an international group that set up shop in town
about two years ago, and word is they are recruiting young people,
and that their numbers are growing. I want you to investigate them
for me. Here's everything you'll need to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   She reached into her purse and pulled out a silver key and a
single black computer disk and placed them carefully in his hand.

   LAST INSTALLMANT: Max and Kate discuss why every movie seems to

investigating a millennium cult called The Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a perfect morning, and no one was more surprised
at his cheeriness than Max Timlin. He was not a morning person _ or
an afternoon person, or an evening person, for that matter. But on
this summer morning, his coffee was strong and sweet, the breeze
off the Gulf was comforting, and an item in the morning paper made
him laugh:
</P>
<P>
   Television evangelist Curtis Woodson criticized the city of
Orlando for permitting gays and lesbians to carry rainbow-colored
banners, symbolizing diversity, in a Fourth of July parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no prophet,'' said Woodson, ``but I would not be waving
those flags in God's face if I were you. It'll bring about
terrorist bombs; it'll bring earthquakes, tornadoes and possibly a
meteor!''
</P>
<P>
   Max did not like Orlando much _ too much traffic, and too many
mouse ears. He chuckled at the idea of a meteor striking a theme
park, and how quickly it would take Disney to turn the huge crater
into a new attraction.
</P>
<P>
   He was still laughing _ he was almost giddy _ as he stood,
stretched, and leaned forward on the balcony rail. He looked to the
left and could see the Skyway Bridge, close enough to make out tiny
cars heading south.
</P>
<P>
   One week ago, he lived on that side of the bridge, but now he
had a new place on St. Pete Beach. Kate Banks, editor of the
Florida Sun, had handed him a key to a condo on a stretch of sand
called Land's End.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gorgeous place, with cathedral ceilings, polished wood
floors, and expensive Florida art on the walls. He had never lived
anyplace like it. The place had two huge bedrooms, each with a
bath, one bath with a hot tub, a fancy office, a well-stocked
kitchen, and a living room extended onto a balcony with a
fifth-story view of the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   If the world was about to end, this was the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   That thought slapped him sober, like the old after-shave
commercial, and reminded him of why he was here. He had accepted a
strange proposal from Kate Banks, to investigate a group of
doomsday types called The Watchers. That was not so strange _ he'd
investigated and written about wackos and Wacos before. He
considered it a specialty. But Kate had added some stipulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to work out of my beach condo, not the newspaper
office. I live in a great old house not far from the paper. You can
phone me there. Only two people at the paper besides me will know
you are on the job: a photographer and a researcher. Here are their
names and numbers. You'll love working with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the secrecy, Kate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may remember that we won a Pulitzer in the 1970s for
covering the activities of the Science of God cult. They
infiltrated the newspaper. Stole files. Gathered dirt on the
reporters and editors, not a hard thing to do as it turns out, and
are still, after all these years, a pain in the butt. So just think
of us as a little gun-shy.''
</P>
<P>
   Max was not to come into the Florida Sun at any time. He could
access the newspaper's files and records electronically. The condo
office was completely wired. He could call Kate with any special
needs, and she would visit him once a week to check on him, and to
deliver his pay _ in cash.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed more than cautious to Max; it seemed paranoid. But he
was not about to complain. He had a wallet bursting with money,
paradise for a pad, and, most important, a story to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Max reached into a desk drawer for an unlabeled black disk and
slid it into the slot in his computer. He called up a file named
``Leader.'' A color image slowly rolled from top to bottom until it
filled the screen and sharpened into focus. It was the face of a
man in his early 40s, perhaps a bit older. He had black wavy hair
atop an oval face. The jaw was strong, a cleft in the chin. The
eyes were narrow, deep-set, and dark brown, framed by dark brows.
The complexion was very pale, almost white.
</P>
<P>
   The full effect was severe, even threatening, except for the
smile, which was wide and inviting, so wide you were tempted to
count the teeth.
</P>
<P>
   A text file revealed that this was Raoul Glaber, sometimes
called Roy Glaber, the founder and leader of The Watchers. There
was little known about Glaber outside of his association with his
religious group. He seemed almost like a man without a history. He
had turned down many requests for interviews, and became
increasingly reclusive, even as the work of The Watchers became
more public.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Banks was right. This was, by all its manifestations, a
millenarian group. From its creation, in 1977, Glaber had targeted
the year 2000 as climactic and apocalyptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day is coming,'' he had written in an early pamphlet
``when the world as we know it will be shaken to its foundations.
The house of this world will crumble so that a new house can be
created. We will watch for the signs of the new world. We watch for
signs in the heavens, and for signs in the hearts of men. We, The
Watchers, will be ready when the Great Day comes. The date of the
Great Day is no mystery, but comes into our sight, only 23 years
down a narrow road which will end at a bridge which will cross from
a dark, decaying world into a bright new one.''
</P>
<P>
   Max clicked on an audio file enabling him to hear the voice of
Raoul Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will come as a thief in the night,'' the voice said,
evoking what sounded like a biblical text familiar to Max. ``Woe
unto you who are working in the fields. Woe unto you if you are
great with child. Woe unto you who are not watching and waiting,
waiting and watching. For only those who watch will be ready, and
only those who are ready will cross over to a world remade. A world
washed in water. A world washed in fire. A world washed in blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Max was mesmerized. His mind carried him back to a fifth-grade
class in Catholic School when Brother Brian Mahoney played
recordings of speeches by Hitler. Max didn't understand German, of
course, but the rising and falling intonations of the speaker
hypnotized and energized at the same time. When Der Fuhrer reached
a crescendo, the crowd roared _ how many people would it take to
raise such a cheer? When the recording ended, it snapped Max out of
what seemed like a trance.
</P>
<P>
   Then Brother Brian explained that this man had used his gift of
oratory for an evil purpose, to kill millions and millions of
people he hated: Jews, Gypsies, political opponents, homosexuals,
the physically handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Brian turned off the lights. For a dramatic minute the
room remained dark until he clicked on a slide projector. On a
white wall flashed image after image from something he called a
``concentration camp'': piles of skeletal bodies ready for plowing
into a mass grave, soldiers pointing rifles at terrified children,
naked women, old and young, being herded into a brick buildings,
living corpses standing behind barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   Raoul Glaber's oratory had the same mesmerizing effect as
Hitler's_ but with one important difference: Glaber didn't sound as
if he were speaking to thousands upon thousands. His voice was not
thunder, but a zephyr. He sounded as if he were talking to one
person. He sounded, Max thought, as if he were whispering in your
ear. The Serpent in the Garden.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max begins his research on The Watchers, and
their charismatic and menacing leader, Raoul Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max Timlin couldn't remember a better meal, or a more congenial
partner, Ralph Rizzo, an iconoclastic Catholic priest with an
appetite for Cuban food. Their hunger brought them this Saturday
night to a favorite eatery, No Dinero, in the historic Ybor City
district of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Father Rizzo was one of several friends Max had met in St. Pete,
people he had written about while working in Gainesville, Miami and
Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was known for his dogged investigations, tracking
down bad guys, Max was no cynic. He knew that cynic was the Greek
word for ``dog.'' It was true, Max liked dogs, and sometimes felt
like a 14-year-old bloodhound, his best hunting days behind him,
but with a nose that could still pick up a scent.
</P>
<P>
   But Max was no cynic. In his own view of things, he was a
skeptic. A cynic could not believe that human beings were capable
of goodness. A skeptic doubted they were, but was always willing to
be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your mother says she loves you,'' Max would quote an old
newspaper saying, ``check it out.'' But if it checks out, send her
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   There were no saints and no heroes, thought Max, but there were
people of virtue and they were worth writing about. Sometimes he
had to fight his editors to make sure the story didn't get buried
deep in the paper, with the tire ads. But Max was stubborn and
liked the challenge of going against the grain.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of stories, ``Breach of Trust,'' came out about
priests and ministers who molested children, Max did a profile of
Father Ralph Rizzo, who in Max's words, ``combined the intellect
and sensibilities of a college metaphysics professor with the guts
and instincts of a union leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Ralph, Brooklyn-born and the son of a longshoreman and a
schoolteacher, had abandoned university teaching and scholarly
writing for community organizing. He preached that there were only
two ways of reforming institutions: ``through the ear or up the
rear.'' He was good at both approaches.
</P>
<P>
   In five years, he had set up a free medical clinic, a food bank,
an AIDS hospice, a last-chance school for dropouts and an emergency
shelter for runaway teens. One television reporter dubbed him
``Father Teresa.'' Ralph bloodied his nose. This act won him
national attention, and no few admirers. Father Ralph was 62 years
old, wore a halo of curly, snow-white hair, and weighed about 140
pounds, but you didn't mess with him. He was Billy Martin in a
cassock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph, you ever heard of The Watchers?'' Max and Ralph began
their postprandial stroll down Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doomsday cult, no doubt about it,'' said Ralph. ``We've seen
kids at the shelter with Watcher T-shirts, even one with a `W'
tattooed on his arm. It's a sin to lure young people into something
like that, Max. These children need comfort and hope. When you're
16 and addicted to crack and HIV positive and living on the street,
it's pretty easy to believe that the world is coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe it, Ralph? I mean that something big is about
to happen. In the year 2000?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max. Read the gospel. Jesus says the Kingdom is now. If you
don't believe me, ask the Man Himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Max looked down the street to see a man
surprisingly like Jesus in appearance, long brown hair and full
beard, a robe made of rough tan cloth, tied at the waist with a
rope. The man wore sandals. And, here was the real tip-off. He was
carrying a cross.
</P>
<P>
   The cross bore written messages, on both the vertical and cross
beams. ``Unless a man be born again in water and the spirit,''
``The Kingdom of God is at hand,'' and ``God so loved the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, on the long street in the heart of Ybor spread a
scene that was ripe for redemption. Hundreds of tourists,
teen-agers, music lovers and street people patrolled a district
that tried hard for a Bourbon Street effect, but came up
considerably short.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Ybor was without its charms. Once the bustling center
of the Cuban-American cigar industry, Ybor still projected a quirky
ethnicity, including Latin dance clubs and wonderful little
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Max and Father Ralph were sluggish from a feast of chicken and
rice, washed down with too much sangria, and polished off with a
delicious custard desert, and some sips of strong Cuban coffee.
</P>
<P>
   But as they made their way down the street, they walked past
strip clubs and tattoo parlors and thrift stores that gave the
place a seedier, more Bohemian flair. Father Ralph loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people Jesus would be hanging with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On one corner stood a nameless shop that sold holy objects,
blending traditional Catholic candles and sacramentals with the
trappings of voodoo and Santeria.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street was a nudie bar called Anytime Atoll, a garish
storefront awash in neon lights the color of lilacs. A young woman,
her hair dyed shoe-polish black and packed into a black-leather
body suit, stood, looking bored, in the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you look at that,'' said Father Ralph. ``That young girl
has implants. I'd bet my collar on it.'' He wasn't wearing one.
``God gave that woman a beautiful body, and look whats she's done
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the kind of offbeat perspective that Max found charming
about Ralph. In fact, an evening with Father Ralph was enough to
tempt even as lapsed a Catholic as Max back into the fold. ``Check
this out, Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   A framed newspaper clipping in the window reminded passers-by
that this club was the home of an exotic dancer named Thrill Hills,
a woman who boasted a 65-25-35 figure.
</P>
<P>
   A Tampa man was suing her for a ``whiplash injury incurred at a
bachelor party, where the curvaceous Ms. Hills allegedly whacked
him on the head with the most pendulous parts of her anatomy.''
Even Ralph was speechless.
</P>
<P>
   Down the block they stopped at a shop called The Branding Iron,
which might best be described as a tattoo and body piercing
factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baptism leaves an indelible mark upon the soul,'' said Ralph.
But why would someone want to leave indelible marks upon the body?
``Perhaps I can understand it in the young, given their desire to
set themselves apart as members of a group, but look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   They stared at a photograph in the front window _ three women of
three different generations with matching rose tattoos on their
butts. A caption said they were grandmother, mother and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to all this, a sidewalk Jesus seemed almost normal, so
Max and Ralph rushed over to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a hundred dollars a night, plus tips,'' said the man,
who, after brief conversation, said his real name was Jacob
Coleman. He wore Birkenstock sandals. ``I'm Jewish,'' he offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``So was Jesus,'' said Father Ralph, ``a good Jewish boy, real
name Joshua, with a wonderful Jewish mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then it happened. The front doors of The Branding Iron
burst open, almost as if there had been an explosion, and a group
of about a dozen young people rocketed out, so loud and so animated
they seemed part of the same reptilian organism, like Medusa's
head.
</P>
<P>
   The overall impression was black and white, boys and girls,
shaved heads, pierced nostrils, and serpentine tattoos. One carried
a music blaster, and it played something that sounded less like
music than a jagged, metallic vibration. A few toted skateboards
and roared, clumsily, into the street toward the three of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch out, hippy dude,'' shouted what might have been the
leader and clipped the sidewalk Jesus at the ankles. Jacob Coleman
fell backwards and hit his head against the pavement. Max and
Father Ralph twisted out of the way to avoid the collision.
</P>
<P>
   A girl in the back of the pack held something that looked like a
toy rifle _ a super squirt gun maybe _ and pointed it at the prone
figure. Pop. Pop. Pop. Three paint balls hit Jesus in the chest,
soaking his robe in red. Just as quickly they turned the corner and
were gone.
</P>
<P>
   A figure stood on a nearby roof with a video camera and took in
the scene through the viewfinder. There, in the harsh street
lights, the camera captured the image of Father Ralph cradling the
body of the sidewalk savior in his arms, the poor man's Pieta. And
on one knee beside them, carrying the fallen cross over one
shoulder, was a dazed Max Timlin.

<TEXT>
<P>
   They are in many ways a typical couple trying to carve out
quality time in a 24/7 world. He traded a promising military career
for a high-ranking executive position earlier this year. She got
off the business-management track when marriage and motherhood came
along, and now volunteers her services in the nonprofit sector.
</P>
<P>
   Quality time takes on a whole different meaning, though, when
your address is the Royal Hashemite &UR;  &LR; Court in Jordan and your
executive titles are, respectively, King and Queen.
</P>
<P>
   It has been less than a year since King Abdullah II, 37, became
the surprise choice to succeed his father, King Hussein, after
Jordan's longtime ruler died of cancer in February at age 63.
Abdullah's 29-year-old wife, Queen Rania Al-Abdullah, was formally
enthroned six weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Today the couple's marriage, a blend of Arab traditionalism and
Western modernism, has become something of a blueprint for the
future of a country whose population is youthful (70 percent under
age 35) but which still feels the loss of a beloved and charismatic
monarch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something neither one of us signed up for,'' Abdullah
acknowledged during a private interview recently in the couple's
sixth-floor suite at Boston's Four Seasons Hotel. ``Rania and I
were thrown in somewhat in the deep end. It's been an adjustment
for sure, for us and our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in an armchair next to her husband, flanked by a coterie
of security personnel and press aides, Queen Rania spoke to the
same issue, in flawless English that reflects her college years at
the American University in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we took over this position at a young age means
our children are also young,'' she said, conjuring up images of the
Camelot-Kennedy days. ``It's a very sensitive and crucial time in
their lives. We both realize that they will never be 5 and 3 again.
It makes these moments very precious, and we want to appreciate
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every professional couple faces the same kind of
challenge, balancing work life and family life,'' she went on. ``In
our case, maybe it's a little more exaggerated at times'' _ she
giggled in unison with her husband _ ``but we do try to create that
balance.''
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
Drafted to the throne
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The dual interview, conducted during the royals' recent swing
through Washington and Boston, provided a rare snapshot of a young
couple that has stepped smartly onto the world stage with a sense
of flair as well as mission.
</P>
<P>
   Until his father's deathbed wishes were made public, Abdullah,
then a tank company commander and the eldest of Hussein's five
sons, was considered a longshot to assume one of the Middle East's
key leadership posts, with his uncle, Hussein's brother Hassan, the
presumed heir to the throne. Abdullah's wife was no shoo-in,
either, to be granted a title reserved, up until then, for her
stepmother-in-law, the American-born Queen Noor, 48, who still
advocates for some worldwide causes, such as land-mine abolition.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's decision, detailed in writing just days before he
died, altered all plans.
</P>
<P>
   The royal couple's mid-October trip was originally scheduled
around a high school friend's wedding in Vermont _ a graduate of
Deerfield Academy, the king has maintained close ties with several
of his prep school classmates _ but it quickly stretched to
accommodate meetings with business and political leaders, both here
and in Washington. The king and queen had made their first state
visit to America in May.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House this month, Queen Rania met privately with
Hillary Clinton to discuss the first lady's November trip to
Jordan, during which issues close to the queen's heart will be
highlighted. Prominent among these are child abuse and the economic
empowerment of women throughout the Middle East, causes that Queen
Rania has championed through her nonprofit Jordan River Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got interested in child abuse four or five years ago,''
her majesty commented, ``it was a subject that wasn't discussed in
Jordan. There wasn't even any terminology for child abuse at the
time. Now people are aware that it's a problem that exists in every
community in the world, that it needs to be brought out in the
open. We are opening the first center in the Middle East to deal
with this issue, and we hope it will be a model replicated in other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaning forward slightly in her chair, the queen, who is of
Palestinian descent and went to school in Kuwait, noted that having
two small children (Prince Hussein, 5, and Princess Iman, 3) drives
her even harder in her efforts against child abuse in Jordan. She
credited King Hussein with raising awareness of the issue as well.
In one publicized incident before his death, he visited an
orphanage where children had been mistreated, she said. Not only
were the children relocated to one of his palaces, but the king
fired the minister in charge of the orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' said Queen Rania, ``people realized it was a
very important issue in Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, she was asked whether she is consciously bending
_ if not breaking _ cultural barriers that have faced Jordanian
women in the past. The queen spoke softly, yet emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for revolution,'' she replied. ``It's a matter
of taking the best from the past and looking towards the future. My
husband and His Majesty (Hussein) have both been very supportive of
women having a productive role in our society.''

<P>
   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max and his friend Ralph Rizzo, a Catholic
priest, enjoy an evening in one of the wilder parts of town,
ill-prepared for an encounter with a young group of Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In a funk, Max would yell that he ``hated nature,'' but, truth
be told, he hated technology more. Not all technology, of course.
He loved his car, a 1965 Mustang convertible. And he loved his VCR
although he never could figure out how to program it. And he loved
his little CD player, although he once told a friend that CDs made
music sound ``colder and more brittle'' than old vinyl records.
</P>
<P>
   On most days, he loved his computer and the ease of revision it
offered the writer, instead of the endless retyping he could still
feel in his fingers from the 1970s. But tonight he could not get
his printer to work.
</P>
<P>
   He retried and retried and finally hollered ``I hate
technology'' and pounded his fist on the desktop. The printer
suddenly bleeped to life _ flashing green and yellow lights and a
burble of R2D2 noises _ and printed out the day's work.
</P>
<P>
   That morning he had read yet another news article about the
millennium's most frustrating technological glitch, known to
insiders as the Y2K problem. Y2K stood for the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a computer,'' the story read, ``1998 is merely 98, 1999 is
just 99, and so on. The trouble will arrive when 1999 rolls over to
2000 and computers get confused about how to interpret the double
zeros. The computers may think we've flashed back to 1900.''
</P>
<P>
   Max couldn't figure out why this problem would take more than 10
minutes and 10 dollars to fix, but experts insisted it would take
billions to kill the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Without a fix, great computer networks would crash, plunging
air-traffic control, nuclear power plants, military installations,
international banking systems into chaos. Max could almost hear
computer after computer failing, clicking down, click, click,
click, like an equator of dominoes around the globe, click, click,
click, click ... click ... and then silence.
</P>
<P>
   The idea reminded Max of one of his favorite old books, ``Cat's
Cradle,'' by Kurt Vonnegut. Max remembered two details from the
story, that in a future world men and women made love through the
soles of their feet, and that the world ended when a renegade
element is loosed into the environment, turning all the world's
water to ice, slamming the future shut like a great iron door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Max, glad I found you decent.'' It was Kate Banks, and
even her soft voice made Max jump. ``Sorry I startled you. I buzzed
in at the front. When you didn't answer, I let myself in with my
key.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fighting with my damn printer _ I mean your damn
printer.'' He handed her a file with about 30 pages of text. Not a
bad day's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go over it on our way to dinner,'' she said. ``Let me
treat you. Do you like Italian?''
</P>
<P>
   Kate drove an old, gold Volvo sedan, vintage 1978 _ a quarter of
a million miles on her, said Kate proudly _ and Max enjoyed
watching her at the wheel. The car was in great shape, and Kate
looked wonderful driving it, wearing a pair of comfortable jeans, a
Florida State University T-shirt, white socks, and the only
extravagance, what looked like a $200 pair of running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   She snapped off the radio, which was playing classical. ``Tell
me what you've found out, Max.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well you were right about The Watchers, Kate.'' It was the
first time he had used her name in conversation and wondered
whether it marked some kind of turning point. ``They are a classic
doomsday cult. Better yet, let's use your word: They are
millenarians. They don't seem to be Christians, in the conventional
sense, but they tend to quote the Bible _ especially the
apocalyptic stuff. They are very specific about the date Jan. 1,
2000. They associate it with something big, but it's not clear
what. The end of the world? A new world order? The Buccaneers win a
Super Bowl? Lions lying down with lambs? Lambs eating the lions?
What I can't tell you yet is how dark this thing is, or whether
they pose a risk to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about members?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of their pamphlets make one of those unprovable claims _
more than a million members worldwide. We'll know a little more in
the fall. They're planning a huge convention _ at the Star Dome if
you can believe that. But I don't think there are more than a
thousand in the area, and most of them live in Gulfport. They
actually own the Conquistador Hotel on Cosmos Key.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of corporations is listed as the owner, but they all
trace back to Raoul Glaber, their leader. He's the one who scares
me. By all accounts he has this mesmerizing effect on people _
especially the young. The Watchers come in all ages, color and
sizes, but his recruiting efforts seem targeted toward the
alienated young, the kids we ran into _ or who ran into us _ in
Ybor City last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate nodded as they pulled into the parking lot of a restaurant
called Meat Balls. The place was owned by three Italian brothers
from the Bronx. In one room, which had about 12 tables, they served
the best Italian food Max had ever eaten _ a veal cacciatore,
tender beyond imagination, like butter. Max closed his eyes with
pleasure. Kate devoured the linguine with red clam sauce, and they
split a bottle of cheap Chianti.
</P>
<P>
   There were three large rooms in the back. One had a bowling
alley with only two lanes. You could use it at no charge, but you
had to replace the fallen pins by hand, like the old days. An
adjacent room had four pool tables, and Max and Kate shot two games
of eight ball.
</P>
<P>
   Max was winning the first, but scratched on the eight ball. Kate
won the next game in a rout. She was full of surprises, Max
thought, as he watched her lean over the table to kiss the winning
ball in the side pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think they call me Kate Banks?'' she said, laughing
at her own pun.
</P>
<P>
   The final room was a lounge with an old juke box and a tiny
dance floor. If you wanted to dance, you had to take off your shoes
to protect the shiny old wooden floor. Max couldn't believe how
relaxed he was feeling, or the renewal of his good spirits at a
time he assumed his life and work would be in continuous decline.
</P>
<P>
   They shared more wine and conversation, until Kate reached under
the table, undid the laces of her shoes and kicked his shin with a
stockinged foot. ``You up to a dance, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   He loved music, but not what was playing, some corny old disco
number by the Bee Gees. He had told himself, over the years, that
more than nature and technology, he hated disco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much of a dancer,'' he said, ``especially after a long
day of writing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Suit yourself,'' she said with a smile, and scooted off to the
lady's room. Max suddenly felt oafish and over-the-hill, and walked
dejectedly over to the juke box, staring into its yellow light,
glancing for several minutes at the selections. One caught his eye,
an old favorite. The Stones had done the most famous version, but
the original was recorded by the great Stax-Volt artist, Irma
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   He felt a hand on his shoulder. ``See one you like?'' It was
Kate, and her touch was like a jolt. He popped the number K-24.
``Ti-i-ime is on my side, yes it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Irma sounded like she was singing with a thousand-voice choir,
and Max felt like a parishioner in the Church of Soul. ``You'll
come runnin' back ... you'll come runnin' back, to me-e-e.''
</P>
<P>
   Max turned and Kate's hand slid across his shoulders. He glided
one arm around her waist, and the other down her arm to her hand.
They locked fingers. Her cheek touched his, and he inhaled some
delicate flowery fragrance behind her ear. Max slipped off his
loafers and kicked them free. She put her feet softly on his. They
rocked gently back and forth in the light of the juke box like two
teen-agers transported back to the past, with a thousand years of
time ahead of them.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max ponders the Y2K computer bug before a
rendezvous with his editor Kate, an evening that turns to romance.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max Timlin was known as a fearless journalist, but, truth be
told, he was afraid of two things: lightning and high places. He
traced these phobias to a single event in his childhood, when a
baby sitter dragged him onto a roller coaster at the Georgia State
Fair. He could not have been more than 5 years old. He was so
terrified he could neither close his eyes nor scream. A bolt of
lightning crashed out of a dark blue sky. He wet his pants. And
that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, he lived in the lightning capital of the world.
Three golfers were already dead this summer, the result of ignoring
the warning signs or trying to seek shelter under a tree.
</P>
<P>
   What a way to go, he thought, imagining some poor duffer raising
his sand wedge above his head, only to be zapped in midswing.
</P>
<P>
   He had read that a lightning strike could heat the surrounding
air to a temperature hotter than the sun. And this, it seems, had
been a record year for strikes, many of which had ignited forest
fires around the state.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, the El Nino water currents in the Pacific were
being blamed for disaster after disaster. Tornadoes. Floods.
Droughts. Fires. Hurricanes. If one were looking to the skies for
signs of the last days, you didn't have to look too long or too
hard.
</P>
<P>
   But Max had more immediate concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think we should go in, Kate?'' He turned a weather
ear to some distant rumblings over the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a while longer, Max. This breeze is so beautiful. And
look, there's a rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, to the southwest, a glorious rainbow arced from
Tampa Bay into the Gulf of Mexico, right over the Skyway Bridge. A
bridge over the bridge. But across the sky, blue-black clouds
gathered and billowed cinematically, illuminated from the inside by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Mississippi ... two Mississippi.'' He counted to six. A
faint rumble. They were still safe, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, will you answer me please?'' She reached up and punched
him on the arm.
</P>
<P>
   He now had proof that Kate was one hell of a journalist. Either
that, or she really was interested in him personally, and, in spite
of last night's slow dance, he found that hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   They had been walking along the beach for more than an hour now,
and she had asked him only a dozen questions. In return, he had
revealed to her all his secrets, including that he was petrified by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he had been born in Atlanta, to a Catholic mother and a
Jewish father. That made him something of an outsider in a land
full of Protestants. He attended a small parochial school, St.
John's Elementary; a public high school in Buckhead; and got into
Emory on an academic scholarship, but left after a year.
</P>
<P>
   He hustled a job at a community weekly paper, the Auburn Caller,
covering high school sports. The decision broke his mother's heart
_ she thought of her only son as a doctor, or lawyer, or maybe even
a priest. His father, a criminal defense attorney, thought writing
would suit Max just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Max himself considered becoming a lawyer, mostly because his
favorite television show was ``Perry Mason.'' He imagined himself
the center of some dramatic courtroom scene, getting an arrogant
witness to admit that, yes, yes, he was the one who had committed
the murder, and that the beautiful, shapely blonde was _ in a
manner of speaking _ innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I visited my Dad's courtroom. I was about 12, and
realized that all that Raymond Burr stuff was just a crock. That
most trials were really boring. Then it occurred to me that what
had fascinated me was not the law, but the stories, the
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   The breeze picked up and the sky lit up. ``One Mississippi, two
...'' This time the thunder rolled in at four. ``Let's go in,
Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until you tell me about your marriages.'' Not a topic he
usually talked about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short version is that I married and divorced twice. And
you'll find this interesting. Both times my wife ran off with the
same guy.'' More thunder. Kate looked at him in disbelief, and
tried to suppress a little laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's true. His name is Lionel Cropper, but, of course, I
call him Crapper. He was my best friend _ once _ an editor who gave
me great assignments, but while I was all over the country, he was
all over my first wife, Helen. She died in a car crash. He was
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate reached over and squeezed his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the rebound, I fell in love with a young reporter, Jamie
Nelson, a beautiful, talented kid who I think was infatuated with
what she perceived to be a big-time reporter. We were married less
than a year, before Crapper managed to get her assigned to his
desk. As far as I know, they're still together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you thought of putting a hit out on this guy?'' A flash
of lightning. Louder thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to think that maybe it's all been for the best, that
I'm not cut out to be with somebody _ not in marriage anyway. At
least we were smart enough not to have any kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you regret that, Max? About the children, I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to being alone, finally. My mom's still alive and
well _ I've got few friends _ but good ones. I love dogs. Wish I
had one. But sometimes I wonder about being the end of the line,
the last of the Mohicans.'' He looked at the sky. ``What about you,
Kate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good marriage. Jonathan died 10 years ago. Lung
cancer. He was a terrible smoker. But those fierce blue eyes made
up for it. We made a baby, little Cassandra Banks. A wild child. A
great athlete, soccer and volleyball. She's off on her own. I don't
see her very often. I miss her.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate began to cry. It took Max by surprise, until he realized
that his eyes were burning with tears too, not from crying, but
from the salty wind off the Gulf that was now whipping into a
mini-gale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you ever think about dying, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   He had to speak louder now over the sound of the wind. ``Not
every day, if I can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean do you think that when you die, it's, it's _ all over _
like the way it was before you were born _ or is there something
waiting for us?'' Flash. One Mississippi. Crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy, Kate. I'm shaking. Please let's go in. At least
to the car.'' She threw herself on him and kissed him hard. He
caught her. And held her perfectly still, and sustained her weight,
and let her kiss him until she was through. One Mississippi ...
two... he counted to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Zzzzznnappp! A lightning bolt snapped so close, there was no
time to count. So loud it knocked them both to the sand. He could
smell it.
</P>
<P>
   He gathered her to her feet and raced toward the top of the
beach, it was raining hard suddenly, huge drops driven by the wind
into full sheets of water. He opened the door of the Mustang and
hustled her into the back seat and climbed in after her. The rain
drove down even harder, what he once called ``tarantula rains,''
his childhood mistake for ``torrential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No more existential questions, Kate.'' Max tried to catch his
breath. ``You've brought down the wrath of the gods on us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, Max, but I miss Cassandra.'' She buried her head in
her hands as Max put his arm around her shoulder. ``I miss my
daughter.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max reveals his fear of lightning, which does
not deter Kate from leading him on a walk through a storm. She
reveals to him her concerns about her daughter. Max ponders the Y2K
computer bug before a rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Kate had assigned Max two helpers from the newspaper, the only
other people who knew he was on the trail of The Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Violet Rose was a crack researcher with an uncanny technical
instinct. She was in her mid-30s, tall, elegant and slightly
exotic, looking a little like NBC anchor Ann Curry. Violet was born
in Singapore, her father a British journalist, her mother a Chinese
translator.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Darling _ she received a lot of kidding after Bruce
Springsteen wrote a song with that title _ had been snapping photos
since she was a little girl in Cuba. She had a reputation as
inventive, independent, relentless and courageous, all the traits
Max appreciated in a photojournalist. Sherry was a short woman with
a delicate face and a surprisingly muscular body.
</P>
<P>
   Max knew her work and admired it. Sherry was a Pulitzer finalist
for her photographs of the 1980 Skyway Bridge disaster. A huge
tanker had hit the bridge in a fierce storm. At the exact moment
the storm cleared, Sherry was leaning out of a helicopter,
capturing startling images of the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in town still talk about her picture of the yellow Buick
Skylark, stopped dead on a span of ragged metal, dangling 175 feet
above Tampa Bay. The driver escaped, but had to be restrained from
returning to the car to rescue his golf clubs from the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tee time is in three hours!'' he exclaimed, turning him into a
folk hero for a battalion of men wearing shiny white shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Max knew the Skyway disaster story well. He had written a
profile of the only man to fall from the bridge and survive. He was
Elmo Polonski, a man in his 50s, who had been driving south in a
pickup truck, on his way to work, when the oil tanker crashed into
the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Driver and truck soared through the air, heading down, down, the
ship getting closer and closer. His instinct was to hit the brakes.
The wheels of the truck hit the bow of the tanker and bounced off
into a choppy Gulf of Mexico. The truck submerged and the driver
escaped the cab, dazed and battered, but with just enough energy to
reach up and hook his arm over a rung of a rope ladder that had
been lowered to him. He blacked out and came to on the deck of the
ship, surrounded by strangers speaking Korean.
</P>
<P>
   Max remembered his lead for the story: ``Something interesting
happened to Elmo Polonski Friday on his way to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Given their shared history as chroniclers of the Skyway
disaster, Max was delighted to hook up with Sherry and her
colleague Violet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been all over the Internet,'' said Violet, ``and the
feeling I get is an increase in activities about The Watchers. More
Web sites, more conversation in New Age chat rooms, and Kate is
right _ much of the buzz centers on West Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Violet tapped out a few commands on her laptop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're planning a big convention _ you know about that, Max _
but they're talking like it's a Stones concert or something _ 30
maybe 40 thousand. They've booked the Star Dome. And they're making
a big deal that this is for `initiates' only.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Initiates? I haven't come across that word with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like it sounds. Someone who has passed through an
initiation _ or joined the club _ or learned the secret handshake
or something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've checked all the photo files,'' said Sherry. ``Not much on
The Watchers _ a few photos of the leader _ but I went out and shot
some scenes around their headquarters at the Conquistador Hotel.
Take a look at these. The hotel is pink, but I might as well have
shot them in black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   The images were of young people, from late teens into their
early 30s. They were entering the hotel or standing in small groups
in courtyards, or walking along the beach. What was remarkable was
that most were dressed in black, but some in white. The contrast
was startling in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   The black tribe tended to be younger, like the kids he had seen
in Ybor City. The picture showed bald heads or spiky hair in weird
colors, tattoos, body piercing, lots of leather, even in the
Florida sun. If they were from the dungeons of Uranus, their
counterparts came from a yacht club on Neptune, neat white sports
clothes and shiny white running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The women wore white barrettes, or scarves, or headbands, the
men white sports caps with familiar logos. Their hair was short and
neatly groomed, their postures like models in a Spiegel catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory,'' said Sherry, ``is that we're seeing the before
and after effects of initiation.'' She explained that she dressed
like a tourist, took shots from a safe distance with a big lens,
pointing mostly at the water and sailboats.
</P>
<P>
   It was Violet's turn again. ``The Watchers draw from an odd mix
of mythologies and liturgies, on a spectrum from medieval
Catholicism to New Age Druids. I found out that initiation rites
are conducted _ all over the world _ on the eve of a full moon, and
always near the confluence of two bodies of water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When is the next full moon?'' asked Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three nights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So Thursday is the eve?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The odd thing is that these are public events. They are not
clandestine. They're even advertised in the alternative weekly.
Check this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Violet had clipped a small ad from the back page of Fishwrap, a
free and funky paper popular, because of the music news, with young
people.
</P>
<P>
   Are you watching?
</P>
<P>
   Tired of watching alone?
</P>
<P>
   Then come watch with us.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   South end of Cosmos Key.
</P>
<P>
   Dress in black.
</P>
<P>
   Max knew that location well. The south end of Cosmos Key is the
closest point of land to the center of the Skyway Bridge, the exact
point where the Gulf of Mexico flows into Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that you'd look mighty fine in black, Sherry,
darlin'.'' She played along. ``Only way for you to find out, Boss,
is to rent a tux and take me to the dance.''

   THE STORY SO FAR: Reporter Max Timlin, out of a job and down on
his luck, is hired by editor Kate Banks to conduct a secret
investigation of a doomsday cult called The Watchers. Max begins
his research, focusing on the cult leader Raoul Glaber, a
charismatic man with a troubling message, who seems to be targeting
the young for recruitment. Max and a Catholic priest, Ralph Rizzo,
encounter a group of young Watchers in one of the wilder parts of
town. Kate begins to take a romantic interest in Max, much to his
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max and Sherry arrived for The Watcher initiation ceremony
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll pretend to be this biker couple hangin' with the punky
kids.'' It was Sherry's idea. She owned a Harley, and brought over
some biker gear for Max to wear: black jeans, a black and gold
Harley T-shirt, and a black helmet with a swirling snake design on
the sides. Sherry wore tight black shorts over a black bathing suit
and looked ``damn good,'' Max told her.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Max had never been on a motorcycle before, so he
was stuck riding behind Sherry, and though he enjoyed holding on to
her, he was glad they were riding at night so no one could get a
good look at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like Pee-wee Herman,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   As they approached the south end of Cosmos Key, Sherry slowed
down so the roar of the bike would not attract too much attention,
and then parked it near a palm tree at the north edge of the park.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, they could see that a crowd, maybe 200 to 300
people, had gathered. Most looked young and were dressed in black,
although they were mixed with a few onlookers dressed like tourists
attending a bonfire on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had lit a fire, which was illegal, although there was no
sign of the police. In general, Max hated beach cops. He'd received
too many petty parking tickets over the years, but, as Max and
Sherry walked hand in hand toward the site, not knowing what would
happen, he wished for some token of security.
</P>
<P>
   It was about an hour before midnight, a calm and cloudless
night. An almost round moon _ it would be full tomorrow _ had made
</P>
<P>
   its climb into the sky, turning colors from orange, to yellow,
to ivory. It was now positioned just to the southeast of the Skyway
Bridge. It made a nice photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry had rigged a small backpack with a hidden camera. She had
used the device before, usually chasing down corrupt politicians or
scam artists or gangsters. Her most famous ``gotcha'' photo was of
a well-known televangelist soliciting a teen-age prostitute. Sherry
and a policewoman, dressed like hookers, stood on a corner across
the street and caught the rat in the trap.
</P>
<P>
   So as Max and Sherry walked through the crowd, which continued
to grow, Sherry silently snapped dozens of images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, old biker man, can I score a smoke?''
</P>
<P>
   Max was startled by the approach of a tall, thin kid dressed
only in a pair of black Speedos and black flip-flops. His head was
shaved, but, more startling, he was completely hairless, even on
his arms and legs, and didn't appear to have any eyebrows or
eyelashes.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry pulled a pack of Camels from the front of her backpack
and handed him a cigarette and a light.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to your hair, man?'' she asked. ``You look like
an Olympic swimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaved it all off, biker lady. Getting ready for my
initiation.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he ran back toward a circle of friends and sat on the
edge of the beach looking out at the moon and the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   It was now about 10 minutes before midnight and the crowd had
grown to about 500 and pressed toward the water. A few boom boxes
had been playing the same strange metallic vibrations Max had heard
in Ybor City, but they were silent now, and the crowd calmed down,
and there was almost no noise, except for the sound of surf and the
croaking of sea birds, until the young man with no hair yelled,
``Watch! Over there!'' and pointed a long arm and skinny finger
toward the middle of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   A sleek, white vessel sliced through the sea, the boat and its
wake brilliant in the moonlight. As it came closer, its huge
engines roaring, Max recognized it as something called a
``cigarette'' boat. Fast and powerful, it was favored by drug
runners in the tropics. This one was big, a 40- or 50-footer.
</P>
<P>
   The boat ate up the distance between the bridge and shore, its
engines now in a deafening roar, and Max could make out its full
size and elegance. He counted 12 figures on deck. Eleven men,
dressed in white, and what looked like a woman in a black, hooded
robe. Sherry had moved away from Max to a location where she could
snap away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome you all to the initiation rite of The Watchers,
here on the eve of the full moon, at the confluence of two great
bodies of water.''
</P>
<P>
   The boat was wired for sound, although no speakers or
microphones were visible. The young man who issued the greeting
must have been wearing a wireless mike. He was not Raoul Glaber,
but a much younger man with hair so blond it looked almost white.
</P>
<P>
   The other men on deck looked equally young, blond and very
athletic, like TV infomercial models for exercise machines. ``Will
the candidates for initiation please come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   At various points, the crowd parted to let through several
aspiring Watchers. Max counted 24 in all, 12 men and 12 women. He
estimated that they were in their late teens to early 30s. They
formed an awkward line at the shore where sea foam washed against
their feet.
</P>
<P>
   The men on board, except the speaker, climbed down from the
anchored boat into the water, which was up to their chests, and
walked forward to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand before this bridge, an image of the world's
transformation. We watch for signs of the last days, and for that
day to come _ it is just before us _ when all that once was will
disappear, and time, newly born, will begin again.''
</P>
<P>
   He gestured toward the initiates. ``But first you must strip
yourself of the vestiges of the old, dark times.'' As if on cue,
the initiates began to remove their jewelry, most of it silver. One
man unpeeled several chains from around his neck. A girl took off
rings from each finger.
</P>
<P>
   The tall hairless kid removed earrings. One young woman, with
barbed wire tattoos on both arms, removed clips from her nose, ears
and an eyebrow. They dumped the jewelry into bags carried by the
men in white.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next startled Max, and by the buzz in the crowd,
several other onlookers. The initiates began to remove their
clothing. Off came bathing suits, and T-shirts, and caps, and black
jackets, and flip-flops, and even a pair of Doc Martens, until two
dozen figures stood in the moonlight, tall and short, doughy and
angular _ and completely naked. Sherry noticed that three of them
had the letter W tattooed on their snowy butts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a glorious new beginning, for once you wore black,
when your hearts and minds were dark, but now, washed in this
water, you will wear white.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a roll call: ``James Weeks, Sasha Britton,
Bethany Davis ...''
</P>
<P>
   Each initiate was escorted by a Watcher out toward the boat,
leaned backwards like a dancer being dipped, and submerged in the
waters of the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha Kronauer, Russell Major, David Poynter ...''
</P>
<P>
   It reminded Max of the old-timey baptisms he remembered from the
evangelical South _ except for the nudity, which made this ceremony
look like a scene in a Salvador Dali painting.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the initiates were ushered back to the shoreline,
where they donned gleaming white robes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this day forward, you will wear white,'' declared the
young man, ``until the day comes, and it will come soon _ watch for
it _ when we all will be clad in red _ the color of fire, the color
of Raoul.''
</P>
<P>
   A cheer went up from the crowd, which evolved into a chant,
something you might hear at a political rally or a soccer game.
``Ra-oul ... Ra-oul ... Ra-oul.''
</P>
<P>
   It lasted for more than a minute, followed by another cheer, as
emerging from a cabin in the center of the boat, dressed in a dark
red running suit, emerged a man with dark hair and skin so pale it
looked ghostly in the moonlight. He stood behind the woman on the
deck, reached around her shoulders, and removed her hooded robe.
</P>
<P>
   Max was startled by the action and the cheer that went up from
the crowd, for there before him stood the most beautiful woman he
had ever seen, wearing nothing but long chestnut hair that cascaded
across her shoulders. He found himself embarrassed by this intimate
vision of her and lowered his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That girl's name is Angela Powers.'' Sherry was back now,
whispering in his ear.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd began chanting her name: ``An-gel-a. ... An-gel-a
...'' until the man beside her raised his hands, silenced the
crowd, and began to speak.

   Max watched in fascination as the young woman, Angela Powers,
stepped elegantly down a ladder off the side of the boat and into
the water of the Gulf, which came up almost to her chin. She
executed an athletic surface dive and took three strong strokes,
stood, the water was now waist high, and walked unself-consciously
naked toward the shore.
</P>
<P>
   She looked maybe 21 years old, thought Max, about 5-foot-7, with
chestnut hair, wet and pulled back now, and skin that emitted a
healthy translucent glow even in the moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   Max imagined the most beautiful model and the best woman athlete
merged into a single body. No gaunt, skeletal clothes hanger here,
but a woman who looked both voluptuous and chiseled _ how was that
possible? _ and as comfortable with her own body as a person could
be. Her eyes glowed blue, very blue.
</P>
<P>
   All the Watchers on shore stepped forward to greet her, and one
wrapped her in a dark red robe, the same color worn by Raoul
Glaber, who watched with a toothy smile from the boat. He began:
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela, our special angel, is now sheathed in red. It is the
color of blood, flame, Pentecost, the rising sun, the new
millennium, and, of course, the Florida State University football
team.'' The crowd burst into laughter at this unexpected bit of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see before you the bridge. A bridge to the sky. But also a
bridge of death, the place where too many have ascended and then
thrown their lives into the deep. It is a symbol of our times, of
our century.'' His voice was soft and steady, amplified perfectly
by an invisible sound system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is the century that created the automobile and the
airplane and the television and the computer. Alan Shepard landed
there,'' he pointed to the moon, ``and hit a golf ball into space
right there. We created penicillin and cures for thousands of
diseases. People have hope of living longer and happier lives. So
maybe we should call our time the Age of Hope and Creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, not to think of something to say, but as if preparing
to lift some great weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what have we done with the powers that have been given us?
We have become the masters of disasters. In 1915 the Ottoman Turks
killed a million Armenians. By 1933, Josef Stalin had caused the
death of more than 11 million of his countrymen, through systems of
starvation and torture. In three years, Pol Pot murdered more than
2 million, one out of every four Cambodians. If you committed the
crime of having a high school education, you could have been one of
his victims. In Uganda, thousands of victims of Idi Amin could be
found, their bodies mutilated, floating down rivers. In this very
decade hundreds of thousands of Rwandans have been hacked to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what can we say of Hitler and the crimes of the Third
Reich? Just 22 Nazis were tried at Nuremberg for grotesque crimes
against humanity, crimes that separated, deported, tortured,
starved, gathered into concentration camps, gassed, and incinerated
6 million Jews and 5 million others. How do we begin to understand
this without declaring ours the Age of Hatred and Genocide?
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up believing in the God of Christians and Jews, but no
more. How does a just and merciful God rest amid the glories of
heaven, angelic music ringing in his ears, in the face of such
atrocities? Would a loving father permit such pain to be visited on
his children? How can this race of people think of itself as saved
or redeemed?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not worthy. And we cannot be worthy until this age
passes away, as a man walks across a bridge and leaves one side
behind and heads off for another. Our time must come to an end, and
a new age begin. An age of blackness must be purified, washed in
blood, healed by fire, before we can achieve an age of purity,
peace, and harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are false prophets who have come before me with similar
messages. But salvation cannot be found in the poisoned potions of
Jonestown. Heaven is not behind the Halle-Bopp comet. It is not on
a faraway planet. You will not be whisked away there by friendly
aliens patting you on the back. And salvation is not in the
violence of Waco, or Oklahoma City, or Ruby Ridge. If I lead you
down those paths, walk away from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 2,000 years ago, a Jewish child was born in a tiny
village and given the name Joshua, although we know that man as
Jesus. His followers believe he died and rose from the dead and
ascended into heaven, but that he would return. One of them _ his
beloved friend John _ had a vision and wrote down what he saw in
what we now call the Book of the Apocalypse:
</P>
<P>
   ``And I saw an angel come down from heaven, and he laid hold on
Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the
bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him. And I saw
the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and
they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. And when the
thousand years expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four
quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to
battle. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured
them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of
fire and brimstone. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand
before God; and the books were opened. And whosoever was not found
written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children, look, I have inscribed your names into my book of
life.'' He held up what looked like a laptop computer. ``I accept
you as my own. I embrace you as a father. I gather you up and
shield you. I sit and watch with you for the time that is coming. I
heal you from the wounds placed upon you by your parents. Wounds of
abuse. Wounds of neglect. Wounds of addiction and dependency.
Wounds of crass materialism. They left you alone. They let you be
raised by strangers. While you were crying with grief or
loneliness, they dropped you off at the mall. They stood by while
you scarred your own bodies, or stuffed them to obesity, or starved
them to oblivion. They aborted you before you were born. And then
they went out and bought themselves a nice dinner, some dessert, a
carafe of wine. They created the Age that Hated Children.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love you, and I'LL LOVE YOU FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time that Raoul Glaber raised his voice, and
the crowd echoed back its cheers. Max looked and saw people holding
each other, tears streaming down faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come,'' he said, ``and follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   He stepped down into the cabin of the boat and disappeared from
sight. In the next few minutes, his original 11 disciples, with
Angela Powers, waded out to the boat, climbed aboard, and prepared
to embark. The engines roared to life, the boat turned back toward
the bridge and sped off toward the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Back on shore, the new initiates greeted and hugged each other,
and were approached and congratulated by friends in the crowd, like
Jewish kids after their bar mitzvahs. Then they marched across the
park, stepped into three white vans _ with Conquistador Hotel on
the side _ and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   Max and Sherry walked slowly, heads bowed, not touching now,
back toward her Harley, their every stepped being watched my a man
sitting on the branch of a nearby oak tree.

<P>
   If the world was going to end, thought Max, the best place to be
was in a traffic jam on U.S. 19, one of America's ugliest roads and
biggest parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more tourists and ``snowbirds'' flocked to West
Florida, the development and traffic clotted Route 19 to the point
of arteriosclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a good day to die,'' said Max to his Mustang,
quoting an old Native-American saying, and looking north toward
Clearwater and an endless line of traffic. Apocalypse today might
be considered a form of euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   For the next half hour he inched by one strip shopping mall
after another, their stores offering everything from lawn furniture
to used cars to fast foods to lingerie modeling. Finally, he came
upon the landmark he was looking for, a large billboard inviting
one to stop in for a ``Quick Lube.''
</P>
<P>
   Max pulled the Mustang, its temperature gauge pointing toward
hot, into a big lot and parked it under a shady tree and pulled up
the top to avoid bird bombing runs. He had come here to meet Father
Ralph Rizzo and to sort out the things he had seen and heard at The
Watchers' initiation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   He could not erase from his mind the image of Angela Powers,
naked as a newborn, shimmering wet in the moonlight. He told
himself that his thoughts about her were not lustful, that they
aroused in him a different kind of yearning, a fatherly desire to
save a lost daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Father Ralph stood in the parking lot wearing sandals, khaki
shorts, a Hawaiian shirt, and a Yankees cap. As Max approached him,
Ralph swept his hand and pointed dramatically: ``Behold. There she
is. Our Lady of Clearwater. The Rainbow Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   It clicked now in Max's mind. He looked up to see on the glass
panels of a bank building the most remarkable image _ a
multicolored pattern of wavy bands that formed the familiar cloaked
outline of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Max remembered reading about
it. How a palm tree had been removed. How water from the sprinkler
system had washed upon the glass. How chemicals had bonded to form
this startling icon of red, blue, gold and violet. How this was now
a destination for pilgrims and preachers and miracle seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Max noticed about 100 votive candles before the image, along
with dozens of handwritten messages tacked to the fence. ``Dear
Mother of God. I am only 10 years old. My dad is sick and doesn't
have any money. Please help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph told Max that he came here once in a while to collect
messages, to greet pilgrims, and to minister to those seeking help.
He often directed them to food banks, or hospices, or AIDS clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two stories from the Gospel that always impressed
me,'' said Ralph, leading Max to a white plastic bench under a
tree. ``The first one is about this sick lady who figures that if
she can just touch the hem of His garment, she would be healed. It
says that Jesus felt the power going out of Him. In another town,
Jesus can't perform any miracles because the people there had no
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get it,'' said Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think God reached down from the sky and with some big
magic marker drew a picture of Mary on that glass? No. I think the
sprinkler system did that. The power is not in that image, but in
the faith of that 10-year-old boy who wants to help his father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But people can believe in the wrong thing. The Nazis had faith
in Hitler. The Watchers have faith in Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does that name sound familiar to me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been talking about him for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the first time I've focused on his name. Is this
the guy you saw on the boat _ with that beautiful girl?'' Max
nodded. ``Do you think Glaber has the hots for her?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a funny expression for a priest to use, and it evoked
from Max a muffled laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph turned professorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing in The Watchers turns out to be a very old
story, Max. Social movements inspired by the millennium take many
shapes, but they always have two distinct features _ it's been that
way since the Middle Ages. I taught this stuff for years. First,
you need an alienated, disenfranchised, impoverished group _ in the
Dark Ages it was the peasants. And then you need a charismatic
leader who is self-important and usually a little loony. This Raoul
Glaber has obviously targeted the dispossessed young for
indoctrination. And he holds himself up as a kind of savior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What amazed me, Ralph, is that I know this guy's a jerk, but
he makes a kind of perverse sense. It's hard to deny that we've
sort of screwed over a generation of young people. And we've
committed such atrocities over this century, some in the name of
religion. Maybe we've lost the chance to be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bull----,'' said Ralph. ``There are only three kinds of people
in the world. The ones like Glaber who look at things and see the
end. The ones, like that 10-year-old boy, who have hope even in the
dark days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the third kind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``People like you, Max, who can't make up your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How could a just and merciful God allow something like the
Holocaust to happen? I'm not trying to be disrespectful, Ralph. I'm
just trying to get inside Glaber's head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the oldest trap in the world, Max. It's shows that, deep
down, you're a believer. If you believe only in chaos or accident
or biology, then you can account for someone like Hitler _ a crazy
person in a crazy world. If you believe in God, you've got some
work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you're not supposed to understand. Maybe you're just
supposed to act. To investigate this Glaber guy. And write a great
story. And save the life of that beautiful young woman. Maybe
that's the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here for a counseling session, Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you come here for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To try to learn more about this millennium stuff. We may be
entering a new era, but I think I'm beyond the kind of rejuvenation
you're preaching, Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You once had so much energy and passion. I admired that in
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've collected too many barnacles, Ralph, even for a good hull
scraper like you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't you ever seen a piece of driftwood polished into
something glorious? Maybe God ain't done with you yet, Max.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph got up from his seat to greet a tall, thin man with long,
unkempt hair, and a scraggly beard that flowed to his breastbone.
His face was gaunt, and Max could see that his belongings were
piled nearby in a grocery cart.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph, a foot shorter than this man, locked him in a bear hug
and dragged the man by the arm into the shade of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max,'' he said, ``I want you to meet Louis. He's a friend of
mine.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max meets up with Father Ralph and questions
the priest about the millennium, but Ralph dispels a doomsday
attitude with acts of kindness.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   As Max cruised down Gulf Boulevard through Madeira Beach and
toward Treasure Island, he glanced down and noticed the odometer
had, some miles ago, crossed the 99,000-mile barrier. He reached
out and patted the dashboard of the old Mustang as if he were
stroking a pony's mane.
</P>
<P>
   Although exhausted from his encounter with Father Ralph, Max
decided to keep another appointment he had made for that afternoon.
He turned toward the beach and stopped at a lovely house with
weathered shingles and a xeriscaped yard. Dr. Evelyn Hamilton lived
here, a retired veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Max had read in the Florida Sun that this kind woman had adopted
Daisy, the Rottweiler who survived a fall from the Skyway Bridge.
Daisy's former owner, quite deranged, had tossed her over on his
own journey toward the big deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me Evie,'' she insisted and extended her hand. She was a
lovely woman with dark eyes and silver hair who had been chosen
from among more than 100 suitors to take care of Daisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always tell how a person will treat people by how they
treat animals,'' she said. Daisy was doing fine, except for the
slightest limp, the effects of neurological damage to one of her
paws.
</P>
<P>
   Max lowered himself to one knee, reached into a bag and took out
a handful of gourmet doggie yummies. Daisy devoured these and
nuzzled Max's hand for more. The next half hour was spent on the
rug with generous amounts of ear rubbing, back scratching and
slobbery kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Evie told Max he could visit any time. He congratulated her on
her fine work and said he'd like to write Daisy's story some day.
He waved from his Mustang _ the top was down _ and drove happily
down the beach until his thoughts turned to the young man who had
ended his own life and wanted to take his dog with him.
</P>
<P>
   What had she done for him but be a faithful companion even into
the abyss? Did he think he needed her in the afterlife like some
Egyptian pharaoh? Could he not stand the thought of someone else
taking care of her? Maybe God watched over the sparrows and the
Rottweilers, the lilies of the field and the Daisies. Maybe that
cagey Father Ralph was getting to him.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the road, Max heard an amusing story on National Public
Radio. A man entered a betting emporium in London, where they'll
lay odds on almost anything: ``What are the chances my 5-year-old
son will grow up to play for England in the World Cup?'' A 100,000
to 1, minimum bet 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But one man wanted to bet 1,000 pounds that the world would end
on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' explained the manager, ``we can't take a bet where we
couldn't pay the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The bettor looked puzzled. ``If the world did end, how would we
pay you?''
</P>
<P>
   That bit of British honesty _ along with his visit to Daisy _
lifted Max's spirits, a feeling that intensified when he thought
again of Angela Powers, a young girl so beautiful and strong, whose
physical presence projected a sense of purity and purpose
inconsistent with her attachment to Raoul Glaber and The Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   As he made his final turn toward Land's End, his thoughts moved
to Kate Banks. He needed to see her again to report on all he had
learned about the Watchers and _ more urgently _ to test whether
there was anything between them.
</P>
<P>
   Max clicked the radio to a music station, only to hear Michael
Bolton's overwrought version of ``When a Man Loves a Woman.'' He
took it as a bad sign. He changed stations and a true miracle
occurred: It was Percy Sledge's original version of the same song.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired, he pressed his foot on the accelerator and, in the
three minutes it took to finish the song, he looked in his rearview
mirror to see the lights of a police car. He pulled over and a
tall, imposing officer with ebony skin approached the Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry if I was speeding, officer, I ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to worry about that, Mr. Timlin. You are Max Timlin. Or
have you just stolen his car?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm him. I mean he.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, sir, could you follow me?''
</P>
<P>
   More curious than fearful, Max followed the police car for about
a mile, then turned down a side street in front of a tiny
restaurant called Red Beans. The officer held the front door open
without a smile and Max walked in, his eyes adjusting to the
darkness. Finally, at an isolated corner table he saw a familiar
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, my man, what the hell are you doin' muckin' around with
The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   The question was so direct and had such conviction behind it, it
caught Max off guard. He decided on a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the hell do you know that, Sam? You been followin' me?''
</P>
<P>
   Sam was Samson Lockhart, one of the top cops in the state of
Florida. Max had written a long profile of Lockhart, who had
arrived in St. Pete from New Orleans, La., to become its first
African-American chief of police.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart was the son and grandson of police officers, and had
been credited with easing tensions between the police and the black
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have to follow you, little brother. We been watchin'
the Watchers. Special investigative unit. We've got you on tape in
Ybor City when those kids knocked over the Jesus guy, and we got
you during the latest initiation ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart let out a big laugh. He was almost 6-foot-5, and the
laugh echoed through the empty restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funniest thing I ever seen. You looked like a candy-ass
dressed in that biker stuff. But the lady you were with looked
mighty fine. Who was that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman named Sherry ... '' Max regretted it as soon as the
name left his lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherry Darling? So you workin' for the Florida Sun now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly, I ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you not exactly work for a newspaper? Do you hear
that?'' he turned to the other officer, ``He doesn't exactly work
for the Sun. Well, who the hell are you workin' with, then? I know
you ain't datin' Sherry Darling because she's a bright and talented
woman who wouldn't be seen dead with a burnt out old dog like
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Max couldn't bring himself to laugh under this harangue though
he wanted to. ``Sam, I can't tell you any ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, why don't you call me Chief Lockhart, just for today,
just so I know you're payin' attention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir, Chief Lockhart, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You still drivin' that old piece of junk? When you gonna get
yourself a proper car?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What does this have to do with The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well if you're gonna catch Raoul Glaber and those pretty blond
boys he hangs with, you're gonna need a car that goes more than 45
miles per hour and gets better than eight miles to the gallon.''
</P>
<P>
   `You know the kind of car Glaber drives?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what kind of toothpaste he uses, but we ain't gonna
tell you unless you start tellin' us some things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you, Sam, I mean Chief Lockhart, that I'm working
as a journalist. It's not some personal thing. But I can't tell you
who hired me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to tell me. It's Miss Kate Banks, another fine
woman who should know better than to have anything to do with the
likes of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want from me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothin' much. I just want you to go to the Conquistador Hotel,
go into that lion's den, and interview Raoul Glaber, the Number 1
Big Daddy Watcher himself.''

<P>
   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max meets up with Daisy, the dog that survived
a fall from the Skyway Bridge, and then is summoned to a meeting
with Sam Lockhart, chief of police.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me to do what?'' Max Timlin squinted his eyes and
scratched what was left of his hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to screw your courage to the sticking post,'' Sam
Lockhart, police chief, reciting this line in a mock Shakespearean
accent as if rehearsing for a Mel Brooks production of Othello,
``and I want you to go in amongst the Watchers and interview Raoul
Glaber, their king.'' He bowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you just send your best detectives in there? Or why
not just bring him in?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he's much too dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Max looked at him, his eyes now wide in disbelief. ``He's too
dangerous for the cops, so you want me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam relaxed his demeanor and pointed to the chair across from
him. He called to someone in the kitchen and began ordering Cajun
food, large steaming bowls of it: red beans and rice, andouille
sausage, shrimp jambalaya, crawfish etouffe, blackened grouper, all
washed down with sweet iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   The talking and the eating took almost two hours. Some of Max's
favorite music played in the background: Fats Domino, Professor
Longhair, Dr. John, the Neville Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to the sweet voice of Aaron Neville, Max, you've just
got to `Tell it like it is....' You're a macho newspaper man,''
said Sam, pushing back from the table. ``You'll get a big story out
of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't cut deals with cops,'' said Max, eating a bite of
bread pudding soaked in rum. ``And I don't do their work for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't like reporters,'' said Sam, ``but we've got
something important here, and I'm willing to dispense with some of
the old rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a huge file on our ongoing investigation of The
Watchers. It goes back more than a year. And I'll open it just for
you. It's got loads of stuff in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And what do I have to do in return?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just be yourself. Go in and ask for an interview. Get as close
as you can, which will not be easy. Light a little fire under him
and see if he jumps. Just be your old, stank reporter self. And
then just answer a few of our questions about what you saw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get no access to my notes. I tell you whatever I want to
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I get to see the file anytime I want to from now until the
Second Coming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a good man, Max Timlin, and deserve a fine cup of
chicory coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Max debated the big cop's proposal with himself for two days
before meeting up with his editor.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Banks showed up at the condo on Saturday evening, just in
time to enjoy a bright-orange sunset, which she and Max watched
from the balcony while sipping Heineken from bottles and nibbling
on slices of Sicilian pizza. They fought over the crust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought you a present,'' said Kate, reaching into her purse.
``Call it a bonus for your good work so far.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a video copy of ``Goldfinger,'' which Max had told her
was one of his favorite movies. He peeled off the plastic wrapper,
popped it into the VCR, and curled up on the couch to watch it.
About 90 minutes and two beers later, by the time James Bond is
rolling in the hay with Pussy Galore, Kate had kicked off her
sandals, pulled up her knees, and rested her head against Max's
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the coolest thing,'' Max clapped his hands in delight
as Bond defeated Odd Job, and the counter on the nuclear device
stopped at exactly 007. ``Fort Knox and the economies of the Free
World _ saved!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldfinger was not your average terrorist,'' said Kate. ``I
wonder what Bond would do if he encountered Raoul Glaber?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably go right into the lion's den.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same phrase that Sam Lockhart had used, and it gave
Max a moment's pause. He had told her over the phone the details of
the plan, and she now approved, ``As long as you report to me first
_ before you talk with the cops.''
</P>
<P>
   She opened a folder filled with photos, the ones Sherry Darling
had shot at the initiation ceremony. They were splendid. The
cigarette boat in the moonlight, with the Skyway Bridge as a frame.
The initiates lined up on the beach. Raoul Glaber waving from the
boat. And Angela Powers, like a postmodern Venus, rising from the
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume you'll want to keep this one for your private
collection,'' said Kate.
</P>
<P>
   Max raised his hand in honest protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, but she's
young enough to be my daughter. Father Ralph thinks I've been put
on this earth to save her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' said Kate, and looked into his eyes earnestly.
``Thank you, Max. You're one of the good guys.'' And with that she
kissed him, first lightly on the cheek, and then lightly on the
lips. And again. He kissed her back, very softly, like a beginner,
then more firmly, and then, as if a door had finally opened, with
passion.
</P>
<P>
   He took in the warmth of her breath, the smell of her hair, and
the wonderful feel of a strong woman's body pressed against his.
They kissed nonstop for what might have been 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang. It was on the near table, and it startled them
both, so that they separated, looked at each other and laughed.
Kate picked it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, hello, Father Ralph. Yes, this is Kate Banks. Yes, Max is
here. We were just watching a movie.'' Kate winked at Max, who took
the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, tell me again, the name of this Watcher guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The priest's voice was loud and excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raoul. Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spell it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``R-a-o-u-l G-l-a-b-e-r.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've got two pieces of news for you, buddy boy. First,
that's not his real name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the second piece?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in more trouble than we thought.''

<P>
   LAST INSTALLMENT: Police Chief Sam Lockhart persuades Max Timlin
to infiltrate The Watcher headquarters and obtain an interview with
the secretive Raoul Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   It took Max Timlin three full days in the musty old library of
St. Pius College, north of Tampa, to make sense of Father Ralph's
revelations: Raoul Glaber was not the real name of the leader of
The Watchers. Max wasn't as convinced as Ralph that this was true,
but he devoured the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He began by reading the Book of Revelation, sometimes known as
the Book of the Apocalypse. He always thought the word
``apocalypse'' meant some great final cataclysm, as in the movie
``Apocalypse Now.'' But it was actually the Greek word for
``revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Father Ralph's tutelage, Max came to realize that the
revelations of the last book of the Christian scriptures are
shrouded in mysterious and symbolic language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if the Apostle John was dropping acid with Picasso,''
said Max, irreverently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dreamlike visions of this book have left so much open to
interpretation that any tinhorn prophet can use it to predict just
about anything,'' explained Ralph. ``One thing we know for sure,
that for at least a thousand years, people who look at their own
times, and see dark things, return to this book as a kind of
mystical map.''
</P>
<P>
   Max pored over the text and some commentaries on it. In one
tradition, he learned, Christ would return to rule over the Earth
for 1,000 years. The Latin word for this was ``millennium.'' The
story of this return contains several subplots, including the
appearance of false prophets and antichrists, a time when Satan
would rule, a great battle between God and his enemies, and the
Last Judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great problem,'' explained Ralph, looking at Max over his
reading glasses, ``was how to calculate the time when Jesus would
return. There's evidence in the Gospels that the disciples thought
it would happen right away _ perhaps in their lifetime. But when it
didn't happen, it opened the door for people to reinterpret the
Scriptures for their own purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Max learned that the historical Jesus was actually born between
6 and 4 B.C. _ the first calendar makers goofed _ which means that
even if you were thinking about an era of 1,000 years, what would
be the starting point? The moment Christ was conceived? His birth?
His death and resurrection?
</P>
<P>
   Max read a gospel passage in which Jesus describes a time of
judgment when ``the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not
give her light, and the stars will fall from heavens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' said Max to Ralph, ``Jesus said that `this generation
will not pass away till all these things have been accomplished.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But listen to this next part,'' said Ralph pointing down the
page and reading aloud: ```But of that day and hour no one knows,
not even the angels of heaven.' Jesus is urging his followers not
to calculate the precise time, but to do good all the time, to be
prepared for their own deaths and the end of the world, which would
sneak up on them, `like a thief in the night.'''
</P>
<P>
   That led Max and Ralph to a discussion of the year 1000, the
only historical precedent for what the world was about to
experience. Ralph stood on tiptoes and pulled a thin volume off a
high shelf. ``This is the smoking gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The innocent book was called ``The Year 1000,'' written by a
French art historian named Henri Focillon. The text tried to settle
an ancient intellectual argument: Was there any hard evidence that
people living in 10th century Europe were obsessed by the terrors
of the last days? Did they think they were living in a time when
the end of the world was at hand?
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer was no. The historical records and artifacts
do not reveal a population in panic. Early in the next century,
after the millennium had passed, there was an intense period of
church building.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might suggest,'' said Ralph, ``that some people were
holding their breath, waiting a bit before undertaking any big
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were some notable exceptions, some 10th century
``lunatics,'' as Ralph called them, who were prophets of doom, who
saw signs of the last days everywhere. The most notable of these
was a radical French monk. ``His name was Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber wrote of a great meteor or comet he saw in the night sky
in the year 1000: ``It appeared in the month of September, not long
after nightfall, and remained visible for nearly three months. It
shone so brightly that its light seemed to fill the greater part of
the sky, then it vanished at cock's crow. What appears established
is that this phenomenon in the sky never appears to men without
being the sure sign of some mysterious and terrible event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think Glaber saw Halley's comet?'' asked Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Focus on the more important point, Max. We're not talking
ancient superstitions here. Remember what the Heaven's Gate cult
did upon the appearance of the Hale-Bopp comet. They followed to
the death a wacky old guy, who apparently had himself castrated,
who told these bright young people _ they were computer experts,
for God sakes, they had their own Web site! _ that there was a
spaceship waiting for them behind the comet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All they had to do to get there was to put plastic bags over
their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Read this,'' said Ralph and pointed to a passage in the text.
It said that the old French monk saw Satan everywhere, including
right beside his pillow, and that Satan was a ``small black monster
of human shape,'' and that ``Satan will soon be unleashed because
the thousand years have been completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Max leaned toward Ralph and whispered: ``Isn't it possible that
Glaber's daddy just named him Raoul?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And what? That just by coincidence he turned into Doomsday
Dick? Have you been able to track back on this guy? Do you know his
family's history?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a researcher at the Sun working full blast on it. So
far there's just a black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tell you, Max, this guy, whoever he is, adopted the name
of a man who, 1,000 years ago, was trying to scare people to death.
And I predict that this guy will do the same. Unless we stop him.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: What Father Ralph teaches Max about the Year
1000 leads Max to a startling conclusion: that Raoul Glaber is not
the real name of The Watcher leader.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   From a distance the Conquistador Hotel looked like a friendly
old soul, a small but elegant pink lady, born in the roaring 20s,
and preserved with several discreet face lifts. For 150 bucks,
tourists could buy the right to lay themselves out in the sun and
burn to a crisp _ ensuring, if they lived long enough, skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point of Max's Mustang, driving through
Gulfport toward the beach, it was hard to imagine anything more
malevolent happening here than, say, a post-prom booze party or
your standard adulterous affair. Even the president of the United
States once spent the night here. ``It sure is pink,'' he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But as Max drove closer and closer, the look of the place got
weirder and weirder. An attendant dressed in white stopped him at
the front gate and with friendly insistence pressed Max to learn
the nature of his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a guest at the hotel, Mr. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Timlin. No, but I've heard this was a special place, so I
thought I'd take a look for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man, he looked bleached blond, took Max's license and
recorded his tag number, slid a pass onto his dashboard, and
pointed to a place in the shade where he could park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enjoy the day, sir, and don't forget to stop into the Globe
Room. You'll enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Max saw lots of tourists, and a few Watcher acolytes dressed in
black, and many more initiates in blazing white regalia.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was warm, Max dressed in black for dramatic effect. As
he walked around he got the impression of a gilded cage, a
too-perfect community in which everything was Watched. It reminded
him of the resort in Wales that became the set of the 1960s British
TV series ``The Prisoner.'' He started whistling the theme song,
``All You Need Is Love.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent about two hours scouting the place, its little
restaurants, shops, tennis courts, boardwalk, cabanas, and down one
end a dock for boats. He could see Glaber's cigarette boat in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, behind the dunes, he could see a large round white mark
along the beach with concentric circles _ like a target _ or
perhaps a landing pad for hang gliders or even a small helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   What interested Max most was the absence of Watcher insignias or
other public displays that might indicate who owned the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   He took an elevator to the fifth floor, which opened to a
mahogany reception desk behind which sat an attractive young woman
dressed in a handsome white suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in white and I'm in black,'' said Max, still wearing
his sunglasses. She smiled at him blankly. ``The prince of parking
told me I should check out the Globe Room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please sign in here, sir, and then take those steps to the
right.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed her directions and stepped into a remarkable
setting. The room was the world, or to be more precise, a globe.
Inside, Max could see a map of the world rendered in magnificent
stained glass, lit from behind. You could only move across the room
on a thin walkway which served as the sphere's diameter.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to a spot that marked the center of the Earth. A
recorded voice came on. It was Raoul Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand beside you, watching our magnificent world. But what
shall become of it?'' What followed was five minutes of standard
Watcher fare _ apocalyptic doom softened by New Age mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked up and noticed a security video camera. He smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can turn back and walk out the way you came in,'' said
Glaber's soothing voice, ``or you can move forward beyond this
great world to something ever more glorious.''
</P>
<P>
   Max shrugged and walked 10 steps toward the door beyond him. It
opened automatically. The hall beyond had a great W on the wall.
This was The Watcher sanctum, busy with Watcher workers in white,
moving in and out of offices, or stretched out before banks of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Max was approached by a handsome black woman with her short hair
dyed blond. ``Dennis Rodman's sister,'' he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to The Watchers, sir. I'm Denise and you're ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Timlin. Max Timlin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome, Max. I'm here to watch over you so you can learn more
about The Watchers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'd like that. I'm a reporter and would like to interview
Raoul Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   Her expression darkened. ``Wait right here, sir. Don't move.''
She ran off.
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 seconds, Max was surround by burly blond attendants;
they resembled personal trainers in dress and physique, but Max
guessed they constituted the palace guard.
</P>
<P>
   An older man, his head shaved bald, approached him. ``I
understand you are a reporter, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct. I'm a free-lance writer and I'd like to
interview Mr. Glaber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider ourselves to be a very open organization. We
conduct much of our business in public.'' Max pulled out his
notebook and began scribbling. ``I'm afraid I'm going to have to
ask you to put that away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure. I'm not here to make a scene. I'm Max Timlin. And
your name sir is?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not required to give you my name, sir, but it's Monty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``May I write that down?''
</P>
<P>
   Monty shook his head sternly. ``Mr. Timlin, have you read
stories in the press about The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, of course, I've been doing research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen a story about us that didn't portray us as some
kind of kooky cult? We've been so badly used, we've had to ban
reporters from our premises. I'll give you all the literature
you'll need to understand who we are and what we stand ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, Mr. Full Monty, I don't take handouts from flacks, and
I'm not intimidated by blond Nazi boys dressed like ice-cream
vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to flex as one, but Monty held up a hand to restrain
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't I have you escorted from the premises _ and
roughly?''
</P>
<P>
   Max reached in his pocket and pulled out an index card and
clicked his pen and scribbled two quick sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's why. Be so kind as to show this to Mr. Glaber. I'll
wait here with your goons.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty took the card, read it, his face flushing with anger.
``Watch him,'' he said, and spun away. Max put his shades back on,
crossed his arms, and smiled.

   THE STORY SO FAR: Reporter Max Timlin is hired by editor Kate
Banks to investigate a doomsday cult called The Watchers and their
leader, Raoul Glaber. Max witnesses a Watcher initiation rite and
hears Glaber's dark view of the world and its future. Max seeks the
counsel of Father Ralph who becomes suspicious that Glaber is not
who he says he is. Police Chief Sam Lockhart persuades Max to enter
The Watcher's inner sanctum.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max's adrenaline had kicked in now, and his heart raced as he
was escorted through a glass automatic door, down a narrow hallway
and through two heavy wooden doors. A burly, grimacing attendant
pointed him through.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked up to see Raoul Glaber wearing a red University of
Alabama T-shirt, sitting at the far side of a round table and
holding Max's index card in one hand and flipping it with the
middle finger of his other.
</P>
<P>
   I KNOW YOUR NAME IS NOT RAOUL GLABER!
</P>
<P>
   SURRENDER DOROTHY.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very amusing, Mr. Timlin. That's an interesting name, Max
Timlin. Just add a few letters and you could become Maximum
Timeline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You seem fascinated with names, Mr. Glaber, and with time. Or
shall I call you by your real name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know my real name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, no. But I do know that Raoul Glaber was a
10th-century French monk who saw Satan standing by his pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be so harsh on visionaries, sir. I believe in Satan _
how can you look at the world and not _ but I don't see him as an
ugly little gremlin. I think that he takes a much more reassuring
human form, like yours, for instance, ... or mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is your real name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please call me William, if you like, William Miller. How's
that for a classic American name. Don't you love those double l's
in the middle? Almost like the Latin word for one thousand: mille.
I love beautiful and interesting names. But I've told you that.''
</P>
<P>
   He reached for a button near his chair. Max flinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, not to worry, sir, there is no shark pool under your
feet.'' A side door opened. Max was not prepared for the sight of
Angela Powers (though he had her in mind when he wrote ```Surrender
Dorothy'').
</P>
<P>
   She, too, was dressed in red: tank top, soccer shorts, and
thongs. She padded gracefully into the room, holding a tray with
glasses of cold iced tea and some ginger snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Timlin. This is Angela Powers, but I assume you already
know that. Isn't that a wondrous name _ the power of angels _ she
is my helper and my archangel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pleasure to meet you _ please, help yourself,'' said
Angela to Max. ``Aren't you broiling in that black suit? You look
like one of the Blues Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber or Miller or Whoever came around the big table and took a
seat with Max and Angela near a window overlooking the water.
</P>
<P>
   Glaber took some hard swallows of tea. ``I like it Southern
style,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you not from the South?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' some impatience passed through the charm. ``I'm from the
West. And I don't talk to the press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And why not? Some publicity might gain you more followers.
Isn't it natural that, given your message, people would turn their
interest toward you as we approach the millennium?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, come now, Mr. Timlin,'' the voice came from Angela Powers.
It was deep for a young woman, and filled with character and
intelligence. ``The interest of the press is not in informing or
enlightening, no matter what you say. It is to appeal to the
largest and the lowest audience. Is any other institution more
responsible for the decline in standards, for cynicism about the
country, for spreading hopelessness, for fear of crime, for a
picture of the world that debases anything noble?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, Ms. Powers, don't The Watchers espouse a philosophy that
is the ultimate pessimism, that the world as we know it will
disappear?''
</P>
<P>
   ``God is no magician, Mr. Timlin. He's not into vanishing acts.
We see the world as it is. You see it as better than it is _ and
then portray it as worse than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You fascinate me, Ms. Powers.'' Max was sweating profusely.
Why had he worn this darn black suit? And why did he choose a chair
in the direct sunlight? He finished his tea, and held the frosty
glass to his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a good writer, Mr. Timlin?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if you listen to my old editors. But I am fast. I think
for reporters fast is better than good. Are you a writer, Ms.
Powers? You are very well spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber smiled at the compliment to Angela like a proud parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about becoming a writer, but I saw what it did to my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mother's a writer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was. But she's an editor now. Mr. Timlin, are you all
right? You look a little pale. Can I get you some more tea?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your ... mother?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, perhaps you know her. Her name is Kate Banks.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have been this revelation that unsettled him because the
image of her, the beautiful image, suddenly went out of focus.
There were two magnificent angels in red _ no there were three, and
then someone must have turned the lights out, or closed the blinds,
because wasn't it just daylight _ a moment ago _ or maybe an
eclipse of the sun _ or maybe this room was a revolving bar at
night _ spinning, darker and ... darker.

revelation render him unconscious.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Maybe there had been an eclipse, or maybe Max had fallen asleep,
because when he awoke the sky was still dark, but now a light rain
splattered across his face. He wiped it with his hand and clumsily
sat up.
</P>
<P>
   He looked around to get his bearings and found himself in the
back seat of his Mustang with the top down, and yes it was raining
and his head hurt and his leg hurt, too.
</P>
<P>
   This must be what a migraine felt like: a pain both dull and
sharp, pressing a thousand pounds against the side of his skull.
But he had never had a migraine before.
</P>
<P>
   His memory came back slowly now and then snapped into focus: the
visit to the pink hotel, the incursion into enemy territory, a cool
drink with Raoul Glaber and Angela Powers. The drink.
</P>
<P>
   He had been drugged, carted to his car, driven to an empty spot
on Cosmos Key, and left there for how long? Hours? His face felt
sunburned. This was the punishment for his arrogance. But at least
he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at the dashboard. ``They left the keys,'' he said
aloud to no one. ``My head hurts! And my leg!''
</P>
<P>
   Max drove slowly back to the condo, gripping the wheel and
blinking his eyes. He let himself in, clicked on the lights, and
looked around suspiciously. He blamed himself for letting down his
guard against Glaber _ not Glaber, but William Miller _ and what
had Angela Powers said to him, just before the eclipse? Now he
remembered. He picked up the phone and dialed the home number of
his researcher, Violet Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet, this is Max.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What time Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, Violet, it's 1 a.m. I've had a bad day. Violet, I
talked to Glaber today. Got him to admit his real name was William
Miller. But I don't believe it. Look up that name. Check not only
personal and legal stuff _ it's a common name _ but look at
historical references _ check the damn World Book Encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, you woke me up to tell me to look something up in the
encyclopedia?'' She was groggy, but laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick with me, Violet. He named himself after one doomsday
guy. Let's see if he picked another. One more thing. Do you know
much about Kate Banks? I mean her personal life?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this about, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick with me, Violet. Does she have a daughter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, one daughter. Cassandra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is her middle name Angela?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kate Banks was married, right. Her husband died. What was his
name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael, I think, Michael Powers. Max, are you all right?
Please. Do you want me to come over?''
</P>
<P>
   Her concern made Max feel guilty that he had awakened her. There
was something special about her, he had discovered. He had met
highly intelligent people before. And compassionate ones. But never
in quite the combination that Violet offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A megabyte mind,'' Kate had said of her, ``and a heart of
gold.'' Sherry offered her own appreciation of Violet's character:
``She's got the hardware and the software.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, are you hurt? I'll come over if you need me to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Violet. You are a kind person. I'm sorry I woke you
up. It could have waited until tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me what happened, Max.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did. Detail by detail in chronological order. It helped
him clear his memory, make sense of the day, and rehearse the long
memo he would write to himself tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, and one more thing, Violet. He says he's from the West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``William Miller. From the West. Well that narrows it down.''
Max found Violet's laugh comforting.
</P>
<P>
   Max hung up. He stripped quickly, leaving his clothes in a pile
on the tile floor. He turned on the water in the shower until it
steamed up the room. The water hit his face _ he was sunburned _
just what a guy with skin cancer needed. But in a minute it felt
great, down into his muscles to the bone, steaming the pain and
poison from his body.
</P>
<P>
   Max turned to let the water hit his back. He let out a howl. As
the water sprayed the top of his leg, it stung like a horde of red
ants. ``What the ...?''
</P>
<P>
   He turned off the shower and stepped out onto the floor. A
full-length mirror on the back of the door was steamed up. He wiped
his hand across it and turned his body. And there it was. On his
right hip. A tattoo. The letter ``W.'' Sign of The Watchers.

<P>
   Sam Lockhart, police chief, had seen a lot in his day, but
nothing quite like this. A man stood in front of his desk, his
pants around his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my reward for doing your dirty work,'' said Max
Timlin. ``The letter `W' tattooed on my rear end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be laughing if it weren't for this.'' Sam slid an
investigative file across his desk. It contained autopsy photos,
and they were gruesome _ a young man and woman so broken apart they
look like they had imploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens after you've jumped off the Skyway
Bridge, and flown like a birdie 200 feet or so, and hit the water,
which is like concrete from that height. They were probably in the
water for a couple of days before they washed up.''

   ``White male and female. Probably a suicide pact. Drugs in the
system. Speed _ the kind of stuff that makes you aggressive and
paranoid. And check out this little detail.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief slid another photo across the desk. A close up showed
that each victim had the letter ``W'' tattooed above an ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to hate the look of that tattoo, so what say,
when this is over, the department springs to laser your sorry ass
and remove that nasty thing and all that it stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think it stands for, Sam?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe nothin' but a bunch of folks who like to dress up in
white for a New Year's Eve party. But my responsibility is to be
suspicious and stay that way. I don't know what Glaber is watchin'
for _ but I'm watchin' him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is he capable of? That's what I can't figure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just assume he could blow up a federal building, or burn
down his hotel with everyone in it, or hold a big party at the Dome
and make everyone drink poisoned lemonade, or that he might blow up
a 747, or car-bomb an embassy in Africa. Now that the Commies are
all gone, these nuts are turning their anger against their own
countries _ even their own people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember how I thought the Oklahoma City bombing was caused
by terrorists from the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And, surprise, it turned to be some pasty lookin' white boy
with a grudge against his own country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But how vulnerable are we here? We're just a quiet little city
in West Florida. The land of snowbirds and retirees and tourists.
The city of the newly wed and nearly dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got no imagination, Max. You want doomsday scenarios.
They could poison the water supply. Or hijack nerve gas or
biological weapons. They could sabotage our Air Force base _ which
would appeal to fellow terrorists around the globe since we have a
special strike force stationed in Tampa. On any given day, how many
people are in one of our amusement parks? What's the Big Mouse
gonna do, let Goofy carry an Uzi?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I write this story _ if I write it _ I'm gonna put all
that stuff in it _ make you sound a lot smarter than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean if you write it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well I may not have a job after I tell my boss what I think of
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Max drove now as fast as the Mustang would carry him across town
to the offices of the Florida Sun, a 10-story marble tower
overlooking Tampa Bay, housing Florida's best and biggest
newspaper. Max had always wanted to work there. And now he did _
sort of.
</P>
<P>
   He strode briskly through the lobby and right past the security
guard, who was looking down reading the paper, and into the
elevator. A large woman eating a doughnut told him Kate Banks'
office was on the ninth floor. He walked in through a cluster of
secretaries, ignored their questions, and strode into Kate's
office. She looked up from her desk and sensed right away that Max
had learned the truth. In fact, she had hoped he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela Powers is not her real name,'' said Kate. ``It's
Cassandra Powers. Cassie. Powers was my husband's last name, but
this Glaber guy got off on the idea of `angelic powers,' and she
must have gone along for the ride. I've been desperate about her,
Max. This girl has been messed up since her father's death. Please.
Don't walk out on this. I couldn't bring myself to tell you about
her and make you think I was hiring you as some kind of private
eye. I'm up to my ears with conflicts. How could my own paper cover
this when my daughter's so involved?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about full disclosure _ and then trusting your people to
do the right thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never been a parent, Max. You saw my daughter, didn't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she spiked my ice tea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean in the water, without her clothes, with Glaber and the
others looking on.'' Max nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sherry showed me those photos, I turned to ice. I've lost
my husband. I'm afraid of losing my daughter. And now I don't want
to lose you, at least as a dance partner. At least as a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Kate. I could use a pal. But one who, from now on, tells
me the whole truth. I know you've been hurting for your daughter,
so let's just say that I'll stay on the story ...,'' he dropped his
pants to show her the tattoo, `` ... to the bitter end.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate picked up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell, this is Kate. Please assemble the staff for a
meeting. I'll be down in an hour. There's something I want to tell
them, and someone I want them to meet.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max shows Sam Lockhart his Watcher tattoo and
gets a lecture on the potential dangers of a doomsday cult. Max
then confronts Kate about her daughter, but promises to stay on the
story.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   A great thing happened to Max. His new friend Evie Hamilton
called him. She was going to visit her daughter in Santa Barbara,
Calif. Would Max like to take care of Daisy the dog for a week or
so? ``Of all her visitors, she liked you the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Daisy loved the beach, but shied away from the water. She walked
along the sand beside Max with a slight limp, which disappeared
when she broke into a jog. She was so attentive and so pleased to
be out, sniffing dead fish and clumps of seaweed, that Max didn't
bother with a leash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, there are no dogs allowed on the beach. We can't make the
sign any bigger. Are you a German tourist who can't read English?''
The harsh words came from a tall beach cop with a mean sneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I read the sign. And I ignored it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't any ordinary dog, copper.'' Max did a bad imitation
of Edward G. Robinson. The cop looked at him in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Max said in his own voice, ``This is Daisy _ the dog that
survived the fall from the Skyway Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The cop's features changed instantly. In a second he squatted to
pat Daisy's head, and apologized to Max, and walked with them down
the beach, explaining to sunbathers that they were in the presence
of royalty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they returned to the condo, Daisy collapsed on the
cool tile, sated with exercise, attention and affection.
</P>
<P>
   A knock at the door announced the arrival of Violet Rose,
looking smashing in a purple sun dress and strappy sandals. Her
long black hair was pulled into a ponytail, drawn neatly through
the back of a St. Pete Rays baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   She flashed him a bright smile, her face glowed, which could
mean two things at the same time: She was glad to see Max, and her
research had discovered something important. She arrived with a
chew toy for Daisy, some Chinese takeout for her and Max, and a
file under her arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were right, Max, about the name William Miller _ if that
is Glaber's real name, it's another weird coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The photocopies in Violet's file revealed that William Miller
was the most famous American doomsday prophet of the 19th century.
He claimed 100,000 followers. From his reading of the Bible, Miller
predicted that the Second Coming would occur on Oct. 22, 1844.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, they waited and waited and the day came, and it
went, and the Millerites, what was left of them, referred to that
time as `The Great Disappointment.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a few of those in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So have I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to try out the hot tub? Kate's got some stuff out
there you can wear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can Daisy join us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She seems a little shy of water right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daisy surprised them, hopping right in and splashing around
a minute and hopping out and shaking hard, sending a healthy spray
over Max and Violet.
</P>
<P>
   Max told her now about the Watcher tattoo, but did not show it
to her, and she did not ask to see it. He told her that Sam
Lockhart, feeling a little guilty about what had happened to Max,
had the entire police investigative file on The Watchers
photocopied for Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you take it, Violet, and have another copy made for
yourself? Pay special attention to Glaber. I have a hunch that if
we can find out who he is, even a little something about his
background, some big mystery will be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, there are lots of ways to track someone's background
online. You know that. It helps, of course, to have a real name or
date of birth or Social Security number. But I'll start with a
cross check of the names Glaber and Miller and see what turns up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get this guy's real name, I'll buy you a dozen roses _
violet roses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll settle for a foot massage. Right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Max granted her wish, a job that took a surprising length of
time. Each foot demanded careful attention. This was no hard labor,
he decided early on, but work that still commanded his best effort,
which meant not ignoring the Achilles tendon stretching up to a
firm but slender calf, and pressing his thumb hard up into the
arch, so that Violet closed her eyes and tilted back her head and
moaned and told him that it hurt but not to stop, and then pulling
on the dainty toes until they popped and making sure not to forget
to slide his fingers through the slips of skin between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about a kiss?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we get Daisy to join us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not this time.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max takes care of Daisy the dog, then receives
a visit from Violet Rose, who is tracking down the real identity of
Raoul Glaber. A foot rub leads to something more.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max Timlin woke up with a warm breath on his neck and rolled
over to see Daisy the dog on the next pillow. He let out a laugh
that startled Daisy from her sweet doggie dreams. Max offered her a
good morning ear rub and took a licking in return.
</P>
<P>
   This display of affection caused him to reflect on his
surprising good fortune with women, not a condition, after two
divorces, that he was used to.
</P>
<P>
   He got up and looked into the mirror and could not imagine what
anyone might see in him. A once athletic body had gone to seed.
Thinning blondish hair was down to a cluster of unruly stalks. He
had random scars from skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's invisible, he mused, or my after-shave. Kate Banks
was more attentive and earnest than ever before, but Max could look
into her dark brown eyes and see, clearly circumscribed, the
difference between friendship and love. That was fine with him. He
needed her passion and intelligence in mounting the investigation
against The Watchers. And she clearly needed him, at least for her
daughter's sake.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed his meetings with Sherry Darling, who continued
surreptitious photographing of The Watchers, not only around the
Conquistador Hotel, but also around the Star Dome, where
preparations were under way for an international gathering of
Watchers, now just a fortnight away. Sherry had become a great
buddy, a kindred spirit, a true partner to Max.
</P>
<P>
   And now came the delicious surprise of one Miss Violet Rose, who
had visited him for evening walks on the beach, each night for the
last five nights. Her purported mission was to fill him in on the
day's search. Along with gathering string on Glaber's background,
Violet was vacuuming the Internet landscape on news of the upcoming
Watchers event, billed as ``The New Awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, Violet taught Max some yoga stretching
exercises, which he found relaxing, cooked a meal for him, and
grabbed his hand during their sunset strolls.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, came the news from Evie Hamilton in California
that she would extend her visit to her daughter for a while. Max
assured her that Daisy would be in good hands until her return.
</P>
<P>
   The week had brought one disturbing development. Two more
Watchers were found floating face down in Tampa Bay. The couple _
another man and woman _ lacked the identifying tattoos, but they
were clean cut and dressed in white.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Sam Lockhart had sent his investigative unit into the
Conquistador Hotel, but the detective turned up little to indicate
why two healthy young people _ just before the New Awakening _
would choose to sleep with the fishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We presume they jumped,'' Sam told Max, ``except for one
little detail. There was no abandoned vehicle near the top of the
Skyway. How the hell did they get up there? Take a little stroll?
Or did someone give them a lift? And maybe a little push?''
</P>
<P>
   Max was writing furiously now every day, sometimes as much as
5,000 words or more. Kate had arranged a small team to cover the
daily activities of The Watchers. It was agreed that Max would
write the blockbuster, which would appear after the first of the
year, or the first of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The world was a month away from the biggest New Year's Eve party
of all time, and you could not turn on TV without seeing Dick Clark
hyping the annual Times Square event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join us for The Biggest Ball of All,'' he said, still looking
like the world's oldest teen-ager. And you couldn't turn on the
radio without hearing Prince or the Artist Formerly Known As _
heck, he had more names than Glaber _ singing ``1999'': ``Two
thousand zero zero, party over, oops, out of time ... We're gonna
party like it's 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Max sang along to the radio as he drove the Mustang toward the
St. Pete Municipal Airport, a flying club for rich people, really,
but convenient for journalists.
</P>
<P>
   There he met Sherry and a pilot. They boarded a helicopter _ Max
hated helicopters and high places _ but in he went after a
reassuring hug from Sherry. They circled the beautiful waterfront
district, and shot across the city, hovering over the roof of the
amazing Star Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where The Watchers will be gathering,'' said Sherry.
``This is the site for the New Awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   The great white roof was a structural marvel: six acres of
strong but flexible fiberglass coated with Teflon, translucent to
affect the light in the stadium, supported by 180 miles of cables
connected by struts, yet puffy, like the world's largest throw
pillow.
</P>
<P>
   The chopper banked and cut south. Max's heart raced and his
mouth went dry and he gripped his seat and closed his eyes.
Meanwhile, Sherry was gabbing and pointing and leaning out to shoot
images of the Skyway.
</P>
<P>
   Max found the courage to look down at another engineering marvel
_ a gorgeous bridge, its golden cables rising to the heavens in two
steeples, as if to sanctify the blue-green marriage of sky above
and water below.
</P>
<P>
   But he could never view this without thinking of the destruction
of the old bridge, and the 35 people in cars and a bus who had gone
off the end to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about bridges?'' he wondered aloud. He knew many
people had nightmares about bridges. He had interviewed people who
could not drive across the Skyway themselves. They needed friends,
or chauffeurs, or Valium to get them across.
</P>
<P>
   Then he thought of those who had made their way to the top, who
had looked down at this beauty, only to feel betrayed by it and the
world. Then it came to him in a flash of images. Maybe the drowned
Watchers hadn't jumped. Maybe they hadn't been driven to the top
and pushed over. Maybe they had been flown over and dropped from
the sky.

THE OTHER SCREEN THAT NEEDS MONITORING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement last
summer about children and the media, the &UR;  &LR; press glommed onto the
most sensational item, a recommendation that children under 2 not
watch TV. What went virtually unnoticed, however, was equally
important: Children's bedrooms should be media-free.
</P>
<P>
   Not just no TV, but also no computers. Not just for children
under 2, but for children of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents already know not to put a TV in a child's room. But
many readers tell me they purposefully put the computer there,
thinking it opens the door to the child's personal technological
age. All it opens the door to is problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting the computer in a public room is the single most
important thing parents can do,'' says educational psychologist
Jane Healy, who has spent 35 years studying &UR;  &LR; how children learn.
</P>
<P>
   Public placement enables parents to monitor not only the time a
child spends at a terminal but also how he sits when he's there and
what's on the screen. This is important at all developmental
stages:
</P>
<P>
   Toddlers and preschoolers. Although it didn't say so explicitly,
the TV ban for 2-year-olds was intended to extend to computers,
says Children's Hospital adolescent physician Michael Rich,
co-author of the academy position paper. Neither he nor Healy has
anything kind to say about lapware, the new software for infants
that is getting good write-ups in some of the parenting press.
Indeed, Healy calls software for infants ``preposterous.'' Her
newest book, ``Failure to Connect: How Computers Affect Our
Children's Minds and What We Can Do About It'' (Touchstone), is the
most comprehensive look so far at how computers can harm cognitive,
social, and emotional growth.
</P>
<P>
   The later the better
</P>
<P>
   Researchers and clinicians say the longer we wait to put kids on
computers, the better. Psychologist Maressa Hecht Orzack, a
specialist on computer addiction, says 5 is plenty young; Healy
recommends 7, an age parents may consider shockingly old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Educators have begun to realize that computers in and of
themselves are not necessarily a good thing, but parents are slower
in getting that message,'' Healy says. ``Unless there's a specific
task to be done _ downloading a picture with you, dictating a
thank-you note to you _ they shouldn't be on.''
</P>
<P>
   Time spent on the computer is time away from the primary task of
early childhood: socialization. Even if a 4-year-old is playing a
computer game with you _ and note that Healy's exhortation is for a
child to download with you or dictate to you _ the social
interaction is extremely limited. And even if a young child is on
your lap, Orzack worries. ``Nobody knows how it changes brain
connections or what it does to a kid's sense of reality to connect
to an image rather than a person,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   School-age. This is typically when parents scoop up so-called
educational software, a.k.a. skill &AMP; drill, to give a child an edge
in math or reading. In fact, at this age it is more likely to
detract from learning. For evidence, Healy points to an increase in
the reporting of learning problems at early ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children learn best from hands-on experience,'' says educator
Bob McCannon, director of the New Mexico Media Literacy Project.
``Their brains grow in relation to the quality of the stimuli
coming in through the senses. When the computer provides the input,
the ability to think things up in your own mind is compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   A veneer of learning
</P>
<P>
   Healy says the problem is with the software. ``The people who
create it know how to make it glitzy so it appeals to kids, and
they paste a veneer of learning on it so it appeals to parents. But
they don't understand what motivates a young child to learn,'' she
says. She tells parents to avoid programming where children receive
rewards for trivial amounts of work. ``It erodes their internal
motivation: `Why should I choose a harder problem? It'll just take
me longer to get to the reward.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This affects classroom learning because it shortens attention
spans. Teachers report that children are more likely to give up
rather than work harder when faced with a challenge. ``They're
programmed for immediate gratification,'' says Healy.
</P>
<P>
   There are dangers to physical health _ ``Most kids would rather
be on the computer than outside getting exercise,'' McCannon says _
and dangers of addiction, even to 8-year-olds, says Orzack, founder
and coordinator of the computer addiction service at McLean
Hospital in Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Young children can get hooked on all kinds of computer games,
from Pokemon to SimCity. ``If you try to talk to your child while
he's playing a hand-held computer game and you can't get his
attention; if the game comes at the expense of play with friends;
if homework or chores are getting squeezed; you're looking at a
computer addiction,'' Orzack says.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's advice is to set limits on how much and when computers
are used. ``It's a matter of prioritization,'' he says. ``After
homework, after family time, after friends, sports, exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Peer pressure
</P>
<P>
   Middle-school age. In about fifth grade, the need for peer
approval fuels children's behavior, from what they wear to what
they say. If all her friends are doing chat rooms after school, you
can be sure your child will want to, too, says occupational
therapist and ergonomist Karen Jacobs of Boston University, who
teaches about computing at West Middle School in Andover.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, there are benefits at this age from chat rooms.
``They can be a b self-esteem for kids who don't fit in, who
feel awkward or uncomfortable for any reason,'' says Jacobs. She is
president of the American Occupational Therapy Association, which
has targeted middle-school age children for a national healthy
computing initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But the downside can be treacherously slippery, as parents in
Townsend discovered last week.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-school students at Hawthorne Brook School who had logged
into a chat room were terrorized allegedly by a teenager in
Missouri who gained access to their chat and directed children to
pornographic sites. Last Friday, police say, he threatened to blow
up the school. Police were able to track the teen to his home and
charged him with disseminating child pornography and threatening to
commit assault.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, dangers like these so far are extreme, but Rich says
it's not unusual for children to be unaware that there can be
``lurkers'' _ people who hang out in chat rooms and get information
but never talk _ or to realize that people in a chat room are not
always who they say they are. He says even buddy chats, where
participants invite people they know to join, are only slightly
safer. There also have been many reported cases of chats leading
children to real-life meetings and dangerous activities. More
typically, what parents need to know, however, is how seductive
chats are. ``Kids get sucked in and neglect other parts of their
life,'' Rich says.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs's concern is that a lot of what goes on in a chat room is
putting down of peers. ``It can be hurtful and destructive,
especially because kids can't read the nuances that might be more
obvious in spoken conversation,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Potential for injury
</P>
<P>
   Because preteens spend more time on the computer than any other
age, they are at greatest risk for muscle and skeletal problems.
She spends a good chunk of class time on ergonomics. ``Children
sharing chairs and keyboards with adults at home need to readjust
to avoid injury,'' she says. She recommends a backpack as a
footrest, a jacket rolled up for back support, yellow pages under
the monitor and stretches every 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Townsend case, coupled with all the other risks, offers
frighteningly concrete proof why computers need to be in public
spaces where parents can monitor activities. Rich says his
children, 13 and 11, are only allowed on the Internet for school
research and if an adult is with them. ``With some of the search
engines,'' he says, ``you can put in something innocuous and come
out with something bizarre or pornographic.'' He says chat rooms
can work in moderation if parents negotiate rules and limits around
them, for instance, that they are a reward, not an entitlement, and
come after homework, dinner, chores, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Teenage. Instant gratification, a feeling of belonging, and the
excitement of risk-taking (for hacking, for being in sites you know
you shouldn't be in) are what motivates teens, who are most at risk
for addiction. ``If you're bringing him dinner into the computer
room, you're an enabler,'' says Orzack. Other tips that your teen
is in trouble: slipping grades, truancy, falling asleep in class,
irritability, missed meals, and, if the computer is in his room,
hours spent behind a closed door. Sites that are most addictive are
multi-user domain game sites (MUDs) where a user takes on an
identity that some teens have trouble shaking off; teenage chat
rooms; Internet games such as Everquest and Quake; hacking and
pornography. Blocking software will not deter a teen who wants to
find whatever he wants, says Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   Parental involvement
</P>
<P>
   As simple as it sounds, the best antidote to teen addiction is
constant conversation about computer use. But don't wait until your
child is 15, says Orzack. Begin in the elementary years: ``Show an
interest in their computer use: `Show me your favorite sites. Can I
sit with you while you do a chat, just to see what it's like?' ''
Her favorite question to a teen is, ``When you open your computer,
what do you expect to find?'' Answers that tip off trouble include:
``a place where I belong,'' ``a place to make money,'' ``a place
for excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer use with older children is largely an issue of values,
says Jacobs. ``He knows I trust him to do his work first,'' she
says of her son. ``I also know there are times when that trust gets
abused. Is it a problem? No so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all children find the computer so enticing, of course.
Rich's daughter, Desta, 13, finds chat rooms boring. ``I'd much
rather talk on the phone to a real person,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   CYBER SUGGESTIONS FOR PARENTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Be sure that a child of any age knows that if he's in an
on-line site where he feels uncomfortable and he can't seem to
exit, he can just turn off the computer.
</P>
<P>
   --The American Occupational Therapy Association has a free
screen saver that offers computer posture tips for children.
Download it at http://www.aota.org.
</P>
<P>
   --More than an hour a day playing on the computer is considered
excessive.
</P>
<P>
   --Your computer use is a powerful model and predictor of your
child's.
</P>
<P>
   --Teens who get caught up in risky computer activity are
frequently very smart but bored and marginalized at school. For
them, the computer provides positive, immediate gratification.
</P>
<P>
   --If you think your child of any age is addicted to any on-line
behavior, seek professional guidance.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Two Watchers are found floating in Tampa Bay.
Max ponders if they jumped off the Skyway Bridge, or were pushed?
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by Max, the police began an inquiry into whether the
dead Watchers could have been dropped from a plane or helicopter to
make it look like a suicide leap off the Skyway Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injuries on these folks were unusually devastating,'' Sam
reported to Max over the telephone. ``The medical examiner says the
injuries are consistent with a drop of more than 200 feet _ but so
many things can affect this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any comment from Glaber?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Through a spokesman he said that young people, even Watchers,
killing themselves was a horrible thing, and a clear sign of a
troubled world tumbling toward its end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What an ass----.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says The Watchers don't own a plane or helicopter. Only
boats, vans and cars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I saw something that could be a landing pad for a
helicopter _ out beyond the dunes near the Conquistador.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll check it out. What are you up to?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm writing like crazy, but today I'm going to call on a
friend, so I can get into the Star Dome and view the New Awakening
with my own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Max found himself on the southern tip of St.
Petersburg, in a neighborhood called Pinellas Point, where great
oak trees hung shade over lovely wide streets that for decades had
been paved with pink concrete. Most people called this place ``The
Pink Streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Max's face was as pink as the streets. He was jogging _ feeling
flabby and out of breath _ next to a tall, young black man, who
happened to be one of Florida's most beloved athletes, James
``Choirboy'' Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had grown up in St. Pete, one of the nation's only
five-sport athletes and an honors student at Lakewood High. At
6-foot-4, both nimble and strong, James played quarterback, point
guard and center field. He ran track. And he once joined the soccer
team to step in for an injured goalkeeper. He went to Florida
State, where he decided to concentrate on baseball. He was now in
his second season playing with the St. Pete Pelicans.
</P>
<P>
   Max had written about him after James' father was murdered in a
convenience-store robbery. The father, Charles Jones, was a great
preacher and pastor _ earning his son the nickname ``Choirboy'' _
and his death stunned the community.
</P>
<P>
   In his father's honor, James had committed half of his huge
salary to charitable work. He built houses for the working poor,
sponsored the construction of athletic fields in the poorest
neighborhoods, purchased books for a new library branch and could
often be seen on Sunday mornings at local churches, working with
pastors on their most pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you want me to sneak you into the Dome for this Awakening
event. Don't you know I'm the Choirboy. I'm not exactly the sneaky
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``James, I didn't know where else to turn. You know everybody in
that place _ and The Watchers are barring the press, and they know
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max. I like you, my friend. The story you wrote made my mother
cry her heart out over my father _ but in a good way. So I'll help
you. But, to ease my Choirboy conscience, I must impose two
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Name them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you have to come with me to church early Sunday
morning. Then for the rest of the day, you have to help me build a
house. Then, if you can still stand up _ by the way, you are way
out of shape _ we'll go to the Dome.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday afternoon, every muscle in Max's body, including
some he didn't know he had, ached. Seven hours of bending, lifting,
hammering, lifting, bending, had taken their toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I've worked like that, James. I
think I remember now why I became a writer. No heavy lifting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Words can be heavy, very heavy. But this is good for your
body, Max, and your soul. I can see that God ain't done with you
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   They hugged and Max remembered that Father Ralph had said the
same thing, using almost the same words.
</P>
<P>
   It was no trouble for James to get into the Dome, even on a
night when the building was closed to the public. They trusted him
with his own key. ``Max, you came to church with me. You helped me
build a house.''
</P>
<P>
   They were standing at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm gonna add one more stipulation. I've got a great idea
for how you can get in here, see everything you need to see and
still not be seen by a single Watcher. But it's gonna cost you.''
</P>
<P>
   Max could see mischief in the eyes of the Choirboy. ``Max,
you've got to beat me in a race around the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean I run and you crawl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, easier. You start at second base and I'll start out at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Max lost. His legs, tight from the day's work, slid out from
under him rounding third base, and by the time he recovered, he
could hear the fastest man in baseball whooshing by him. ``You've
got to promise you'll write about this, Max. Not now. But someday,
when I enter the Hall of Fame.'' Coming from the Choirboy, it did
not sound like bragging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll write your life story, James Choirboy Jones. I've never
met an athlete _ a man _ like you. Now where are you going to hide
me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Max lifted his eyes from the tip of his friend's finger, up, up,
up, till his head was bent back, staring at a thin catwalk leading
to a circular bank of huge speakers. Up, up, up, more than 250 feet
to the domed roof of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up there?''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max makes plans to sneak into the huge Watcher
convention, with the help of James ``Choirboy'' Jones, a great
athlete and champion of social justice.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   To get Max to the top of the Dome would require three things: a
guide, a rehearsal and a counter-phobic energy he did not believe
he possessed. James Choirboy Jones hooked Max up with the Dome's
master sound engineer, a short, silver-haired Italian man named
Rocky Como. From a distance, Rocky was the spitting image of Father
Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ain't the first guy to say so,'' said the man known as The
Rock. ``In fact I know the Good Father. If you are friends with the
Good Father and the Choirboy, maybe I can be your friend some day,
cause you got great taste in friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocky, I'm afraid of heights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to worry. You don't look down. You follow me and stare
right into the middle of my back. And breathe nice and steady.
Don't forget to breathe, or you'll die. But first you wear this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocky gave him a bright orange jump suit that said Star Dome
Sound on the back. It was a little big for Max, but he found it
light and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   He stared up at the Dome roof. He saw four concentric circles _
metal catwalks that allowed workmen access to different parts of
the roof. The outer ring was the lowest, circling most of the
inside of the stadium. Only a few hitters could reach that catwalk.
The next ring in was also a home run, requiring a long, high fly to
reach it. The next ring in was higher still. A high pop-up could
reach it, but not often. The ball was in play.
</P>
<P>
   And then at the center, like the bull's eye in a target, was the
smallest and highest circle, home of the Dome's speaker system. A
person could hide behind those speakers, invisible to the crowd
below.
</P>
<P>
   Each circle was connected to the next by a thin metal gangplank
_ with protective sides _ acting as a kind of ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll come in through the service entrance, wearing that
gear. If anyone stops you, have them call me. I'll clear you.
You'll take Service Elevator 11 _ that's this one _ and it will
take you to the first catwalk. From that point on, it's a piece of
pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The march that followed looked like a dog trying to follow a cat
across a circus tight rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow down, Rocky. Take it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Max gripped the hand rails on the first ramp so tight it gave
him blisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stare at my back,'' Rocky said, over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, they had reached the final ramp, steeper
than the others, but shorter in distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't look down!'' But Max couldn't help it. Step, step ...
step ... step ... step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, you got here. One more step. Look up.''
</P>
<P>
   And there he was, but his heart raced like a fast ball, a
burning sweat stung his eyes and soaked through his clothes all the
way through the jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, that ain't so hard,'' said Rocky, pointing to a safe
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Max regained his breath and composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perfect, Rocky. I'll be able to see everything. But
just one thing? How do I get down?''
</P>
<P>
   That night Max Timlin had a dream, and it was a doozy. It began
with the sound of a helicopter: tucka tucka tucka tucka tucka, and
he was the only passenger, but no one was at the controls. He was
sitting next to an open door, gaping wide, and the copter _ it was
black _ circled and circled over the Star Dome, till Max was dizzy
from the motion.
</P>
<P>
   An unseen hand pushed him in the back and he tumbled over, down,
down, head first, but then upright, waving his arms. He looked down
to see the great white roof of the Dome, like a lovely marshmallow
pie.
</P>
<P>
   He would be safe, he thought. But his body sliced like a hot
knife through the marshmallow, through layers of roof, and into the
stadium where he grasped at air until his hands locked on a piece
of metal, the third catwalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now batting for the Pelicans, James Choirboy JONES!'' But Max,
facing home plate could see it wasn't the Choirboy, but Glaber _
only huge _ on steroids.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch. The crack of the bat _ deafening _ and a shot like a
missile, the ball hit so hard it traced a path in the air, coming
at him, at him, hitting his right hand with the force of a grenade
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging by one hand now, and all the fans dressed in white
cheering as Glaber rounded the bases, the fans looking up at him
and laughing and pointing and chanting his name in derision:
``Max-well, Max-well.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing the grasp now and falling down, down, and gazing down, in
this dream, he saw not the green of the outfield turf, but the
night-black waters below the Skyway Bridge.

   THE STORY SO FAR: Reporter Max Timlin is hired by editor Kate
Banks to investigate a doomsday cult called The Watchers and
succeeds at penetrating their inner sanctum. Max confronts The
Watcher leader, Raoul Glaber. Max suspects that is not his real
name. He then learns that Glaber's protege, the beautiful Angela
Powers, is really the daughter of Kate Banks. Two Watchers are
found floating in the sea, suspected suicides. Violet helps Max
track down Glaber's real identity and earns his affection. Max
overcomes his fear of heights to spy on The Watcher's convention at
the domed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The crow's nest behind the speakers turned out to be the perfect
vantage point to view The Watchers' so-called ``New Awakening.'' A
work crew had erected makeshift bleachers across the outfield. The
doors had opened at noon, and Max watched as a sea of white
streamed in noisily, trying to get as close as possible to a
central stage, erected near home plate.
</P>
<P>
   White banners were hung everywhere with slogans such as WATCH
THIS! and WATCH WITH US and AWAKE AND AWARE.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers pumped stadium music. Rocky told Max to wear
earplugs, but all the sound was directed out from where he was
sitting. Whoever picked the music and big screen videos had a sense
of humor because all the songs had ``white'' in the title _ from
``White Christmas'' to ``A Whiter Shade of Pale'' to, amazingly,
Billy Idol's ``White Wedding.'' Max curled his lip reflexively.
</P>
<P>
   The lights went out, and the crowd hushed and then became more
excited, like a rock concert, anticipating the featured act. Then
more music, the familiar throbbing of that great rock anthem of
paranoia and stalking, the rhythm like a heartbeat over Sting's
persistent voice: ``Every step you take, every move you make ...
I'll be watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a blast of crisscross laser beams, as bright white lights
shone on Glaber and his minions _ all dressed in blood-red tuxedos
_ almost 30 of them _ all blond or bald, except Glaber whose hair
was dark _ and one woman in a red, skintight, formal dress. Angela
Powers.
</P>
<P>
   Glaber raised his hand for silence. ``You know,'' he began,
``I've been following the stock market recently ...'' He paused,
and the crowd laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So here we are less than a month before a new millennium, and
the market is down. Now where is Wall Street's confidence? My
children, the economies of the world are about to crumble. Those
who put their stock in gold, now have rust. Those who put their
stock in lust, now have AIDS. Those who put their stock in the
religions of your fathers, are left with empty promises. Pie in the
sky when you die.'' More laughter and applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about all of you who have put your stock in me? What
do you all have?''
</P>
<P>
   The Watchers rose as one in prolonged waves of cheers and whoops
and cries, morphing finally into a chant of their leader's name:
``Ra-ool, Ra-ool.'' It shook the stadium, and Glaber put his hands
on his hips, nodded up toward the cheap seats, and smiled, looking
every bit the presidential candidate about to give an acceptance
speech.
</P>
<P>
   They showered him with love, dancing and jumping up and down the
aisles, waving placards that pronounced their place of origin: New
York, California, Montreal, Brazil, Denmark, even Japan.
</P>
<P>
   From Max's watchtower it looked like he was staring into a
microscope at some strange organism, vibrating with energy,
changing shape, a source of fascination and mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you have been through the rite of initiation _ you have
shed the garments of darkness for robes of white. And let me say
that some of you look better without your clothes than others.'' He
glanced toward Angela. Waves of laughter. ``We on this stage wear
red, as you all will wear red in a new dawn, blazing with blood and
fire.'' That quieted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you will experience a New Awakening. If there are any
among you who still slumber _ if your right eye is closed _ it will
be opened. With opened eyes we will watch together. For it is
ordained that we shall not watch alone. And so today, before you, I
will take unto me a bride.''
</P>
<P>
   The news caught the crowd by surprise, until people started to
point and call out, and before long they were cheering and chanting
her name: ``An-gel-a, An-gel-a.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber reached out her hand for her. She stood slowly, holding
her hands over her face, but Max could not tell the nature of the
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let that poor girl go! Let her go, I say. Give her her
freedom. Freedom, I say, freedom!'' The new voice was loud and
strong, coming clearly through the sound system. The voice was
familiar to Max, but it was not Glaber's.
</P>
<P>
   The group on stage stood and looked at each other and around the
stadium in search of the phantom voice. People in the crowd were
pointing. ``Up here, Glaber. Up here, on the catwalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Max turned to see a solitary little man, dressed in an orange
jump suit, wearing a halo of silver hair. He was looking down, like
Moses descending from Sinai, and was holding a wireless mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God,'' said Max aloud, ``it's Rocky, the sound engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Glaber,'' the voice boomed again. ``This is the day of a Great
Awakening, all right. And it's time for all these people to wake up
and see you for what you really are. A no-good stinker. A coward. A
bum.''
</P>
<P>
   Max stood up straight in his crow's nest, this interloper's
words ringing in his ears, vibrating from the speakers through his
body. It was not Rocky Como after all, he realized. ``It's Father
Ralph.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: The Watcher convention is a giant party for
Raoul Glaber until it is crashed by a little man with silver hair _
Father Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, time meant nothing for Max. It did not matter to him
whether it took two minutes or two days to climb down from his
crow's nest atop the domed stadium. When he got down during his
rehearsal, he had Rocky Como's back to stare at, and his
encouragement. But now it was just Max in an empty stadium, the
event he had witnessed so extraordinary, he couldn't get it out of
his head, even as he inched down the gangplanks and across the
catwalks towards the safety of sea level.
</P>
<P>
   He even prayed, which was not his style. ``Dear Lord, who so
inspired Father Ralph, please get me down off this damn thing.
Sorry about the damn.''
</P>
<P>
   As he descended _ always trying to look out, not down _ Max
replayed the events of the last few hours, again. He could not even
estimate how long they took. Time stood still. Or it sped up. Or it
reversed its field, creating a moment fit only for history,
mythology, or literature: the Knight playing chess with the figure
of Death; Christ facing the Grand Inquisitor; Clarence Darrow
cross-examining William Jennings Bryan during the Scopes Monkey
Trial; Don Juan in Hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Satan?'' Raoul Glaber had asked Father Ralph, who
stood safe and solitary on a catwalk above the crowd, wearing the
orange jumpsuit of a sound engineer, clutching a wireless mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm just a man. I'm not Satan. I'm not an angel. I'm not a
prophet. Just a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And why have you come here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To save that young woman.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to Angela Powers, who stepped back from Glaber and
looked down, as if in shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is loved here. But she is free to leave,'' said Glaber,
who gestured to the crowd. ``They are all free to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you know about freedom, Mr. Bigshot Watcher, Mr. Red
Tuxedo? There is no true freedom without responsibility. And you
act with no responsibility toward that woman, or to any of these
young people. If you did, you would not hide behind a false mask
and a false name. You would not offer them despair in the guise of
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I offer them despair, old man?'' Max sensed a subtle
shift in Glaber's voice, an erosion of his arrogance and
self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say that the human race has proved unfit for saving. I say
you're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You say this, old man, in the last days of a century that gave
us Hitler and Stalin and Pol Pot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not deny it. But can you deny that it also gave us Gandhi
and Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela and Jonas Salk and Dr. King
and my mother _ the woman was a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around you, old man, look at the world with your eyes
opened, and not through the nostalgic blindness of your senility.
Your generation left these children with ashes.'' This brought
scattered applause from a crowd that seemed unsure how to respond
to this debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What year were you born, oh great leader of The Watchers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I tell you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you afraid of me? An old man, as you say. Can't you answer
a simple question? The truth cannot harm you here _ with your many
followers, surrounded by your guards and cronies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in 1950.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so you'll turn 50 in the year 2,000. And you've chosen a
bride young enough to be your daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph paced as he spoke now, and raised his arms to the crowd
melodramatically. ``Kids. Don't you get it? Your leader is about to
turn 50. He's over the hill. He's playing the back nine. He wants a
trophy bride. He rides around in a power boat. Your prophet is not
ushering in a new millennium. He's having a midlife crisis!''
</P>
<P>
   This remark brought some scattered bursts of laughter, but these
were shouted down, until an angry murmur spread throughout the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't I send my helpers up there and have you thrown
into the street?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you are afraid of me, son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I an NOT your son.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber lost his cool, Max could hear it in his voice and see it
in his body language. ``You are NOT my father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're God's son. Just love God, and love these children
enough _ love that young woman enough to free her. Free them all.
Let them go. Young lady ...''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph's voice was comforting now, as if he were sitting across
the table from her, sharing a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young lady. You're free to go. Go ahead. Go.''
</P>
<P>
   With that Angela Powers dashed off the stage, her hand across
her face, as if to hold back tears. She ran like an athlete, even
in that slinky red dress and high heels, past a confused palace
guard, down a runway and out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tolerated your intrusion, old man _ I think you are
Satan _ but now you have gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber was beginning to rant. He gestured to three burly blond
men at the edge of the stage who ran off. To find Angela? To get
Ralph? Max couldn't tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing you can do to harm me,'' said Ralph. ``I do
not fear you. And, children, I do not fear the world. Embrace it.
Do not hate it. Walk out now. Go find a phone. Call your parents.
Wish them a Merry Christmas. Go visit them on New Year's Eve. Bring
some nice pastry. Buy them a Tony Bennett or a Frank Sinatra CD.
Watch the football games. Enjoy. Listen to that word. Enjoy. It has
joy in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber stared up, speechless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those fingers in my hair, That sly come hither stare, That
strips my conscience bare _ It's witchcraft.'' Max was laughing
now, wanting to leap from his perch down to Ralph, to hug him and
lift him up like a prizefighter and raise his hand in victory.
Ralph was breaking into his Frank Sinatra medley. ``I've got the
world on a string, Sittin' on a rainbow, Got the string around my
finger, What a world, What a life, I'm in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaber screamed and twisted around, ``Is there no one here who
will rid me of this Satan in the guise of an old man?''
</P>
<P>
   At that remark the crowd grew angry. People stood and shook
their fists at Ralph, or threw cups or plastic water bottles at
him. But it appeared as if a few others were trying to restrain
them. A fight broke out in the upper deck, and then another in the
mezzanine. Glaber's entourage tore off the stage, running to the
trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked down at the chaos. From his vantage point, it looked
like an illuminated manuscript of Dante's Inferno, a vibrating mass
of humanity, trapped in its own confusion and agony. And there, in
the middle, standing on the stage alone, his arms held wide, his
head down, like a crucified icon, was Glaber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one more thing before I go,'' said Father Ralph. ``A
little something from the poet T.S. Eliot: `In the end is my
beginning ... In the beginning is my end ... And the end of all our
exploring / Will be to arrive where we started /And know the place
for the first time.' Have a nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a group of Glaber's men appeared on the lower
catwalk, and just as quickly Ralph disappeared through a doorway,
his voice an echo in the great stadium.
</P>
<P>
   More fights broke out in the stands, with two men clutching at
each other, leaning dangerously over a high railing. A new
commotion raised the decibel level higher as city police streamed
into the stadium, wearing yellow vests and riot gear.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Father Ralph debates the leader of The
Watchers, and, along the way, secures the freedom of Glaber's young
bride-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max rushed back to the newspaper office, where Kate and her team
had assembled. They debriefed him on what he had seen at the
stadium, but not before he had a quick private conversation with
Kate about how Glaber had announced that Angela would become his
bride, how Father Ralph had dramatically intervened, how Angela was
last seen running out of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Kate crossed her arms and bit her lip, worried more than ever
about her daughter's safety and her mental state.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted but driven by adrenaline, Max wrote a 3,000-word memo
on what he had witnessed and turned it over to an editor. He picked
up the phone and dialed Violet's extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Max,'' she said sweetly. ``I guess this means you made it
down from the dome ceiling safe and sound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Check your e-mail for my memo, Violet. It was amazing. I'm
heading back to the condo. But I want to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see you, Max,'' said Violet, and then, ``and not
just see you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet. Glaber says he was born in 1950.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's telling the truth, that will help.''
</P>
<P>
   Max cruised home, still replaying the events of the day. The
police had arrested 50 Watchers. Angela Powers was missing. Raoul
Glaber had to be led from the stage by one of his followers. Father
Ralph Rizzo was _ well, for all Max knew _ he was eating lasagna
and listening to a Frank Sinatra CD.
</P>
<P>
   When Max let himself in to the condo, he knew right away that
something was wrong. All the lights were on, and the television
blared, turned to the local station, which was reporting news of
the arrests at the Dome. He heard music coming from the back.
</P>
<P>
   Max suddenly wished Daisy had been there as a watchdog, but Evie
had returned from California and retrieved the famous Skyway pup.
``HEY!'' barked Max, ``who's here?''
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed a golf club _ a 2-iron _ from the front closet and
hefted it with two hands over one shoulder as if it were a baseball
bat. He stepped cautiously through the place, peeking around
corners, into one bathroom, the bedrooms, the office. All the
lights were on.
</P>
<P>
   Then finally he poked a door open with the end of his club. It
squeaked, and Max could see that someone had lit candles beside the
Jacuzzi and was listening to classical music. Bach, he thought. The
candles flickered from the gulf breeze, sending odd shadows across
the room, shadows of a human figure, whose body now made ripples in
the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can come in, Max. It's only me.''
</P>
<P>
   He took one more step, and there she was, still beautiful and
once again in the water without the benefit of clothes. He gazed on
the face and body that could distract even the head of The Watchers
from his millennium watch. Angela Powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do me one favor, please,'' said Max. ``Put something on.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she turned a dial which sent bubbles across the surface
of the water, concealing her nakedness. She slid down, so only her
face and kneecaps were visible. ``How's that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine. Why did you drug me at the hotel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know they put a drug in your ice tea, Max. I swear I
didn't. I didn't know a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That he wanted me to marry him, for goodness sake. There's
been nothing like that between us. That came out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or that Watchers were going to start jumping off the bridge. I
knew those four people. I thought they were looking forward to a
new life _ I can't imagine what drove them to suicide. When I
started asking questions, all I got back were strange vibes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand one thing. From what I've learned, you
could be a brain surgeon or an Olympic athlete or a Victoria's
Secret model. What drove you to a windbag like Glaber?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could answer that, a lot of my problems would be solved.
Maybe my mother could tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does she know you're here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. But she gave me a key to the place. I'm glad I kept it. I
love my mother. Can you believe that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's heartsick over what's happened to you. And frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went off the deep end when my father died. I admit it. We
were so close. He raised me, directed me, coached me, cared for me,
while my mom was off working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So Glaber became your substitute daddy?'' Max said it with
sarcasm, and then regretted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ridicule me, Max. It's not that simple. Raoul was
charming and persuasive _ and his challenges about the world
stimulated my thinking. Why not become part of something big and
important? When he took an interest in me, started calling me
Angela, it raised my status in the group. It was like I was Chelsea
Clinton, or a beautiful princess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've hurt a lot of people for a little bit of attention and
celebrity, Angela Powers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please call me Cassie. I want my old name back. And my old
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good first step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you hand me that robe, please?''
</P>
<P>
   Max picked the blue one, instead of the white, handed it to her
and turned away, and closed his eyes for good measure as she slid
out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry you were hurt, Max. And I'm sorry my mom ...'' She
began to sob. ``And I'm afraid something really bad is going to
happen on January 1st _ and if anyone else gets hurt _ I'm sorry.
So sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   She dropped her head straight forward till her forehead hit Max
in the shoulder blade. It hurt. Max put his arm around her and
ushered her back inside. ``Come on. Let's call your mother and let
her know you're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they stepped through into the living room, there stood
three burly blond men, dress in white. Angela screamed. Max grabbed
the lamp and threw it at them. One blocked it with his forearm then
grabbed Max, spun him around and locked the vice of his arm against
Max's windpipe until the room got darker and slipped from under
him.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max returns to the condo, where Angela Powers
is hiding. There they are attacked by Glaber's henchmen. Angela is
kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   When Max came to, someone was leaning over him. A woman, he
surmised, or a man with long, sweet-smelling hair that tickled the
side of face. In fact, the person was blowing air into his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a woman, and Max pushed her aside, turned his head and
coughed, leaning up on one elbow and rubbing his throat with his
free hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them load Angela Powers, she was wearing a blue
bathrobe, into a white van.'' It was Violet. ``And I could see your
front door was open. I ran up and found you on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you save my life, Violet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I'm not sure you were breathing.'' Her hands
started to shake. ``Should I call 911? Are you all right, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   She helped him to his feet. ``Let's call the cops, Violet. In
fact, let's call Sam Lockhart. I've got his direct number.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam issued an all-points bulletin for Cassandra ``Angela''
Powers. He sent detectives to the Conquistador Hotel to question
Glaber, but neither he nor his henchmen could be found. The
rank-and-file Watchers claimed no knowledge of their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Violet stayed at the condo with Max, who was dizzy. She fixed
him a cup of tea, rubbed the soreness out of his neck and
shoulders, and even tucked him into bed, kissing him a gentle good
night, and running a hand through what was left of his hair. He
dropped off immediately and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
</P>
<P>
   He woke up feeling refreshed, even though this December morning
brought another wave of heat and humidity. Before noon it would hit
well into the 90s. Such weather was common from May through
October, but this December blast was both unusual and demoralizing.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas in Florida was hard enough, no snow for years, but
this weather smelled like tropical funk. El Nino by way of Jimmy
Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   He made a quick list of possible icons of the bizarre holiday
season: Scrooge wearing Bermuda shorts. Gingerbread men baking on
the beach. Rudolph with zinc oxide smeared on his nose. Frosty the
Snowman getting a fatal suntan. Suzy Snowflake becoming a crispy
cornflake.
</P>
<P>
   Max filled the passing days with work, writing and reporting,
until Christmas Eve arrived, one week until New Year's Eve, until
Millennium Eve. All the big parties would be next week. But he
decided on a small one, in the afternoon, so people could meet
their family and church commitments.
</P>
<P>
   His guests rolled in to the condo about two in the afternoon,
dressed more for Labor Day than Christmas, carrying cookies, and
salads, and casseroles, bottles of cold beer and wine.
</P>
<P>
   Violet had arrived early to help Max get the place ready. She
wore green shorts and matching halter top, with a red ribbon and
bow draped across her body, beauty queen style.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Banks arrived next, looking somber, like she needed a
drink. Still no word about her daughter, but every cop and reporter
in town was on the lookout. Violet did her best to comfort and
reassure her.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Darling arrived wearing a Santa hat and carrying a
disposable camera, which actually brought a little laugh from Kate.
Sherry, as was her habit, hugged the breath out of each of them _
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Father Ralph came next, wearing his favorite Hawaiian shirt,
lugging pastries and a gift for Max, a Frank Sinatra CD. Kate shook
his hand firmly and thanked the priest for helping her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Next came James ``Choirboy'' Jones, who posed for a picture next
to Father Ralph. They made a comic couple: Wilt Chamberlain
towering over the mayor of Munchkin Land.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined next by the police chief, Sam Lockhart, who
gave them an update on the search for Kate's daughter, and the
investigation of Glaber and The Watchers. Everything was being done
that could be done, he assured them. He would update Max each day,
personally. It was unlikely that Glaber would have escaped the
area. ``We think he's still here. And I'll wager we find him
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Ralph,'' said Kate. ``How did you pull that stunt at
the Dome? How did you get in with the sound crew?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You think Max is the only one with connections?'' he smiled.
``You think it's possible that an old priest might call up a young
superstar like the Choirboy and maybe ask a little favor? And, I'm
not afraid of heights either.''
</P>
<P>
   They all turned and laughed at Max, who affected a sheepish
look.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone filled their plates with the holiday grub and took
seats on the couch or on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father,'' said Sherry, who was Catholic. ``Do you want to say
grace?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he said, ``Let's eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The doorbell rang. Evie Hamilton walked in, dressed immaculately
in a gold holiday frock, with Daisy, wearing a red bow around her
neck, bounding in behind her. It took Daisy, who would be spending
the week with Max, a good hour to make the rounds, gathering hugs,
pats and belly rubs wherever she could get them.
</P>
<P>
   By about six o'clock, the gathering had run out of gas, with
people beginning to stretch their legs, collect their plates, and
discuss their family plans for the rest of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Kate would hang out with friends. Max, Violet and Daisy would
work the beach, looking for Santa to come in on water skis, being
towed by dolphins. Father Ralph invited everyone to midnight Mass
at the clinic. Choirboy and his mom had the family over. Sam and
his wife were hosting an annual party for his top assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you all to know how important all of you have been to
me in the past months,'' said Max, adopting a voice he was not used
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me happy to have you all together here with me for
just a little while. When Kate hired me to work on this story, I
was feeling more than a little burned out. But, I don't know,
something about this story, and all of you, have brought me back.
I've been drugged. I've been choked. I've had to listen to Ralph do
his Sinatra imitation.'' They all laughed. ``I've slept with a
great dog. A dog that survived a drop from the Skyway Bridge.''
More laughter and then the sound of a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Lockhart answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When did this happen?'' he said, and then several ``uh-huhs.''
He looked around the room as he listened. ``And where is he now?
I'll be damned. Any sign of Glaber or the girl? We'll be right
down.'' He hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, you were right. Those Watchers didn't jump off the Skyway
Bridge, they were dropped from a small plane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They just dropped another one. No, Kate, not your daughter.
It's a tall, skinny white boy without any hair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that kid,'' said Max. Sherry nodded. ``We saw him at
the initiation. Is he dead? Did they fish him out of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I guess this is a Christmas miracle, but he's alive. He
was pushed out of a small plane. Or he jumped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did he land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the roof of the Star Dome. Hit near the top, took one big
bounce like a trampoline, and slid down and hooked on to the ledge.
Folks drinking on the patio of Jake's Sports Bar saw the whole
thing. They're taking him down now.''

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Violet comes to Max's rescue, and they spend
days working with police on finding the kidnapped Angela. A
Christmas Eve gathering is interrupted by a shocking phone call.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Sam Lockhart and Max raced from the beach to the Dome in
separate cars. The chief of police even loaned Max a portable
rotating police light he could stick on the dashboard of the
Mustang. He felt like a kid with a new Christmas toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if somebody had given Glaber his own police light,'' Max
mused, ``it would have satisfied his thirst for power.''
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived, they found the Dome lit up like a movie set.
Max counted seven police cars _ the police station was right across
the street _ three news trucks, two news helicopters, a police
helicopter, three fire trucks, one with a long ladder extended to
the lip of the Dome roof, and maybe 200 onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Two rescue workers had succeeded in hooking a harness to the
young man, and were beginning to lower him to the ground. Max was
close enough to recognize him, the hairless Watcher he had first
seen on the shore of Cosmos Key during the initiation ceremony.
From Max's vantage point, the kid looked limp and lifeless, a rag
doll.
</P>
<P>
   They unhooked him on the ground, placed him on a stretcher and
rolled him into an ambulance. A detective approached Sam and Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is conscious, but incoherent. He looks OK from the
outside, but they'll be checking him for internal injuries. We
can't tell if he fell, jumped, or was pushed out. These people saw
the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   An older couple approached now and described how they had been
on the patio of a sports bar, drinking merrily and singing
Christmas songs with their friends, but their Yuletide gaiety was
interrupted by the drone of a small plane: ``The kind that flies
over the beach dragging commercial signs,'' said the woman.
</P>
<P>
   The plane flew a tight circle over the Dome, when a figure,
clearly visible in white against the night sky, dropped straight
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked for a chute to open, or a bungee cord,'' said the
man, ``like it was a publicity stunt, but he just landed near the
top of the Dome, bounced once, and then slid out of sight. I
expected to find him on the ground, dead. We screamed for the
bartender to call 911, rushed over here, and saw he was hooked on
the ledge of the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam thanked the couple and turned to the detective. ``Any word
about the plane? Anyone call saying they lost a passenger?''
Negative.
</P>
<P>
   Max and Sam drove to the hospital and waited for more than two
hours before a doctor came out to see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That roof is made of a tough fiberglass. It was no kiddie ride
down that thing. He's got what amounts to second degree burns down
his back from the slide. He's cracked his pelvis. Maybe busted some
ribs. But he's very much alive. The roof had enough give to cushion
his fall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we talk with him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given him something for the pain, but you can try. Take
it easy, though. He's in Room 211.''
</P>
<P>
   Max stood back and let Sam conduct the interview. The young man
was lying on his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, son, you've had quite a fall. What's your name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas. Thomas Day.'' Max took a step closer to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. Thomas. Tell us how you fell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't fall, man. I jumped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You jumped out of the plane? Why did you do that, Thomas?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were going to push me out. Like the others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The four Watchers who were found in the Bay?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew those people, man. They were good people.'' He winced.
``I didn't think they would kill themselves, so I started asking
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To Glaber?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not that high up. But to his buds. They didn't like that I
was nosin' around. So they said, `Come on, man, we know where your
friends jumped from. We can show it to you from the plane. We can
say a prayer for them.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you went with them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, what an idiot, huh? Man, the pain's goin' away, but I'm
feelin' pretty sleepy. Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang on, Thomas. Why did you jump?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot was next to me and this big guy behind me. When we
got up there, everything changed. Said I wasn't worthy to follow
Glaber into a new world. Said I wasn't strong enough to do what had
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Had to be done?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. On New Year's Eve. These people are wacked, man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What had to be done, Thomas?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out what it was, and that they probably killed
those people because they didn't want to do it. They were scarin'
me, man. So when I looked down and saw the Dome. I can't believe I
jumped, man. Oh man, when they told me what they were going to do
... I've got to sleep man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they were going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``On New Year's Eve....'' He was breathing heavy now, about to
fall off into a painless sleep induced by his medications.
</P>
<P>
   Sam leaned over and shouted. ``What are they going to do,
Thomas? Tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   The police chief turned his head and placed his ear closed to
the young man's lips. Max could hear nothing, but it appeared as if
the man's lips moved.
</P>
<P>
   Sam stood straight and turned to Max, a look of disbelief on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you get it? What are they going to do, Sam. Did he tell
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he told me. He said they're going to blow up the Skyway
Bridge.''

FRANTICALLY PURSUING HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've got to do something about my appetite. Not my appetite for
food. For stimulation. I'm like a magpie, grabbing at anything that
glitters, dazzled by anything that shines.
</P>
<P>
   I keep clipping reviews of books I want to read and movies I
want to see. I keep writing down lectures I want to attend and
courses I want to take. I keep making dates with people I want to
see and making lists of errands I have to run. I have a file of
places I plan to take my grandchildren and a collection of articles
about countries I intend to visit. Every time I read the newspaper,
I scan the listings for interesting things to do. Every time I talk
with friends, I generate new projects. My hunger for experience is
so great I could fill up every block in next month's calendar in
one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it's already filled.
</P>
<P>
   Friday there's a meeting of our Unitarian Church's Ministry
Committee, and on Tuesday nights I teach an adult education class
on the evolution of the human brain, based on a video series by
cosmologist Brian Swimme. Thursday mornings the Marblehead Cancer
Prevention Project meets, and all those dates circled in purple
marker signify talks I'm giving to various women's and library
groups this fall. Saturday night we're having folks over for
dinner. Sunday afternoon we're seeing the stage version of ``The
Last Hurrah.'' My daughter Julie's birthday is a week before Jack
and I take both of our grandkids for the weekend, and then comes
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Those are only the special events.
</P>
<P>
   In case I have a free moment between trips to the supermarket,
the post office, and the chiropractor, I have a cabinet full of
material for various craft projects. I've committed myself to
making doll furniture for our church's dollhouse raffle. As if that
weren't enough, I'm in the process of putting up low-cost
affordable housing for birds on the wall of our garage. My grandson
and I are building one birdhouse together, and I've purchased
several unfinished ones that we have to polyurethane and put up
before winter arrives. I'm also knitting my daughter a sweater . .
.
</P>
<P>
   I don't even want to think about the adventures that are going
to show up, unexpected and unplanned, which I'll be unable to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   I must be out of my mind.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to every one of those things, but I'm not looking
forward to all of them. Each one individually is highly enjoyable,
pleasurable, and gratifying. All together, they're exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   Which ones am I willing to give up? None.
</P>
<P>
   What am I going to do? I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   This is where we all find ourselves at the end of the 20th
century, drowning in a sea of too many good choices and too many
exciting opportunities. If it were only obligations and demands
that were killing us, it would be a lot easier to plot our way out
of the compressed activity that stuffs our lives to the fullest.
Unfortunately, we're also at the effect of all the ways it's now
possible to be entertained, distracted, informed, and uplifted.
Even if we never leave our houses, the Internet lies in wait to
seduce us with great Web sites while the TV undermines our
resistance with good programs. Waves of stimulation crash over us
from every direction, leaving us awash in an ocean of irresistible
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that everyone I know feels like they're going
down for the third time?
</P>
<P>
   This is my Achilles' heel: I like the rush of adrenaline that
comes with purposeful activity. I feel a surge of triumph when I
survive an impossibly busy day. There's a certain
master-of-the-universe thrill in feeling like one of the most
productive people on earth. No one could ever say I'm wasting my
life or missing out on what the world has to offer. I'm never
bored.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also never completely relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   This is what's so difficult: In order to take back my life, to
cushion it with liberal amounts of uncommitted time, to give myself
a margin for flexibility, I not only have to fight the culture, I
have to wrestle myself to the mat. I'm too curious, too
enthusiastic, too human for my own good. I have seen the enemy and
I both love and resent her.
</P>
<P>
   She is my own craving for impact.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: Max and the police chief rush to the domed
stadium to find a young Watcher has jumped out of a plane and
landed on the stadium roof.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max watched Sam Lockhart and his men spend Christmas Day
emptying out the Conquistador Hotel. Sam called in the FBI, alerted
the National Guard and the Coast Guard, which began an elaborate
search for Glaber's boat.
</P>
<P>
   Every corner and crevice of the pink hotel was inspected, every
shadow illuminated, every Watcher and every tourist interviewed,
and then asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared as if Glaber, his dozen closest followers and the
kidnapped Cassandra ``Angela'' Powers had been teleported to
another galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget to check behind the nearest comet,'' said Max to
Sam sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel came up clean, not even a cache of weapons, no double
secret sub-basement filled with missiles or nerve gas. The search
went on for days, including a small army with metal detectors on
the beach. They pulled up lots of coins, wristwatches, gold chains
and beer cans _ but nothing that could blow up a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The break came Wednesday night, Dec. 29, just two evenings
before the new year and the new millennium. It was Sam Lockhart
himself who figured it out.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the roof of the hotel, in increasingly stormy
weather, he looked down the beach to a place Max had once described
for him: ``A big circle, like a landing pad for hang gliders or
helicopters.'' Detectives told him no one had ever seen anything
landing there. ``Dig it up,'' Sam ordered.
</P>
<P>
   They found six metal containers carrying enough plastic
explosives to do quite enough damage, thank you, to a bridge, or
federal building, or hotel, or police station, or newspaper office,
or nuclear power plant. The bad news was that one container was
empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much is missing?'' asked the chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably enough to fill a boat the size of Glaber's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn him,'' said the chief, one of his strongest expletives.
``And damn this weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather between Christmas and New Year's was apocalyptic _
no one could remember anything quite like it _ with effects more
dramatic and unpredictable than those produced by the Pacific
warming known as El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   Two tropical storms had formed in the Atlantic, with tropical
waves hopscotching east across Mexico and reforming in the Gulf.
Although none of these were yet of hurricane strength,
meteorologists worried about the unpredictability of such storms a
month after the end of the normal tropical storm season.
</P>
<P>
   Max spent New Year's Eve morning with a weather eye on the sky
and on television news reports. Storm warnings were being issued on
both Florida coasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next two days, we're likely to get lots of rain,
wind, lightning, maybe even some tornadoes. You folks living in
low-lying areas pay special attention for locally heavy flooding,
when the tides are high. These patterns are common for us in
September, but never as late as New Year's Eve. Maybe this is
Mother Nature's way of joining the Big Party.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be no big millennium party for Max.
</P>
<P>
   He and Daisy the dog and maybe Violet would be at the condo,
parked cozily in front of the television set, watching the weather
and news of the festivities around the world as the Year 2000 broke
first over the International Dateline and then swept west, time
zone by time zone, until it reached Florida and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Max would also be in constant touch with Kate at the newspaper
for news of her daughter, and with Sam for news about Glaber and
The Watchers.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Max, it's Violet. I need to come over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well I need you to come over. And so does Daisy. We wouldn't
want to usher in the new millennium without you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Max, I'm one of those who believe the new millennium
doesn't begin until Jan. 1, 2001. But why let logic and mathematics
get in the way of a good orgy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Orgy? Could this be my lucky millennium?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play your cards right. But that's not why I called,
Max. I'm working on an important angle on Glaber. I think I know
who he is. I'm waiting for one more piece of information _ an old
obituary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't keep me in suspense, Violet. What have you got?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well I looked for connections between the names Glaber and
Miller, like you suggested, but came up empty. Then I made an
assumption _ that his name might really be William Miller, like he
told you, and that he's really 50 years old, like he told Father
Ralph, and that he's from California _ he said he was from the West
_ because he just sounds like a Californian _ his voice, all that
New Age stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's some funky hunch for a logician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick with me, Max, as you like to say. For days I've been
checking birth records, death certificates, old phone books,
microfiche newspaper stories, out of the big California cities: San
Diego, LA, San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet, don't make me jump through this phone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I found an oddity, a birth and a death, in San Francisco. In
the same family. On the same day. On New Year's morning, to be
exact, 1950. The father's name was William Miller. The son's name
was Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are telling me that the son was born and the father died.
On New Year's morning. At the exact midpoint of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, not the exact midpoint, but never mind Max. Here's the
kicker. The father threw himself off the Golden Gate Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind off the gulf blew gusts that shook the condo. Lightning
flashed like a strobe light. Daisy slithered under the bed and
began to whimper. The lights flickered and went out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet. We just lost our electricity. How about you? Violet?''
</P>
<P>
   The phone line was dead.

   LAST INSTALLMENT: The police search for Raoul Glaber and his
henchmen to rescue Angela and destroy a plot to blow up the Skyway
Bridge. Max and Violet get closer to Glaber's true identity.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The lights were off, the phone was dead, the dog was under the
bed and sheets of rain raged against the windows of the condo. When
the rain subsided intermittently, Max Timlin could see waves
crashing across the rocks of Land's End, over the dunes, over the
sidewalk and into the street.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on the weather radio said that, for now, everyone should
stay put, that the barometric pressure was dropping like a brick
off a skyscraper, that winds were approaching hurricane speed, that
there were reports of fallen trees and power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are at a millennium party, stay where you are. Repeat.
Do not try to get home.''
</P>
<P>
   Max looked at his watch. It was 12:09 a.m. Jan. 1. The Year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, after all this, I missed it. I missed the millennium.''
His cell phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max. Max. Can you hear me? It's Kate. I'm still at the
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any word about Glaber and your daughter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got a call from the cops. The Coast Guard found
Glaber's boat about two hours ago in a wharf over in the Port of
Tampa. They've arrested six men. The boat was loaded with
explosives. But there is no sign of Glaber and Cassie. Max. What's
going to happen? I'm so scared.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me to try to get over there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Max, I'm staying here through the night, just in case a
call comes in. Now that they've found the boat and the explosives,
they can't spend time looking for Cassie. All their attention is on
people threatened by the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Max heard a noise and thought it was the wind, but realized
someone was pounding on the door. He looked out. He saw Violet's
lovely face, framed by the hood of a yellow rain slicker.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Max helped her out of her wet clothes, and even Daisy
ventured out of hiding for a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting treacherous out there, Max. It almost looks like
the end of the world. Thank God for the sports utility vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Max gave her a good long hug, sat her on the couch and poured
her a glass of cabernet. Violet reached into her little backpack
and pulled out a file folder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, I think I've got the final two pieces of the puzzle. One
e-mail message came in just before the lights went out.''
</P>
<P>
   She showed him an obituary of William Miller, Glaber's father.
It said that Miller was born in 1900, the son of German immigrants,
that he was a college athlete and honor student, that he graduated
first in his class in medical school, and decided to become a
career army officer.
</P>
<P>
   Here it got interesting. Miller rose to the rank of colonel, and
after World War II served as an advisor to the justices conducting
the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal. Miller spoke German, and was
free to interview the Nazi leaders, even as he took their blood
pressure or gave them an aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now we know that Glaber's father happened to have the name
of a famous 19th-century American doomsday prophet, that he met the
perpetrators of the Holocaust up close, and that three years later
he jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one more thing, Max. I had to wait to get this
translated into English. It's a footnote from a German book on the
Nuremberg trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Max read it. It said that after the suicide of Dr. William
Miller, police found a note in his study addressed to his wife, who
was in the hospital giving birth to their first son, Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have seen what I have seen. To have cared for those whose
hearts were pure evil. I'm not worthy to be the father of a son in
such a world. I'll meet you _ and my son _ in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Max read and re-read the words of the suicide note. It was as if
a large black curtain had been pulled back to reveal a giant
tapestry _ on which a grand but terrible story had now fully
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Raoul Glaber,'' said Max, shaking his head, Violet's hand
on his shoulder. ''Poor Michael Miller. How could he possibly
escape his destiny? The son of a man turned mad by the Holocaust.
To come into the world on New Year's Day, only to have your father
leap to his death. No wonder he wanted to blow up a bridge. Even
his initials. Michael Miller. MM. The Roman numerals for 2,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Violet and Max made sure the doors and windows of the condo were
secure and fell asleep by candlelight, curled up on the couch, her
head against his shoulder. It was a lovely sleep in the storm until
Max awoke to the sound of Daisy's whimpering.
</P>
<P>
   He reached out and patted her with his left hand, and realized
that his right arm was numb, the circulation cut off by the weight
of Violet's sleeping body. He carefully pulled the arm out from
under her and rested her head against a pillow. He stood up, yawned
and rubbed the blood back into his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``What time is it?'' he whispered to Daisy, and looked at his
watch. It was 4:35 a.m. New Year's Day. His mind exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet, Violet, wake up honey.'' He shook her harder than he
meant to. ``Violet, what time did Michael Miller's father jump off
the bridge? What time? Do you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Violet rolled off the couch and grabbed the materials from the
file, which they had left spread out across the floor. It took only
a minute or two for the fog of Violet's sleep to clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we know that Michael Miller was born at 1:15 a.m. The
news story doesn't give an exact time, but police estimated the
father killed himself less than an hour after the birth of his
son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So about 2:15 a.m. Pacific Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Violet got the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 5:15 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. What time is it now,
Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``About 4:45.''
</P>
<P>
   He dashed toward the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you going, Max?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Violet, stay here with Daisy. Try to raise Sam Lockhart and
Kate Banks on the cell phone. I'm headed for the Skyway Bridge.''

   THE STORY SO FAR: Reporter Max Timlin is hired by editor Kate
Banks to investigate a doomsday cult called The Watchers. He learns
that the leader of The Watchers, Raoul Glaber, has a false
identity. He also learns that Glaber's bride-to-be, Angela Powers,
is the daughter of Kate Banks. With the help of Father Ralph, Max
rescues Angela, until she is kidnapped by Glaber's henchmen. A plot
is uncovered to blow up the Skyway Bridge on New Year's Day. Violet
closes in on Glaber's real identity, just as a hurricane bears down
on West Florida.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max had a half-hour, he figured, to reach the top of the Skyway
Bridge, driving his old Mustang through wind and rain of hurricane
force.
</P>
<P>
   Two things worked in his favor: the eerie emptiness of the roads
and the portable rotating police light he had never returned to Sam
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   He stuck the cop light on his dashboard and cruised forward as
fast as the conditions would allow, through water that rose to his
fenders, over downed power lines and around tree limbs and other
detritus of the high winds.
</P>
<P>
   He waved himself past two clueless toll-booth attendants, but
was stopped at a small roadblock on the stretch of highway leading
to the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry, sir, the bridge is closed to all traffic. The
winds are way too dangerous. And the lightning. You'd best be
getting home.'' The officer was young and by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a reporter working on a story. The police chief gave me
this light. Call him if you want. My name is Max. Max Timlin.'' The
officer checked his ID.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has anyone driven up there in the last hour?'' asked Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a Highway Patrol trooper. About 15 minutes ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you talk to the driver?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Just waved him through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you call the roadblock on the other side, please, it's an
emergency, to see if he made it across?''
</P>
<P>
   The officer, thoroughly perplexed, went to his car to use his
radio. Max stepped on the gas.
</P>
<P>
   He drove as fast as he could, but winds from the south seemed to
be pushing against his grille like a fleet of trucks. Gusts knocked
the car sideways, blowing water and wind through the tiny spaces of
the ragtop. He fought the steering wheel for control.
</P>
<P>
   As he climbed the bridge, he realized he was flying blind. The
old wipers seemed to make things worse, and he had no time to
fiddle with the defogger. He tried wiping the window clear with his
hand. As the incline took him higher, more than 100 feet above the
sea, closer to 200, the winds strengthened. Blasts of lightning
crashed around him.
</P>
<P>
   Max feared only two things: lightning and high places. This ride
up the roller coaster was as irrational as anything he had ever
done. He hoped _ he prayed _ hands glued to the wheel, that the
Mustang would cruise over the apex of the bridge, safely to the
other side. That he would find nothing.
</P>
<P>
   More lightning, illuminating the top of the bridge and, too
late, the red reflector lights of a black and gold Highway Patrol
car.
</P>
<P>
   Max slammed the brakes, but the Mustang slid at an angle and
crashed into the bigger, heavier vehicle. He climbed out dazed and
unsteady, and the wind knocked him over. He stumbled up but a
lightning bolt hit one of the bridge towers, and the fear of it
drove Max to his belly. He waited a moment, trying to regain his
breath. He tasted blood.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked up. Another flash. And there, maybe 30 yards ahead,
in the middle of the bridge, at the highest point above the water,
stood a man against the edge, his two arms around the figure of a
woman, appearing limp and unconscious. It was Michael Miller _ aka
Raoul Glaber _ prepared now to die for the sins of his father, and
to take Cassie Powers with him.
</P>
<P>
   Max got to his feet and pressed forward, like a man dragging a
300-pound weight. His nemesis stood perfectly still, immune to the
elements, gazing toward the sky as if in prayer. The man looked at
his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not time to die, Michael. Stop. Stop.'' Max shouted at
the top of his voice, like King Lear railing against the storm.
``Your life isn't done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller turned in complete bewilderment, and then leaned the
young woman in his arms over the edge of the bridge, 200 feet above
the roiling sea. ``You're too late, Max. Unless you want to join
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Miller. Your suffering is over. You are NOT your
father. Please put her down. Put the girl down. Please. Come with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Max moved closer. Only three steps separated them. Max leapt for
Miller's feet, but missed, knocking the wind out of him. Miller
aimed a vicious kick with a heavy boot to Max's head and landed a
glancing blow. Max couldn't tell if he was seeing more lightning,
or just the electricity in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Max looked up, helpless. The King of The Watchers had his angel
_ his Angela Powers _ in his hands now and, almost without effort,
pressed her over his head like an Olympic weight lifter hoisting a
broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   Through the storm in his brain, prone and helpless, Max could
hear Miller, repeating over and over: ``Father, forgive me, for I
know not what I do. Father, forgive me. Father, forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   Max squeezed his eyes shut, so he would not have to see the girl
fly to her death.
</P>
<P>
   Miller screamed, and Max's eyes snapped open to see him fall
backward in pain and confusion, the girl dropping to the pavement
with a sickening thud. Max was dreaming. Or else a dog, a dog like
Daisy, was standing over Miller, growling like a mother protecting
her babies, her jaws locked on his arm. Someone was helping Max to
his feet. ``Violet _ help Cassie.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Max a good minute, and all his strength, to pull Daisy
off the fallen prophet, who rolled in pain on the pavement. Max
looked up to see Violet's white Jeep behind his crumpled Mustang,
and, down the incline, three police cars, their lights barely
visible, their sirens barely audible in the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over,'' he thought. ``It's finally over.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller made a wild dash for the side of the bridge, emitting a
scream of pain and despair that shot Max into action. Just before
Miller went over the edge, Max tackled him from behind, his arms
locked around the Watcher's shoulders. But Miller's momentum and
the demons inside him carried him over _ carried them both over _
the ledge.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Max heard was Violet's scream. And then silence.
And the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Max was dead. He had to be. But could you be dead and dreaming
at the same time? Because this was the strangest dream. Even for a
dead man. He dreamed he was lying in a coffin, a pretty comfortable
one, actually. That surprised him.
</P>
<P>
   And Father Ralph was in the room, saying a prayer over him, and
performing the last rites. Behind him, against the wall of the room
_ quite bright for a mortuary _ stood a row of women. One by one,
they filed by, bent over to kiss him, leaving their hot tears on
his cold face.
</P>
<P>
   First was his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have been a lawyer,'' she whispered in his dead
ear. Then Kate Banks, ``Thanks for saving my daughter.'' Then,
Sherry Darling, who snapped a photograph of him in the coffin and
then hugged his lifeless body until it hurt. Then Violet Rose, the
beautiful flower, who kissed him on the lips, with more passion
than anyone had ever kissed him, but, too bad, cause he was dead
now, but if he was really dead how come he was having this certain
feeling that he associated with being very much alive?
</P>
<P>
   It was all over, he thought now in his dream, I can drift off to
a big, big sleep. Just then he heard a scratching, and looked up to
see two brown and black paws, and then the large head of Daisy the
dog, who whimpered, then drooled on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Max was in a coma for two days, and in the hospital for a month.
He broke his wrist, his collarbone and three ribs. His left lung
collapsed. They removed his spleen. While they were at it, a
plastic surgeon came in and lasered the Watcher tattoo off Max's
behind.
</P>
<P>
   There were dozens of strange theories as to how Max survived the
fall from the bridge. The most common was that Miller absorbed most
of the impact, breaking Max's fall. There was science talk about
terminal velocity and the softening effects of water in motion.
Some people spoke of miracles, but Father Ralph discouraged it.
``Good people make their own miracles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not forget the Coast Guard,'' said Samson Lockhart.
``They risked their lives to fish his sorry butt out of the
water.'' The stormy sea had washed up Max's body onto one of the
bumpers designed to protect the bridge from another collision.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of rehab, Max asked Violet to pick him up at St.
Anthony's Hospital on the day of his release. She rolled his
wheelchair to the front entrance, helped him into the Jeep and
drove at twice the speed limit for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a surprise for you,'' she said, her face fighting to
contain the width of her smile. A lovely ride on a crisp, sunny
February day brought them to the condo, where Kate was waiting to
greet them. She hugged Max, and then wiped the kisses from his face
with her thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the surprise?'' he said goofily.
</P>
<P>
   From around the corner came an amazing site. His Mustang,
looking in mint condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gift from the newspaper. We had it repaired, rebuilt
the engine, top of the line paint job, and magnificently
detailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving the car, with the top down, was Cassie Powers, wearing
reflector sunglasses and a black bikini. It looked like something
out of an old hot-rod magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In the back, proud and pretty, her head tilted back, enjoying
the breeze, was Daisy the dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to drive, Max?'' Cassie got out and embraced him.
Violet hopped in the passenger side, and Max took the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   He looked down at the dashboard and laughed until it hurt. The
odometer had finally crawled over the 100,000-mile mark _ in fact,
seven miles over, to 007.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the ending of `Goldfinger,''' he said, cruising down
Gulf Boulevard, feeling the joy of a new day.
</P>
<P>
   -0-
 &UR; EPILOGUE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The body of Michael Miller, aka Raoul Glaber, was never
recovered. He is presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Father Ralph Rizzo and James ``Choirboy'' Jones started a
program for former Watchers, and succeeded in directing many
towards community service and productive social action.
</P>
<P>
   Samson Lockhart retired from police work, received many awards
for his contributions, and opened a chain of New Orleans-style
restaurants called Daisy's.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy the Dog appeared with Max Timlin on the cover of Time
magazine, and visited Max at the beach every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Banks became Max's good friend, drinking buddy and dance
partner. She hired him and teamed him with Sherry Darling to head
up a special investigative team for the Florida Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Cassie Powers was never called ``Angela'' again. Max took a
fatherly interest in her and coached her on the writing of her
memoir, ``Inside the Watchers,'' which became a best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Max wrote a 29-part blockbuster series about The Watchers. It
was titled ``Ain't Done Yet.'' The Pulitzer Prize Board, an
unusually conservative group, granted him a special award by
acclamation, although one editor thought the series was ``a little
long.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm that hit West Florida on New Year's Eve didn't have an
official name, but Max dubbed it Hurricane Millie, short for
millennium, and the nickname stuck forevermore.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Max ever hooked up with Violet Rose, well, you're
going to have to check in some time down the road with the new
adventures of Max Timlin, because Max and Violet ... well, let's
just say they ain't done yet, either.

COLLEGE BOARD TO WIDEN ROLE, PLAY DOWN SAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   The College Board, for decades associated mostly with the test
that has held so much sway over college admissions, is redefining
its mission, recognizing that it has focused too much on the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new leader, the board now says it wants to concentrate
on preparing students for college, instead of simply measuring how
well they are prepared.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects the declining influence of the Scholastic
Assessment Test, notwithstanding the dread the SAT still inspires
in parents and students or the way it has shaped college admissions
for the last half century.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the College Board's new mission has the
potential to reshape education from kindergarten to high school.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board, which is based in New York City, has already
announced plans to start an on-line college advising and
preparation service, like Kaplan or the Princeton Review. Over the
next few years it wants to drastically expand Advanced Placement
courses, making sure they are in every school in the nation, with
curriculum preparing for Advanced Placement tests starting in
middle and junior high schools.
</P>
<P>
   The board also plans to expand membership to include hundreds of
thousands of teachers whom it wants to teach preparation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the proposed reforms may lead to changes in the SAT
that might better measure the skills needed in a new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new College Board,'' proclaimed Gaston Caperton, the
self-made millionaire and former West Virginia governor who became
president of the board in July. ``It no longer sees itself as a
gatekeeper, a tester. . . . Our mission is to prepare, inspire, and
connect students to college and to opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift is largely necessary, reflecting changes in the
demographics of who goes to college and the economics of the board
itself.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the nonprofit College Board earned most of its
operating income from the SAT, which is taken by millions of high
school students in their junior or senior years. But the average
age of college students has risen to 26.6 years, and less than half
of college students fit into the traditional ages of 18-22. With
more people taking time off before they pursue their degrees, fewer
are taking the SAT to get into college.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the College Board is losing its virtual monopoly on
testing college entrants, as almost every state has imposed a
graduation test. And public universities, which enroll 80 percent
of US college students, have started their own entrance exams, in
Massachusetts and many other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are only in the business of sorting and selecting, we'll
be out of business, because there are lots of other ways to sort
and select now,'' acknowledged Howard Everson, the board's vice
president of research.
</P>
<P>
   By expanding the Advanced Placement program, originally started
to provide a more challenging, college-level curriculum to bright
high school students, the board also increases the number paying to
take the Advanced Placement test.
</P>
<P>
   And by expanding its membership, now at about 15,000, to include
high school teachers who teach Advanced Placement courses, the
board can increase its membership dues.
</P>
<P>
   But board officials say the expansion is not purely economic.
The Advanced Placement program has the potential to raise academic
standards in the lower grades, and by becoming a larger
organization, the College Board plans to take on a larger advocacy
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the education organizations are very specific in what
they're doing,'' Caperton said. ``What we think we have is a
mission that pulls all of those people together for student
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's expected new income will also provide capital to
launch the Internet college preparation service, which Caperton
says will help get students who can't afford expensive preparation
programs to get into college.
</P>
<P>
   Building on its study of minority high achievement, started
under former College Board president Donald Stewart, the board
wants to find and promote programs that help black and Hispanic
students to achieve at the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   Everson says the board's changes may also mean changes to the
SAT, with more focus on math and verbal reasoning skills and
possibly a writing portion. However, the board emphasizes that such
changes may be far off.
</P>
<P>
   Through such changes, ``we want to be the organization that
provides access to more and more students,'' said Lee Jones, who
Caperton brought in to run the Advanced Placement program.
</P>
<P>
   That is a far cry from the beginnings of the College Board,
which started as a tweedy association of Ivy League admissions
directors who wanted the SAT to identify the best and the
brightest.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lemann, who writes about the early days of the board in
his book, ``The Big Test,'' sees two ways to interpret the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The non-cynical approach is to say that this has been a dream
rattling around the College Board for 50 years,'' Lemann said.
``There's a vision behind the SAT that involved democratically
picking the 1 percent of the population to lead, and the people who
started it didn't really care about everyone else. That's not what
the College Board top brass are into now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cynical view is that they need SAT fees to survive. From a
business standpoint, they are way too dependent on a test that's
under fire politically.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, some truth in both interpretations, board officials
concede.
</P>
<P>
   The break with the past was reflected in the choice of a new
leader. In the past, the board has chosen its presidents from a
pool of college presidents or academics, largely from the
Northeast. Caperton has no doctorate but does have a record of
success in business and in improving the educational system of one
of the poorest states in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Caperton admits to being surprised when he got a call asking him
to head the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the woman who called me said she thought it could be the
best job in education, and I think she's right,'' he said. ``Here
is a place that can impact education, that can really infect it
with things.''
</P>
<P>
   Change came quickly, with Caperton getting rid of 26 people the
first week. He announced the Internet service, which reversed a
long-held College Board tenet that preparation courses don't help
improve scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people have said about the College Board in the past is
not what the College Board is today,'' Caperton says. ``Anybody who
prepares is going to do better than somebody who doesn't prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston School Superintendent Thomas W. Payzant, chairman of the
College Board trustees, says the board has always promoted access
and equity. But he and other trustees acknowledge that the board is
shifting its emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never wanted to define ourselves as a testing agency,''
said Michael McPherson, president of Macalester College and a
trustee. ``Gaston (Caperton) came in and took the view that we're
not going to be able to do what we've always wanted to do unless we
make really fundamental changes in our methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't take a step like this we're yielding up the
responsibility to connecting kids to college to places like the
Princeton Review and Kaplan,'' McPherson says. ``We think that's
part of our mandate and we ought to be players.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The floor in Lydia Shire's kitchen is gray concrete, mottled
like a stormy sea. The ceiling is also gray, the color of
thunderclouds. The overall effect of the room is anything but dank
or chill, though.
</P>
<P>
   Between ceiling and floor is a large infusion of Shire's
favorite color _ red. A red Murano glass chandelier with
antler-shaped branches hangs over the kitchen table. The
floor-to-ceiling windows, a whole curved wall's worth, are outlined
in red steel. The stove is likewise red: It's a restored, 1940-ish
Chambers brand that Shire bought in Los Angeles before she owned a
house to put it in. Of the quartet of lighting fixtures hanging
over the island counter, just one is red: As much as Shire loves
that color, she loathes symmetry and things that match.
</P>
<P>
   People who have eaten at Shire's two celebrated Boston
restaurants, Biba and Pignoli, might feel a stab of deja vu in
seeing her home kitchen, which shares the commercial
establishments' playful design, sinuous lines, and color scheme as
carefully balanced as the flavors of a great meal. An invitation to
dine chez Shire is no longer necessary to get a glimpse of that red
stove, etc.: She's one of 26 high-profile pros featured in the
lavish new coffee-table tome ``Great Kitchens: At Home with
America's Top Chefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Shire's suburban farmhouse
</P>
<P>
   Her kitchen sits at the back of her circa 1820 Greek Revival
farmhouse in a Boston suburb. She and her husband, Uriel Pineda,
moved here in 1994, leaving their Bay Village condo in order to
find a place with a yard where their young son, Alex, could play.
The house hadn't been lived in for five years when Shire and Pineda
found it. They didn't want a place where the design was already a
fait accompli, so they asked their realtor for ``a rattletrap,''
Shire recalls, and the broker produced this classic derelict with
leaky roof and squirrels living in the walls.
</P>
<P>
   To collaborate on the complete overhaul it needed, Shire signed
on her daughter, New York architect Lisa Shire, one of three grown
children by her first marriage. The house's columned facade was
inviolate. But inside the red front door Lisa Shire created a
series of curves _ graceful bends in both walls and staircase _
that bounce the eye back to the kitchen and beyond, out those
red-rimmed windows and over the lawns, which end in woods that, at
this time of year, also oblige by turning red _ the orangey shade
that is Shire's favorite. ``I don't like reds with blue in them,''
she says. This sort of certainty made working with her mother
relatively simple, Lisa Shire says. ``Mom knew what she wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   What she wanted before she became a chef was to be an artist.
The Brookline, Mass., native went into cooking partly because she
didn't get into the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Her parents
were both commercial illustrators: A Campbell's soup ad by her
father hangs on her kitchen wall, extolling the virtues of a
steaming bowl of canned soup, a cheese sandwich on white bread, and
a big glass of milk. A page from Pignoli's menu it's not. But Dad
was also an ace cook, and little Lydia was chopping garlic for him
from the age of 4. She picked up that childhood experience later
on, enrolling in London's Cordon Bleu and then working in top
restaurants in Boston and Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Performance artist
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In her home kitchen, she's a performance artist, cooking in a
galley-shaped area that's deliberately confined, both to cut down
on the number of steps she has to take and to maximize space for
guests to meander in the rest of the room. She works at a counter
38 inches high, taller than the norm, so she doesn't have to bend
over to chop and mix. ``It's the difference between whether your
back hurts or not,'' she says. Her sink is outsize, because it
tends to fill up fast. Ditto for the 30-gallon garbage can.
</P>
<P>
   The working half of the kitchen island is covered in green-black
Ubatuba granite. ``When that tree outside turns yellow,'' she says,
looking out from the windowed wall, ``it's reflected in the
counter, which turns completely gold.'' The other half of the
counter, where guests perch, is even more visually compelling, an
irregular rounded concrete form designed by Boston artist Tom
O'Connell. This ``island'' could be in Greece, and it could be the
site of an archeology dig. Fragmentary staircases, pilasters,
canals, and windows with colored glass insets are built into this
little world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love miniatures,'' Shire says. Toothpick-size farm tools,
hatchets to shovels, adorn the arch of the kitchen fireplace where
Shire roasts meat on a multispeed spit: She serves it on an antique
wooden sled that waits nearby. A white plaster relief of tiny
kitchen tools, whisks to ladles, hangs on the wall. A 1930s German
model of a store features minute scales and bins. Shire also owns a
teensy antique toy stove you could actually light and use. (She
hasn't.)
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother says I have more tchotchkes than anyone else in the
world,'' she says, standing in the middle of Tchotchke Central,
a.k.a. her pantry. ``It gets so crowded in here that every so often
I have to edit, and send things to the basement.'' Currently
crammed onto the shelves are stoneware jars labeled ``Fly Feet''
and ``Bug Eyes''; a copper teapot so slim it's virtually 2-D,
designed to sit in a vent on the back of a wood-burning stove; a
plethora of plates of different patterns, many with gold rims,
chosen to reflect the gold-leaf ceiling in the adjacent dining
room; and an old Dutch breadbox bought because ``the color drove me
nuts,'' Shire says. ``It's close to celadon, but more intense. More
a spring green. But not quite.''
</P>
<P>
   The shelves in the pantry are held up by curly wooden brackets
that represent a rare point of disagreement between homeowner
mother and architect daughter. Lydia liked their look; Lisa wanted
something simpler, translucent and modern-looking. Lisa Shire got
her transparency, though _ in the pantry walls. Pantries, for most
people, are places to hide stuff away; this one is walled in
mesh-patterned glass that turns it into a vault to look into.
</P>
<P>
   Passion for asymmetry
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Shire's passion for asymmetry and pattern-mixing continues
in the kitchen proper, where the chairs are as diverse-looking as
the people who might sit in them and where cabinet doors and
drawers are of different sizes, with mismatched hardware. Their
wood is pale golden sycamore, with a striped grain further
complicated by little squares of ebony. The effect is jewel-box
opulent.
</P>
<P>
   As in other matters, Shire has definite views on equipment.
She'd lusted after a Chambers stove since childhood: Her aunt who
lived in Newton had one, in green. Shire's red model has its own
built-in sconces, which give it an altar-like feel. She makes
pancakes on the Chambers's griddle and makes Alex's favorite
haddock with crumb topping on the lever-operated stovetop broiler.
</P>
<P>
   The other appliances aren't period pieces. She has two huge
Gaggenau burners to accommodate oversize pots, and a Gaggenau oven
in addition to the one on the Chambers. She favors ASKO dishwashers
because they're quiet and Traulsen refrigerators because she likes
the taste of their ice.
</P>
<P>
   Fussy about major appliances, she dismisses the minor ones. ``I
hate gadgets,'' she says. ``I don't have a microwave. And a
breadmaker is the silliest thing I've ever heard of. The whole
point of making bread is the tactile sensations involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of her objection to gadgets, she says, is that ``I can't
stand clutter.'' She likes either a visual feast, as in that pantry
or the living room cabinet where she stashes her treasured
collections of glass, Murano to Japanese, or just one focal point
isolated on a table.
</P>
<P>
   An artist's passion
</P>
<P>
   The chef who couldn't get into the Museum School _ and
subsequently concluded that cooking was of course an art itself _
retains an artist's passion for putting together colors and shapes.
She's got hundreds of props, from Lady with Unicorn plates she uses
for hors d'oeuvres to the straight cylindrical Hoya glasses from
Japan she proclaims ``the sexiest champagne flutes ever.'' (Her
preferred brand is Deutz Blanc de Blancs.) Fondling a miniature
metal wheelbarrow she uses as salt cellar, Shire announces, ``When
I set my table, I have the most fun in the world. It's the biggest
high of my life.''

HAUNTED BY DIANA'S LOVER, HOWARD'S SPLIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was heartening to learn James Hewitt didn't write his memoir
of his affair with Princess Diana for the money, a reported $1
million or so, but ``as a necessary correction to the historical
record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave Diana a lot, and that seems to have been forgotten,''
Hewitt selflessly confesses in People magazine this week.
</P>
<P>
   How can we forget if he won't stop reminding us?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, indeed, he did give Diana a lot, in a manner of speaking.
We can read his most recent version of their story in his book,
which has an appropriately Barbara Cartland-ish title, ``Love and
War.'' I plan to devour it as soon as I manage to settle some of
this other stuff I've been obsessing about lately. Martha's IPO.
Pat Buchanan's ravings. My plans for the eve of the False
Millennium. And that models' eggs thing. I was so disappointed to
hear it's a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a wonderful idea. ``Beautiful struggling models,'' as
one story described the alleged donors, auctioning their eggs on
the Internet for big money. What would they be struggling with, I
wonder? Surely, not their consciences. But, of course, it turns out
they're not struggling with anything, since they don't exist, and
the whole thing is a scam.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that doesn't mean the idea isn't viable. Why shouldn't
beautiful people make the world a lovelier place by sharing their
DNA with the rest of us? Selling your eggs is no different than
selling your children, and let's be honest, who hasn't wanted to
sell theirs, on occasion?
</P>
<P>
   It would be interesting to dwell further on the possibilities of
DNA-for-sale, but I am too distressed about the Howard Stern
situation to think too much about anything else. As the entire
world knows by now, Howard and Alison, his wife of 21 years, have
split.
</P>
<P>
   The pain. The anger. The recriminations. And that's just me. God
knows what Howard is going through. And Alison? We don't hear much
about Alison. It's all about Howard, as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a crummy spouse, a burnout, and I always have been,''
Stern told his listeners on his nationally syndicated radio show
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   This admission came as a dreadful shock to the faithful fans who
assumed the Sterns had a perfect marriage. Well, that Howard, at
least, had a perfect marriage.
</P>
<P>
   What could be more ideal than Howard's situation? He makes $20
million or so a year titillating himself and his listeners _ and
his TV viewers, too _ bantering with half-dressed porn stars and
centerfold models. Then he goes home to his faithful wife.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lifestyle many men envy. Howard knows he's a role model.
``My long marriage has kept a lot of guys in line,'' he told the
New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   You have to admire the sensitivity and humility of the man, and
the degree of his self-awareness. He knows he's personally
responsible for keeping so many marriages together. The burden must
be nearly intolerable. He knows that without his marriage to look
to, his fans are bound to leave their wives and spend their days
talking to porn stars.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his career that came between him and Alison, Howard
confessed, not the bevy of sexy women he has as guests on his show.
``I think I'm married to my career in a lot of ways,'' he said on
his Monday show. How could any woman hope to compete with something
as fabulous as Howard's career?
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of the national divorce rate, I hope the Sterns
will find a way to reconcile. If she'll have him back. There's too
much at stake.

FED ANALYST SEES TECHNOLOGY PLAYING BIGGER ROLE IN ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Federal Reserve analysts said the central bank
has wrestled with how to gauge the impact of technology on the
nation's economy and has reached the concluded that it's becoming a
major influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new economy and technology are fundamentally real, it's
not hype,'' said Jack Beebe, director of research at the Federal
Reserve Bank in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a staff, we've dragged our heels on studying the impact of
technology on the economy,'' he said in an address Wednesday before
the Commonwealth Club, an organization of business and civil
leaders in San Francisco. ``But now it's leading to fundamental
shifts in our analysis and thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The government traditionally has relied on factors such as
factory production and worker output to gauge the health of the
economy. But the influence of the Internet and technology, which
allow more people to work at home and have their own businesses,
are harder to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Beebe said that many signs point to an economy that will remain
strong in the coming months, led by billions of dollars in
technology spending and investments.
</P>
<P>
   The national economy may grow at a healthy 4 percent to 5
percent clip over the next year, he said. Consumer spending may
hover at 5 percent to 6 percent. Unemployment remains low. And
labor costs and inflation are not rising dangerously.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Beebe hedged his bets and preached caution,
noting that the economy also might slow a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Factors such as a rise in long-term interest rates, higher
wages, a slower housing market and a dip in consumer buying could
slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Beebe spoke enthusiastically of the impact of computer hardware
sales on wage inflation and growth of the gross domestic product.
His conclusion? The economy will go up _ or down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, technology is fueling a huge expansion of the economy,''
he said. ``But it's also an immutable law that some day we'll have
a recession. The question is: When?''

DIGITAL SCRATCH 'N SNIFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be forewarned: This column is about a new technology that really
stinks. And if it actually works, that's a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Two California entrepreneurs, Dexster Smith and Joel Lloyd
Bellenson, have invented a form of digital Scratch 'n Sniff, making
it possible to transmit smells over the Internet. If their company,
Digiscents Inc., takes off, you will be able to send stink bombs
that really stink, receive spam that really smells like Spam, and
transmit steamy love letters that really emit the scent of, well,
steam.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like something out of a wacky sci-fi novel (or a
John Waters movie), but it isn't a hoax. The device attaches to
your computer and picks up coding embedded in Web pages, e-mail,
video games, or DVDs. It converts the digital signals into a full
spectrum of scents that breeze out of the box. The gizmo, which
won't be released until spring of 2000, is simply called iSmell.
That's not a joke either.
</P>
<P>
   The in-your-face name conjures up images of kids sending
messages sprinkled with a certain toilet water. ``Obviously, people
will get a hoot out of it for a while, but hopefully we can satisfy
the juvenile impulses enough so people can focus on it as an art
form,'' says Bellenson.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine how digital smell could be used by the
advertising industry _ as well as the adult entertainment industry.
``You had to bring that up,'' Smith says with a groan. ``Sex is a
natural thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But an art form? ``Smells transport you to another place
mentally,'' says Bellenson. ``Say you've just come back from Bali
or Paris or wherever you've been. You remember the smells of the
meat on the sticks, the incense, the diesel of the car, the bakery.
The smells intensify the memories.''
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Digiscents have even hired a staff psychologist as
vice president of research and development. ``People invest smells
with meaning,'' says Dr. Avery Gilbert, an expert in human odor
perception. ``We are going to open up a whole new area of
creativity as we take smell as a symbol and unhinge it from its
literal origins.'' A pause. ``Oh God, I sound like a French
philosopher.''
</P>
<P>
   French philosophy, it's not. But it is a scientific fact that
smell operates differently from the other senses; smells
communicate directly with the limbic system, the part of the brain
associated with emotions. As such, the addition of smell to a
multimedia event can heighten the experience. The entrepreneurs
have already created what they call ``scent tracks'' to accompany
such vintage movies as ``The Wizard of Oz,'' in which viewers can
actually smell the forest, as well as the flying monkeys. They're
not saying what perfume the Wicked Witch wears, but you can only
just imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Word has it that they're already working on a signature for
video game superstar Lara Croft. Talk about total immersion.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time the entertainment industry has flirted
with scentsational effects. Back in the 1950s, Hollywood producers
experimented with Scentavision and Smell-a-Vision, in which odors
were released in synch with a film. Needless to say, that
experiment took a quick nosedive. Then, in 1981, Waters released
his campy spoof ``Polyester,'' starring Divine and presented in
what the flamboyant director called ``Odorama.'' It was about as
high-tech as it was highbrow: Audience members received Scratch 'n
Sniff cards to be used during particularly fulsome moments.
</P>
<P>
   Bellenson, 35, never saw ``Polyester.'' ``I was never into
Scratch 'n Sniff either, but I was made fun of as a kid for having
a big nose,'' he admits. ``Really. The nose knows.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Smith came up with the idea for the iSmell when they were
vacationing at Miami's South Beach. You know the scene: beautiful
people. Scanty clothes. Sweet scents. Sensory overload. ``The
smells were hitting us, and it had a profound impact,'' Bellenson
recalls. ``It really affects your body.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Digiscents was born. ``We should get out more often,''
says Bellenson of the original epiphany. Since the company issued a
press release last week and hit the cover of Wired magazine, it has
been inundated with queries. Some callers are incredulous. Others
are fascinated. Some are horrified: Aren't those perfume ads that
fall out of magazines bad enough?
</P>
<P>
   The Digiscents partners point out that users will always have
the option of turning the device off. But Bellenson is convinced
that a new art form is about to emerge. ``This is a whole new
sensory aspect that you're not used to having stimulated,'' he
says. ``When the first telephone was developed it was bizarre. When
the phonograph came out, people thought there were little tiny
people in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone, the phonograph, and the iSmell? We're not holding
our breath, at least not yet. But if this column had a scent track,
Bellenson would be wearing Aqua de Gio, and Smith would emit the
scent of Basala by Shiseido. As for the psychologist, his scent
remains anonymous, although it's probably something French.

   Along with the rest of the world, we were thrilled to learn that
Encyclopaedia Britannica had opened its vault of information to the
world on a new free Web site. But the site was so overwhelmed with
traffic on its first day of operation that it crashed within a few
hours. The site (www.britannica.com) posted a note of apology,
reporting a ``tidal wave of activity'' and a promise to resolve the
technical problems. Luckily, we could look up ``limbic system'' the
old-fashioned way.

REMEDIES FOR CLEANING STAINED ENAMEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My 1951 cast-iron bathtub is in great shape except that it is
stained a dingy brown. I have tried bleach and other cleaners
without success. How can I get it clean?
</P>
<P>
   GLENN MEISTER, Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Cast-iron tubs will last indefinitely, but the porcelain
enamel surface does not, especially under decades of scrubbing with
abrasive cleansers containing fine sand or pumice. The abrasives
wear off the surface of the enamel, but not the enamel itself,
making it easily dirtied and difficult to clean.
</P>
<P>
   You will never restore the gloss to the enamel, but you can
clean it this way: Wet the finish with hydrogen peroxide (sold in
drugstores) and sprinkle lots of cream of tartar (sold in grocery
stores) on top. Leave it for an hour, then scrub and rinse. I think
SoftScrub will do the same, and it can be smeared heavily on the
stain.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a reader once told the handyman that Ivory shampoo will
also work. The caller had spilled a bottle of the stuff in the tub
but didn't see it until an hour or so later. Lo! Where the shampoo
was, the tub was pristine white.
</P>
<P>
   So, take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My manufactured house has an attached aluminum porch. The
aluminum ceiling is loaded with mold. I plan to power wash, then
put a light coat of insulation to keep the roof warmer than it was,
preventing condensation of water vapor on the ceiling and
subsequent growth of mold. Would that keep the mold away?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN HART, Carver, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It might, but the water vapor is likely to condense on the
walls or other parts of the porch, with mold as a consequence,
especially if the porch is closed in with windows. To get rid of
the mold, power washing is OK, but better is to wash it with a
bleach solution, then rinse, to kill the mold.
</P>
<P>
   It won't hurt to insulate the ceiling just to keep it from
getting too hot in summer. Glue inch-thick polyisocyanurate to the
ceiling. This will provide an R factor of 7, pretty good for a thin
layer of insulation.
</P>
<P>
   However, ventilation is the only way you will keep the moisture
away and prevent future mold. Put louvered vents in the walls, as
high up as possible, and put them on opposite walls to provide
cross-ventilation. Put vents in the high end of the roof if
possible. The more air flow, the less moisture and mold.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The porcelain is chipped on the old Tappan cooktop that is
set into my kitchen counter. Can it be repaired or replaced? I
called Tappan, who said there are no replacements available.
</P>
<P>
   TOO NICE TO THROW AWAY
</P>
<P>
   A. Ain't it the truth. You get a good thing and everything is
hunky-dory for a while, then when you need help, or even a part,
there is none forthcoming. It's a throwaway world, which saves
manufacturers money, but at the price of their good name.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you might try, if chipping and wearing of the
porcelain is severe, is to spray it with a high-heat-resistant
(HHR) spray enamel. It is widely sold in hardware and paint stores
in a number of colors. I suggest the HHR enamel if the cooktop gets
hot in use. If not, an ordinary latex undercoater and spray enamel
finish will do wonders. But you must sand the top thoroughly first
to make sure the primer and enamel stick.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My family room in the basement is 25 years old, and some of
the square floor tiles are broken. How can I make the floor look
relatively decent without spending a lot of money?
</P>
<P>
   TONY BARBERE, Billerica, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Those tiles are probably vinyl asbestos and should not be
fiddled with until they are analyzed for the amount of asbestos
they contain. But here is your best bet: Put the broken tiles back
where they were, then put down wall-to-wall indoor-outdoor
carpeting. The carpeting will allow water vapor rising through the
concrete to continue through the rug, where it can be ventilated
away. It was the water vapor that popped off the tiles in the first
place. There is little you can do to stop the water vapor, so you
have to accommodate it, and that is what the carpeting does.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am painting my front door, and although it is gray, it is
not a metal door. I bought latex paint. Can I use that?
</P>
<P>
   AN ANXIOUS RITA
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you can use the latex paint, if it is labeled exterior,
trim, or house paint. That gray is a prime coat. So, put on the
latex, but make sure you use thin coats. Two will do well, and
should last for many years, even 20 if the door is protected,
either under a roof or behind a storm door.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

IVY LEAGUE RACE OPENS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard and at least three other teams can thank Dartmouth for
turning the Ivy League title race into a more inclusive affair. But
the Crimson will likely display more hostility than charity when it
plays host to Dartmouth on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth (1-5 overall, 1-2 Ivy) upset Cornell, 20-17, last
week, dropping the Big Red (4-2, 3-1) into a tie with Brown (5-1,
3-1) for first place. Harvard (4-2, 2-1), Pennsylvania (3-3, 2-1),
and Yale (5-1, 2-1) are also in contention.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard scored on the game's last play to defeat Princeton,
13-6, in its fourth successive game decided by a touchdown or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team is good enough to beat you if you are not playing
with intensity and focus,'' Harvard coach Tim Murphy said
Wednesday. ``We haven't handled prosperity very well. We've played
better with our backs to the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard is only 4 points away from an unbeaten record. Brown is
5 points removed from an undefeated season. Yale is only 1 point
away from being undefeated. But the league race could open up after
this week's games: Columbia (2-4, 0-3) at Princeton (2-4, 0-3) and
Pennsylvania at Yale. Brown visits Fordham and Cornell plays host
to Wagner in nonconference games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch Dartmouth on film, they look like everyone else
in the league: very good,'' Murphy said. ``They are physical and
aggressive, and if they play like they did against Cornell it is
going to be very difficult. They have a good quarterback in Brian
Mann and their defense is strong and physical. The defense has had
a tendency to get worn out in the second half, but that was because
they were spending so much time on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard will rely on running back Chris Menick, who has 3,037
career rushing yards (36 shy of Eion Hu's school record) and the
passing combination of Brad Wilford to Terrence Patterson (122
career receptions, five short of Colby Skelton's school mark). The
Crimson have scored 143 points, 7 more than it scored last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to continue to play well on both sides of the ball,''
Murphy said. ``We had an outstanding defensive effort last week. We
ran the ball well and we have to continue to present a balanced
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that if you can run the ball you're a real football
team. That means you can compete in bad weather, tough situations.
You need to be able to run well to be a complete and confident team
and, fortunately, we can do that. We didn't throw well last week _
the wind was a factor _ but that's when you want to have a good
running team.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Cornell, Dartmouth snapped a 10-game losing streak,
scoring first on a blocked punt and stopping Cornell's passing game
with seven sacks and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is averaging 35.3 points per game behind James Perry, who
was 31 for 50 passing in a 44-37 win over Pennsylvania last week.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross (2-4, 1-1 Patriot League) will try to bounce back
from a 62-8 loss at Lehigh when the Crusaders meet St. Mary's (1-7)
in Moraga, Calif.

TIPS ON WINTERIZING YOUR HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So far, so good. We've hardly had a day or night when the heat
came on.
</P>
<P>
   But don't hold your breath. The cold will come, and it can be
pretty uncomfortable if you and your house are not ready for it.
You want to be ready so you don't run around trying to fix things
at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   And, we are not talking about just saving fuel and being snug as
a bug in your house, but also about winterizing your house and
doing things to make it survives the ravages of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a checklist to help with that preparation. Most of the
chores are easy and will not take much time, or are to be done by
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Heating systems
</P>
<P>
   If you have a heating contract (one that pays for repairs and
maintenance), your furnace or boiler has already been checked and
tuned, and that goes for the burner as well as the boiler (hot
water) or furnace (hot air) itself.
</P>
<P>
   What you can do: For a hot-air furnace, check the filters and
change them if necessary. But remember, a dirty filter is more
efficient than a clean one because it will stop more dust and other
particles. Eventually, enough dirt will build up to block the
system completely, and there goes the heat, not in your house. So
change the filter when necessary, usually three or four times a
season.
</P>
<P>
   Oil burners need checking and tuning more than gas burners.
</P>
<P>
   For wood or pellet stoves or fireplaces, have the chimney
cleaned regularly.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not getting any heat, call the pro.
</P>
<P>
   Check the chimney to make sure all flues are open. During the
off-season the chimney might have deteriorated and dropped debris
down a flue and partially blocked it. Animals and birds might have
done the same thing, without your knowing it. A chimney sweep can
inspect your chimney, and clean it if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you can do all winter long to save heat and fuel is
turn down the thermostat at night and turn it up in the morning. Of
course, getting your roommate to cooperate is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   That dilemma could be solved with a programmable thermostat,
with the changes preselected. Now if you can only agree to those
preselected changes.
</P>
<P>
   Windows
</P>
<P>
   Make sure windows are tight. Check the weatherstripping and
replace it or add new if there is none there or what is there has
deteriorated. Good weatherstripping can stop the shake, rattle, and
roll of your windows.
</P>
<P>
   You can caulk inside frames (but not the movable sash) with a
caulking gun. Avoid caulking outdoors; it may be ineffective, and
improper caulking can trap water around windows, causing decay.
</P>
<P>
   And, check the aluminum storms, if you have them. Lower or raise
them to the proper position. And the proper position is this: The
top sash goes toward the outside, the bottom sash goes toward the
inside. Sound weird? Not at all: These storms slide up and down in
grooves in the frame, making it easy to remove them for washing and
to raise and lower them according to the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes someone will lower the upper sash instead of the
bottom sash, leaving the bottom sash in the ``up'' position. If
that happens, the checkrail will be wide open and water, snow, and
cold air will go in there as sure as you can say ``darn!''
</P>
<P>
   Still confused? Look at your regular double-hung window, one
that slides up and down vertically. You will see that the top sash
is the outer sash, the bottom sash the inner sash. The storm sash
works the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the little weep holes at the bottom of the storm are
open; they should be open all year long to allow water to drain and
to keep the windows from fogging up. If they are clogged, open them
with a coat hanger wire. If there are none, make some; drill
1/8-inch holes as close as possible to the bottom of the frame
where it meets the wood sill, four inches in from each side.
</P>
<P>
   If you have no storms, you can buy and install them yourself, or
you can hire a contractor to do it. Be sure to get a quality storm;
a top-rated storm costs about $100 each.
</P>
<P>
   For a stopgap storm, buy a plastic kit, for one-time use on the
inside, for a lot less money.
</P>
<P>
   All the above applies to doors as well as windows, except for
the weepholes and plastic storm. And make sure the bottom of the
door has a good sweep or threshold that blocks leaks.
</P>
<P>
   To check the bottom seal, belly down to the floor to see if you
can see daylight through the crack. If no daylight, forget it. If
daylight shows, you have to do something about it; door bottoms are
notorious losers of heat.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to fix a leaky door bottom is to install a movable
threshold, one that pops up when the door is open, and pops down
snugly when it is closed.
</P>
<P>
   Water lines
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and don't forget to shut off your outside faucets. If they
freeze in winter, you will have a big pipe repair job.
</P>
<P>
   Most outside faucets are shut off indoors. Usually it takes just
turning the handle and opening the outside faucet so water can
drain out.
</P>
<P>
   Older faucets may require not only shutting off the inside valve
but opening a small drain cock on the faucet (one with a little cap
on it, usually turned with pliers) to allow proper drainage.
</P>
<P>
   If you do all these things, and pay attention to insulation,
caulking, and tight windows, you may find that you won't have to
turn the thermostat up so high.
</P>
<P>
   If this all turns you off, you can always move to Florida, where
people whine a lot if the temperature drops below 40. Then you can
tell them, in a superior tone, ``You ain't seen nothin' yet!''
</P>
<P>
   And, there are a few other things you should do, if you don't go
south, although they have nothing really to do with keeping warm
and saving heat, but rather making sure the house gets through the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Gutters, painting, and cracks
</P>
<P>
   Clean out the gutters; after all, they do a lot of their work in
winter, and a clogged gutter or downspout will simply not work, and
can cause backup of water under the roof shingles. Install gutter
guards to prevent more debris from clogging them.
</P>
<P>
   If there are any trim pieces with exposed bare wood, be sure to
prime and paint them before the cold really sets in. Pine, the wood
of choice for woodwork and trim, does not stand up to weather, even
for a short tme. If you can't paint it, at least try to get a coat
of primer on it before it's too cold.
</P>
<P>
   See to cracks anywhere: in driveways, sidewalks, and
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Cracks in these places will fill with water, and in winter will
freeze and expand, making the cracks bigger and bigger until major
repairs are needed.
</P>
<P>
   For asphalt pavement, fill cracks with asphalt crack filler,
which comes in a caulking cartridge for easy installation.
</P>
<P>
   For concrete, chip out the crack to at least 3/4-inch wide and
deep, and fill with mortar, packing it in compactly.
</P>
<P>
   Vertical cracks in foundations are less likely to cause
problems, so can be left alone, as long as they are not leaking.
</P>
<P>
   OK, this all should keep you busy for the weekend.

ELECTRONIC BANKING FITS THE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's getting tough to be a member of the Internet elite, now
that 40 percent of Americans are on line. Snobs like me find it
more difficult to stand apart from the common herd. Almost every
time I learn of some flashy Internet service, it turns out many of
you have gotten there ahead of me.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's on-line banking, a wonderfully useful concept
that most of you have ignored. It seems that only 4.5 percent of us
paid bills over the Internet last year, according to the Yankee
Group, a Boston research firm. I'm one of that happy few; I began
using an on-line banking service in 1996, and I've never regretted
it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm not quite at the cutting edge. I don't use one of
the true Internet banks, like Security First Network Bank. Now
owned by Royal Bank of Canada, Security First (www.sfnb.com) was
the first bank to exist entirely on line. No offices, no vaults, no
teller windows, nothing but Net. No thanks.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer the reassurance of bricks and mortar. But my bank, like
dozens of others, allows me to check balances and write checks from
my home computer, with the aid of Intuit Corp.'s Quicken financial
software package.
</P>
<P>
   When bills show up in the mailbox, I start up Quicken. The
addresses and account numbers are already typed in. I just fill in
the amounts, weep quietly over my depleted bank balance, then log
onto the Net and electronically issue the payments.
</P>
<P>
   And here's where it gets interesting. If you're paying bills
electronically, shouldn't the money arrive instantly, sort of like
an e-mail message? Well, it doesn't. Many companies have no way of
accepting electronic payments. In that case, Intuit sends the
payments to a facility in Utah, which prints and mails the checks.
If you're paying your local plumber, the payment would arrive
quicker if you'd mailed it yourself. You may need to pay your bills
earlier if you do it electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Some big companies now accept direct electronic payments, which
helps, but not as much as you'd think. Electronic payments are
handled by a clearinghouse system that processes the data in
batches. Your payment won't just get zapped directly to the phone
company _ it still has to ``clear.'' And that can take a couple of
days.
</P>
<P>
   So why bother with electronic bill payment? The sheer
convenience of it. Your software remembers addresses, account
numbers, and amounts; you have a permanent record of the bills
you've paid. Sending out a new batch of checks is as easy as
pushing a few buttons.
</P>
<P>
   It's so convenient, in fact, that a horde of companies are
offering up Net-based bill payment systems that don't require
special software like Quicken. Any old Web browser will do.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Funds &AMP; Data Corp. of Southampton, N.Y., offers a
service called Jackdough (www.jackdough.com) that aims to create a
new generation of electronic bankers. Jackdough is available
exclusively to college students. And unlike other computer
bill-paying services, it's free. The site provides links to music
and book stores, and even a credit counseling service. Chief
executive Gary Glanz is hoping to turn young kids into lifelong
customers, then try to peddle them mortgages and car loans when
they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-profile competitor, Paytrust.com of Princeton,
N.J., hopes to transform the bill-paying process.
</P>
<P>
   For $7.95 a month, Paytrust subscribers won't get bills in the
mail. Instead, they all go straight to Paytrust (www.paytrust.com),
which displays them on an encrypted, password-protected Web page.
The system also fires off an e-mail notice. To make a payment, the
user types in the amount and the payment date. Paytrust deducts the
money from an existing bank account. Users can even tell the
service to make certain payments automatically _ rent or mortgage,
say.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also trying to take the next step in the process
_ the complete elimination of paper bills. They're working to
develop a system to let companies submit their bills
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   With computers in more than half of all homes, it's a mystery to
me why we aren't all using some form of on-line banking. And yet,
if everybody did it, it just wouldn't be as cool.

<P>
   It almost seems like a law of nature. Computers, and other
high-tech devices that rely on microchips, just keep getting
faster, smaller, and more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the same can't be said about batteries. The most
powerful laptop computer or the most stylish cell phone is useless
unless its battery pack can deliver a long-lasting stream of power.
But experts in the electronics industry admit that today's
batteries fall short. Worse yet, they warn that a major improvement
is nowhere in sight. And that means that electronic devices meant
to liberate us from our desktops still leave us chained to the wall
socket.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a practical solution in view that would provide a
dramatic increase'' in battery performance, says Antoni Gozdz,
chief battery scientist at Telcordia Technologies Inc., formerly
Bellcore, a research arm of the old nationwide Bell telephone
system.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Gozdz and his colleagues are giving up. From the campus
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to the labs of the
world's top battery makers, scientists are tinkering with an array
of advanced materials. They're hoping to find a magical combination
of elements that could produce a steady stream of electrical power
from a package that's smaller and lighter than today's batteries.
</P>
<P>
   And they've made progress. Morristown, N.J.-based Telcordia, for
instance, played a major role in developing the most common type of
rechargeable battery used in today's phones and computers. These
batteries deliver two to three times the power of early
rechargeable batteries. But they still don't provide enough juice
to run the typical laptop on a flight from Boston to San Francisco,
let alone deliver long-term power to next-generation devices such
as cell phones that display color Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing improvement in electronics performance is driven by
Intel Corp. cofounder Gordon Moore's famous dictum that the number
of transistors that can be squeezed onto a chip _ and hence the
chip's computing power _ will double every 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But while the chipmakers revel in the benefits of Moore's Law,
battery makers are governed by statutes that are far less
forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is electrochemistry, not pure electronics. So there are
limiting factors,'' says Ian Irving, executive vice president of
Battery Engineering Inc. in Canton, which makes specialized
rechargeables for the military.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been pushing against the limits of batteries for
two centuries. The first modern one was devised in 1800 by an
Italian scientist with a familiar-sounding name _ Alessandro Volta.
</P>
<P>
   A battery is basically an electrical generator that uses a
chemical reaction instead of a mechanical dynamo to create current.
Two electrodes, made of materials with different electrical
charges, such as zinc and carbon, are immersed in an electrolyte, a
substance that transmits electricity. If you attach a wire between
the two electrode, electrons begin to flow. And you can run an
electrical device by tying it into this circuit. It's like carrying
packaged electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, you have to carry the package around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I just wanted to get myself about five amp-hours of
electrons, it weighs almost nothing. It's all the other stuff,''
says Don Sadoway, a professor of materials science at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other stuff'' includes electrodes large enough to produce
plenty of current. There's also the electrolyte, which is usually a
liquid or gel. And then there's the ``battery can,'' a case that
must be able to hold everything together without allowing the
often-toxic electrolyte to leak out. As much as 30 percent of a
battery's weight comes from the can, which produces no power at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Tote it all up, and then factor in the amount of juice the
battery produces. The resultant figure, called ``energy density,''
is the amount of power per ounce delivered by the battery.
</P>
<P>
   Batteries have definitely improved in this area. Today's
alkaline batteries are far more powerful than older batteries of
the same size, made using carbon and zinc. In the realm of
rechargeables, most portable devices now use a chemistry based on
the element lithium, along with oxidized cobalt dipped in an
electron-friendly gel. These ``lithium ion'' batteries have more
than twice the energy density of the older nickel-cadmium
rechargeables.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest laptop computers, like an old Radio Shack
TRS-80, would run for quite a long time with one of today's lithium
ion batteries. But the TRS-80 had a drab black-and-white display,
and no hard drive or DVD drive to rapidly drain the battery.
Meanwhile, growing numbers of cellular phones and pocket digital
devices like the PalmPilot are adding features such as color
display screens and the ability to get e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want full-color displays, they want to be able to read
text, they want to go to wireless Internet,'' says MIT's Sadoway.
``We're going to find that we have a very powerful wireless device
that runs for an unacceptable period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Electrical engineers have taken pity on their electrochemist
brethren. They're trying to ease the pressure by finding ways to
increase computing power without increasing electrical consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have maintained essentially the same active power level on
our microprocessors'' since 1997, says Intel Corp. vice president
Frank Spindler, who oversees marketing of Santa Clara, Calif.-based
Intel's chips for portable computers. For one thing, Intel _ along
with nearly everybody else _ is moving to new manufacturing
processes to make their chips much smaller. Simply reducing the
size of the chip cuts its power consumption.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Intel has come up with some impressive
energy-saving tricks. The mobile versions of the company's Pentium
II and Pentium III chips actually power themselves down for
fractions of a second whenever they're idle. Type a word on one of
these laptops, and the processor will go to sleep between your
keystrokes.
</P>
<P>
   Gimmicks like these help extend battery life. But they do
nothing to transcend the basic limits of battery technology. The
battery guys keep plugging away, but they warn that there are no
Moore's Law-type miracles in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Irving of Battery Engineering can't conceive of a practical
battery material that will outperform today's lithium-based
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anything that has the capability of producing
batteries necessarily any more capable than lithium,'' says Irving.
``The raw material currently doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that lithium batteries can't be improved. MIT's Sadoway and
others are working on a variation of the concept _ lithium polymer
batteries with an electrolyte that's solid instead of liquid. Such
a battery won't need the heavy battery can. Sadoway foresees
batteries the thickness of a potato chip bag; he's even made a
prototype capable of running a transistor radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea is to make the battery so small and light, you don't
even have a battery compartment any more,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lithium polymer batteries don't actually produce more
power than existing rechargeable battery technology. Chuck
Kuhlmann, lead battery technologist for IBM Corp. in Raleigh, N.C.,
says the energy densities of batteries will have to increase by a
factor of 10 to keep up with the stuff he and his colleagues would
like to invent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that we'll get a breakthrough,'' Kuhlmann says.
But he has no idea where it will come from.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four men sit at a table playing cards. Like a male version of
the war council scene in the film ``Jungle Fever,'' where a group
of women engage in frank talk about men, the guys discuss their
ideal woman.
</P>
<P>
   Lance is looking for an angel who will forgo her career in favor
of marriage and children. For Quentin, there is no ideal, he plows
through women like a lawn mower. Murch doesn't mind having a
powerful mate who makes more money than him. And Harper's friends
call him the serial monogamist.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion is one that any group of male friends could have.
But in this case, the four men are African-Americans in the
romantic comedy ``The Best Man,'' which opened last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which was number one at the box office and made $9
million during its first week of release, centers on Harper (Taye
Diggs), an author whose dishy novel is peppered with characters and
experiences based on his college days. The book causes Harper's
school buddies to address issues of fidelity, friendship, and love
when they reunite in New York for Lance's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   With scenes like the card game, ``The Best Man'' delves into
relationships in a realistic way that camp sex comedies like
``Booty Call,'' ``Sprung,'' and ``How To Be A Player'' have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for women it's a real (chance) to peek into a world
that they rarely get to see,'' says Malcolm Lee, writer and
director of ``The Best Man.'' `` `Is this what they talk about? Is
that how they talk?' And the answer is, `Yes, we do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Movies aren't the only medium dissecting male/female
connections. An increasing number of songs, television shows, and
books are examining relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Hit songs like TLC's ``No Scrubs'' and Destiny's Child's
``Bills, Bills, Bills'' denounce men with no money. The
relationship book ``What Brothers Think, What Sistahs Know''
entered the Black Board Bestseller List, which tracks sales of
African-American books, at number one when it was published earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the BET cable channel debuted the first of 10
feature films based on the African-American romance novel line,
Arabesque. And ``The Best Man'' follows on the heels of ``The
Wood,'' a $6 million film that has made $25 million since its July
debut. Both movies are ensemble comedies centering on young male
friends who explore the complexities of romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relationships are a good subject matter,'' says Lee, 29.
``People are trying to figure out why men do this and why women are
like that. It's a wonder how we even hook up in the first place. So
I think there's a lot of gold to be mined there.''
</P>
<P>
   African-American films tend to be released in genre waves, says
Todd Boyd, a professor of critical studies at the University of
Southern California's School of Cinema and Television. There were
the blaxploitation films of the 1970s, the inner-city ``hood''
films of the early 1990s, and the hip-hop sex comedies of the late
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' and ``The Wood'' may be the beginning of a new
genre cycle, says Boyd, who co-wrote the screenplay for ``The
Wood.'' ``But I think instead of having one genre be popular at one
time, we need to have multiple genres popular at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Love has always had a place in African-American films, but it's
usually been a peripheral position. In recent years, a smattering
of films, like ``Boomerang,'' ``Love Jones,'' ``Soul Food,'' and
``Waiting to Exhale,'' have put the spotlight on relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there's still a feeling that when positive romances are
depicted on the large and small screen, viewers are seeing
something rare.
</P>
<P>
   Eriq LaSalle took the writers of the television series ``ER'' to
task earlier this year because the show didn't portray healthy
relationships between blacks. LaSalle's character, Dr. Peter
Benton, had an affair with a married African-American woman, then
had a child out of wedlock with another black woman.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Chiles, co-author of ``What Brothers Think, What Sistahs
Know,'' sees how such images affect children. He teaches a writing
program for teenagers on weekends with his co-author and wife of
two years, Denene Millner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They truly think that this is the way things work,'' says
Chiles as Millner sings the chorus of ``Bills, Bills, Bills,'' a
song where a woman asks her boyfriend pay her bills or pack his
bags. ``To have a counter to that like `The Best Man' is so very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The stereotypes perpetuated in songs and television can have a
larger impact, as well, adds Diggs, who made his film debut in
another romance, ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get pigeonholed into thinking this is how black people are
if you only have only one representation of them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, cousin of filmmaker Spike Lee, says ``The Best Man'' was
inspired by ``The Big Chill,'' ``Diner,'' and ``Waiting to
Exhale.'' It's filled with African-American professionals,
something that Lee, a graduate of Georgetown University and New
York University's film school, felt he hadn't seen often on
television or in movies.
</P>
<P>
   There's the ambitious television producer Jordan Armstrong (Nia
Long), who draws criticism from her male friends for pursuing a
career rather than love. The author (Diggs) who leaves his
girlfriend Robin (Sanaa Lathan) in love limbo because he hasn't
gotten over his college crush (Long). And there are Lance (Morris
Chestnut) and Quintin (Terrence Howard) who have a long history of
sleeping around and push Harper to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' gave Millner, 31, a feeling of familiarity she
hadn't felt since she saw ``Love Jones,'' a 1997 film about a
Chicago couple doing the mating dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way my friends and I act,'' she says. ``We fall in
love, we have relationships, we fall out of love, we have
friendships, we bond, we fight, we get mad, we get glad. But it's
so rare to see it on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some characters Chiles, 34, found stereotypical, like
Lance and Quentin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always have the dog in there trying to push everyone to
be unfaithful,'' he says. ``I'm not sure that guys do that to each
other. Guys stay out of relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   But the film's take on professional women was on point, Millner
says: ``When we're out talking to audiences (on book tours), `Why
can't black men deal with strong black women?' turns into an
hourlong discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee is so confident relationships will continue to transfix
people that he's already writing another romantic comedy for
Universal Pictures, the studio that released ``The Best Man.''
Tentatively titled ``Sex and the Married Man,'' the film, Lee
promises, will delve even deeper into the eternal conundrum of love
between the sexes.

VAMPING WITH JAMES MARSTERS 
</HEADLINE>

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of James
Marsters in a scene from ``Angel.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    James Marsters likes vampires as much as the next guy _ he just
never counted on making his living playing one.
 &HT;    But as the ferocious Spike on both ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
and ``Angel,'' the 28-year-old actor is doing precisely that.
 &HT;    ``How could I imagine any of this?'' Marsters says by telephone
from his ``Buffy'' trailer during a lunch break. ``Spike was
supposed to die within three to five episodes. The original idea
was that I was kind of an ornament for Dru (Juliet Landau). Angel
(David Boreanaz) would go and kill me, presumably as one of his
first acts of evil, then take Dru as his new paramour.
 &HT;    ``So I was very surprised to be asked to come back after my
fifth `Buffy' episode,'' he says. ``I think (series creator/writer)
Joss Whedon just said, `You don't suck so bad.'''
 &HT;    Actually, Marsters sucked so well that Whedon kept summoning the
Slayer-slaying vamp. Spike _ whose penchant for torturing people
with railroad spikes inspired his nickname _ wreaked havoc
throughout much of season two, beginning with ``School Hard.''
 &HT;    He was eventually left burned to a crisp and wheelchair-bound,
but recovered enough to raise some hell in season three's ``Lovers
Walk.'' Now that Angel has landed his own show, Whedon elected to
spike ``Buffy'' with more Spike.
 &HT;    Starting on Nov. 16, with the episode entitled ``The
Initiative,'' Marsters joins ``Buffy'' as a regular, co-starring
with title slayer Sarah Michelle Gellar. He'll also make his bite
felt on ``Angel,'' guest-starring on another one or two episodes
during that series' freshman season.
 &HT;    So what's on tap on ``Buffy'' _ besides a new gal (Mercedes
McNab as Harmony) and a likely visit from a sure-to-be-jealous Dru?
 &HT;    ``I don't know,'' Marsters says. ``I don't mean to be an
a--hole, but I really only get details script to script. Also, I'm
shackled by Joss' need for secrecy, which I completely respect _ as
a storyteller, he needs to be able to deal the cards as he wants
to.
 &HT;    ``Suffice it to say that I was more evil and violent than ever
in the `Buffy'/`Angel' crossover, and we'll take it from there,''
he says. ``Whatever happens with Spike, he'll be the same on both
`Buffy' and `Angel.' Everything will be the same _ the hair, the
makeup, the attitude.
 &HT;    ``I haven't been on Buffy's side so far, but I assume that
something will have to change or they'll have to stake me,''
Marsters adds. ``I've given up trying to second-guess what they're
going to put on my plate, because every time I think I know where
they're going, they go in the exact opposite direction and, of
course, mine much more gold than I ever would have found.
 &HT;    ``If it were up to me,'' he concludes, ``I'd only be killing a
lot of people and quipping. And they're taking the character in a
lot of different directions.''
 &HT;    Though the California native counts among his credits episodes
of ``Northern Exposure'' and the as-yet-unreleased indie feature
``Winding Roads,'' he's done his share of genre work: ``Buffy''
buffs remember his guest-star spot in a ``Millennium'' hour and
know that he appears briefly in the upcoming horror flick ``The
House on Haunted Hill.''
 &HT;    Right now, though, Spike is Marsters' calling card.
 &HT;    ``People who meet me on the street want me to bite them,''
Marsters says. ``I'll get girls who say, `Bite here, baby!' _ and
then my girlfriend kicks their a--.
 &HT;    ``In general, I get a lot of `You look like Spike' comments,''
he says. ``People think the character is British _ and I, of
course, am not _ so they'll inch forward and listen to my accent,
and sometimes they'll get a disappointed look in their eyes and
leave.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes they'll come up to me and say I look like Spike.''
Marsters adds. ``I'll turn around and say, `But, love, I am
Spike.'''

HOW TO AVOID DANGER BEHIND THE WHEEL OF AN SUV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started with the cop in the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   She was a good driver, track-trained in what cops like to call
``pursuit of the suspect vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time, when the screaming motorcycle passed her, going
in the opposite direction on a rural stretch of Vermont road, she
was driving an SUV. Now SUVs are practical members of many police
and fire department fleets. But you can't drive them like cars, as
the Vermont cop found out, and SUV owners should know.
</P>
<P>
   She went into a three-point turn, trying to reverse direction
and catch the speeding motorcycle. The next thing she knew, she was
in the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Baffled by what had happened, her chief called Bud Stanley, a
partner at Stevens Advanced Driver Training in Merrimack, N.H. The
Stevens staff has taught lots of cops to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, watching SUV wrecks down the years, had already
developed an anecdotal theory about a key danger inherent in SUVs.
Using the cop's car, he put it to the test.
</P>
<P>
   He drove 45 miles per hour on an airport runway, hit the brakes
hard, and turned to make a lane change. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Did the same thing again, but this time, he turned first, then
hit the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I knew, I was off the road and 75 feet out into
the grass,'' Stanely recalls.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs, he says, can be dangerous to drive; dangerous because they
have high centers of gravity, high roll axis, stiff frames, and
unforgiving suspension systems. People who buy them _ looking for
car-like feel, perceived added safety, and the ability to carry
lots of passengers _ often ignore one important characteristic.
They are basically trucks. And they drive like trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Put yourself behind the wheel of a big SUV. You are doing 50
miles per hour on the Southeast Expressway. You are distracted for
a moment and when you look back out the windshield, you are racing
upon a slow truck. With your hands on the wheel and your foot on
the gas, your first instinct, and quickest option, is to steer away
from the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more danger, the greater tendency to crank the wheel,''
says Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Only after turning the wheel do you try to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   And now you are in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Car wrecks are all about the transfer of weight and energy, and
because you're driving a heavy SUV, it's Transfer City.
</P>
<P>
   Say the sharp turn you have just made is to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Your vehicle's weight will shift in two ways. First, it goes
cross-axle, from the inside of the turn to the outside. This is
accompanied by a diagonal shift, from the inside rear tire to the
outside front tire. Physics at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you've got an enormous weight transfer going on,'' says
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   When you hit the brakes after you initiate your turn, you
accelerate and amplify this transfer to that one tire. Now it is
the primary tire for both braking and steering the auto. Trouble
City.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, says Stanley, one of two things happens.
</P>
<P>
   The frightened driver freezes and the car carves an unyielding
arc right off the road. Bad on the Expressay, bad on a tree-lined
country lane.
</P>
<P>
   Or, the driver tries to correct and steers back the other way.
All the pent-up energy that has settled down on the outside front
tire is now released as it unweights. It moves to the other side of
the car, is amplified by the car's motion, and shifts to the
outside of the new turn. There is a good chance you will now roll
over.
</P>
<P>
   So besides the braking-steering mistake, what went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   First, consider the ABS brakes. After your first mistake, with
most of the weight on the front outside tire, you have to rely on
the other three tires to save you. If you could lock them up, you'd
probably skid, but you'd get a gradual pullback of some of that
weight, and you wouldn't carve that wide arc off the road.
</P>
<P>
   But because the three tires whose help you need are unweighted,
ABS won't let them lock up. They are of little use to you as they
spin-clamp, spin-clamp merrily along.
</P>
<P>
   Second, when you try to correct, you are transferring weight
back through a truck-like ladder frame. Rigid and nonabsorbing. To
understand this, stand with an aluminum ladder at your feet,
running away from you. Reach down and grab the bottom of one leg
and lift it. Do you sense an equal redistribution of weight to the
other three leg ends? Or do you sense a diagonal shift to one far
leg, accompanied by a shift to the opposite side of the ladder from
the one whose leg you are holding?
</P>
<P>
   Back to the SUV. Weight is shifting, pent-up energy is being
released by coil springs and in some cases leaf springs.
</P>
<P>
   Now keep in mind that this is happening in a top-heavy vehicle.
The motor, transfer cases, transmission are all up high. Not to
mention the tall passenger cab.
</P>
<P>
   This gives you a lot of weight rotating on a high roll axis.
</P>
<P>
   Roll axis? If a car rolls over, there is a point in its circle
that, as you look at it straight ahead or from behind, does not
move _ an imaginary axle. If you put a skewer dead center through
an apple, the apple would be stable, right? What if you put the
skewer through the apple one third of the way from its outer rim
and the core? Hold the skewer with the upper two-thirds of the
apple above this axis and see how stable it is. Fruit as SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that cars will have the same initial reaction to
the incorrect steer-brake sequence. But cars are lighter so there
is less energy being thrown around; they do not sit as high; their
roll axes are far lower.
</P>
<P>
   But many of us drive SUVs and we like them.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do?
</P>
<P>
   First, don't drive them like a car. They may feel like a car _
all those fancy interiors, the quiet, smooth ride down the freeway
_ but until they evolve (as many are doing) they remain trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Don't drive them fast. It takes a longer time to slow them, and
in a crash situation speed increases energy and weight shift.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tailgate. Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   And if you do get into trouble and have to avoid a crash, do
this:
</P>
<P>
   Slam on the brakes fast and hard and keep them on. Don't pump
them because this confuses your ABS system. This puts weight on
both front tires as suspensions contract up there. Then steer away
from whatever it is you are trying to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not guaranteed success, but you'll have the best
opportunity to miss whatever's ahead of you and keep your car under
control,'' says Stanley.

TESTING THE NEW `PRINTER/COPIERS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Multifunction devices that combine a flatbed scanner with a high
quality color inkjet printer seem to make a lot of sense. Called
``printer/copiers,'' these devices save on desk space and give you
the ability to make a copy even if your computer is turned off. But
they have not been wildly successful in the marketplace. Xerox is
trying to change that this fall, with two new multifunction systems
aimed at home users and small businesses. Although I can't
recommend these machines, it's instructive to learn from Xerox's
mistakes _ especially if you are in the market for a scanner or a
multifunction system.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox's two machines are the XK35c and the Xi70c. Priced at $399
and $499, respectively, each looks like a standard desktop copier,
with lift-up top that covers a glass surface, room for a stack of
paper on the bottom, and front panels with several controls. But
unlike traditional photocopiers, they work by scanning the original
and then printing the copy on a built-in inkjet printer. The front
panel controls let you control the resolution of the copy, the
darkness, the number of copies, and whether the copy will be full
color or black and white.
</P>
<P>
   But similarities between the XK35c and the Xi70c are only
skin-deep. These two machines were developed by different product
groups at Xerox. They are based on different printer mechanisms,
use different software, and have different problems.
</P>
<P>
   The XK35c is designed for home users. It can connect to your
computer with either a parallel printer cable or a Universal Serial
Bus interface. Xerox says the printer can put out eight pages per
minute in black and white or three pages per minute in color. Don't
believe it. In my tests, the printer produced just one page per
minute when printing black-and-white text, and required 2 1/2
minutes to make a single color copy. Once the image is scanned,
additional copies come somewhat faster, but still nowhere near the
claimed speed.
</P>
<P>
   Installing the XK35c was problematic. Although the USB is
supposed to be plug-and-play, Xerox's software wouldn't work
properly unless I first inserted the CD-ROM and ran the installer
program, rebooted my system, then plugged the printer into my
computer. But once everything was in place, the printer functioned
reasonably well.
</P>
<P>
   The XK35c scanner, by contrast, didn't work well at all. Because
it uses TWAIN, the software is supposed to let you use the scanner
from any Windows application. In my experience, though, the XK35c's
TWAIN driver occasionally crashed and refused to work until I
rebooted my computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Xi70c is designed for business users. It is larger than the
XK35c, has a faster print engine, and has ink cartridges that hold
more ink than the XK35c. In what I think is a major oversight, the
Xi70c doesn't have a USB interface. The first Xi70c that Xerox sent
me arrived damaged; I'm not sure whether this reflects a poor
choice of shipping companies (Xerox used DHL) or a fragile print
assembly, but it is the first piece of equipment that I've received
in the past three years that was damaged in shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the Xi70c to run with my desktop system was a nightmare.
I tried for several hours and never got it to print or scan. Xerox
said there probably was a conflict between some program on my
desktop and the machine. I had better luck when I installed the
printer software on my laptop. But even on the laptop, the scanner
software remained nonfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going with one of these Xerox multifunction devices,
another choice is to simply buy a traditional inkjet printer and a
se low-cost desktop scanner. This gives you all the same
features as the Xerox machines except the convenience of making a
copy without turning on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   One new scanner that deserves particular mention is IBM's new
IdeaScan 2000. It's lightweight, low profile, full-color, and
100-percent USB. (If you don't have a USB interface for your
desktop computer, buy one: They cost less than $60 each.) The
scanner has an optical resolution of 600 x 1200 dots per inch,
fairly typical as scanners go. There are five attractive
push-buttons on its front: one performs a scan, one cancels the
scan, and the other three provide one-button access to copying,
faxing, and a program of your choice. The scanner costs $169 and
can be ordered from IBM's Web site, www.ibm.com/shop.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has done a pretty good job with its TWAIN software: I had no
problems using the scanner's driver from a number of different
programs. The scanner also comes with a version of PaperPort, which
is magnificent for scanning and managing scanned images.
</P>
<P>
   Integrated machines such as the Xerox XK35c and Xi70c have a lot
of promise. I really enjoyed the ability to drop a piece of paper
onto the glass, push a button, and get a copy.
</P>
<P>
   But as general peripherals for a desktop computer, the
all-in-one machines still have significant problems. With color
becoming more important for both business and at the home, it makes
sense to have both a scanner and a color copier. For now, however,
I recommend that you keep these machines in separate boxes.

DRUG `STORIES' ACTUALLY MAY GIVE BUSH A LIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This summer, George W. Bush looked like a prizefighter slumping
into the ropes. On the nagging issue of past cocaine use, Bush
began drawing movable lines in the sand. First, he hadn't used
drugs in seven years. Then he amended it to 25 years. It was the
kind of backing, filling, and parsing that invites
character-hunting journalists in for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a few months later _ given the fresh fiasco over the book
``Fortunate Son'' and its now-disbelieved allegations of a 1972
Bush cocaine bust _ Bush's strategy looks like the ``Rope-a-dope''
tactic Muhammad Ali used to knock out George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   With every mighty swing that fails to produce legitimate
evidence of a Bush-cocaine link, the media not only damage their
credibility, they make Bush appear to be the victim of a witch hunt
while taking the political sting out of the drug issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the story has gone so well for Bush, I suspect he's
driving it,'' notes Craig Crawford, editor of the political Hotline
newsletter. ``It makes him look like he's been hounded by the
irresponsible media . . . It's all about the messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a story that seems to have leapfrogged the simple
question of whether there is any truth to it or not,'' adds Paul
Taylor, the former journalist who once asked presidential candidate
Gary Hart whether he committed adultery and who is now executive
director of the Alliance for Better Campaigns. ``The only thing
that's going to make this an interesting story is a set of facts.
And that hasn't arrived yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest chapter in this saga began to unravel last week with
the anonymously sourced drug allegations in ``Fortunate Son.''
While many news outlets didn't bite at that tidbit, Bush's
subsequent denials made headlines everywhere. Yet, those denials
paled in comparison to the damage done to ``Fortunate Son'' when
publisher St. Martin's Press recalled the book after it was learned
that author J. H. Hatfield was a former convict who once hired a
hitman. And on Tuesday, St. Martin's editor in chief Robert Wallace
resigned over the ``Fortunate Son'' fallout (see accompanying
story). In an e-mail posted on The Drudge Report, Hatfield
complained that he has become the victim of a ``smear campaign''
and ``character assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The (`Fortunate Son') incident could not have been designed
better by the Bush campaign itself,'' says ``Feeding Frenzy''
author Larry Sabato. ``It's hard to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent false alarm notwithstanding, unsubstantiated
allegations of Bush drug use have managed to reverberate inside the
media culture for months. In May, The Wall Street Journal ran an
extraordinary piece investigating the rumors and concluding that no
one had yet offered ``a shred of proof.'' Still, that didn't stop
the paper from rehashing gossip that Bush had used cocaine at his
father's inauguration. And jokes about the Texas governor's drug
use are now a staple of Jay Leno's ``Tonight Show'' shtick.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, all this public airing of a rumor may have the
effect of desensitizing voters to the once potentially explosive
subject of drug use by a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when the Exxon Valdez spills oil all over Alaska.
And the Exxon stock doesn't change, and someone says it's already
been factored into the market,'' says Brookings Institution senior
fellow Stephen Hess. ``I have the same feeling in political terms.
The (Bush drug matter) has already been factored into the market.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Quinnipiac College poll revealed that by a 56-41
percent majority, voters felt they had a right to know about a
candidate's past cocaine use. But that was viewed as a less urgent
matter than news of a candidate cheating on taxes, avoiding
military service, and having past alcohol problems. And in a
September Pew Research Center poll, only 35 percent felt that
cocaine use by a politician almost always merited media scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers suggest that this apparent tolerance on the
cocaine issue is a reflection of changing mores and the legacy of
Bill Clinton's foibles of the flesh. But Taylor disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we becoming more like the French?,'' he says. ``There's no
question we've been exposed to more. But I don't think our
fundamental character has changed that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the explanation lies in the column that Arizona Republic
reader advocate Richard de Uriarte wrote this week criticizing the
media for running the kind of ``shaky'' sex and scandal story
``that only confuses and desensitizes people.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford puts it another way. ``You know who'd be the most
regretful'' to see the media stop publishing gossip and rumor about
drug use, he asks? ``The Bush campaign.''

MERCURY SABLE IS DISTINCTLY AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There used to be a joke that a Mercury is just a Ford with the
bolts torqued tighter.
</P>
<P>
   It was based on the perception _ correct in many cases _ that
American cars were inferior to foreign models and that little
differentiated one domestic from another.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thanks in part to that foreign pressure, Americans
shopping for domestic autos have plenty of quality from which to
choose, even as many of these cars remain distinctly American in
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Mercury Sable LS is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Redesigned this year _ lowered at nose and rear, a smooth line
running up over windshield and high roof and linking the ends in a
graceful arc _ the sedan is a sleeker looking car than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Sable comes as a wagon, as well, and engine options include
a pair of 3.0 liters, one turning out 153 horsepower, the other,
200 horsepower. With the bigger engine I got just over 24 miles per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the car is big, broad American. In the LS model tested,
the leather seats are wide and firm, essentially five bucket seats.
The thigh support up front is very good, though bucket seats need
better lateral support ridges than the Sable seats offer.
</P>
<P>
   The dash is deep up top and angles away nicely below, affording
plenty of legroom up front. Rear legroom is ample, as well.
</P>
<P>
   A new feature _ one that ought to catch on everywhere _ is
height adjustment (about 3 inches) on the gas and brake pedals.
Push a button on the side of the driver's seat and the pedals come
to or move away from you. For short drivers, this means they no
longer have to move the seat far forward, pushing themselves right
up to the steering wheel and bluntly in the way of an exploding
airbag.
</P>
<P>
   Further safety enhancements include front and side airbags, seat
belt pretensioners, belt use sensors, a driver's seat position
sensor, and two inflation levels for the airbags, depending on the
severity of a crash. Also sure to become standard across the
industry, the Sable has an interior emergency trunk release.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumentation is spartan in a simple, good way. Fuel,
tachometer, speedometer, and engine temperature are in the display
behind the wheel. Window controls, door locks, and mirror controls
are on the driver's door. In the center grouping on the dash,
arranged horizontally one above the other are audio controls up
top, climate controls below.
</P>
<P>
   Interior bins are adequate _ no large atlases, fine for standard
folding maps _ and the trunk is cavernous. A 60/40 split rear seat
allows for longer parcels and items.
</P>
<P>
   The LS Premium came with the DOHC, 24-valve, Duratec V6 engine.
Because of composite cam covers and intake manifold, it is 30
pounds lighter than the standard V6, yet cranks out 47 more
horsepower. Another sign of emerging quality: Tuneups come at
100,000-mile intervals.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is a four-speed automatic with adaptive shift control,
and in testing it ran itself up and down the gears smoothly and
click-free.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury, looking to lessen compartment noise, installed a
lightweight instrument panel insulator, designed to absorb sound
rather than just attempt to repel it. The repel method can lead to
vibrations and rattles, and the new insulation works quite well.
Engine noise was minimal, and even during rapid acceleration the
engine _ muffled through a single exhaust engineered to keep the
same backflow as the dual system it replaces _ was a distant
burble.
</P>
<P>
   Wind noise, however, was another matter, and it was so
encompassing it was hard to tell if it was coming from mirrors,
windows, or the sunroof.
</P>
<P>
   The engine was plenty powerful _ I'm not sure I'd be happy with
the lesser mill in this car _ and pulled the Sable up steep hills,
and in and out of highway traffic, with confident surges.
</P>
<P>
   My only performance complaint _ and I've noticed this in other
Ford Motor Co. products _ is a strange lag time, while the car is
already rolling, right after you press the accelerator. It's as if
the engine is getting the message and taking a split second to
decode it.
</P>
<P>
   The ride? Big American again, though stiffer laterally than in
the past. Suspension front and rear is fully independent, with
gas-pressurized struts and stabilizer bars.
</P>
<P>
   This makes the Sable firm on corners (and made me wish again for
better lateral support up the sides of the leather seats), and
agile in commuter traffic.
</P>
<P>
   What I did not like was the front-to-rear, up-and-down bounce
that uneven roads produced. Looking out the windshield at times was
like looking over the bow of a gently bobbing boat under headway.
</P>
<P>
   Given 200 horsepower in a front-wheel-drive auto, there was
remarkably little indication of torque steer. It was evident only
in quick, sharp-turn starts from a stop, a move you don't really
need to make. On wet pavement, from a stop, rapid starts did
produce a bit of chatter up front.
</P>
<P>
   The power-assisted, ABS brakes _ vented discs up front, drums in
the rear _ brought the car to sure, swift stops, even from 50
m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   At $23,000 for this model, Mercury is getting into the territory
of some very fine, lower-level luxury cars and sports sedans. There
is no reason to exclude the Sable out of hand, but anyone looking
to spend that much money should certainly do some comparison
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The multi-folding section between the front seats. The lower
portion folds out and down, revealing storage and cup holders; the
upper folds down and becomes an armrest.
</P>
<P>
   --The use of the dead space ``V'' at the lower front of the
front windows to house parts of the speaker system. This is usually
wasted space behind the mirror mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The removable carpet pads, front and rear, are thin and cheap.
At $23,000, I'd want better.
</P>
<P>
   --The fold-down armrest between the front seats could be split
at the middle and hinged, opening for more convenient storage
space.

YANKEES TRADITION EXTENDS TO A NEW GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is exactly how our parents and grandparents
remember the baseball of their youths _ with two major leagues, the
New York Yankees and all the other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Even the scene inside the Yankee clubhouse after the 4-1 victory
over the Atlanta Braves that gave them their third championship in
four years had that look of the old Yankee teams that celebrated
championships. There wasn't a lot of howling and screeching like
they'd hit the lottery, as there was three years ago or even last
October in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they all looked like smart investors who just found
out about a stock split. Happy, but fully expecting the reward they
were celebrating. There was champagne, but it was used more for
drinking than for spilling. There were smiles, but not shrieks.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees of the '90s acted as the Yankees of the '50s did,
and the '40s and '30s before them _ as though they knew more than
everyone else, and could prove it to anyone who wanted to argue the
point.
</P>
<P>
   Even Paul O'Neill, the right fielder whose father had died that
very morning and ran off the field rubbing tears from his eyes,
kept it Yankee-like.
</P>
<P>
   He told Fox broadcaster Steve Lyons not to ask about his
tragedy, gave a few Yankee-like responses about winning and being a
proper teammate (``We came into the playoffs wanting to get off the
right way, and we're used to playing close games, and big games,
because we've done it all year''), and then disappeared to face the
bleakness of the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees know that, too. Scott Brosius' father died.
</P>
<P>
   So did Luis Sojo's. Manager Joe Torre had cancer. There were
subplots everywhere, but the main story was the baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it always seemed to be when the Yankees were baseball,
and everyone else seemed only to be renting space.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what everyone said it was all about,'' said Roger
Clemens, the All-Century pitcher who chased the demons that only a
man who played in Boston for a decade can truly know. ``Now I know
what it really feels like to be a Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   He earned his pinstripes by constructing a masterwork that was
every bit as Yankee-esque as anything Whitey Ford, Allie Reynolds
or Red Ruffing ever erected. Clemens allowed the Braves only four
hits in 7 2/3 innings, and none of those 23 outs reached the
outfield. He allowed 17 ground outs, four strikeouts and two
infield popups, and were it not for his being bundled over on a
close play at first base in the eighth and the presence of Mariano
Rivera, the closer for the end of millennium, Clemens might even
have finished.
</P>
<P>
   That, though, might have been gilding the lily a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera deserved his moment, too, just as second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch did, as Brosius and Sojo and O'Neill and Derek Jeter and
all the other champions. The Yankees won bragging rights to the
decade because they understood, as their forbears had, that the
Yankees at their best stand as a collective.
</P>
<P>
   For this, they have Torre to thank, and Jeter, the obvious focal
point who doesn't act like one, and even owner George Steinbrenner,
who provides as much as he ever did without the concomitant
preening that soiled the Yankees of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, these Yankees live off their history. For them, the
gruesome '80s never really happened, or the decaying '60s, either.
They reach back to the days when the Yankees won 11 American League
pennants in 13 years under Casey Stengel, or seven of eight titles
under Joe McCarthy in the '30s and early '40s.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many people, perhaps carried away by the immediacy of
the moment, said this Yankee team was better than the one that won
125 games and swept San Diego last year, or the one that beat the
Braves after losing the first two games in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Those people see the tragedies overcome, the more mundane
struggles endured (Darryl Strawberry's fall from and rise to
sobriety, Knoblauch's throwing problems, the Andy Pettitte trade
rumors) and see this Yankee team as a model of excellence through
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. But it is the excellence rather than the melodrama
that will endure. They blew through the postseason with only one
loss, the first team to do so under the present format, and they
became the third team in history to sweep successive Series. That
is the kind of history that sticks to a fellow's head.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Braves, all blank looks and shaking heads, understood
at least that much. They had overwhelmed National League
opposition, as the Dodgers of the '50s and the Cardinals of the
'40s and the Giants of the '30s had, and they had no more complaint
about their fate than those teams did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we were outmatched,'' said pitcher John
Smoltz, once again the unlucky loser. ``But I believe we were
outplayed. Every play you make, everything you try, they have an
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I pitch like I did tonight (six hits, 11 strikeouts, three
runs allowed on two infield plays unmade) 10 times, I think I'd win
nine of them. But I didn't win tonight. It's amazing. That's why
they're who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   A team for the decade, yes. More than that, though, a reminder
of the teams and decades that preceded them. At the end of the
century, the Yankees showed a new generation what two earlier
generations saw. History doesn't get better than that.

THE VIEW FROM `MALKOVICH' A WACKY ONE 
</HEADLINE>

   Anyone who happens to wander into ``Being John Malkovich''
expecting a documentary about, or maybe a one-man show by, the
noted and often pompously serious actor whose name is so
prominently mentioned in the title is in for one big surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The film is actually a body-changing farce, a revival of that
prototypically '80s subgenre (``Big,'' etc.), and one that's a
little more goofy and bizarre than anything that's come before it
in this strange category. It's quite a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a dedicated but failed puppeteer named Craig Schwartz
(John Cusack) who takes a job as a file clerk in a Manhattan
office. One day he discovers a secret portal that leads directly to
a view window of the world as observed from John Malkovich's
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. And before long, the puppeteer, his sexy co-worker
(Catherine Keener) and his shy pet store-owner wife (Cameron Diaz)
are making regular 15-minute trips into the actor's brain and
selling tickets to the public at $200 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   It's essentially a one-joke situation, but screenwriter Charlie
Kaufman and first-time director Spike Jonze definitely make the
most of it, carrying the gag to ever more absurd and sexually kinky
lengths, and even flirt with turning it into a profound existential
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Good sport Malkovich himself is along for the ride, gradually
taking center stage, poking fun at himself in the process and
bringing in pals Charlie Sheen, Sean Penn and Brad Pitt for cameos.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the cast is even better. Keener and Diaz, each going
against their customary type, are delightful; Cusack has never
created a more likable loser; and old pro Orson Bean steps out of
oblivion to almost steal the movie. Everyone in this clever, funny
film seems to be having a great time, and so do we.
</P>
<P>
   Being John Malkovich. Directed by Spike Jonze. Written by
Charlie Kaufman. Cast: John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener,
Orson Bean, John Malkovich, Charlie Sheen. USA Films. 120 minutes.
Rated R for sexual situations.

`MUSIC OF THE HEART' IMPARTS AN AUTHENTIC LUMP IN THE THROAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Oscar-nominated 1996 documentary ``Small Wonders'' was a
moving parable about an inexperienced but gutsy divorcee named
Roberta Guaspari who steamed into the East Harlem elementary school
system one day and single-handedly created a nationally recognized
violin-instruction program.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of this inspired film may find a few things to quibble
about in ``Music of the Heart,'' a somewhat fictionalized,
big-budget, dramatic version of the same story.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, it takes us to the same place as its model _ a
teary appreciation of the value of a good teacher, the joy of music
and the payoffs of discipline and hard work _ while offering yet
another irresistible performance by Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the film chronicles how Guaspari (Streep)
convinces a disbelieving principal (Angela Bassett) to let her
start a large-scale program to teach an instrument that seems, at
first glance, highly irrelevant to inner-city life.
</P>
<P>
   The second half is set 10 years later, and basically tells the
``Small Wonders'' story: The well-established program is suddenly
axed due to insensitive budget cuts, and Guaspari and her students
try to save it with a gala fund-raiser that turns into a convention
of violin superstars.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Pamela Gray's script is smart enough to
re-create the documentary's best characters, more inspiring moments
and climactic concert finale. It also avoids most of the sappiness
inherent in the ``inspiring teacher'' genre to impart an authentic,
well-earned lump in the throat.
</P>
<P>
   In a big career change of pace, horror director Wes Craven does
a competent enough job, but he could often use a lighter touch, and
he never can figure out what to do with Gloria Estefan in her brief
but billed-above-the-title movie debut.
</P>
<P>
   As Guaspari, Streep seems much softer than the hard-charging
real thing, and she dissolves into tears in almost every scene, but
she's ultimately quite convincing and more than likely to ride the
performance to a record-tying 12th Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Music of the Heart. Directed by Wes Craven. Screenplay by Pamela
Gray. Cast: Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn, Gloria Estefan, Angela
Bassett, Jane Leeves. Miramax. 123 minutes. Rated PG.

   BROOKLYN-JOHNSON-EXHIBIT While the legal battle continues over
``Sensation,'' the show of work by young British artists at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art that has drawn fire from Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, it is nice to know that the museum continues to go about
its business of mounting exhibitions. The latest, ``Eastman
Johnson: Painting America,'' set in the 19th century, is a
comfortable distance from controversy and a good foil for the
visual ballistics of the ``Sensation'' show. Johnson (1824-1906) is
represented here by 70 paintings and 32 drawings, a mix of corny
stereotype and original observation heavily influenced by
17th-century Dutch genre painting. By Grace Glueck.
</P>
<P>
   APPLES-CINCINNATI (Cincinnati) _ This old river town, with a
site of uncommon beauty and a populace of uncommon civility, has a
reputation as a stick-in-the-mud all the same. Mark Twain suggested
that he'd like to come here for the apocalypse because it was
always 20 years behind the times. The most celebrated outcropping
of the city's conservatism in recent years was the indictment on
April 7, 1990, of the Contemporary Arts Center and its director on
obscenity charges arising from an exhibition of 175 Robert
Mapplethorpe photographs. Much less attention was paid when a local
jury, largely working-class in makeup, acquitted both defendants
six months later. Which was par for the course. People also tend to
overlook the city's cultural traditions, especially its rich
musical heritage, and its record of innovation in many fields. By
R.W. Apple Jr. (Will move with a ``t'' travel code.)

``it'' social scene, with enough new restaurants, chic bars and
smoky clubs to occupy even the flimsiest of attention spans. By

RADICALLY DISTURBING, `BOYS DON'T CRY' IS A BOLD CAUTIONARY TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What were you like before all this?'' asks Lana (Chloe
Sevigny), the young woman who has fallen hard for Brandon Teena
(Hilary Swank), a heartbreakingly handsome youth passing through
the dreary Nebraska landscape where Lana lives.
</P>
<P>
   She asks because she's just learned the boy of her dreams is
really a young woman named Teena Ray Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon just wanted the freedom to wander the world without fear
so she dresses as a boy. But that desire has led to mayhem and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   First-time feature director Kimberly Peirce was mesmerized by
the real-life tragedy of Teena Ray Brandon, who became a gay icon
after her 1993 death. As a graduate thesis, Peirce wrote a script
based on Brandon's last days, focusing on the less iconic and more
humane aspects of this young teenager from Lincoln, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was he, really?'' she wondered. ``And why had he incited
such a violent reaction?''
</P>
<P>
   What emerged was the idea that Brandon was an imaginative,
capricious, danger-loving character who had committed petty theft
but was, according to the women he befriended, ``a perfect
gentleman,'' ``so cute'' and a guy who ``knew how a woman wants to
be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Peirce has captured that essence triumphantly as well as
instilling Brandon with a loyal heart and a huge capacity to love
and be loved.
</P>
<P>
   But Brandon's ability to love women well worked against her in
the end. Brandon became the victim of a heinous hate crime after
Lana's ex-con boyfriend, John Lotter (Peter Sarsgaard), and his pal
Thomas Nissen (Brendan Sexton III) decided to stop the charismatic
youth from testifying against them.
</P>
<P>
   Like the stark, restless and chafing films of Terrence Malick
(``Days of Heaven,'' ``Badlands'') or the anti-hero, true-crime
classics ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' ``In Cold Blood'' and ``The
Executioner's Song,'' Peirce's film has captured the mystique and
eerie loneliness and isolation of the Midwest, with its dusty
desolation and nowhere-to-go frustration that propels people to
violence and despair.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her talent with a camera and script, Peirce may
never have made Teena Ray Brandon's story come so vibrantly and
poignantly to life had she not found the right actress for the
role.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Swank, a tall beauty who is just androgynous enough to
pass for a young man, inhabits the character and gives her
heartbreaking conviction, ardor and vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   It's a marvelous performance that is supported ably by Sevigny
as the smitten Lana, Sarsgaard as the unpredictable, sociopathic
Lotter and Jeanetta Arnette as Lana's good-time-gal mom.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, Peirce has evoked larger issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than producing a true-crime thriller, she's taken on
gender, class, sexual identity and cultural _ as well as political
_ themes and tied them together so compellingly that ``Boys Don't
Cry'' emerges as a radically disturbing and memorable movie whose
images don't easily fade or diminish in power. The film is a
cautionary tale about ignorance and intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Boys Don't Cry. Directed by Kimberly Peirce. Written by Peirce,
Andy Bienen. Cast: Hilary Swank, Chloe Sevigny, Jeanetta Arnette,
Peter Sarsgaard, Brendan Sexton III. Fox Searchlight Pictures. 114
minutes. Rated R for violence, sexual content, language.

`SUBURBANS' DRAGS ALONG TOO MUCH OF `TOO SOMETHING'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VH1's Behind the Music/Where Are They Now? craze, the '80s-music
revival, and MTV are all subjects ripe for parody. Heck, if you
want to make fun of 'em, they give you a running head start. So
it's pretty astonishing when the opportunity is botched, and ``The
Suburbans'' is a botch of record-breaking proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Suburbans of the title are a band that had one
hit, ``By My Side,'' way back in 1981. Let's introduce you to the
guys: Rhythm guitarist Danny (Donal Lardner Ward) has matured into
a dude terrified of commitment to his long-suffering girlfriend
(Amy Brenneman). Lead guitarist Mitch (Craig Bierko) has a
predilection for women _ and girls _ in uniform. Drummer Rory (Tony
Guma) is trying to make things work with divorcee Lara (Bridgette
Wilson) and her two bratty kids. And sweet, vacant bassist Gil
(Will Ferrell) is ... well, sweet and vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The movie opens during the early '80s _ a few years before
``This is Spinal Tap'' did this material much better _ with the
guys telling Dick Clark on ``American Bandstand'' that they don't
think MTV will ever catch on. Considering their skyscraper
hairstyles and cerulean-blue vinyl suits _ their image is
none-too-subtly modeled after The Romantics _ they seem more like
the type of guys who were sitting around just waiting for someone
to invent MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The Suburbans fade into oblivion, until they're coerced into
doing an impromptu reunion gig at Gil's wedding. A record exec
(Jennifer Love Hewitt) catches their performance, and persuades
them to attempt a comeback, even though ``By My Side'' appears to
be the only song they know.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, which was written by Guma and Ward, is supposed
to be funny. But, as with his earlier projects, ``My Life's In
Turnaround'' (a not-dissimilar take on indie filmmaking) and the
blink-and-you-missed it Fox sitcom ``Too Something,'' Ward has
demonstrated two things: 1. He is a sometimes-clever writer with
potential; 2. He is absolutely the wrong person to direct his
material or act in it.
</P>
<P>
   He has, however, provided opportunities for actors _ ``Too
Something'' helped introduce ``Ally McBeal's'' Portia de Rossi to
the world. ``The Suburbans'' provides opportunities for its cast,
also, for example, Brenneman, who breathes a sigh of relief that
her TV series ``Judging Amy'' is a hit.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, TriStar decided to release this video-bound
movie to theaters in a few markets, including Dallas. Big D gets to
baby-sit this loser. It's not obnoxious, it's just clueless.

   BBO-WORLDSERIES-YANKS (New York) _ The Yankees have clearly
staked a claim as the dominant baseball team of the free-agency
area, which began in the mid 1970s. In an era in which players are
constantly changing teams, they have managed to keep together a
core roster in recent seasons that has led the way to three titles.

   BBO-WORLDSERIES-COMPARE (New York) _ Twenty-five World Series
championships put the Yankees well ahead of all major-league
baseball teams and most other franchises in the professional sports

slimmest of margins: The Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey
League, who have won the Stanley Cup 24 times. The Yankees bypassed
the Canadiens on Wednesday night when they beat the Atlanta Braves
by 4-1 to take the 1999 baseball championship in a four-game sweep.

FOR 49ERS, IT'S FAREWELL TIME FOR A DEDICATED QB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER and DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ San Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci
has essentially retired Steve Young. Reading between the lines,
it's clear that Young's season, and likely his career, are over.
</P>
<P>
   The quaterback's denouement came over an eight-day period in
September in which he was battered by the New Orleans Saints and
absorbed a flagrant helmet-to-helmet hit by safety Chris Hewitt,
followed by a high-velocity shot from St. Louis Cardinals
cornerback Aeneas Williams that knocked the quarterback out briefly
and resulted in his fourth concussion in 35 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would all love him to be healthy and playing again,''
Mariucci said Wednesday, the day Young said he would like to play
again. ``However, it may be very unlikely he gets back into a 49er
uniform. There's always a glimmer of hope. It's really a long shot.
I have to be prepared to play without Steve indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, it's time to thank Young for all he accomplished in
his eight-plus years as San Francisco's starter, as he helped
perpetuate nearly two decades of brilliance at the quarterback
position begun by Joe Montana late in the 1980 season.
</P>
<P>
   Young led the 49ers to victory in Super Bowl XXIX and was named
the game's most valuable player for throwing a record six touchdown
passes. He has been to the Pro Bowl seven times and has passed for
more than 32,000 yards, with 232 touchdown passes and 4,239 yards
rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he would make ``a 1,000-percent recovery.'' But at
38, with a history of concussions, the risk is too great for Young
to continue playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very competitive but I also recognize all the potential in
the future, all the things that can be accomplished outside of
football,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been preparing for retirement since I started playing
football. ... You have to come to some realization that there are
more important things. There never was a question for me.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes playing again a risk, one the 49ers certainly
will not take after all they have been through on the matter. Young
has seen three outside specialists in addition to his own
neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg of Stanford Medical School, and
none of the four has cleared him to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a small part of me that would love to see him running
around throwing touchdown passes again,'' Mariucci said. ``The
whole world would love to see that. There's a larger part of me
that has to prepare for him not doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's agent, Leigh Steinberg, has advised Young to retire
since 1997. But he understands his client's competitive desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to retire this season, so the retirement watch
can be called off,'' Steinberg said. ``He feels way too committed
to the team. He feels he needs to be there on the sidelines,
helping Jeff Garcia or helping in any way he can.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether Young goes on injured reserve is immaterial
at this point. Putting him on injured reserve would free up a
roster spot, but Mariucci said the 49ers do not need another player
at the moment, especially not during a bye week. The 49ers return
Nov. 7 against Pittsburgh at Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
   In the four games he has missed, Young has remained involved
with the team he said has become ``imprinted'' on him. He has
practiced a little, attended meetings and has been encouraging
Garcia, his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Going on the injured reserve list would mean Young could not
practice with the team but he could remain involved in everything
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to stay integrally involved with the team
and continue to practice,'' Young said. ``At the moment we are at a
critical part in the season. I wish I could be on the field. Right
now I can't. I'll do whatever I can to help the team, help Jeff,
help the coaches.''

   BUDAPEST _ A California company is harnessing Hungarian software
and the Internet to help Turkey recover from the devastating
earthquake there in August.
</P>
<P>
   Simple Building Products, a San Diego-based developer that
produces modular building systems, is using computer-aided design
software created by Graphisoft NV of Budapest to help design and
build quake-proof structures and to train Turks in planning and
constructing their own.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, which began work in Turkey last week, was organized
by Servant Group International, a charity based in Nashville,
Tenn., along with U.S. government and international aid agencies.
The earthquake killed at least 14,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Naigle, the project architect, is not actually traveling to
Turkey but is instead directing the 40-member team of architects,
engineers and mechanics from his office in San Diego through
telephone and Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Graphisoft's popular CAD software allows teams of architects to
work on the same project from different places.
</P>
<P>
   ``The method we're using is a low-tech building system that goes
up quickly and inexpensively,'' said Tony Ruiz, chief executive of
Simple Building Products. ``It's extremely durable and employs
common metal studs as framing, which is then clad with common
galvanized metal walls embedded into thin concrete. These
structures defy earthquakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Naigle said his design required each higher floor to be smaller
than the floor below it. ``The shape is very much like a mountain,
and mountains do not fall down during earthquakes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz's building team will teach their Turkish counterparts how
to build the structures after first working alongside them. They
plan to complete three relief centers in two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The approximately 6-meter-by-30-meter (20-by-100-foot) buildings
will be used as clinics, soup kitchens and administrative offices
for trauma counseling in the Istanbul suburbs of Acvilar, Yalova
and Halidere. Housing is planned for the next phase of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz estimated the value of his company's donation at about
$80,000. &QL;

STREEP PLAYS IT IN THE KEY OF ANGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probably the scariest thing to most of horror film director Wes
Craven's fans is his casting Meryl Streep in one of his movies. It
could have been even scarier; original star Madonna dropped out
before shooting began. In ``Music of the Heart,'' Streep plays
Roberta Guaspari, trapped in a terror that's out of her hands at
the beginning of the movie. (Roberta's husband has abandoned her
with two young sons.)
</P>
<P>
   She weeps continually for the first 10 minutes of the film. Then
she hardens. With a mop of crimped hair and a face often twisted by
frustration, she doesn't try to contain her rage. It's hard to tell
whether her quick-to-anger attitude has always been in her or is
the aftereffect of her suddenly single status. No matter _ she's as
combative as Stone Cold Steve Austin.
</P>
<P>
   When Roberta shows up at the East Harlem school where she's
taken a job as a part-time music teacher, she finds an environment
as hostile as she is. Her fellow teachers ignore her, figuring she
won't be around long enough to get to know. The principal (Angela
Bassett) is just as no-nonsense as Roberta, and so is Roberta's mom
(Cloris Leachman). It's no wonder Roberta gets mad so often.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, almost everybody tells Roberta to pull herself
together. Even Aidan Quinn, as a boyfriend unwilling to commit,
offers a few pearls of wisdom. Finally, Roberta settles and is able
to instill her love for the violin in the kids she teaches. (Gloria
Estefan turns up as a parent who appreciates Roberta's efforts.)
Much of ``Music'' comes from the 1996 documentary ``Small
Wonders,'' which details the success that the hard-driving and
impolitic Guaspari had with the kids she taught violin.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is probably closer to Craven's purview than you
might believe initially, because his movies tend to place a value
on family and emotional attachment and to punish cynicism. In a
peculiar way, Craven's movies are about spiritual and psychological
testing; there can really be no other deconstruction of ``Nightmare
on Elm Street.''
</P>
<P>
   So, his attraction to the subject matter here makes sense.
Roberta is constantly being tested, with no otherworldly figures to
challenge her. The real specters of loss and failure are demons
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Craven also lightens the load with gallows humor. During a phone
conversation, Quinn asks Streep if she'll tell her co-workers she
quit her job because her husband left and nothing else matters. She
nods a vigorous, wordless yes on the other end of the phone. Most
of the time, Streep's performances suggest a prodigy on autopilot,
each moment having been plotted out a week before. (Example: In
nearly every movie in which Streep has a love scene, she seems to
open her eyes wide with delight during a kiss.) Maybe because she's
working with kids in many scenes here, her performance doesn't feel
as carefully planned; she looks natural with a violin, as if she's
lived with one under-chin all her life.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much anyone could do to pump the moisture out of
this melodrama, given the obvious uplift of the material. Because
of a funding shortage, the music program is to be dropped by the
school system, and Roberta and her friends and the parents get
together to put on a benefit concert that ends up being staged with
the help of Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern and Mark O'Connor _ playing
themselves _ at Carnegie Hall. Craven and writer Pamela Gray stick
closely to the events as they happened in ``Wonders,'' where they
had an almost magical quality. Here, things are low-key but
sentimental. It's ``Mrs. Holland's Heartstrings,'' or ``Rocky''
with violins.

<P>
   Viagra could be licensed for use by women with sex problems in
three to four years, the manufacturers said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, which treats impotence, was first licensed in Britain
in September last year and was made available on the NHS to some
men five months ago. It is seen as a wonder treatment by Britain's
two million impotent men, most of whom are middle-aged or older.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer believes that a similar percentage of women in Britain
experience some form of sexual dysfunction and so Viagra could be a
big revenue earner if its benefits can be extended to women.
</P>
<P>
   The drug works by increasing the blood flow and doctors are
currently doing physical and psychological experiments on women to
see how they respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   Early results are encouraging and could lead to Viagra being
marketed to women early in the next century, Dr. Michael Sweeney,
medical director at Pfizer, said.
</P>
<P>
   He told the BBC: ``The science is still developing but I think
we're looking at at least three or four years before it's
officially on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest the drug could help post-menopausal women
with sex problems. The company is also looking at the potential to
combine Viagra with hormone replacement therapy. Results from tests
on 800 women in the United States are being analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate study, doctors involved in trials of the drug at
the Boston University School of Medicine have shown that a
significant number of the 200 women tested have been helped by the
Viagra pill.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jennifer Berman said: ``We're finding that there's a
statistically significant increase in sensation, the ability to
become aroused and the ability to have an orgasm, in the women
we're treating.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug has been linked to fatalities. Since it was introduced
in the U.S. 17 months ago, 130 users have died worldwide, including
31 in Britain. &QL;

   Viagra could be licensed for use by women with sex problems in
three to four years, the manufacturers said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, which treats impotence, was first licensed in Britain
in September last year and was made available on the NHS to some
men five months ago. It is seen as a wonder treatment by Britain's
two million impotent men, most of whom are middle-aged or older.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer believes that a similar percentage of women in Britain
experience some form of sexual dysfunction and so Viagra could be a
big revenue earner if its benefits can be extended to women.
</P>
<P>
   The drug works by increasing the blood flow and doctors are
currently doing physical and psychological experiments on women to
see how they respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   Early results are encouraging and could lead to Viagra being
marketed to women early in the next century, Dr. Michael Sweeney,
medical director at Pfizer, said.
</P>
<P>
   He told the BBC: ``The science is still developing but I think
we're looking at at least three or four years before it's
officially on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest the drug could help post-menopausal women
with sex problems. The company is also looking at the potential to
combine Viagra with hormone replacement therapy. Results from tests
on 800 women in the United States are being analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate study, doctors involved in trials of the drug at
the Boston University School of Medicine have shown that a
significant number of the 200 women tested have been helped by the
Viagra pill.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jennifer Berman said: ``We're finding that there's a
statistically significant increase in sensation, the ability to
become aroused and the ability to have an orgasm, in the women
we're treating.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug has been linked to fatalities. Since it was introduced
in the U.S. 17 months ago, 130 users have died worldwide, including
31 in Britain. &QL;

`MUSIC OF THE HEART': THE TRIUMPH OF TALENT OVER TENURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a director best known for his ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' and
``Scream'' series, Wes Craven has long been associated with
violence. Now he has made a film about violins. This may appear to
be a fabulous typographical error, if not such a hot movie idea.
</P>
<P>
   But times appear to be changing, to the point where creeping
cinematic squareness actually looks like a new wave. Incredibly,
the same kind of spiritual U-turn that drew a lawn mower adventure
out of David Lynch (``The Straight Story'') has also made a niceguy of Craven. His ``Music of the Heart,'' about how a real woman
named Roberta Guaspari (whose story has also been the subject of a
documentary, ``Small Wonders'') evolved from a rejected wife into
an inspired violin teacher, turns out to be thoroughly appealing.
Not many of us enjoy being lectured by dressed-down Hollywood stars
in gritty classroom situations, but Ms. Guaspari's story has been
given a blunt, no-nonsense tone that works.
</P>
<P>
   Boring as it may have become for Meryl Streep to show up for
awards ceremonies, count on her to be doing it again. Her
rock-solid performance here is strong and convincing, and the film
offers her an unusually well-drawn role. Without undue
sentimentality, it shows how a single mother with little work
experience or confidence managed to help a lot of children and
create a meaningful new life for herself in the process. Despite
its elements of the predictable (does anyone doubt that the boy who
announces ``I don't wanna learn about no stupid violins'' will
become a dedicated student?), the story is given substance and
naturalness by Ms. Streep's down-to-earth manner.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay is by Pamela Gray, who also wrote such involving,
recognizable women's roles for ``A Walk on the Moon.'' Ms. Gray
again shows a talent for summoning the familiar so well that it
seems fresh. Yes, the film's Roberta has a mother (Cloris Leachman)
who tells her: ``You're a beautiful and talented woman. You have
your whole life ahead of you.'' And yes, Aidan Quinn pops too
automatically into the story as the obligatory new boyfriend. Ms.
Gray writes her share of cliched lines, but what she gets so right
is the everyday complexity of Roberta's situation. The rapport
between this tough-talking single mother and her two sons, for
instance, has a nicely authentic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Literally and figuratively, Roberta begins the movie in a
bathrobe and curlers. She is feeling worthless after being ditched
by her husband, and has no professional prospects until Quinn, as
an old friend, suggests a teaching job at an East Harlem school.
Presided over by Angela Bassett as its stern but glamorous
principal, the school is at first unreceptive to Roberta's
unconventional ideas about teaching. There's a memorably noxious
performance from Josh Pais as the whiny, unhelpful music teacher
who doesn't have Roberta's talent but does have tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping her g's and barking orders to her reluctant students,
Ms. Streep's Roberta is shown learning the ropes: getting to know
the children, bullying them into submission and occasionally
glimpsing the kind of urban tragedy that doesn't have much place in
the movie. A fatal mugging and a drive-by shooting are mentioned,
but the movie keeps its emphasis on music. And it follows the
students' progress until the inevitable Big Event, a benefit
concert that is filmed here with Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman
among the stellar violinists playing with the schoolchildren.
Perhaps the truest measure of Ms. Streep's performance is that by
the time she gets to Carnegie Hall, it takes some effort to recall
that she is merely a brilliant actress and not a violin teacher
after all.
</P>
<P>
   One admirable aspect of ``Music of the Heart'' is its way of
avoiding the maudlin; another is the nature of Roberta and her
students' accomplishments. There was a time when a movie like this
would have had to end with a prize or a big victory, a sense of
somebody's having gone for the gold. The reward here is simpler:
just an affirmation of the power of music to provide beauty,
pleasure and a sense of accomplishment. Not a bad reason for Craven
to have sidelined the claws and hatchets this time.
</P>
<P>
   In subsidiary roles, Ms. Bassett is ever-dazzling, while Gloria
Estefan acquits herself gracefully as another faculty member and
mother. A large, eager group of violin-playing children account for
much of the film's charm.
</P>
<P>

   The killing of at least seven top Armenian officials, including
the prime minister, in the Armenian parliament Wednesday may be
connected with corruption and factionalism within the government,
specialists on the region said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The motives of the assailants were still a mystery, and whether
the prime minister, Vazgan Sarkissian, was the specific target of
the shooting is unclear. But he was a leader of a younger
generation of Armenian politicians, and had key responsibility in
the economy, deciding state subsidies and the award of government
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarkissian is (sic) a very powerful figure domestically.
Strong arm tactics get used, and this episode could have been
arranged by interests who had lost out in the division of the
spoils _ or by radicals protesting the corruption in the way
business is done,'' said Anna Matveeva, a specialist on
TransCaucasia at the Royal Institute for International Affairs
(RIIA) in London.
</P>
<P>
   The reported words of one of the gunmen, that they opposed
``those who have drunk the blood of the nation,'' could be
interpreted in that sense, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Another, connected, possibility is that the attack stems from a
feud within the governing coalition. ``Armenian politics is
volatile, and political assassinations happen there. Basically,
this sort of thing is do-able in Armenia,'' Matveeva said.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it appears less plausible that the episode reflects
disagreement over the fate of Nagorno-Karabakh, an overwhelmingly
Armenian-populated enclave within the legal frontiers of Azerbaijan
_ the issue that brought down the previous president, Levon
Ter-Petrosian.
</P>
<P>
   Like President Robert Kocharian, who appointed him prime
minister in June, Sarkissian has long been a hardliner on
Nagorno-Karabakh, and helped force the resignation of Ter-Petrosian
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting first broke out over the enclave in 1988, as
separatists sought to reunite it with Armenia, from which
Nagorno-Karabakh was severed by Stalin in the 1920s. After six
years of hostilities, a cease-fire in 1994 left control in Armenian
hands, but did not resolve the final juridical status of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Today a settlement, on which Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy
secretary of state, has also been working during his current visit
to the region, looks closer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The rumored deal would offer some face-saving device for the
ailing 76-year-old Azeri president, Gaidar Aliyev, but in practical
purposes the enclave would stay with Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in Armenia is a nationalist over Nagorno-Karabakh,''
Matveeva said. ``It's possible these people were ultra-hardliners
trying to prevent what they claim would be a sellout to Azerbaijan,
but it's not very likely.'' &QL;

`THE LEGEND OF 1900': HOW TO LOSE YOUR MOORING BUT REMAIN
IMMOBILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he demonstrated a decade ago with his semi-autobiographical
film, ``Cinema Paradiso,'' Giuseppe Tornatore can be awfully good
at plucking nostalgic heartstrings. And in his first
English-language film, ``The Legend of 1900,'' the Italian director
has created a lavish, poetically ambitious period piece, drenched
in romantic atmosphere that wants to tap into our tear ducts while
aspiring to be the thinking man's ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   But to be the thinking man's anything requires some serious
thought. And this solemn, ersatz epic not only misses the boat
intellectually but also fails as entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   A two-hour cinematic fable based on a dramatic monologue by
Alessandro Baricco, ``The Legend of 1900'' tells the story of a
foundling, discovered aboard the Virginian, a trans-Atlantic
steamer, in the year 1900, who becomes a jazz piano prodigy. Named
after the year of his discovery and played by Tim Roth as a holy
innocent whose wide Buster Keaton eyes gaze sadly out over the
keyboard while he spins out his improvisations, the character has
Allegorical Significance written all over him.
</P>
<P>
   Because he's a symbol (of exactly what is never made clear),
we're not supposed to wonder how he learned to read, write and
speak impeccable English, or how he acquired his expensive wardrobe
without ever having left the ship.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about fables, if we are to take them seriously, is
that they have to mean something and the characters have to add up
to more than question marks. But when Nineteen Hundred has his
moment of truth and must decide whether to leave the ship on which
he has spent his entire life to pursue his dream girl, his
explanation for his reluctance is a pseudo-poetic mumbo-jumbo about
beginnings and endings and his being able to hear (or not hear)
``the voice'' of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The movie might have been partly salvageable if Nineteen
Hundred's music soared to the heights everyone claims it does. In
the film's dramatic climax, Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams
III), who has heard rumors of Nineteen Hundred's genius, books a
passage on the Virginian specifically to challenge him to a piano
duel.
</P>
<P>
   But the piece (composed by Ennio Morricone) with which Nineteen
Hundred defeats Morton is a whirling, twirling, fussy, ``Flight of
the Bumblebee''-like finger-flying exhibition that has velocity but
little coherence. It is no match artistically for Morton's
propulsive meat-and-potatoes jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Much worse is the movie's dinky little theme song, a wistful
piano fragment that characters tout as a Great Melody (something
beyond Chopin or Gershwin); it comes to Nineteen Hundred as he
falls hopelessly in love with a pretty third-class passenger
(Melanie Thierry) while glimpsing her through a porthole.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, was composed by Morricone, who has done much more
distinguished work, as in his score for ``Bugsy.'' Even Morricone's
love theme from ``In the Line of Fire'' is more eloquent.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing down the movie is a ponderous narration by Max (Pruitt
Taylor Vince), a jazz trumpeter, who entrances a dealer of used
musical instruments with the story of Nineteen Hundred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legend of 1900'' is at least gorgeous to look at. Lajos
Koltai's cinematography bathes everything in a rich, golden light.
In the most magical moment, the young Nineteen Hundred (Cory Buck)
presses his nose against a stained-glass partition to observe the
blurred images of whirling, formally attired ballroom dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a dizzying set piece, he unhooks the grand piano from
its footing during a violent storm and plays the instrument as it
careers wildly across the floor, eventually crashing through the
stained glass.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``The Legend of 1900'' is a little like coming upon a
beautifully lighted, ornately framed painting in a museum and
discovering on closer inspection that the picture itself is just
piece of kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>
   The movie is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It includes some profanity.

MERCURY SABLE IS DISTINCTLY AMERICAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   There used to be a joke that a Mercury is just a Ford with the
bolts torqued tighter.
</P>
<P>
   It was based on the perception _ correct in many cases _ that
American cars were inferior to foreign models and that little
differentiated one domestic from another.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thanks in part to that foreign pressure, Americans
shopping for domestic autos have plenty of quality from which to
choose, even as many of these cars remain distinctly American in
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Mercury Sable LS is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Redesigned this year _ lowered at nose and rear, a smooth line
running up over windshield and high roof and linking the ends in a
graceful arc _ the sedan is a sleeker looking car than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Sable comes as a wagon, as well, and engine options include
a pair of 3.0 liters, one turning out 153 horsepower, the other,
200 horsepower. With the bigger engine I got just over 24 miles per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the car is big, broad American. In the LS model tested,
the leather seats are wide and firm, essentially five bucket seats.
The thigh support up front is very good, though bucket seats need
better lateral support ridges than the Sable seats offer.
</P>
<P>
   The dash is deep up top and angles away nicely below, affording
plenty of legroom up front. Rear legroom is ample, as well.
</P>
<P>
   A new feature _ one that ought to catch on everywhere _ is
height adjustment (about 3 inches) on the gas and brake pedals.
Push a button on the side of the driver's seat and the pedals come
to or move away from you. For short drivers, this means they no
longer have to move the seat far forward, pushing themselves right
up to the steering wheel and bluntly in the way of an exploding
airbag.
</P>
<P>
   Further safety enhancements include front and side airbags, seat
belt pretensioners, belt use sensors, a driver's seat position
sensor, and two inflation levels for the airbags, depending on the
severity of a crash. Also sure to become standard across the
industry, the Sable has an interior emergency trunk release.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumentation is spartan in a simple, good way. Fuel,
tachometer, speedometer, and engine temperature are in the display
behind the wheel. Window controls, door locks, and mirror controls
are on the driver's door. In the center grouping on the dash,
arranged horizontally one above the other are audio controls up
top, climate controls below.
</P>
<P>
   Interior bins are adequate _ no large atlases, fine for standard
folding maps _ and the trunk is cavernous. A 60/40 split rear seat
allows for longer parcels and items.
</P>
<P>
   The LS Premium came with the DOHC, 24-valve, Duratec V6 engine.
Because of composite cam covers and intake manifold, it is 30
pounds lighter than the standard V6, yet cranks out 47 more
horsepower. Another sign of emerging quality: Tuneups come at
100,000-mile intervals.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is a four-speed automatic with adaptive shift control,
and in testing it ran itself up and down the gears smoothly and
click-free.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury, looking to lessen compartment noise, installed a
lightweight instrument panel insulator, designed to absorb sound
rather than just attempt to repel it. The repel method can lead to
vibrations and rattles, and the new insulation works quite well.
Engine noise was minimal, and even during rapid acceleration the
engine _ muffled through a single exhaust engineered to keep the
same backflow as the dual system it replaces _ was a distant
burble.
</P>
<P>
   Wind noise, however, was another matter, and it was so
encompassing it was hard to tell if it was coming from mirrors,
windows, or the sunroof.
</P>
<P>
   The engine was plenty powerful _ I'm not sure I'd be happy with
the lesser mill in this car _ and pulled the Sable up steep hills,
and in and out of highway traffic, with confident surges.
</P>
<P>
   My only performance complaint _ and I've noticed this in other
Ford Motor Co. products _ is a strange lag time, while the car is
already rolling, right after you press the accelerator. It's as if
the engine is getting the message and taking a split second to
decode it.
</P>
<P>
   The ride? Big American again, though stiffer laterally than in
the past. Suspension front and rear is fully independent, with
gas-pressurized struts and stabilizer bars.
</P>
<P>
   This makes the Sable firm on corners (and made me wish again for
better lateral support up the sides of the leather seats), and
agile in commuter traffic.
</P>
<P>
   What I did not like was the front-to-rear, up-and-down bounce
that uneven roads produced. Looking out the windshield at times was
like looking over the bow of a gently bobbing boat under headway.
</P>
<P>
   Given 200 horsepower in a front-wheel-drive auto, there was
remarkably little indication of torque steer. It was evident only
in quick, sharp-turn starts from a stop, a move you don't really
need to make. On wet pavement, from a stop, rapid starts did
produce a bit of chatter up front.
</P>
<P>
   The power-assisted, ABS brakes _ vented discs up front, drums in
the rear _ brought the car to sure, swift stops, even from 50
m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   At $23,000 for this model, Mercury is getting into the territory
of some very fine, lower-level luxury cars and sports sedans. There
is no reason to exclude the Sable out of hand, but anyone looking
to spend that much money should certainly do some comparison
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The multi-folding section between the front seats. The lower
portion folds out and down, revealing storage and cup holders; the
upper folds down and becomes an armrest.
</P>
<P>
   --The use of the dead space ``V'' at the lower front of the
front windows to house parts of the speaker system. This is usually
wasted space behind the mirror mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The removable carpet pads, front and rear, are thin and cheap.
At $23,000, I'd want better.
</P>
<P>
   --The fold-down armrest between the front seats could be split
at the middle and hinged, opening for more convenient storage
space.

<P>
   BEIRUT _ It looks like the final suppression of Rifaat Assad's
power in Syria. With the closure of Rifaat's illegal port at
Lattakia _ not to mention the reports of the killing of his
retainers _ his brother, President Hafez Assad, appears to have
cleared the way for his son Bashar as undisputed successor to the
country he has led for almost three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Syrians admit that a number of Rifaat's heavily armed
praetorian guard _ the remnants of his once-powerful Defense
Brigade _ have been ``returned to their units'' after the closure
of his private harbor.
</P>
<P>
   And although Damascus denies that Syrian troops stormed Rifaat's
residence and killed his security guards _ a story put about by
Rifaat's own son Summar on his satellite television station _ they
acknowledge that the port was shut down because it had been built
on state land.
</P>
<P>
   During Lebanon's civil war, illegal Mediterranean ports made
millionaires of rival militia leaders, many of whom traded in guns
and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   President Assad's eldest son Basil _ killed in a car accident in
1994 _ won widespread popularity in Syria by suppressing much of
the corruption which had spread from Lebanon. But Rifaat Assad's
own private port was never touched.
</P>
<P>
   Who, after all, would tangle with the heavily-armed retainers of
the president's brother? Last week, however, the authorities acted
with their customary ruthlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Put very bluntly, Rifaat is finished as a political force in
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he tried to stage a coup against his brother in 1983
and was confronted by an outraged President Assad who announced _
according to his biographer, Patrick Seale _ ``I am the regime,''
Rifaat's days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Although a vice-president, he chose an extraordinary luncheon at
the Sheraton Hotel in Damascus in 1984 to denounce his brother's
policies, announcing plaintively to 500 guests that ``my brother
doesn't seem to like me any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with many of his loyal officers, Rifaat was packed off to
Moscow for a ``cordial working visit''; a few days later, he took
up exile in Geneva with a retinue of more than a hundred servants,
subsequently wandering between estates in Spain and France.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes with local European police forces and rumors of
drug-running did nothing to dispel Rifaat's earlier reputation as a
gregarious and often dissipated man, operating nightclubs in
Damascus as well as a restaurant in the Mezze boulevard of the
capital which sold modest helpings of Arabic cuisine at
extortionate prices.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the ascetic president with his iron determination and
austere Baathist ideals could not allow Rifaat to hold any power in
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of his Lattakia port _ the harbor was built opposite
his luxurious private residence in the Damssarkhou district of the
old Roman city _ tells the story of Rifaat's decline.
</P>
<P>
   He was still vice-president when the Syrian minister of
transport, Dr. Mufeed Abdel-Karim, ordered its removal on Jan. 27,
1995. If Rifaat refused to abide by the ruling, the minister added,
``it would be removed at Rifaat el-Assad's expense.''
</P>
<P>
   In September the same year, abdel-Kareem _ obviously acting with
the president's permission _ ordered the port chairman to ``proceed
with the removal of structures built on public maritime property by
the vice-president due to the unavailability (sic) of the required
permit.'' Rifaat ignored the minister.
</P>
<P>
   But the president removed his brother from the nominal post of
vice-president and Rifaat was expelled from the Baath party,
forbidden ever to return.
</P>
<P>
   And so this last week, the one-time aspirant to the leadership
of Syria was told that Syrian government officials had turned up to
clear the equipment from his private harbor and order most of his
bodyguards to close up shop and report back for duties in their old
military units.
</P>
<P>
   As for those reports of shooting and killings at Rifaat Assad's
summer residence _ the ``intense gunfire'' allegedly heard near the
former vice-presidential complex, the Syrian resident in London
whose friends told him that ``tanks and armed boats'' had attacked
the building _ Damascus refuted them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Highly exaggerated and imprecise,'' a government ``source''
was quoted as saying. As for Summar's television station, which is
based in London, it claimed ``hundreds of deaths, including those
of women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone, it seems, is telling a lie. &QL;

`SUBURBANS': AND THE BEAT GOES ON, EVEN WHEN IT SHOULDN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(pr) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Suburbans'' is the kind of breezy little movie that can't
get arrested these days. It's cute and jokey and has no particular
edge. Rock-and-roll and relationships are its concerns, as was the
case with Allison Anders and Kurt Voss' recent ``Sugar Town,'' a
better and more ambitious recent film that had no luck in finding
an audience. Even at their best, inexpensive films without a sting
have a way of getting lost in the shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   This one has its moments, though. Set on Long Island, it
concerns an over-the-hill '80s rock band that is coaxed into a
comeback despite obvious obstacles. One guy's old stage outfit is
so tight it makes him faint. (Nowadays he's more likely to be found
in a ``Kiss the Cook'' apron at his backyard barbecue.) Also, he
sells insurance. Another has a stake in a Long Island nightclub
that is optimistically named Funky Nassau. When the Suburbans try
to rehearse onstage, one has to tell another, ``Rory, I know it's
been a long time, but the drums go in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Suburbans'' was directed by Donal Lardner Ward, who wrote
the screenplay with Tony Guma and plays the Suburban's lead singer,
Danny. ( Guma plays Rory, the drummer.) Also in the group are
scene-stealing Craig Bierko in a wise-guy role a la Jeff Goldblum,
and Will Ferrell as the band member who bursts into tears during
his MTV interview. ``Shut up, Kurt Loder!'' the interviewer is
finally told.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar faces turn up in amusing small roles. Jerry Stiller and
Ben Stiller have funny moments as an incomprehensible father-son
duo running a record company. Jennifer Love Hewitt slinks through
the story as a record-company executive who rediscovers the band,
much to the chagrin of Danny's girlfriend (Amy Brenneman).
</P>
<P>
   Domestic scenes drag on a bit, since the touches of rock parody
are better executed. Everybody looks youthful enough to suggest
that the film may have spent time on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Suburbans'' includes mild profanity and brief sexual
situations.
</P>

HOW TO AVOID DANGER BEHIND THE WHEEL OF AN SUV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started with the cop in the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   She was a good driver, track-trained in what cops like to call
``pursuit of the suspect vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time, when the screaming motorcycle passed her, going
in the opposite direction on a rural stretch of Vermont road, she
was driving an SUV. Now SUVs are practical members of many police
and fire department fleets. But you can't drive them like cars, as
the Vermont cop found out, and SUV owners should know.
</P>
<P>
   She went into a three-point turn, trying to reverse direction
and catch the speeding motorcycle. The next thing she knew, she was
in the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Baffled by what had happened, her chief called Bud Stanley, a
partner at Stevens Advanced Driver Training in Merrimack, N.H. The
Stevens staff has taught lots of cops to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, watching SUV wrecks down the years, had already
developed an anecdotal theory about a key danger inherent in SUVs.
Using the cop's car, he put it to the test.
</P>
<P>
   He drove 45 miles per hour on an airport runway, hit the brakes
hard, and turned to make a lane change. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Did the same thing again, but this time, he turned first, then
hit the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I knew, I was off the road and 75 feet out into
the grass,'' Stanely recalls.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs, he says, can be dangerous to drive; dangerous because they
have high centers of gravity, high roll axis, stiff frames, and
unforgiving suspension systems. People who buy them _ looking for
car-like feel, perceived added safety, and the ability to carry
lots of passengers _ often ignore one important characteristic.
They are basically trucks. And they drive like trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Put yourself behind the wheel of a big SUV. You are doing 50
miles per hour on the Southeast Expressway. You are distracted for
a moment and when you look back out the windshield, you are racing
upon a slow truck. With your hands on the wheel and your foot on
the gas, your first instinct, and quickest option, is to steer away
from the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more danger, the greater tendency to crank the wheel,''
says Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Only after turning the wheel do you try to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   And now you are in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Car wrecks are all about the transfer of weight and energy, and
because you're driving a heavy SUV, it's Transfer City.
</P>
<P>
   Say the sharp turn you have just made is to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Your vehicle's weight will shift in two ways. First, it goes
cross-axle, from the inside of the turn to the outside. This is
accompanied by a diagonal shift, from the inside rear tire to the
outside front tire. Physics at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you've got an enormous weight transfer going on,'' says
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   When you hit the brakes after you initiate your turn, you
accelerate and amplify this transfer to that one tire. Now it is
the primary tire for both braking and steering the auto. Trouble
City.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, says Stanley, one of two things happens.
</P>
<P>
   The frightened driver freezes and the car carves an unyielding
arc right off the road. Bad on the Expressay, bad on a tree-lined
country lane.
</P>
<P>
   Or, the driver tries to correct and steers back the other way.
All the pent-up energy that has settled down on the outside front
tire is now released as it unweights. It moves to the other side of
the car, is amplified by the car's motion, and shifts to the
outside of the new turn. There is a good chance you will now roll
over.
</P>
<P>
   So besides the braking-steering mistake, what went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   First, consider the ABS brakes. After your first mistake, with
most of the weight on the front outside tire, you have to rely on
the other three tires to save you. If you could lock them up, you'd
probably skid, but you'd get a gradual pullback of some of that
weight, and you wouldn't carve that wide arc off the road.
</P>
<P>
   But because the three tires whose help you need are unweighted,
ABS won't let them lock up. They are of little use to you as they
spin-clamp, spin-clamp merrily along.
</P>
<P>
   Second, when you try to correct, you are transferring weight
back through a truck-like ladder frame. Rigid and nonabsorbing. To
understand this, stand with an aluminum ladder at your feet,
running away from you. Reach down and grab the bottom of one leg
and lift it. Do you sense an equal redistribution of weight to the
other three leg ends? Or do you sense a diagonal shift to one far
leg, accompanied by a shift to the opposite side of the ladder from
the one whose leg you are holding?
</P>
<P>
   Back to the SUV. Weight is shifting, pent-up energy is being
released by coil springs and in some cases leaf springs.
</P>
<P>
   Now keep in mind that this is happening in a top-heavy vehicle.
The motor, transfer cases, transmission are all up high. Not to
mention the tall passenger cab.
</P>
<P>
   This gives you a lot of weight rotating on a high roll axis.
</P>
<P>
   Roll axis? If a car rolls over, there is a point in its circle
that, as you look at it straight ahead or from behind, does not
move _ an imaginary axle. If you put a skewer dead center through
an apple, the apple would be stable, right? What if you put the
skewer through the apple one third of the way from its outer rim
and the core? Hold the skewer with the upper two-thirds of the
apple above this axis and see how stable it is. Fruit as SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that cars will have the same initial reaction to
the incorrect steer-brake sequence. But cars are lighter so there
is less energy being thrown around; they do not sit as high; their
roll axes are far lower.
</P>
<P>
   But many of us drive SUVs and we like them.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do?
</P>
<P>
   First, don't drive them like a car. They may feel like a car _
all those fancy interiors, the quiet, smooth ride down the freeway
_ but until they evolve (as many are doing) they remain trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Don't drive them fast. It takes a longer time to slow them, and
in a crash situation speed increases energy and weight shift.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tailgate. Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   And if you do get into trouble and have to avoid a crash, do
this:
</P>
<P>
   Slam on the brakes fast and hard and keep them on. Don't pump
them because this confuses your ABS system. This puts weight on
both front tires as suspensions contract up there. Then steer away
from whatever it is you are trying to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not guaranteed success, but you'll have the best
opportunity to miss whatever's ahead of you and keep your car under
control,'' says Stanley.

`LO'S DIARY': HUMBERT WOULD SWEAR THIS ISN'T THE SAME LOLITA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lolita, the lovely, lilting nymphet of Humbert Humbert's dreams,
the love and light of his twisted life, was described by Vladimir
Nabokov as a mixture of ``tender dreamy childishness and a kind of
eerie vulgarity,'' a combination of ``naivete and deception,''
``blue sulks and rosy mirth,'' an ``exasperating brat'' whose
childhood was stolen and besmirched by her stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   As for Nabokov's classic 1955 novel, which recounted the story
of Lolita from Humbert's point of view, it was not merely a study
in obsession and guilt and forbidden love, but also a coyly crafted
and jeweled literary puzzle: a witty, wicked meditation on time and
mortality and the irretrievability of the past; a satiric take on
postwar America, as seen through the jaded eyes of a European
emigre, and a self-delighting exploration of the luxuries and
limits of English prose.
</P>
<P>
   Pia Pera's controversial new novel, ``Lo's Diary'' _ which is
being published for the first time in the United States, after the
settling of a 1998 lawsuit over copyright infringement brought by
Nabokov's son _ depicts Humbert's nymphet as a scheming 12-year-old
seductress, a selfish young thing who determines to snare a
handsome older man from her hated mother. The novel is a dreary,
monotonous and heavily Freudian account of incest and abuse and
mutual manipulation _ a book that is completely bereft of the love
of language that animated Nabokov's famous novel, and devoid, too,
of that earlier novel's wit and glittering subtext.
</P>
<P>
   Given the long and distinguished tradition of authors'
reimagining earlier writers' works, it's hard to see how Nabokov's
estate had a case against Ms. Pera. After all, Aeschylus,
Shakespeare and Joyce all reinvented older stories; so, too, with
varying results, have such writers as Jean Rhys (``Wide Sargasso
Sea,'' taking off from ``Jane Eyre''), John Updike (``S,'' taking
off from ``The Scarlet Letter'') and Michael Cunningham (``The
Hours,'' taking off from ``Mrs. Dalloway''). Two novels _ A.M.
Homes' ``End of Alice'' (1996) and Emily Prager's ``Roger
Fishbite'' (1999) _ have even used ``Lolita'' as a jumping-off
point in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``Lo's Diary'' isn't that it's derivative. The
problem is that Ms. Pera seems to have no understanding whatsoever
of what Nabokov was up to in ``Lolita,'' and so cannot begin to
reimagine his story in any meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
   With Humbert, Nabokov's book gave us an unreliable narrator, a
self-justifying, silver-tongued child molester who thinks of
himself as a poet and who draws us into his own romantic
rationalizations. He was, as Nabokov later wrote, ``a vain and
cruel wretch who manages to appear `touching.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is no such narrative tension in ``Lo's Diary,'' which
gives us a flat, irony-free portrait of Lolita as a calculating
vixen, a pubescent girl who acts and talks like a woman twice her
age. Ms. Pera's Lolita studies a book called ``How to Catch a Man:
101 Winning Strategies,'' then vows to ensnare this man her mother
covets for herself. ``Since I know how to seduce Humbert and Mom
couldn't do it in a million years,'' she reasons, ``why should I
leave him to her?''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this leaden book, Ms. Pera depicts Lolita in the most
unsympathetic of terms. She reviles her mother as ``Plasticmom,'' a
``humanoid hen,'' a ``viper'' and a ``fossil,'' and when she learns
of her death, evinces not the slightest bit of sadness or regret.
``The fact that the hen is dead opens up interesting prospects,''
she observes. ``Totally new prospects. Hummie, whether I like it or
not, is mine now.'' This Lolita complains that Humbert is ``a lousy
lover'' and she quickly learns to trade sexual favors for presents
and money.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt this Lolita's cynicism _ and attraction to older men _
stems in part from her fixation on her late father, a creep, in Ms.
Pera's telling, who used to kiss his daughter on the mouth, his
lips wet with beer. His favorite hobby, we're told, was
electrocuting lizards in the garage _ a taste for tormenting small
animals that Lolita shares. When her pet hamster, Nelson (named
after her dead brother), misbehaves, she places the creature on a
hot light bulb and burns him so badly that his feet fall off and he
dies.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Lo's Diary'' hews closely, in terms of central plot
developments, to Nabokov's story line, it's initially amusing for
the reader to compare scenes from the two books. Humbert thinking
that he's gently pressed his mouth to Lolita's fluttering eyelids
as a gesture of affection; Lolita thinking that he's stuck his
tongue in her eye. Humbert thinking, in the famous lap scene, that
Lolita hasn't noticed his arousal; Lolita thinking that she's
succeeded in seducing him and that he now belongs to her.
</P>
<P>
   Such comparisons, however, quickly grow tiresome, for Ms. Pera
demonstrates no ability to work variations on Nabokov's text that
illuminate the original story or stand on their own as genuinely
imaginative improvisations. Instead, she has turned Humbert into
your run-of-the-mill child molester, Lolita into an underage slut
and their story into a crude sex farce _ a book that is as leering,
uninspired and mechanical as Nabokov's was dazzling.

`MAN OF THE CENTURY': CUB REPORTER IN THE WRONG DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plop an eager-beaver 1920s newspaper reporter onto the streets
of contemporary Manhattan, make him blissfully unaware that he has
landed in the wrong decade, film his adventures in black and white,
and you have Adam Abraham's amusing one-joke film, ``Man of the
Century.''
</P>
<P>
   This farcical riff on movie nostalgia echoes early Woody Allen
(and Stanley Tucci's recent comedy, ``The Impostors'') in its
lampooning of the hoariest celluloid stereotypes. The movie is also
shrewd enough to avoid wearing out its welcome. It's only 77
minutes long.
</P>
<P>
   The title character, Johnny Twennies (Gibson Frazier), is an
unflappably chipper columnist for The Sun-Telegram, a creaky New
York daily so low on the journalistic food chain its reporters
still pound away on battered old upright typewriters.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier's Johnny is the comic distillation of every cocky,
freshly scrubbed cub reporter who ever chased down a scoop in a
'30s B-movie. Imagine the very young Jimmy Stewart as a hybrid of
Clark Kent and Jimmy Olsen, mouthing quaint soft-boiled slang in a
voice that carries a helium lilt: that's Johnny heroically standing
up to '20s-style mobsters whom he calls ``bub'' and ``buster.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's cleverest running joke is the way the screenplay (by
Abraham and Frazier) unfurls a dictionary of vintage street slang
(from the '30s as well as the '20s) in funny, cartoon-balloon sound
bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man of the Century'' is best appreciated as a stylistic
juggling act. After a silent introduction (with organ music
swelling over subtitles as Johnny jauntily performs his morning
ablutions), the movie breaks into sound as soon as he leaves the
house.
</P>
<P>
   From here, it see-saws back and forth between the '20s and late
'90s, pretending they coexist in a celluloid time warp. One minute
Johnny is skulking through a speak-easy, the next he is doffing his
hat at the Ubu Roi Gallery, the chic SoHo art emporium run by his
girlfriend, Samantha (Susan Egan).
</P>
<P>
   The trick of a movie like ``Man of the Century'' is to keep its
pins in the air and to string out the joke for as long as possible.
The movie comes up with just enough silly variations on its premise
to keep it afloat until its desperate madcap finale at a stuffy
'20s dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man of the Century'' is at its cleverest portraying Johnny's
crossed-signals romance with Samantha. Our hero, who is the soul of
chivalry, plies his sweetie with bouquets and compliments until one
evening, fed up with his courtliness, she pounces on him, only to
be rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   When she demands to know if he's gay, he replies that of course
he's a carefree fun-loving guy. The joke is underscored by Johnny's
utter lack of comprehension when witnessing the bitter breakup of
Samantha's cynical gallery assistant, Richard (Dwight Ewell), and
Timothy (Anthony Rapp), the photographer assigned to Johnny's beat.
Timothy is the kind of shutter-bugging prima donna who, when sent
to cover the ribbon-cutting at a library, takes hopelessly arty
photos unrelated to the event.
</P>
<P>
   Our hero also rescues a disaster-prone opera singer (Cara Buono)
from a mugging and later from bondage and imminent molestation at
the hands of a leather fetishist posing as an impresario (Frank
Gorshin). Oh yes, there's also a half-baked plot in which Johnny,
pursuing the scoop to end all scoops, busts a gangland kingpin who
is none other than _ you'll never guess. And it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>
   `Man of the Century' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and some strong

 &HT;    CLINTON: SEARCH FOR COMMON GROUND IS 'CENTRAL TRUGGLE'
 &HT;    700&AMP;add. With CLINTON.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sank into a yellow upholstered
armchair, crossed his legs and cast his thoughts back toward his
own beginnings in rural Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   It was a place, Clinton recalled in an interview Wednesday(cq)
night, where a young boy was quickly forced to either embrace or
reject the racial fault lines running through the American South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned when I was very young that people fear what they
don't know,'' he said. As he grew older, Clinton said, ``I had to
keep telling myself, you have to find ways to reaffirm what you
have in common, and that's the way you can let go of whatever fear
you have.''
</P>
<P>
   As he approaches the twilight of his presidency still struggling
with issues such as peace in the Mideast, ethnic slaughter in the
Balkans and racial divisions at home, Clinton is searching for the
common ground to resurrect a spirit of community.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I believe,'' he said in the half-hour session in
the Oval Office. ``That's the message I've got to get to society,
and I still think it's the central human struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the president takes his message to Atlanta, where he
will address members of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith
on the need to strengthen federal hate crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton contended that such laws are part of a larger set of
institutions the country needs to protect against the human
instinct for one group to target the differences of another.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans, ``We think, 'Well gosh, you know, we'd never go
back to race wars,' '' said Clinton. ``Well, I think that's true.
But I think it's true, not only because basically the American
people are good people, but because we've set ourselves on a good
path. We've made a legal and a societal commitment to a good
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a climate where you are always encouraging
people to do the right thing and discouraging them from doing the
wrong thing,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He suddenly appeared to acknowledge the irony of such a
statement from a man nearly thrown out of office because of his
personal conduct involving former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a person in the United States _ some are more
saintly than others _ but nearly everybody is vulnerable to
defining themselves in terms of other people who are different,
where we say, 'Well, I may not be the best person in the world, but
thank God I'm not that.' We all almost need that from time to
time,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a human being that sometime or another in his or
her life is not disappointed in themselves, doesn't feel like
they've failed in some way or another,'' he continued. ``So this is
something that will never go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, wearing a gray wool suit, a blue and white
checked shirt, a burgundy necktie and black western boots,
discussed his attempts to place the theme of resurrection of
community near the center of roach to governance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central work of citizenship in a democratic society is
finding ways to respect other people and their differences and even
celebrate the differences,'' he said. ``But you can only celebrate
the differences,'' he said, ``if you believe that what you have in
common with them is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it works there's nothing more wonderful in life, you
know, seeing (former South Africa President) Nelson Mandela
reconcile with the people that kept him in jail for 27 years,''
said Clinton. ``There's nothing more beautiful in life.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge remains, he said, to prevent ideals from being
smothered by fear, a lesson he often implores in speeches to gay
and lesbian groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a young gay man or a lesbian woman will come to me
at one of these events and say, 'You've given me more respect than
my parents.' It happens with some frequency. They're estranged from
their parents,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   His voice lowered to a near whisper as he leaned out over the
edge of his chair and made a bowl with his hands as if to cradle
the thought. ``And I always tell them the same thing, I say 'Your
parents are scared. You have to keep loving them, you have to to
keep giving them a chance. They're scared.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Against long odds, Clinton is pressing the Republican majority
in Congress to widen the activities existing statutes would cover
and to broaden federal definitions of hate crimes to include
attacks based on gender, disabilities or sexual leanings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pushing hard for it,'' said Clinton, whose view on the
need for such legislation was hardened by the torture and murder of
a gay student last year in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society as a whole suffers a particular burden from these
kinds of crimes,'' Clinton said. ``It's a very important thing for
our elected representatives to say that we want special focus on
these crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   On this fight, at least, Clinton's prospects seem dim.
</P>
<P>
   He vetoed a spending bill Monday in part because it had been
stripped of his hate crime proposals. He has stopped short of
threatening to hold up the amended version of that bill, whether it
contains his proposals or not.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., opposes the
proposals, said his spokesman John Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically we are very reluctant to get into the business of
federalizing the notion that one individual is less valuable than
another is, just because of the group they belong to,'' said
Czwartacki. ``That's just not a healthy thing, especially in our
society.''

kinds of crimes,'' Clinton said. ``It's a very important thing for
our elected representatives to say that we want special focus on
these crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   On this fight, at least, Clinton's prospects seem dim.
</P>
<P>
   He vetoed a spending bill Monday in part because it had been
stripped of his hate crime proposals. He has stopped short of
threatening to hold up the amended version of that bill, whether it
contains his proposals or not.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., opposes the
proposals, said his spokesman John Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically we are very reluctant to get into the business of
federalizing the notion that one individual is less valuable than
another is, just because of the group they belong to,'' said
Czwartacki. ``That's just not a healthy thing, especially in our
society.''

S.F. VOTERS TO DECIDE ISSUE ON CAMPAIGN SPENDING LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Demonstrating the tenacity of the campaign
finance reform issue, San Francisco voters will decide Tuesday
whether to lower the voluntary spending limits for candidates
running for the Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   And in March, they may consider a proposal for public financing
of campaigns in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics really has become the playground for millionaires,''
said Holli Thier, co-president of the League of Women Voters here,
who supports both plans. ``Our goal is to level the playing field,
to allow average citizens to run for office.''
</P>
<P>
   But the courts have tossed out attempts by the voters and the
Board of Supervisors to restrict campaign financing in the past two
mayoral elections.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition K on next week's ballot is the simpler of the two
ideas. It would lower the spending caps for supervisorial
candidates who, starting next year, will be running for office by
district, rather than citywide. The proposal would amend the city's
current spending cap law for those running for supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under citywide elections for supervisors, the spending
limit is $250,000 for each candidate. Prop. K calls for lowering
the amount to $75,000 for the general election, and adding another
$20,000 for candidates who get into a run-off election.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Marsteller of Common Cause, a group advocating campaign
finance reform, said candidates don't need as much money under
district elections because they have fewer voters to reach and less
territory to cover. Under district elections, the city will be
divided into 11 geographic sectors with roughly 65,000 residents
each.
</P>
<P>
   City law allows candidates who agree to the voluntary cap to
accept individual contributions of up to $500. Those who don't
comply are limited to $150 individual contributions. However, that
portion of the law which lowers contributions for those who don't
comply with the spending cap has been challenged in federal court
by mayoral candidate Clint Reilly, and it is unclear whether that
provision will remain on the books.
</P>
<P>
   There is little official opposition to Prop. K, but some
campaign consultants think it will favor incumbents over newcomers
who need more money to gain the attention of the public.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents, though, say the district campaigns likely will rely
more on bus-stop and door-to-door campaigning, which cost virtually
nothing, rather than expensive efforts that rely on mail and
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the more ambitious proposal to publicly finance
campaigns in San Francisco got a boost at the Board of Supervisors
Finance Committee on Wednesday. The committee wants the full board
to urge the city's Ethics Commission to hold hearings on public
financing, and if there's interest, to place a measure on the March
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind taxpayer support of political races is to
remove, or limit, the influence of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters strongly support curbs on the influence of money in
local and national elections,'' said Board of Supervisors President
Tom Ammiano, who's championing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants the Ethics Commission to look into curbing
campaign contributions from businesses with city contracts or those
that bid for city business.
</P>
<P>
   Several cities, among them Long Beach, New York, Los Angeles and
Tucson, already provide matching funds to candidates' campaigns.
The amount of money varies from about 5 cents to 80 cents per
resident. New York City spent close to $6 million in the 1994-97
election cycle; Long Beach spent about $41,000.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause estimates the cost to San Francisco for providing
candidates with 50 percent financing would be $1.2 million a year.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The fire burned out of control inside the CH-46
Sea Knight helicopter as Capt. Jack Estepp spotted the coastline
seven miles away through the clear Hawaiian night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started smelling something,'' he said. ``Then the fire
started. I didn't want to see anybody get hurt. These guys are my
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   His crew chief unable to stop the flames, Estepp ditched the
12-ton cargo helicopter in the Pacific Ocean. The crew of four was
rescued.
</P>
<P>
   What Estepp smelled on that October night in 1996 was leaking
hydraulic fluid, a smell that had become familiar to many of the
crews flying CH-46s
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaii crash is one of at least 71 incidents spanning more
than 11 years involving hydraulic problems in Sea Knight
helicopters, the Navy and Marine Corps' medium-lift troop and cargo
transport, capable of carrying up to 28 soldiers and passengers.
</P>
<P>
   None of the incidents was fatal, but in several cases, like the
one in Hawaii, crews barely escaped with their lives. At least
three helicopters were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   And the problems continue.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9 of this year, 11 years after the first hydraulic
problem was reported, a Sea Knight made an emergency landing near
Malibu Bluff Community Park, 200 feet above the coast and in the
center of the city of Malibu, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, a Sea Knight carrying reporters and
photographers off the USS Bonhomme Richard in California caught
fire when a hydraulic line broke. Two people, one a TV anchor, were
treated for smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-month Dayton Daily News examination found that the
military's handling of the hydraulic failures on Sea Knight
helicopters was typical of the way it handled numerous other
mechanical failures in many types of aircraft: Costs outweighed
risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make hard choices based on dollars and cents,''
said Marine Corps Col. Roger Dougherty, a former Sea Knight pilot
and until June the director of aviation safety at the Naval Safety
Center in Norfolk, Va. ``If it's a high risk that's going to happen
often, it gets fixed. That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News examination found that problems such as those
involving the Sea Knight hydraulic system often continue for
months, years, even decades. Sometimes costly solutions aren't
implemented until aircraft start falling from the sky or the death
toll rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is the system reacts, albeit slowly sometimes, to
the requirements that we generate here,'' said Bill Mooberry,
executive director of the Naval Safety Center in Norfolk. ``It
doesn't react slowly simply because it's unresponsive. It's simply
that the facts are that the process takes time and money and
engineering and analysis and all that other stuff to get it
fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Federal Aviation Administration, which monitors
civilian aviation safety, the Naval Safety Center cannot mandate
safety changes. It cannot issue fines. It cannot ground aircraft.
It cannot force the service to install a safer part on an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy makes the decisions,'' Mooberry said. ``All we do is
advise. I don't have the power here to enforce. ... I have the
power of moral persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can whine and pound on the desk and jump on people's tables
and beat at the rugs and stuff like that to try to get their
attention, but as far as the decisions about who does what to whom
... safety is part of it, but it's not the only part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't direct anything. Nobody here directs anythi
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the hydraulic failures, the problem started in
1988, about the time the Navy upgraded its fleet of Sea Knights
with new, more powerful hydraulic pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with that (new) pump was it was just too strong,''
said Marine Corps Maj. Tim Clubb, who oversees parts acquisition
for the CH-46.
</P>
<P>
   The new pumps increased the pressure in the hydraulic system by
15 percent and, at the same time, increased the amount of fluid
flowing through the system. The increased pressure in the lines,
Marine Corps officials acknowledged, could increase the risk that
leaking fluid could become atomized, or flammable, but they called
the 15 percent additional pressure ``negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another major difference in the pumps. The shaft in
the old pumps had an added safety feature: a weak point designed to
break when fluid in the system leaked out, through battle damage or
mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   The new pumps were designed to withstand combat damage, so the
shaft had no weak point. It would continue to run without fluid
until it burned up and, possibly, caused the leaking fluid to
ignite.
</P>
<P>
   From 1988 through 1992, there were at least four hydraulic
failures on Sea Knights. During the two years that followed, at
least a dozen more CH-46 helicopters suffered hydraulic failures.
None caused substantial damage.
</P>
<P>
   Until the night of Feb. 18, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On that night, a Sea Knight carrying a crew wearing night-vision
goggles flew from the deck of the USS Inchon. The helicopter had
just arrived on the ship, replacing another Sea Knight that crashed
the previous month because of unrelated engine problems, killing
three people.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after it left the deck, a crew member reported smoke
and a large amount of leaking hydraulic fluid. The Inchon prepared
for an emergency landing on deck, but the helicopter crashed into
the water, rolled right and then left before floating upside down.
</P>
<P>
   All four crew members were rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``This had been a problem that was identified before the Class A
(major accident), but sometimes it isn't always apparent of just
what the severity of the problem is,'' Col. Dougherty said. ``You
have a pump that fails and causes some minor damage and everybody
recognizes that we got to get the pump fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven more hydraulic failures followed the Inchon crash in
1994, none causing serious damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took them (Navy safety officials) awhile through trend
analysis'' to identify the problem, Maj. Clubb said. ``We
identified it, and we tried to find solutions to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the Navy had hoped that all the aging Sea Knights
would be replaced by 1994 with the new tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey. But
the Osprey program, which dragged as Congress debated cost and
other issues, was canceled in 1989, forcing the military to change
the way it would view long-term maintenance for the aging Sea
Knights.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1994, Congress brought back the Osprey program, again
forcing the military to change its long-term plans for maintaining
the aging Sea Knight helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, while the Navy still was two years away from approving
funding for the new pumps, 10 more hydraulic failures were
reported. Then, in 1996, helicopters started crashing.
</P>
<P>
   On March 19, 1996, Capt. Nobert J. Torres, Capt. Leo A. Kilgore
and 10 others had just taken off from the Marine Corps Air Station
in Yuma, Ariz., when the problems started.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of black-brown smoke began rushing into the cockpit,''
Kilgore told accident investigators. ``I looked back and saw
nothing but orange-red fire and black-brown smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was popping and cracking and small muffled booms _
explosions occurring. ... Capt. Torres and I began choking on the
smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Filled with smoke and flames, the helicopter landed on the
runway, giving the crew just seconds to escape before the flames
engulfed the aircraft. Two crew members suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door (escape hatch) fell to the ground,'' Torres said. ``I
jumped from the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yuma accident was the second hydraulic failure in 12 days,
the 29th since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The following month, on April 19, 1996, the hydraulic pump on a
CH-46D from the USS Mars failed, prompting a Navy official to
write:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fourth HAZREP (Hazard Report) our command has
released this fiscal year concerning failure of utility hydraulic
pumps. Research into history of failing pumps reveals no common
deficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine more failures were reported in the next five months. In one
of those, on Sept. 6, 1996, a helicopter filled with smoke and
fumes and was forced to make an emergency landing in a field near
Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   That helicopter was part of President Clinton's entourage
traveling in Florida, although Clinton was not on the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The following month, Estepp ditched his helicopter into the
ocean off Hawaii, bringing to at least three the number of Sea
Knights lost because of hydraulic problems.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, after at least 43 hydraulic failures on Sea
Knights in nine years, the Navy approved funding for a new pump.
But it wasn't until two years later, in January 1999, that the
first pump was installed.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps purchased 310 new pumps for the helicopters and
this year began installing them at a rate of 40 per month. The
pumps and spares cost $5.52 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, 16 hydraulic failures were reported in 1997,
and during the first seven months of 1998, the latest computer data
available, there were 13 more incidents.
</P>
<P>
   There were at least two other incidents involving hydraulic
failures on Sea Knights this year, both in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hear it coming,'' Paul Adams, recreation supervisor
for Malibu Bluff Community Park, said of the March 9 emergency
landing. ``They made a quick but nice landing.''
</P>
<P>
   Just four days later, a Sea Knight helicopter from the USS
Bonhomme Richard caught fire shortly after takeoff, sending a
fireball toward the area where reporters and photographers were
sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went up 10 feet, and they noticed the fire so they set it
back down,'' Navy spokesman Tim Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Green, anchor for KSBW-TV of Salinas, Calif., said the fire
started above the huge rear cargo door. That is the area where the
hydraulic pump is located.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started yelling fire, but nobody could hear me,'' said
Green, who has been piloting single-engine airplanes since 1989.
``Everybody had headphones on, and it was very, very loud'' inside
the helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Green and the others watched the fireball move toward them as
the helicopter made an emergency landing back on the deck of the
ship. The passengers had to exit through the cargo door, just under
what appeared to be the source of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Towards the end, as we were walking out, we had to stoop very
low because of the flames,'' said Green, one of two people treated
for smoke inhalation. ``A lot of guys were coughing, and they
wanted to get them off the deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody told me _ and this was third-hand _ that there was a
hydraulic line that leaked and was ignited by a spark.''
</P>
<P>
   The Naval Safety Center in Norfolk identified the cause as a
problem in one of the helicopter's hydraulic lines.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, all Sea Knights are expected to have
new hydraulic pumps. The V-22 Osprey is not scheduled to completely
replace the CH-46 until 2012.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we completely replace it ... the CH-46 will have
served 47 years,'' Gen. Charles C. Krulak, commandant of the Marine
Corps, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in January. ``In
terms of longevity, that is virtually the equivalent of taking the
Wright Brothers' aircraft, flown at Kitty Hawk in 1903, into aerial
combat into the Korean conflict in 1950.''

   DAYTON, Ohio _ The aging CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters _

explosions occurring . . . Capt. Torres and I began choking on the
smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Filled with smoke and flames, the helicopter landed on the
runway, giving the crew just seconds to escape before the flames
engulfed the aircraft. Two crew members suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door (escape hatch) fell to the ground,'' Torres said. ``I
jumped from the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yuma accident was the second hydraulic failure in 12 days,
the 29th since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The following month, on April 19, 1996, the hydraulic pump on a
CH-46D from the USS Mars failed, prompting a Navy official to
write:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fourth HAZREP (Hazard Report) our command has
released this fiscal year concerning failure of utility hydraulic
pumps. Research into history of failing pumps reveals no common
deficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine more failures were reported in the next five months. In one
of those, on Sept. 6, 1996, a helicopter filled with smoke and
fumes and was forced to make an emergency landing in a field near
Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   That helicopter was part of President Clinton's entourage
traveling in Florida, although Clinton was not on the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The following month, Capt. Jack Estepp ditched his helicopter
into the ocean just off the coast of Hawaii, bringing to at least
three the number of Sea Knights lost because of hydraulic problems.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, after at least 43 hydraulic failures on Sea
Knights in nine years, the Navy approved funding for a new pump.
But it wasn't until two years later, in January 1999, that the
first pump was installed.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps purchased 310 new pumps for the helicopters and
this year began installing them at a rate of 40 per month. The
pumps and spares cost $5.52 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, 16 hydraulic failures were reported in 1997,
and during the first seven months of 1998, the latest computer data
available, there were 13 more incidents.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, all Sea Knights are expected to have
new hydraulic pumps.

 &HT;    U.S. FAMILIES AREN'T BUILDING ENOUGH WEALTH, STUDY SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Financial (f) categories
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most low- to middle-income Americans believe that
they have a better chance of accumulating $500,000 by winning a
lottery or sweepstakes than from savings and investing, according
to a national poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Such financial ignorance _ combined with excessive consumer debt
_ has resulted in half of the nation's households building up less
than $1,000 in net financial assets, warned Stephen Brobeck,
executive director of the Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans are now aware of the consumer debt trap and the
need to build wealth but don't believe they can do so,'' said
Brobeck. ``There is a failure to appreciate the time value of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit consumer federation and the financial services
firm Primerica released the poll and a related study of household
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The research showed that millions of Americans are spending as
much as they make _ oftentimes more _ rather than taking advantage
of widely available ways to build up financial worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly all Americans have the ability to accumulate wealth if
they would make the commitment to do so,'' said Joseph Plumeri,
chairman of Primerica. ``Simply by building equity through home
ownership, taking advantage of an employer's retirement options and
saving monthly, most families can build assets of several thousand
dollars during their lifetimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The study of ``American Family Wealth'' is based on 1995 census
data. It showed that a family with the median annual income of
about $29,000 had net financial assets of only about $1,000. These
assets were calculated by adding the value of money in the bank,
stocks, bonds and other securities and subtracting consumer loans,
credit card debts, and other unsecured debts. Home equity and
mortgage debt were not included in the calculation.
</P>
<P>
   The median net wealth of all families _ which includes home
equity, other real estate and vehicles _ is about $35,500, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   Neither net assets nor net wealth included any pension funds
that a family might have either in 401(k) accounts or defined
benefit accruals.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, family wealth is closely associated with
family income. The fifth of families with the lowest incomes
($13,000 or less) had zero net financial assets and a median net
worth of $3,000. The top fifth, families with incomes of $55,000 or
more, had median net financial assets of $18,000 and median net
worth of $118,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brobeck said this disparity could be eased if low- and
middle- income families understood the benefits of saving and
investing small amounts of money over a long period of time. For
instance, he said, saving $50 a week for 40 years and investing it
at 9 percent annually would accumulate over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that 51 percent of people with household incomes
of $35,000 or less thought they stood a better chance of winning a
lottery than of saving and investing enough to accumulate $500,000
over a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Americans understood that their chances of winning a big
lottery jackpot were 10 to 20 million to one but that they could
accumulate hundreds of thousands of dollars through regular saving,
more families would put the $50 away rather than spending it on
gambling or unneeded consumption,'' said Plumeri.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 1,010 Americans 18 and older conducted
July 22-25 found that most respondents undervalued how invested
savings can build up over time. Asked how much $25 invested weekly
for 40 years at a 7 percent annual yield would amount to, nearly a
fifth estimated less than $50,000 and less than a third guessed
over $150,000. The correct answer is $286,640.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by Opinion Research Corporation
International of Princeton, N.J., and has an error margin of plus
or minus 3 percentage points. The analysis of family wealth was
based on U.S. Census data and made by Capital Research Associates
of Chevy Chase, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that most Americans overestimate the wealth of
the typical American household, with only a fifth guessing
correctly at ``under $50,000.'' About half (45 percent) guessed
higher and 34 percent did not venture an estimate.
</P>
<P>
   This rosy miscalculation ``probably explains why the declining
savings rate'' has not caused greater consern among ordinary
people, said Brobeck.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The life of Lt. Cmdr. Randall E. McNally II was
soaring the day he climbed into the cockpit of an A-6E Intruder jet
near San Francisco Bay in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Reserve pilot. Persian Gulf veteran. Notre Dame graduate.
Full-time Delta Air Lines pilot. Recent Stanford Law School
graduate. Aspiring novelist. Hero. Engaged to a former model and
Ice Capades skater.
</P>
<P>
   As McNally taxied his jet on Runway 31 at Alameda Naval Air
Station, he was unaware that he'd achieved yet another goal: a
letter notifying him that he had passed a state bar exam was in the
mail.
</P>
<P>
   At three minutes before noon, on April 5, 1994, as the sun
struggled to break through the clouds, two Navy jets zooming
overhead drew the attention of dozens of ironworkers and office
workers eating lunch beside the bay. Suddenly, McNally's two-seater
seemed to fly out of control and then became obscured in huge walls
of water as it crashed into the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane sank very quickly, leaving behind debris all over
the place,'' a fishing boat captain who pulled McNally from the
water said in a statement to Navy investigators. ``I knew the man
was still alive, if only barely, because he stirred and gulped for
air a few times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to rouse him, and he moved his head. His face was
bloodied and battered with lots of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   McNally's jet, like the rest of the A-6Es in his squadron, was
weeks away from being junked at an aircraft boneyard. The shop
maintaining the plane, Navy records show, was shorthanded at a time
when the workload was heavy, and the plane was awaiting a number of
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News , which examined never-before released
records from the Naval Safety Center, found that the A-6E that
McNally and Lt. Cmdr. Brian R. McMahon of Portland, Ore., flew over
San Francisco Bay was the subject of at least 10 technical
directives _ four identified as ``urgent'' and some years old _
requiring maintenance work on the plane that was never done.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight days before the crash, mechanics found problems with
the plane's stabilizer augmentor, an electronic system enabling the
pilot to better operate the aircraft's most critical flight-control
systems. Less than half the wreckage was recovered, and the
stabilizer augmentor was among the critical evidence never found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stabilizer augmentor functioning really badly could have
been a contributing factor,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Aladar Nesser, who
conducted one of two Navy investigations into the crash. ``This is
an important piece of evidence that could have ruled out one of the
final things that could have possibly occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   To fix the stabilizer augmentor problem, mechanics replaced a
computer system that had ``a high failure rate,'' Navy records
show, and in the 14.7 hours McNally's jet flew prior to the crash,
that computer system was changed twice, at least once by taking a
computer from another aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, military planes fall from the sky, and the reasons
frequently are hidden in a cloud of secrecy or lie at the bottom of
an ocean among the unrecovered wreckage. This was one of those
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never worried about my brother in an aircraft in
peacetime,'' said McNally's sister, Sheila McNally-Hoy, who works
as a nurse with her father's Chicago plastic-surgery practice. ``It
never occurred to me that his life was on the line every day he was
on an aircraft carrier or on a military base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous not only for the pilot but for everyone
involved, the guys on the deck. That's why all the people in the
military are putting their lives on the line every day, not just in
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   For McNally's family, the coming weeks would bring many
questions and too few answers.
</P>
<P>
   The A-6E that Randall McNally II flew on April 5, 1994, like the
other A-6Es in Attack Squadron 304, was to be mothballed sometime
before October of that year. The Navy, responding to cutbacks
mandated by Congress, had decided to decommission about a
half-dozen squadrons making up Reserve Carrier Air Group 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact we started to fly them to the boneyard in July
(1994),'' said Lt. Cmdr. Aladar Nesser, who investigated the
accident and was a member of the squadron.
</P>
<P>
   The A-6, first used in 1963, was the Navy's only medium-range
bomber, but its maximum speed was only about 650 mph, making it
more and more vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated
anti-aircraft weapons. By 1997, the Navy decommissioned all A-6s.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of McNally's crash in 1994, the maintenance shop
responsible for repairing the aging A-6s in Attack Squadron 304 was
shorthanded and under pressure. Records from the Naval Safety
Center described the shop this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``Undermanned and decreasing department was supporting a
challenging operational schedule which included frequent fleet
support detachments but was performing at an outstanding level.''
</P>
<P>
   The records also show managers were carefully monitoring the
shop because it was operating at ``decreasing levels.'' Still, the
records say, the mechanics were well-trained, and commanders
believed that ``safe maintenance was being done.''
</P>
<P>
   Records from the Naval Safety Center show that after a test
flight on March 28, 1994, eight days before the crash, mechanics
reported problems with the jet's stabilizer augmentor. The
electronic device helps the pilot operate the movable control
surfaces on the wings and tail _ parts critical to the operation of
the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to control a jet without a stabilizer augmentor is
similar to trying to steer a car when the power steering fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could affect the movement of the aircraft,'' said Don Delk,
an Air Force jet mechanic for 22 years. ``To me, that would be a
very important part of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mechanics suspected the problem with the stabilizer augmentor
was caused by the Air Navigation Computer, which operates
constantly on the aircraft and feeds information to aircraft
systems such as the autopilot and bombing systems.
</P>
<P>
   That computer, Navy investigators reported, had a ``high failure
rate.'' Investigators noted that during the A-6E's previous 14.7
hours of flight time, the Air Navigation Computer was changed
twice, at least once by cannibalizing a computer from another
plane.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the crash, McNally's plane had flown 5.1 hours
since the test flight in which mechanics found problems with the
stabilizer augmentor.
</P>
<P>
   Less than half of the aircraft was recovered, and a Navy
accident report listed the stabilizer augmentor among ``key items
missing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a mechanical piece that wasn't recovered that remains a
possibility,'' Lt. Cmdr. Nesser said. ``The stabilizer augmentor
system was looked over as a possible cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Naval Safety Center records also show that at the time of the
crash, McNally's A-6E had at least 10 outstanding technical
directives mandating maintenance work on the plane. Additional
records from an accident report show the aircraft had 18
outstanding directives, 12 of them identified as ``urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   No aircraft identified in the Navy Safety Center's accident
database had more outstanding technical directives.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the directives on McNally's jet mandated repairs on
wing parts, and at least five of those directives noted ``fatigue
cracks'' on the wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The A-6s had a history of wing cracks that were discovered
years ago,'' Nesser said, adding that the cracks prompted the Navy
to restrict the planes from performing certain maneuvers that put
heavy stress on the wings.
</P>
<P>
   McNally's A-6E was one of the planes restricted from flying
certain maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Rand McNally, nicknamed ``Atlas'' after the map publisher,
piloted his first vehicle atop the carpeted stairs of a rented
house in Wilmette, Ill. He was not yet 3 years old, and a
half-dozen of his siblings put him in a cardboard box and pushed it
down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rand, or course, ran smack into the wall,'' recalled his
brother, Edward, now an attorney in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, Lt. Cmdr. Randall E. McNally II was
preparing to crash-land an A-6 with a broken landing gear on the
deck of the USS Ranger, bouncing in the fog and darkness in heavy
seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so risky that the skipper gave Atlas the option of simply
pulling up, ditching the plane and ejecting to safety,'' Edward
McNally said.
</P>
<P>
   Rand McNally landed the plane successfully, only to be involved
in another accident six years later when his Navy jet crashed into
San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But until the crash, McNally lived a storybook life.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a prominent Chicago plastic surgeon, the red-haired
McNally was an extraordinary man from an extraordinary
Irish-Catholic family of 10 children. His brother Edward wrote
speeches for President Bush. Another brother is an orthopedic
surgical resident. One sister is a producer for the Oprah Winfrey
show; another a Los Angeles-based actress who has appeared in
commercials and TV shows such as ``Ally McBeal,'' ``Seinfeld'' and
``L.A. Law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was born in Texas, in the first year of the Kennedy era. It
was the cockiest state at the cockiest time in the cockiest country
on earth,'' Edward McNally once wrote. ``And proudly wearing his
mother's red hair and his father's esteemed name, Randall Edward
McNally II charged through life with all the energy and enthusiasm
of America itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Rand spent the rest of his life brilliantly piloting
America's Jeeps, America's Corvettes and America's jet airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rand McNally, a popular track star in high school, followed his
brother, Edward, into Notre Dame, where he roomed with a former
Marine. It was that relationship, his mother suspects, that led her
son to join the Marines and become an A-6 pilot.
</P>
<P>
   While in the Marines, Edward McNally said, his brother helped
rescue two American pilots who ejected in the Persian Gulf, and he
saved the life of another Marine in the western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, he left the Marines, got a job as a full-time Delta Air
Lines pilot, started a novel about Navy pilots titled ``Night
Landings,'' joined the Navy Reserves and applied to Stanford Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   McNally had been out of school for eight years. The university
didn't accept him immediately, putting him instead on a waiting
list. But McNally wouldn't accept no, so, without an appointment,
he got into his Corvette and drove 200 miles to speak with the
dean.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting hours for the dean, McNally walked into his office
and played a tape of his emergency landing on the USS Ranger from
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays that two-minute tape and says to the dean: `I think I
can handle the stress.' He was admitted,'' Edward McNally said.
</P>
<P>
   As his professional life soared, so did his personal life. One
day the wife of his best friend from high school introduced him to
her sister, former Ice Capades skater P.J. McShane, who also spent
five years working as a model.
</P>
<P>
   The two met again at a wedding and began dating. Months later,
the couple went on a ski trip in Gaylord, Mich., with dozens of
friends, and McNally hired a saxophone player to walk into the
restaurant where the group was eating.
</P>
<P>
   The saxophone player stood by McShane and played the Frank
Sinatra song ``All of Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he knelt down and asked her to be his wife,''
McNally's sister, Sheila McNally-Hoy, recalled. ``And, of course,
all of us old married people started to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   The wedding was set for June.
</P>
<P>
   By April 5, 1994, Lt. Cmdr. Randall E. McNally II had
accumulated nearly 2,100 hours flying airplanes, 1,289 of those in
the A-6E Intruder. The bombardier-navigator, Lt. Cmdr. Brian R.
McMahon, also a civilian airline pilot, had even more time flying
in A-6Es.
</P>
<P>
   Both were experienced aviators, respected by their peers. Both
were well-rested, in good health. Tests later showed neither was
under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   At 12 minutes before noon, Firebird 507, the call sign given to
McNally's plane that day, taxied down Runway 31 at Alameda Naval
Air Station, following another jet designated as the lead in a
two-plane formation for a training flight. A slight breeze blew
across the runway. Temperatures were in the mid-60s.
</P>
<P>
   At four minutes before noon, Firebird 507 was following the lead
aircraft past the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge. One minute
later, Firebird 507 made a routine radio transmission to Alameda
tower air traffic controllers, who advised the pilots to follow the
lead aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last transmission Firebird 507 would make.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer 1st class Robert H. Kruger, the Alameda tower
supervisor that day, had just put some popcorn in his microwave
when he spotted Firebird 507 about a half-mile south of Runway 31.
</P>
<P>
   He watched Firebird 507 make a normal turn but became concerned
when the plane's nose pointed downward after a 90-degree bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I yelled at the local controller: `Altitude safety alert.' I
observed what appeared to be flame from the left wing when the
aircraft was approximately 200 feet above the water,'' Kruger told
accident investigators. ``I saw the aircraft hit the water, left
wing first, followed immediately by the nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gobert, aboard a boat anchored nearby, told investigators
he saw ``a bright orange flash'' and then saw the pilots eject.
</P>
<P>
   Edward F. Eseh also watched from a boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I should not assume, but being a licensed pilot,
something I believe let go in the primary control system, mainly
ailerons _ pure conjecture _ but that pilot started to get back
(control). Then I think everything let go,'' Eseh said in a signed
statement to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Thompson, the captain of a fishing vessel called One Hope
150, told investigators: ``The plane seemed to be out of control,
going from side to side, with black smoke pouring out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, whose boat was only a quarter-mile away, watched the
plane sink quickly as he steered toward the crash site, spotting
one of the pilots in the water. Thompson had five 10-year-old boys
aboard his fishing boat, along with a woman, Lark Roper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Lark to keep the young boys out of the way and not to
let them look at the body in the water because I knew it was going
to be traumatic,'' said Thompson, who watched a Coast Guard boat
arrive just as he got to the site. ``The young Coast Guardsmen were
not so sure what to do and looked shocked at the sight of this
airman in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was sure if the man was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The airman Kevin Thompson pulled from the San Francisco Bay on
April 5, 1994, was the pilot of the A-6E Intruder, Lt. Cmdr.
Randall E. McNally II.
</P>
<P>
   McNally seemed to be struggling to stay alive as Thompson pulled
him into his boat and motored to a dock, where a paramedic tried
CPR. It was too late. Both McNally and his bombardier-navigator,
Lt. Cmdr. Brian R. McMahon, were dead.
</P>
<P>
   The crash that killed McNally and McMahon, married and a father
of two, at three minutes before noon was almost instantly labeled a
Class A mishap.
</P>
<P>
   Class A mishaps in the military involve a death or permanent
total disability, at least $1 million in damage or the loss of an
aircraft, regardless of the cost. These cases usually trigger two
separate investigations.
</P>
<P>
   One investigation is conducted by a team of military personnel
working through the service's safety center. Much of this
investigation is conducted in secret. Its findings, recommendations
and conclusions are not available to the public, although purely
factual information can be released.
</P>
<P>
   The military argues that secrecy is the only way to determine
the truth and prevent other accidents. Federal courts have upheld
the military's argument.
</P>
<P>
   The second investigation triggered by Class A accidents is the
so-called ``legal investigation,'' which the military calls the JAG
(judge advocate general) manual investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Because the recommendations and conclusions of the safety
investigation are secret, it is the legal investigation that is
given to the public and to the relatives of dead fliers as the
official explanation of what happened. The legal investigation also
is what the military offers to civilian courts in the event that
someone files a civil lawsuit over a military crash.
</P>
<P>
   But the explanation the military gives to the public, to
grieving relatives and to the courts is not nearly as thorough as
the recommendations and conclusions that come from the secret
safety investigation _ information the military keeps to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer resources usually are used on legal investigations.
Sometimes they involve only one officer who is not required to have
experience investigating aviation accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The officer appointed to investigate the April 5, 1994, crash
that killed McNally was Lt. Cmdr. Aladar Nesser, a member of
McNally's squadron, who described himself as a ``very good friend''
of McNally's.
</P>
<P>
   Nesser, now stationed in Italy, said he saw no conflict of
interest in investigating his friend's accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would it be?'' he asked. ``We're professionals. It's a
professional (organization) you're talking about: military
aviation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon for people to know each other and be
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Nesser, an experienced A-6 pilot, said he had no specialized
training in conducting aviation investigations except for a course
on writing JAG manual reports he took as part of a three- to
four-month officer school he attended in 1980. He wasn't sure how
long the course on JAG reports lasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember. It was 20 years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nesser said he had conducted one other JAG manual investigation,
into a motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was scheduled to be decommissioned, but Nesser said
that had nothing to do with the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were key upgrades on this (type of) airplane even
knowing it was going to be decommissioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under item 14 in the ``Opinions'' section of Nesser's accident
report, he wrote that the crew was too experienced and the angle of
the plane too steep to blame the crash only on pilot error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the high experience level and professionalism of
the flight crew and obvious severity of such a gross overbank, an
undetermined material failure ... cannot be ruled out,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Because less than half of the wreckage was recovered and because
key evidence was among the wreckage not recovered, the exact cause
will never be known, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Significant parts which would have aided in determining the
cause of the mishap were never found,'' his accident report says.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview, Nesser said, ``It's one of three things:
pilot error, mechanical failure or a little of each.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is it's a little of each.''
</P>
<P>
   For days after the funeral, P.J. McShane, Lt. Cmdr. Randall E.
McNally II's fiancee, was at his gravesite hour after hour, sitting
in a lawn chair under an umbrella to keep the sun off of her as she
studied for her final college exams. She told friends she sometimes
wanted to crawl into the grave to be with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went there every morning. She set out a folding chair and
an umbrella and sat there with her premed book and studied,''
Edward McNally said. ``She was there between 8 to 10 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, 1994, the day she was to marry Lt. Cmdr. Randall
McNally, P.J. McShane brought some friends to a spot alongside Lake
Michigan and held a ceremony to celebrate her love for her fiance
who had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Mass. She planted a tree for the spirit of their
marriage. We all had lunch afterward,'' said Sheila McNally-Hoy,
McNally's sister. ``It just seemed like the right thing to do at
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of several ceremonies the family held after McNally's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was lost, everyone I talked to felt like they lost
their best friend,'' McNally-Hoy said. ``The reason they felt that
way was because when Rand walked into a room, he let you know that
he knew that you were there.''
</P>
<P>
   In a eulogy to his brother, Edward McNally wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Rand lived several lifetimes. He had the love of his life, a
spectacular education, work so fulfilling he would have done it for
free, and the blessing of dying quickly, in the line of duty, doing
something he truly loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was handsome, dashing, courageous. ... Track star. Platoon
leader, born on an Air Force base. They say that Rand was born to
run, born to fly, born to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother knew that each of us is special, and he made us
feel that way, because every life has a dream and every life is
important, because it touches so many other lives.''
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the Dayton Daily News , Rear Admiral Frank M.
``Skip'' Dirren Jr., commander of the Naval Safety Center in
Norfolk, Va., reviewed records from McNally's crash. Neither of the
two investigations the Navy conducted, including the secret safety
investigation, identified a cause, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response, the safety center acknowledged that the
stabilizer augmentor _ an electronic system that enables the pilot
to better operate the plane's most critical flight control systems
_ was never found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it fail on the mishap flight?'' the written response says.
``Don't know. Apparently the unit was not found. That may have been
one of the reasons that the (cause of the) mishap was designated as
undetermined.''
</P>
<P>
   McShane joined McNally's parents and eight of his siblings on a
trip to Alameda Naval Air Station. They went to attend a military
ceremony for Randall McNally. They went to grieve. They also went
looking for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the feeling they were withholding something,'' said
McNally's mother, Margaret McNally.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randall E. McNally, McNally's father, said he, too, wanted
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose a child, it's almost better if you went,'' he
said. ``It's tormenting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole family thought it was just so tragic because Randall
was just so highly thought of,'' said Regina Crane of Springboro,
Ohio, a distant cousin of McNally's. ``He was just a wonderful
person.''
</P>
<P>
   What's made it even harder for his family and friends to accept
is the loss of a man at the height of an extraordinary life. And
what is equally hard for them to accept is that there are so few
answers about how he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as answers, we all know Rand is still watching us,''
said McNally's sister, Sheila McNally-Hoy.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the eulogy, Edward McNally wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``And so we, too, say goodbye, with a lump in our throats. ...
God bless you Rand and watch over us. .... Blue skies and fair
seas, little brother. Blue skies and fair seas.''

 &HT;    U.S. FAMILIES AREN'T BUILDING ENOUGH WEALTH, STUDY SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Financial (f) categories
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most low- to middle-income Americans believe that
they have a better chance of accumulating $500,000 by winning a
lottery or sweepstakes than from savings and investing, according
to a national poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Such financial ignorance _ combined with excessive consumer debt
_ has resulted in half of the nation's households building up less
than $1,000 in net financial assets, warned Stephen Brobeck,
executive director of the Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans are now aware of the consumer debt trap and the
need to build wealth but don't believe they can do so,'' said
Brobeck. ``There is a failure to appreciate the time value of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit consumer federation and the financial services
firm Primerica released the poll and a related study of household
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The research showed that millions of Americans are spending as
much as they make _ oftentimes more _ rather than taking advantage
of widely available ways to build up financial worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly all Americans have the ability to accumulate wealth if
they would make the commitment to do so,'' said Joseph Plumeri,
chairman of Primerica. ``Simply by building equity through home
ownership, taking advantage of an employer's retirement options and
saving monthly, most families can build assets of several thousand
dollars during their lifetimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The study of ``American Family Wealth'' is based on 1995 census
data. It showed that a family with the median annual income of
about $29,000 had net financial assets of only about $1,000. These
assets were calculated by adding the value of money in the bank,
stocks, bonds and other securities and subtracting consumer loans,
credit card debts, and other unsecured Home equity and
mortgage debt were not included in the calculation.
</P>
<P>
   The median net wealth of all families _ which includes home
equity, other real estate and vehicles _ is about $35,500, the
study found.
</P>
<P>
   Neither net assets nor net wealth included any pension funds
that a family might have either in 401(k) accounts or defined
benefit accruals.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, family wealth is closely associated with
family income. The fifth of families with the lowest incomes
($13,000 or less) had zero net financial assets and a median net
worth of $3,000. The top fifth, families with incomes of $55,000 or
more, had median net financial assets of $18,000 and median net
worth of $118,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, Brobeck said this disparity could be eased if low- and
middle- income families understood the benefits of saving and
investing small amounts of money over a long period of time. For
instance, he said, saving $50 a week for 40 years and investing it
at 9 percent annually would accumulate over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that 51 percent of people with household incomes
of $35,000 or less thought they stood a better chance of winning a
lottery than of saving and investing enough to accumulate $500,000
over a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Americans understood that their chances of winning a big
lottery jackpot were 10 to 20 million to one but that they could
accumulate hundreds of thousands of dollars through regular saving,
more families would put the $50 away rather than spending it on
gambling or unneeded consumption,'' said Plumeri.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 1,010 Americans 18 and older conducted
July 22-25 found that most respondents undervalued how invested
savings can build up over time. Asked how much $25 invested weekly
for 40 years at a 7 percent annual yield would amount to, nearly a
fifth estimated less than $50,000 and less than a third guessed
over $150,000. The correct answer is $286,640.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by Opinion Research Corporation
International of Princeton, N.J., and has an error margin of plus
or minus 3 percentage points. The analysis of family wealth was
based on U.S. Census data and made by Capital Research Associates
of Chevy Chase, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that most Americans overestimate the wealth of
the typical American household, with only a fifth guessing
correctly at ``under $50,000.'' About half (45 percent) guessed
higher and 34 percent did not venture an estimate.
</P>
<P>
   This rosy miscalculation ``probably explains why the declining
savings rate'' has not caused greater consern among ordinary
people, said Brobeck.

   CLINTON-INTERVIEW _ WASHINGTON _ Speeding toward the twilight of
his presidency, Bill Clinton is a man on a crusade. Whether the
goal is to build peace in the Middle East, end ethnic slaughter in
the Balkans or bridge the racial divide within his own nation,
Clinton is searching, again and again, for the common ground he
believes can resurrect communities and reconcile people riven by
history, hatred and fear. ``That's the message I've got to get to
society,'' he said in an Oval Office interview with Cox Newspapers,
``and I still think it's the central human struggle.'' (Deans, Cox

 &HT;    Grimsley's tidings of sadness and salvation
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 31
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Love is shelter, a physical space as palpable as two bodies
coiled in slumber. More than sex or religion or art, it is the
thing that ennobles the spirit and salves the heart. In ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' Milan Kundera called it ``shared
sleep.'' In the new novel by Jim Grimsley _ the Atlanta writer
whose pure style and heart-rending storytelling has earned him an
international reputation _ it becomes ``Comfort &AMP; Joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither as eloquent nor as artfully structured as his three
previous stories, this book is Grimsley writing at his best, and
worst. Dramatically clumsy, structurally confusing, with a
cumbersome central section that tries to fill in the gaps of the
past, the volume reads at times like a 291-page short story. Yet
for all its awkwardness and thinness of plot, it's difficult to put
down this bittersweet and affecting tale of heartbreak, sacrifice
and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   This sequel to ``Winter Birds,'' Grimsley's dark and highly
autobiographical first novel, is a prototypical tale of lovers from
opposite ends of the track. After growing up with hemophilia in an
impoverished North Carolina family and barely surviving the abuse
of his alcoholic father, Dan Crell is now a Grady Hospital worker.
A fragile man with a ``collarbone like two wings'' and a voice like
an angel, he falls for Ford McKinney, a young doctor from a family
of Savannah bluebloods. So imagine what happens when the two drop
in, unannounced, on the stodgy McKinneys at Christmastime. It's too
bad the dialogue often reads like a gay ``Love Story'' or a bad
``Dynasty'' episode (or am I thinking of ``ER''?).
</P>
<P>
   But as weak as some of the novel is, the section in which Danny
returns to a house of his childhood, and the trailer where his
mother now lives with his stepfather, is beautifully told. Danny's
mother warms to Ford, and though she is somewhat unsure about the
ring Danny plans to give his partner on Christmas Day, she
volunteers to wrap it. Moreover, there's something wonderfully
authentic about a Southern mother who asks: ``Do you boys ever cook
at your house, or do you eat out all the time?''
</P>
<P>
   Marriage, in whatever form, is a universal condition. But what
makes Dan and Ford's a wholly honorable (not to mention rare) union
is that it's based on kindness and nurturing. That redeems them,
and the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They slept peacefully, side by side, and the body of one
became adjusted to the rhythm of the other, and the breathing of
one slowed the breathing of the other, and they dreamed in tandem
and shared fragments of each other's dreams, and they grew more
like each other day by day, not in personality but in the fissures
of the brain, because, seeing the same things every day, day after
day, they laid crevices in themselves that were the same shape,
that were the same events written into memory, and this was enough,
without words, to keep them silent about the fact of their hates
and their fears, their deep concerns about each other, and the
certainty that one of them would die first and neither of them knew
which one it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   In such remarkable passages, Grimsley gets it absolutely right.

 &HT;    Gary Allan set to make it after being true to himself
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Country singer Gary Allan stopped giving a flip about Nashville,
its ponytailed executives and their stuffy resistance to change
sometime in January.
</P>
<P>
   That's when his label, historic Decca Records, unexpectedly
closed its doors, leaving most of its roster without record deals.
Allan, a California honky-tonker who had never quite crawled out of
the pack of post-Garth hat acts, was one of four artists offered a
contract by MCA, Decca's parent label. Frustrated with the music
business, particularly what he perceived as a lack of creativity
and risk-taking on Music Row, Allan stunned industry insiders with
his eat-my-dust response: ``No thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Just let me go.' I didn't want to be there,'' Allan
said. ``I told 'em, `When I first came to this label, you guys were
excited about me because I was different. Then you started tweaking
on me, and now I feel like you're scared of what I do. If I can't
make the record I want to make, I don't need to be here.'''
</P>
<P>
   MCA producer Tony Brown persisted, and hard-core country fans
should dedicate a Tabernacle of Twang to him. With ``Smoke Rings in
the Dark,'' Allan has made what could be the record of his career.
The title song is an aching tune of obsession and regret, the kind
that establishes a career and blasts Allan out of anonymity. From
the first call/response notes of a lonesome guitar crying out to
pedal steel, the tune sounds classic, fueled by Allan's sandpaper
vocals and strong lyrics: ``The night is like a dagger / Long and
cold and sharp / As I sit here on the front steps / Blowin' smoke
rings in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying video captures the aura of late-night anguish,
featuring a hatless Allan in a custom-made, vintage 1940s Nudie
suit. If fans were unclear about just who he was on his first two
albums, this push is likely to make him a major star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only will it put Gary Allan on the map as a player; I
think the kind of music that's on this album will help country
evolve,'' said Y-106.7 program director Steve Mitchell. ``Like the
Dixie Chicks, it's going to open the doors for country radio to
take a chance and play something that's different.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent private concert for the Atlanta country station,
Allan kicked back confidently in an overstuffed chair and said,
``This is the best buzz I've ever had on a record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make a record for radio. I want to make
something I would want to listen to,'' he said. ``It's really hard
for me to find songs that are straight down the middle for radio
that I can live with singing. I'm one of those people who sits
around and plays guitar until four in the morning, and I listened
to a lot of Roy Orbison and Chris Isaak this year. All that stuff
is in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Smoke Rings in the Dark,'' which arrived in stores
Tuesday, draws heavily from the Isaak/Orbison school of
tear-stained lyrics and V-8 guitar. But it is traditional in many
ways, jerking country's reins back to heartfelt basics as well as
experimentation. Three tunes _ ``Bourbon Borderline,'' ``Sorry''
and ``Learning to Live With Me'' _ were born during a guitar pull
at Allan's house with songwriting greats Harlan Howard, Harley
Allen and Guy Clark. Allan has even thrown in a
wreck-on-the-highway tune in which a battered and bloodied truck
driver's last words are something any Southern Baptist would
understand: ``Don't Tell Mama (I Was Drinkin').''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Californian seems to sense the potential career
explosion before him, and plans to spend most of the winter on the
road promoting the album. His private concert for Y-106.7 will air
at 9 p.m. Sunday. The show at Cowboys is his first appearance in
Atlanta since the album hit stores, and the honking Kennesaw club
may be his kind of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best vibe I get is the bar scene. I love it when that
energy gets going,'' he said. ``My favorite is when it's just
packed, everybody's sweaty, no air conditioning _ and a lot of
beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Allan
</P>
<P>
   11 p.m. Saturday. $10. Cowboys, 1750 N. Roberts Road, Kennesaw

 &HT;    Meryl Streep's performance, along with this surprising film,
simply inspirational
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounds like a ``Saturday Night Live'' skit. Wes Craven
(``Nightmare on Elm Street'' and the ``Scream'' series) directs
Meryl Streep (two Oscars), as an inner-city music teacher.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turns out, the joke's on us. Yes, ``Music of the
Heart'' _ wretched title _ is at heart a glorified TV movie. But
Streep's extraordinary performance makes this the rare
inspirational movie that actually is, well, inspirational.
</P>
<P>
   The story, which is true, previously provided the basis for an
Oscar-nominated documentary, ``Small Wonders.'' In the late 1980s,
Roberta Guaspari (Streep) finds herself abandoned by her husband
with two children to raise. Given that she gave up a promising
music career to be a full-time parent, job prospects are limited.
But a chance encounter with an old school pal (Aidan Quinn) reaps
an introduction to an East Harlem school principal (Angela
Bassett). Over the protest of the tenured music instructor _ a
pasty-faced and paper-thin antagonist who's the kind of mistake the
movie often makes _ Roberta gets a job teaching violin.
</P>
<P>
   During the film's first half, she overcomes everything from
reluctant students to confrontational parents. ``My son has better
things to do than learn dead white man's music,'' says one. But
Roberta's persistence pays off, and her class becomes a showcase
and an institution. In the second half, however, she's forced to do
battle with a budget-conscious school board that thinks music _
dead white man's or otherwise _ is a nonessential.
</P>
<P>
   The film's triumphant ending isn't unexpected; that's the kind
of movie this is. What is unexpected is how absolutely satisfying
it is. Like the similarly themed ``Mr. Holland's Opus,'' ``Music of
the Heart'' wins you over almost in spite of yourself. Almost in
spite of itself, too. There are some too-gooey moments, and adding
Gloria Estefan, in her acting debut, to the mix as a sympathetic
teacher underscores the movie's own awareness of how uncool it is.
But cool is hardly the point when you have cameos by the likes of
Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman. Or the chance to hear ``We Shall
Overcome'' on the violin.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Streep, who takes a potential cliche and turns
her into a full-bodied, compelling character.
</P>
<P>
   There are more challenging movies around. More original ones,
too. But ``Music of the Heart'' gets the job done, efficiently and
entertainingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music of the Heart''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Meryl Streep and Angela Bassett. Directed by Wes
Craven. Rated PG for language. 2 hours, 3 minutes.

   A massive dose of teenage angst
</P>
<P>
   By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   Actor-turned-filmmaker Frank Whaley must feel a special affinity
for Francois Truffaut's ``The 400 Blows.'' His feature debut, ``Joe
the King,'' could be called ``The 401 Blows.'' Or, given that it's
not half as good as the Truffaut classic, ``The 150 Blows.''
</P>
<P>
   The script, which won Whaley a prize at the Sundance Film
Festival, is reportedly semiautobiographical. Fourteen-year-old Joe
(Noah Fleiss) is a disaffected, neglected and ultimately rebellious
adolescent who, underneath it all, is actually a pretty good kid
stuck in terrible circumstances. He shares living quarters _ you
can't call it a home _ with his alcoholic, ill-tempered father (Val
Kilmer) and his well-meaning but overwhelmed mother (Karen Young).
</P>
<P>
   Left on his own, Joe gets into trouble at school _ Camryn
Manheim is a mean teacher, Ethan Hawke an ineffectual one _ and
basically supports the family by washing dishes at a greasy spoon.
The only control he has over his life comes through committing
needless petty crimes and mouthing off at just about anyone he
pleases. But as the pressures on him increase, so does his
anti-social behavior. He finally crosses the line when he tries to
steal enough money to replace his mother's beloved record
collection, smashed by his dad while in a drunken rage.
</P>
<P>
   Young Fleiss gives a good enough performance in the central
role, and it's amusing to watch Kilmer and Hawke go grungy in their
bids for independent-film respectability (Kilmer sports a beer
belly, Hawke scraggly facial hair). Further, the dank 1970s setting
is evoked without any self-conscious touches of nostalgia or camp.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie overall strikes one note _ a blend of blighted
poignancy and stark injustice _ and stays there. It's not that you
don't care about Joe; you just get tired of caring about Joe as
things go from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe the King'' is an affecting movie, but it's also a numbing
one. Even downers need some downtime _ a slight change of pace, a
touch of self-aware humor. Devoid of the merest glimmer of hope,
``Joe the King'' wears its royal mantle of suffering a little too
proudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe the King''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Noah Fleiss and Val Kilmer. Directed by Frank Whaley.
Rated R for language. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Unhappy is the head that wears the crown in this
``400 Blows'' wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   `Suburbans' as bland as a tract house
</P>
<P>
   By Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   A bland project that can't decide whether it's a music-biz
satire or a midlife-crisis comedy-drama, ``The Suburbans'' concerns
a one-hit-wonder teenage band from 1981 (named the Suburbans) that
gets rediscovered by a music industry executive, played by Jennifer
Love Hewitt, who wants to market their retro-music to the
``post-boomer, pre-millennial demographic.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Craig Bierko (``The Thirteenth Floor'') plays a
leather-jeaned band member whose girl-crazy antics give the movie
some kick. But the script focuses on Danny (Donal Lardner Ward),
whose fears of commitment to girlfriend Grace (Amy Brenneman, far
too good for the movie) take up much screen time. There's a reason
Danny's the focus: Ward is the movie's co-writer and director, and
he also wrote the tinny little song that supposedly launched the
Suburbans to fame.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, blame him.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's idea of humor is to put the guys on a Kenny G tour
bus, have a toddler take a tinkle on an adult, or make the band
members walk around with enormous wigs. It's a spoof without bite.
The sole bit of interest comes from Jerry and Ben Stiller as
father-and-son record executives whose hyper-hipster spiel is as
scary as it is funny. Like the look-alike cul de sacs of the
neighborhood that gives the band its name, this flick is generic,
repetitive and boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The
</P>
<P>
   Suburbans''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Craig Bierko and Donal Lardner Ward. Rated R for
language and some sexuality. 1 hour, 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Lame that tune.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet, slow starter has its charms
</P>
<P>
   By Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   It's not a good sign when a movie starts to bore you even before
the actors appear onscreen. That's the effect of the camera's
lugubrious crawl through an elegant drawing room at the start of
``The Grandfather,'' a Spanish movie that tries to blend a
pulp-fiction plot with pastoral scenery and old-fashioned nobility.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Fernan-Gomez plays Count Don Rodrigo, the now penniless
patriarch of a noble family who lost his fortune searching for
fabled gold in the Americas, and whose only son has died while he
was away. The count's only heirs are his estranged daughter-in-law
Lucrecia (Cayetana Guillen Cuervo), and his two granddaughters,
whom he loves and is visiting in the countryside at an estate that
once belonged to the family. (It's now owned by former servants,
whose petty treatment of the old man reflects the film's
class-conscious, conservative politics.)
</P>
<P>
   After ambling through a half-hour of talky exposition, the
movie's story kicks in, becoming a turn-of-the-century variation on
Shakespeare's ``King Lear.'' The count is the Lear figure, his
granddaughters a bifurcated version of loyal Cordelia, while their
aging tutor, Coronado (Rafael Alonso), is the faithful Gloucester
figure to the old man. Lucrecia and the townsfolk, who support her
every whim, because of her financial and political clout, are the
upstarts who wish to shove the old man out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   That becomes especially crucial to Lucrecia once she realizes
that the count knows her secret: that one of her daughters is
illegitimate. The count determines to discover which of the two is
his true heir, even at the cost of exposing their mother's
infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the melodrama of the plot, it's laid out with such
talkiness that viewers will be either mesmerized or irritated. If
you let yourself get on director Jose Luis Garci's languid
wavelength, you might enjoy some retrograde pleasures and the
coastal Spanish landscape. In case you start to fade out, the movie
throws in repetitive, sentimental music by Edward Elgar and Erik
Satie to underscore every emotion.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

Rated PG for thematic elements and language. 2 hours,

<P>
   A look at the satiric yet sunny side of sex
</P>
<P>
   By Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   ``Go Fish'' director Rose Troche expands on her buoyant first
film with ``Bedrooms &AMP; Hallways,'' shown earlier this month at the
gay and lesbian festival Out on Film. The new comedy widens
Troche's focus, from Chicago's lesbian dating scene to a view of
sexuality (gay and straight) that's constantly in flux.
</P>
<P>
   Set in contemporary London, Robert Farrar's cheerfully satiric
script concerns an attractive bunch of young people whose love
lives reflect the title: sex experienced as a constant mix of
journey and arrival at a destination.
</P>
<P>
   Leo (Kevin McKidd) is an affable gay man invited by his straight
pal Adam (Christopher Fulford) to join his men's therapy group,
which gives the movie plenty of opportunity to gently mock the
``Iron John'' aesthetic. Keith (Simon Callow) is the group's
leader, sharing his home with Sybil (Harriet Walter), also a
therapist; the two have ongoing discussions over who gets to use
the Moroccan Room and the whereabouts of the Tibetan Singing Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It's at this guy-group that Leo admits that he's attracted to
one of its members, an Irishman named Brendan (James Purefoy), who
has just broken up with his girlfriend of seven years, Sally
(Jennifer Ehle). Though it seems that the closest he'll get to
bedding Brendan is in his dreams, which include a funny Jane Austen
fantasy, Leo discovers that Brendan may be open to broadening his
sexual experiences. (Brendan works at a bakery, leading to a
discussion between Adam and Leo about the romantic implications of
the extra ham and pickles Brendan has put in Leo's sandwich.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Leo's fey roommate Darren (Tom Hollander) is busy all
over town, having an affair with real estate agent Jeremy (Hugo
Weaving, of ``The Matrix'') in all of the properties Jeremy has
keys to.
</P>
<P>
   The story lines all converge when Sally starts to wonder who her
ex is spending time with, leading to a small-world revelation
that's no less pleasant for being contrived.
</P>
<P>
   Like the recent ``Relax ... It's Just Sex'' _ but without that
film's unfocused meandering and Southern California self-absorption
_ ``Bedrooms &AMP; Hallways'' spreads its interest among an extended
family of friends. In fact, everyone tends to be so genial and
open-minded that you might be anxious for a dose of melodrama or a
good jealous tantrum. But in the end, it's the movie's generous
viewpoint that makes watching ``Bedrooms &AMP; Hallways'' a sunny
experience. It finds in its characters' search for love a great
deal of human fallibility, sweetened with forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedrooms
</P>
<P>
   &AMP; Hallways''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin McKidd, Hugo Weaving and Jennifer Ehle. Unrated,
but contains nudity and sexual situations. 1 hour, 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   A sunny look at a series of revolving bedroom doors in modern
London.

 &HT;    Shadowy `Third Man' stands test of 50 years
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when Orson Welles as Harry Lime struck as
familiar a chord in movie-lovers' memories as Marlon Brando as Don
Corleone. But somehow director Carol Reed's 1949 masterpiece, ``The
Third Man,'' has gotten lost in its own noir shadow. Ask for it at
your neighborhood Blockbuster and all you're likely to get is a
blank stare.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the good news. In honor of its 50th anniversary, the
film is back in all its elegantly cynical, gorgeously photographed
glory. The print has been restored, as have 11 minutes that
producer David O. Selznick cut from the American version. (Reed,
who won an Oscar two decades later for ``Oliver!'' was British.)
The film wasn't gutted, just trimmed, so the extra footage mostly
means more of an already good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change is in the opening narration. Originally it
was spoken by the film's American protagonist, Joseph Cotten. Now,
screenwriter Graham Greene's distinctively arch words are voiced by
the director himself, thus more effectively setting the picture's
richly mocking tone, and providing a better match for the
celebrated zither score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Third Man'' takes place in postwar Vienna, Austria.
Divided into five zones overseen by the different Allies, the city
is a patchwork of corruption and crumbling rubble. The damp streets
seem deserted, but the closer you look, the more you see. ``We'd
run anything,'' Reed's anonymous narrator says of the thriving
black market. ``If people wanted it, and they could pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Holly Martins (Cotten), a hack writer of pulp westerns with
titles like ``The Lone Rider From Santa Fe,'' is summoned to Vienna
by his old friend Lime, whom he hasn't seen in years. Almost the
moment he arrives, he learns that Harry is dead; he was hit by a
car. But eyewitness accounts of the accident don't add up; the
title refers to one glaring discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   So, behaving like one of his cowboy heroes, Holly naively
decides to find out the truth. In doing so, he's drawn into Harry's
sinister circle of friends and falls for his dead (or is he?) pal's
lover, Anna (Alida Valli). Meanwhile, capable but cold Major
Calloway, played by Trevor Howard in full stiff-upper-lip mode,
watches to see if Holly's blundering will, perhaps, unearth Lime,
whom he regards as ``the worst racketeer who ever made a dirty
living in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   There is so much to admire here, from the exquisite
shadows-and-sidestreets cinematography to the expert performances _
especially that of Welles, who appears in only about 10 minutes of
the film yet dominates almost every frame.
</P>
<P>
   Further, seen through the prism of half a century, the movie
comes off as even more world-wearily correct about the death of a
certain kind of white-hat idealism. It is, in a sense, a
bittersweet eulogy for a lost moral compass in which right and
wrong were clearly defined. In ``The Third Man,'' even the shadows
tell lies.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The Third Man''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles. Directed by Carol Reed.
Not rated, but there is implied violence.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Not to be missed.

AVOIDING UNWANTED PREGNANCIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battling factions in the abortion debate ought to agree on
the need to decrease the 49 percent of pregnancies in the United
States that are unintended. New research points toward strategies
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those unintended pregnancies end in abortion. The other
half frequently lead to maternal complications and poorer outcomes
for infants, which can drive up health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Too often the culprit in unwanted pregnancy is seen as simple
carelessness. But more-thoughtful research has linked unwanted
pregnancies to a variety of abusive environments. The Journal of
the American Medical Association recently reported a study of
almost 1,200 adult women in which 20 percent of unintended first
pregnancies were associated with a ``history of abuse and household
dysfunction during childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The abuse studied included psychological, physical, and sexual
abuse, having a mother who was physically abused by her partner,
substance abuse, and living with a household member who was
depressed, mentally ill, or had attempted suicide. Almost 66
percent of the women reported exposure to at least two types of
abuse. And frequent abuse or exposure to four or more types of
abuse made women 1 1/2 times more likely to have an unintended
first pregnancy than other women.
</P>
<P>
   How can this research be applied? Patricia Dietz of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, the article's first author,
calls for more study to clarify exactly how past abuse and
household dysfunction contribute to unwanted pregnancies. There's
also an expanded role for medical providers. Many screen for
current abuse, Dietz points out, but fewer look for past abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than create a new class of victims, the work should
improve pregnancy prevention efforts. In 1994, the article points
out, ``women 20 years and older accounted for 76 percent of all
unintended pregnancies.'' They need the best insights into
prevention that research can offer.

</P>
<P>
   ``What the gol darn are you doing lying on the floor?'' a friend
asks the elderly Alvin Straight ( Farnsworth), whom he finds unable
to rise from the kitchen linoleum one afternoon. Taken to the
clinic by his retarded daughter, Rosie (Ms. Spacek), Alvin learns
what he knows already: his hips are gone, his eyes are going,
diabetes threatens and he's in the early stages of emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   Time to lay off the cigars and braunschweiger. But Alvin is a
stubborn fellow. When he learns that his estranged brother, Lyle (
Stanton), has had a stroke, he determines to go see him. Denied a
driver's license because of his eyesight, he decides to drive
anyway _ on his rider lawn mower.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin lives in Iowa, Dean in Wisconsin. The mower, hauling a
homemade trailer with a few belongings, goes three or four miles
per hour. All day Alvin chugs along the shoulder of the two-lane
road. At night he pulls off into the fields and sleeps under the
stars.
</P>
<P>
   An open, gracious man, he charms everyone he meets with his
gentle humanity, self-sufficiency and determination to finish the
trip the way he started it.
</P>
<P>
   As the journey proceeds, so does the story of Alvin Straight:
his boyhood, his experiences as a sniper in World War II, his
marriage and 14 children (seven of whom survived), his resilience,
sagacity and love of family. The mower gives out on several
occasions, but never Alvin.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None in the usual sense, but a deer is hit by a car and
there's one brush with danger when the mower's brakes fail on a
steep hill and send Alvin racing, so to speak, into town. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE Almost eerily in a movie by Lynch (``Blue Velvet,''
``Twin Peaks''), the only bizarre moment comes after the car hits

what warning she issues _ honking her horn, yelling out the window,
banging on the car door _ she can't avoid hitting a deer every week
on her drive to work. &QL;

   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 12 A G-rated film by Lynch is almost occasion enough
to take the little ones, especially a film as warmly rich and full
of family values as this one. Unfortunately, it moves very slowly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP OK, on the face of it a movie about an old man
and his lawn mower has little appeal to teen-agers. This one,
though, could grab hold with viewers willing to suspend themselves
for a short while (the 110-minute length is tolerable) and settle
in with Alvin (a true winner), not to mention a finely wrought film
in every respect.

   Bats can be as small as bees, but these are fox bats, which come
with five-foot wingspans, have heads like gargoyles, crash through
windshields and rip down chain-link fences. One night about a
million of them come whizzing down on Gallup, Texas, and make a
mess out of the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   Fox bats are ordinarily fruit eaters, but some biological
tinkering suddenly has them eating anything. Call out the troops,
evacuate Texas, consult the Central Intelligence Agency. Eradicate
those bats or they'll be in New Orleans in time for Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   The government favors diving bombing all the caves in the
region, but that approach has the disapproval of Dr. Sheila Casper
(Ms. Meyer), a ravishing zoologist and bat person (``What got you
into bats in the first place?'' she is asked.).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Casper says an aerial attack will kill everything but the
bats. Pointing out that bats perish in temperatures under 32
degrees, she favors freezing them. Fine, but it's now in the 60s.
It turns out, though, that the CIA has developed just the machine
for the job, a big chuffer that it is claimed could turn Cairo into
icicles in three days.
</P>
<P>
   But then the bats eat the Army, which complicates installation
of the device in the bat lair in an abandoned mine. Looks as if the
doctor and Sheriff Emmett Kimsey ( Phillips) will have to lower
themselves down there and jump-start the air-conditioning.

   And now for a 20-something screwball sex comedy. Angling to
design a $90 million cultural center, the architect Oscar Novak (
Perry) allows himself to be perceived as gay by the entrepreneur
Charles Newman ( McDermott) who controls the project. A crass
schemer, Charles wants a ``safe'' male around to keep tabs on his
girlfriend, Amy (Ms. Campbell), a glass sculptor and attractive
loose cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar, of course, falls for Amy, and she somewhat for him.
Charles is married, but that's nothing compared to the gyrations
Oscar goes through to declare his homosexuality to the world on one
hand and then swear up and down that he's straight to friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
   Could any one architectural project be worth all this?
Absolutely. Gradually, though, Oscar tires of the subterfuge and
determines to declare himself heterosexual. But where's Amy?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>

   FOOTNOTE Like many Hollywood films, this one is so awkwardly
self-conscious about depicting homosexuality that one wonders why

leering cliche is firmly in place. &QL;

   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 12 Unsuitable. &QL;
</P>
<P>

SUSPECT IN YOSEMITE DEATHS SUED BY FAMILIES OF VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RYAN KIM  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The families of three slain Yosemite sightseers
have filed wrongful death suits against Cary Stayner, the motel
handyman accused of killing them, and against the lodge where he
worked and allegedly attacked the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The suits were filed Wednesday in Fresno County Superior Court
on behalf of the families of Carole and Juli Sund and Silvina
Pelosso, who disappeared Feb. 15 from the Cedar Lodge near
Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both families say the lawsuits have several goals,
including obtaining information about the killings, holding Stayner
and the motel responsible, and preventing Stayner from later
profiting from his story.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunds' attorney, Zachary Zwerdling, said it is still unclear
what occurred the night of the killings, how much the motel knew
about Stayner and what security measures they took to protect
guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have questions about what happened and this is the only way
to get answers about it,'' said Zwerdling.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rankin, spokesman for Cedar Lodge, said he had not
received the suit yet and was only able to release a short prepared
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our belief that the person responsible for the tragedy
that has befallen the Sund and Pelosso families is Cary Stayner,
who according to news reports has confessed to the crimes and who
now stands formally charged with the crimes in state court,'' read
the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, 38, was charged with murder last week in Mariposa
County for the deaths of 42-year-old Carole Sund, her 15-year-old
daughter Juli, and Pelosso, 16, a family friend. He was indicted in
August in the beheading of naturalist Joie Armstrong, 26, who
disappeared in July. If convicted in either homicide case, he could
receive the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner's attorney, federal public defender Robert Rainwater,
said he didn't believe Stayner has been served with the suit yet
and is unaware if Stayner has retained a civil attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine it's the least of his worries,'' said
Rainwater of the suits.
</P>
<P>
   While Stayner, who remains in Fresno County Jail, has confessed
to the killings in various interviews, some of the information _
including whether he sexually assaulted the women _ has been
contradicted by court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Jens Sund, Carole's husband, said such conflicting reports have
made him anxious to know what really happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really believe him, because he keeps changing his
story,'' said Sund, of Eureka, Calif. ``I'd like to know but then
part of me doesn't want to know everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Sund would like to know what supervision was
placed on Stayner and what, if any, screening was done when Stayner
was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner reportedly worked on and off for the lodge and was laid
off at the time of the Sund and Pelosso killings. Steven Fabbro,
attorney for the Pelosso family, said he's found complaints from
other guests about Stayner that should have raised concerns from
officials at the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew or should have known that he was harassing guests
and he presented a danger to them,'' said Fabbro.
</P>
<P>
   Fabbro said Stayner was apparently able to roam the motel and
may have had access to a master key, with which he could have
gotten into the Sunds' and Pelosso's room. He said it is
questionable if Carole Sund, a normally cautious woman, would have
let Stayner into the room, as he has reported.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also alleges that the women were given a remote room
that may have made them easier targets for Stayner.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Sund said he would like to see motels increase their
security to help prevent future incidents like this.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunds' lawsuit does not specify a damage amount. The Pelosso
suit asks for $10 million in general damages and $10 million in
punitive damages.

FOR TURKS, ART TO MARK 700TH YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Turkey may be recovering from a crushing earthquake,
but nothing will stop that proud country from commemorating next
year's 700th anniversary of the founding of the Ottoman Empire.
Turks are rediscovering their pre-republic past with an enthusiasm
that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In London they were among the top bidders at Sotheby's
record-breaking Islamic Week auctions, which just ended, and they
are expected to appear in New York on Monday for Christie's sale of
Orientalist paintings and works of art from the estate of Akram
Ojjeh, a Syrian-born financier who died in 1991. The Orientalist
paintings go on view Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Turks are already lending works for a number of American shows.
``Letters of Gold,'' an exhibition of calligraphy that was at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, is now at the Arthur M. Sackler Arts
Museum at Harvard. It has 71 important works of hand-lettered
Ottoman calligraphy lent by the Turkish industrialist Sakip
Sabanci, who has been collecting Korans, palace prayer books and
Ottoman calligraphy panels for years.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts, dating from 1512 to 1909, are as striking as
works of art as they were powerful as ferman (edicts) in the past.
</P>
<P>
   People who miss this exhibition can look forward to ``Palace of
Gold and Light,'' which is opening at the Corcoran Gallery of Art
in Washington in March. The artworks in the show will come from the
Topkapi Palace Museum in Istanbul. The Corcoran will display some
of the earliest Ottoman objects ever to leave Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is different is our focus on Mehmed II the Conqueror and
the 15th century,'' said Dr. Tulay Artan, a university history
professor who is the curator of the show. ``We will demonstrate the
magnitude of the cultural exchanges between the Ottomans and the
Far East and Western Europe. We have Italian velvets, rock crystal
from Burgundy and Chinese porcelains.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ottoman artifacts will include early Turkish carpets, court
jewelry, gilded metalwork, manuscripts and the emerald-encrusted
18th-century Topkapi dagger that was the object of so much
attention in Jules Dassin's 1964 film ``Topkapi.''
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a sultan's collapsible ebony-and-ivory
campaign throne, his sable-lined, brocaded silk caftan, some
jewel-encrusted turban ornaments and gilded-copper horse armor.
</P>
<P>
   In London, sales of Islamic art have broken records in the last
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was very strong bidding throughout,'' said Nicholas
Shaw, Sotheby's Islamic specialist there. ``There was success in
books, coins, paintings, ceramics and carpets.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 13, Sotheby's sold a painting called ``Sunset,
Constantinople'' by an Italian artist, Hermann David Salomon
Corrodi, for $71,750, one of the top 10 lots in its Travel Sale and
thought to be a world record for Corrodi. The next day the auction
house sold a rare Iznik blue-and-white stemmed dish, known as a
tazza, circa 1575, for $139,000, again one of the top 10 lots in
the sale of Arts of the Islamic World.
</P>
<P>
   In that sale, one 15th-century Iznik tile set a world record for
a tile, at $83,200. A 17th-century Iznik dish with a lion motif
sold for $133,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a genuinely unique depiction of a lion,'' Shaw said.
``It may have been borrowed from a miniature or metalwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's Islamic sales, which began in 1976, attract Turkish
antiques dealers, museums and private collectors. Erdogan
Demiroren, a Turkish industrialist, and his wife, Tulin, have been
serious collectors for years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the Demirorens' Istanbul house burned to the ground,
and they lost everything. The calamity was compounded because their
house was a yali, a 19th-century wooden villa built in the Turkish
style right by the Bosporus.
</P>
<P>
   Simple on the outside and elaborate within, yalis were the
summer villas of the ruling elite. To escape the heat in June, the
sultan and his court retreated to the Bosporus north of the city.
When the sultan moved to a summer palace, the pashas (top military
officers) occupied their yalis.
</P>
<P>
   In time some of the yalis became consulates for German, Italian,
British, French and other powers eager to maintain close relations
with the government. (The most notable, still in use, is Egypt's
Art Nouveau confection.)
</P>
<P>
   The Demiroren yali may have been doomed from the start. It was
built in the late 19th century by a French marquis. As the story
goes, the marquis had done a favor for the sultan, and in gratitude
the sultan gave him a beautiful young woman.
</P>
<P>
   The marquis fell in love with the woman, married her and decided
to build a yali and fill it with beautiful things. Soon, however,
he became so jealous of his wife's admirers that he put the front
door in the side yard, out of sight of his neighbor, a lawyer.
(Yalis face the water, because their owners travel by boat.)
</P>
<P>
   The marquis took a Turkish name, Necip, and his famous yali was
called the Marquis Necip Bey Yalisi. Unfortunately, he could not
retain his wife's affections. As soon as he died, she went off with
the lawyer. Until the fire, the yali had been in decent shape.
</P>
<P>
   The Demirorens rebuilt their house and slowly replaced its
contents. Today, the walls are again covered with Orientalist
paintings, some of them by fine, little-known Italian painters, and
rare Ottoman textiles. Tables are adorned with Iznik dishes,
Ottoman horsehair fly swatters with ivory handles and large pieces
of Tombak, a Turkish copper that is gilded.
</P>
<P>
   Their collection, which includes antique Sussani embroideries
and 16th-century silk velvets from Bursa, 19th-century silver ewers
and 18th-century brass braziers, is so important that they are the
only private collectors who are being approached to lend pieces for
the Topkapi show, Mrs. Artan said.
</P>
<P>
   If the auction houses record ever more successful sales, perhaps
other Turkish collectors will join the list.
</P>
<P>
   A Beverly Hills Fair
</P>
<P>
   The Beverly Hills International Art and Antique Fair, now in its
second year, opened Thursday and continues through Nov. 4. Although
many dealers at the fair specialize in fine jewelry or art, the
exceptions are interesting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Galerie Jacques de Vos of Paris has a pair of Serge
Roche consoles from the 1930s with palm-leaf bases and matching
mirrors. Galerie de Beyrie of New York has a Jean Prouve dining
table from 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ferrini, a private dealer in Akron, Ohio, is showing
illustrated manuscripts from the 1400s by a master from Bruges.
Peter Finer of England is selling a jewel-covered presentation
scimitar that was made for the Turkish market in 1842. And Silver
Fund Ltd. of London has an inventory of George Jensen silver from
the early 1900s, including a wine cooler and a five-light
candelabrum.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of antiques in the Beverly Hills fair is wide _ and
welcome in this bastion of modernism.

HOME-BASED MEDICAL BUSINESSES ENJOY VARIABLE HEALTH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: There are tons of ads to file medical claims at home using a
PC. Are any of these offers legitimate?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.B., Burleson, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: ``There are far more bad companies than good ones out
there,'' said Rick Benzel, author of ``Making Money in a Health
Service Business on Your Home-Based PC.'' ``I am very frustrated by
the number of companies that tout medical billing as an easy
business. It's very difficult and competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Zemek, the director of trade practices at the Phoenix
Better Business Bureau, said that some companies sell
claim-processing software for thousands of dollars but offer no
support when you try to find clients for your new business. ``The
people that are successful are the ones who've gone out and beaten
the doors to get contracts themselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Benzel's book describes the pitfalls and benefits of three
medical work-at-home businesses: billing, claims assistance and
transcription. ``You need a good medical or accounting background
to understand how a doctor's business makes money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His book is available at bookstores under ISBN 0-0791-3139-5,
and you also can order it for $37.50 from Rick Benzel, 11670
National Blvd., PMB 104, Los Angeles, CA 90064.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a discussion forum for people running such
businesses at the Web site www.claimtek.com/wwwboard/wwwboard.html.

<P>
   Q: When are the WB Radio Music Awards going to air?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.C., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: The awards will air live at 7 p.m. CDT Thursday on WB
stations.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year for the awards show, which will be held
at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. Performer and
song nominees are based on radio airplay during the past year, and
winners are chosen by a vote of 400 radio programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees include the Dixie Chicks, Lenny Kravitz, Lauryn Hill
and Cake. Some scheduled performers are David Bowie, Faith Hill,
Destiny's Child and BWitched.
</P>
<P>
   Five award categories will be decided by votes cast on the Radio
Music Awards Web site at www.thewb.com/rma.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the name of the tiny symbol used at the end of a
magazine article to let you know it has ended?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.P., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The symbol is called a ``dingbat,'' a term that's commonly
applied to any border, separator or decorative character on a
printed page. That definition dates to at least 1904, according to
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dingbat'' originally referred to an early coin and other forms
of currency, but now is used most often to describe a stupid,
eccentric or crazy person.
</P>
<P>
   The Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang credits
that meaning to The Dingbat Family, a comic strip by George
Herriman, published from 1910 to 1916.

WE REALLY NEEDED AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas voters will soon complete the process of determining how
many of a batch of 17 proposed amendments to the Texas Constitution
will be added to the 377 that already have been attached to the
fundamental document of the state's government.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the ladies and gentlemen who labor in the
legislative vineyards in Austin could not summon up the wisdom and
fortitude to include another proposition that many Texans believe
to be way past due.
</P>
<P>
   Putting that omission aside for a moment, it does seem
appropriate to complement the esteemed members of the state House
and Senate for their extraordinary display of collective ability to
communicate their wishes to the voting and nonvoting public
concisely.
</P>
<P>
   No proposition on the ballot contains more than 34 words. And
yet those terse sentences cover, in some instances, very
complicated issues. And passage of those propositions would have
broad and highly significant repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   The economy of language used by the legislators, as has been the
case in most previous constitutional amendment elections, suggests
that the senators and representatives harbor strong faith in the
willingness and ability of the voters to educate themselves on the
ramifications of all those propositions.
</P>
<P>
   They also appear to have placed a great deal of trust in the
news media to analyze the propositions and explain them to
concerned citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some cynics take the view that the legislators don't
care whether the voters understand what they are being asked to do.
They just want enough of them to endorse those propositions and
embed them in the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   As that skeptical crowd sees it, amending the state constitution
is to the Texas Legislature as punting is to football.
</P>
<P>
   They make a good case that when the legislators are reluctant to
do the job they were sent to Austin to do, they kick the issue back
to voters packaged in such enigmatic terms that most voters either
don't vote on them or guess.
</P>
<P>
   That disillusioned perspective is gaining ground, which bodes
ill for voter turnout for such elections and for public confidence
in state government. Under the circumstances, it is not easy to
make a case that voters need to pay serious attention to Tuesday's
constitutional amendment election.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, however, some undesirable consequences could
occur. It is conceivable that majorities could guess wrong and
reject some of those that are needed, such as:
</P>
<P>
   _Proposition 17, which would allow the regents of the University
of Texas and the Texas A&AMP;M University systems to manage the
Permanent University Fund more creaand generate some
industrial-strength profits for the benefit of the schools in those
systems.
</P>
<P>
   _Proposition 7, which would allow garnishment of wages for
spousal maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   _Proposition 13, which would permit the issuance of $400 million
in tax-supported bonds for student loans.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, wrong-guessers might approve the highly
deceptive Proposition 9, which would allow the legislators to
establish a ``judicial compensation commission.'' That nine-member
commission would recommend changes in judges' salaries. Unless
either the House or the Senate rejected the commission's salary
recommendations, they would become law.
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible purpose of the commission would be to take the
politics out of state judges' pay. And why is politics in it? Well,
that goes back to 1972, when the legislators pegged their pension
benefits to the salaries of state judges.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators, over the years, have been somewhat reluctant to
raise judicial salaries out of fear of being perceived to be
feathering their own nests. If, however, a supposedly disinterested
commission makes the judges' salary recommendations, the
legislators can passively increase their retirement benefits
without voting.
</P>
<P>
   What about those tangled webs we weave when we study to deceive?
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to have such an appointed committee making law.
The legislators can simply do their duty and risk the appearance of
self-interestedness, or they can disentangle their retirement
benefits from judicial pay. It would be a lot easier to do that
than to remove the commission from the constitution once it gets in
there.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the other amendments appear to be harmless at
worst, although it's pretty clear that Proposition 1, pertaining to
the succession to the governor and lieutenant governor, would not
be on the ballot this year were it not for the possibility that
Gov. George W. Bush will be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Now to that omitted 18th proposition: The legislators should
have proposed an amendment stating that the constitution will be
amended no more until the whole unwieldy mess has been reduced to a
concise and comprehensible body of basic doctrine.

MANAGEMENT GURU TOM PETERS HAS WRITTEN THREE NEW BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Peters has things to say. The problem is sifting through his
whiz-bang writing to get to those nuggets of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point is the management guru's latest series: threl books at $15.95 each that have more explanation points,
boldface type, capital letters and dashes than a typing lesson, yet
have something to say. You just have to wade through a lot of
punctuation to get there.
</P>
<P>
   The author made his name years ago with the bestseller ``In
Search of Excellence,'' written with Robert Waterman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Peters has been in high demand on the lecture
circuit, and his writing reflects that. I suspect that much of his
work sounds better read aloud and that the books are transcribed
versions of his speeches.
</P>
<P>
   His latest efforts are the first of a series Peters calls
Reinventing Work.
</P>
<P>
   The titles are:
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional Service Firm 50: Fifty Ways to Transform Your
Department into a Professional Service Firm Whose Trademarks are
Passion and Innovation!'' (Knopf, 227 pages, $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Project 50: Fifty Ways to Transform Every Task into a
Project That Matters!'' (Knopf, 208 pages, $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brand You 50: Fifty Ways to Transform Yourself from an
Employee Into a Brand That Shouts Distinction, Commitment, and
Passion!'' (Knopf, 204 pages, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   That's three exclamation points without even cracking the books.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his writing style, Peters occasionally comes up with
real jewels.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in ``Project 50,'' he tells readers that in the
next century, 95 percent of everyone's work will be in defined,
white-collar, professional projects. He calls it the White-Collar
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-impact project is the gem ... the nugget ... the
fundamental atomic particle from which the new white-collar world
will be constructed and/or reconstructed,'' he writes (in boldface,
of course).
</P>
<P>
   Such a project-centered synergy is occurring on the leading edge
of business in Silicon Valley, Peters reports.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, professional firms such as lawyers, accountants,
architects and financial services have yet to be seriously studied,
Peters says. His books are attempts to fill that gap and show
readers where work is headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once at the periphery _ and seen, frankly, as parasites of the
manufacturing-based economy _ these outfits are now front and
center and role definers in the so-called knowledge economy,''
Peters writes. ``They're all dedicated to the same thing: providing
services and making money by leveraging knowledge. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Project 50,'' Peters discusses topics from making deadlines
to celebrating failures as ways to redefine jobs in light of
professional projects.
</P>
<P>
   Such a shift is necessary for workers to survive in the next
century, Peters says in all three books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White-Collar Revolution will envelop 90-plus percent of
us. And quickly,'' Peters writes. ``The commonplace, if traumatic,
changes that came to the factory, the distribution center, and the
London docks are now racing toward the relatively unscathed world
of purchasing, finance, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters definitely has things to say, but it may take a few days
of tough reading to find them.

   ``Global Business: 308 Tips to Take Your Company Worldwide''
</P>
<P>
   By Lawrence E. Koslow and Robert H. Scarlett
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Publishing, $26.95
</P>
<P>
   This book, written by two consultants, is an excellent how-to
for those wanting to expand globally. It covers the basics, such as
transporting goods, planning operations, international financial
management, tax planning and marketing and sales. The book also
covers areas not normally found in a primer, such as how
family-owned businesses can go global by developing family
networks. Another section is devoted to cultural differences in
international ethics. Finally, the authors provide their take on
international trends.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Action Coaching: How to Leverage Individual Performance for
Company Success''
</P>
<P>
   By David L. Dotlich and Peter C. Cairo
</P>
<P>
   Josey-Bass, $28
</P>
<P>
   Although other coaching methods may focus strictly on
performance improvements, Action Coaching takes a step back to
tinker with employees' self-awareness. Consultants and educators
David Dotlich and Peter Cairo have developed this method for large
corporate clients such as AT&AMP;T, Colgate and Merck.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Million Dollar Prospecting Techniques''
</P>
<P>
   By the Million Dollar Round Table Center for Productivity
</P>
<P>
   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $16.95
</P>
<P>
   This book joins ``Million Dollar Closing Techniques'' and
``Million Dollar Selling Techniques.'' The authors are from the
Million Dollar Round Table, an international association made up of
the world's top 6 percent of life insurance producers. These 19,000
people from 400 companies probably know a thing or two about deals.
The books are full of interesting tips from those who are on the
line and have succeeded.

TIME IS ON THE SIDE OF 49ERS' QB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Steve Mariucci remembered a phone
conversation with his quarterback from this summer, just before
49ers training camp opened. Steve Young, exhilarated by the thought
of another season, told the coach that he thought he could play
past his 40th birthday, well past his 40th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he wanted to play five more years,'' Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach told this story as a reminder of why Young won't be
able to walk away from football as casually as so many people have
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was a month to the day since Young lay silently on a
field in Arizona, knocked unconscious by his fourth concussion in
three years. Since then, he has been advised, sermonized and
editorialized on the issue of retirement. In just 30 days, he has
been expected to find a way to surrender his goals for the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   It is an absurd expectation. He needs time, lots of it. This is
a decision that easily could, and probably should, carry into next
summer. There's no hurry.
</P>
<P>
   The one realistic expectation is that he will shut down the 1999
season, becoming a de facto assistant coach rather than a player.
Young hasn't come to that conclusion yet. Mariucci is driving him
there, though, taking the scenic route.
</P>
<P>
   ``If time and patience is something he feels is really important
to him to make that decision, then we owe him that,'' Mariucci
said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be shouts of protest over this, over whether Young
should quickly vacate his roster spot, moving onto injured reserve,
to accommodate another player. The shouts will be a lot of empty
noise. Be clear on this: Young, 38, isn't being selfish or arrogant
when he refuses to give up on 1999. He's just being himself.
</P>
<P>
   If you've appreciated his energy, his skill, his zeal and his
graciousness over the years, it's impossible to criticize him now
for holding on to the tiniest of hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary ruthlessness of the 49ers won't apply here.
</P>
<P>
   The team that dumped Joe Montana and jettisoned Ronnie Lott
doesn't exist anymore. This team is 3-4. It has been outscored by
more points than any other NFL team outside of Cleveland,
Cincinnati and Atlanta. Slapping Young on IR and then signing a
player recently waived by someone else won't turn the Niners into
contenders again.
</P>
<P>
   As they look to rebuild, the 49ers have to convince free agents
that they are still a great organization. Shoving aside Steve Young
for some castoff special-teamer will do nothing for their image.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci admitted that Young might be getting special treatment,
extra time to think things over, because of who he is. Then again,
Young has always taken on special responsibilities, extra burdens.
The double standard works both ways. In the end, the 49ers will get
far more than they've given.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Wednesday, Young said he realized that
young people looked up to him, that recklessness with his health
could encourage them to take chances with their own. He alluded to
the death of a San Jose high school football player who had
suffered a concussion and then been hit hard again last week, this
time fatally. The teen-ager's death, he said, affected all of the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Young kept saying that he did not want to trivialize concussions
by any of his actions. He advised all athletes to take
neuropsychological exams regularly to see whether any of their
cognitive skills are faltering. That may seem like a token
suggestion, but doctors have had a difficult time persuading pro
football players to submit to the exams. They and their agents tend
to be uncomfortable with the idea that teams might be able to
quantify mental decline.
</P>
<P>
   Young has seen at least three doctors now about his condition,
in what appears to be a scavenger hunt for clearance to play. But
he doesn't seem to be following the most desperate and reckless
course of all: disguising his symptoms. He has revealed publicly
that he has had headaches, grogginess and sleeplessness since the
Arizona game. He tried running during practice to stay in shape and
found himself woozy, so he stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci knew all about this. Young didn't try to hide it.
</P>
<P>
   He says the post-concussion complications have subsided. He is
able to do some running again. Mariucci said he recognized the old
feistiness in Young again, saw him smiling more. He said he would
love to see him on the field again, running around, making plays.
He'd love to give Young five more years. But Mariucci also wants to
be realistic, so he'll settle for the feistiness and the smiles
right now, hoping that they will last a lifetime.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ This old river town, with a site of uncommon
beauty and a populace of uncommon civility, has a reputation as a
stick-in-the-mud all the same. Mark Twain suggested that he'd like
to come here for the apocalypse because it was always 20 years
behind the times. Decades later, John Gunther detected ``a certain
stately and also sleepy quality'' in the place.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio, a member of the city's (and the
nation's) longest-lasting political dynasty, told me when I ran
into him at a football game that Cincinnati has ``an inbred
resistance to rapid change.'' Longfellow, on the other hand,
described this as the ``Queen City of the West,'' and in hard times
Cincinnati has clung to that phrase like a life raft.
</P>
<P>
   The most celebrated outcropping of the city's conservatism in
recent years was the indictment on April 7, 1990, of the
Contemporary Arts Center and its director on obscenity charges
arising from an exhibition of 175 Robert Mapplethorpe photographs.
A few of them depicted explicit homoerotic subjects. Much less
attention was paid when a local jury, largely working-class in
makeup, acquitted both defendants six months later.
</P>
<P>
   Which was par for the course. People also tend to overlook the
city's cultural traditions, especially its rich musical heritage,
and its record of innovation in many fields. It had the first
professional baseball team: the Cincinnati Red Stockings, now the
Reds, founded in 1869. John A. Roebling's suspension bridge across
the Ohio River, which remains in service to this day, opened in
1866, 17 years before the Brooklyn Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Cincinnati as well that Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise of the
Plum Street Temple, born in Bohemia, gave shape to modern Reform
Judaism through the Hebrew Union College, the Central Conference of
American Rabbis and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. The
rabbi called his Byzanto-Moorish temple ``my Alhambra.''
</P>
<P>
   Play-Doh was invented here, and Formica, and soap that floats.
Rather more significantly for human well-being, Dr. Albert Sabin
developed his oral polio vaccine while working here, and Dr. Henry
Heimlich perfected his life-saving maneuver for choking victims.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years several local institutions, notably the
University of Cincinnati, have commissioned new buildings from a
galaxy of groundbreaking architects, including Frank O. Gehry,
Michael Graves, Peter Eisenman, Cesar Pelli and Harry Cobb, among
others. The Contemporary Arts Center, focus of the Mapplethorpe
flap, and not some elite organization in California or New York,
gave the highly regarded Iraqi-born architect Zaha Hadid her first
big commission in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry's Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, which opened on
Sept. 23, looks like one of those cartoon buildings that are
jumping off their foundations, almost ready to burst. The red-brick
structure is defined by its bulges and the metal grids of its
windows. It forms a vivid if startling gateway to the university,
which Herbert Muschamp has described in The New York Times as ``one
of the most architecturally dynamic campuses in America today.''
</P>
<P>
   A little bit Northern, a little bit Southern, Cincinnati comes
close to the national average by a number of standards, including
cost of living and median family income.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Civil War, some Cincinnatians with extensive business
dealings in the South defended that region's Peculiar Institution.
But local abolitionists helped thousands of slaves escape across
the Ohio River to freedom, defying apostles of the status quo.
Lyman Beecher, a fiery Presbyterian preacher, spent two decades as
president of a seminary here, and his daughter, Harriet Beecher
Stowe, drew on her experiences in Ohio and Kentucky in writing the
enormously influential anti-slavery novel ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.''
</P>
<P>
   That history will be celebrated in an $80 million National
Underground Railroad Museum, now in the planning stage. It will be
a major element in the ongoing reinvention of the riverfront, the
place where the city began. A pair of new sports stadiums will be
there, too _ one for the Reds, to be finished in 2003, the other
for the football Bengals, to open next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio was one of the main highways west, and that made
Cincinnati a boom town in the years after the Revolution. Founded
in 1788, it was given its name by Arthur St. Clair, governor of the
Northwest Territory. Having fought as commander of the New Jersey
militia at the battles of Trenton and Princeton, among others, and
attained the rank of major general, St. Clair became a member of
the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization of Revolutionary
officers founded by George Washington. The society was named for
Cincinnatus, a Roman patriot who returned to his farm after saving
his city in battle, and this city, in turn, was named for the
society.
</P>
<P>
   The twin post-modern headquarters towers of Procter &AMP; Gamble,
the nation's largest producer of products for use in the household,
dominate the eastern part of downtown Cincinnati. The company has a
new chief executive, Durk I. Jager, reputedly installed to shake
things up, and the company still reaches into every city, town and
hamlet in America with Tide, Ivory, Pampers, Crisco, Folger's, Old
Spice and dozens of other brands.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati is also home base for Federated Department Stores,
the retailing leviathan that operates more than 400 stores
nationwide, including Macy's, Stern's and Bloomingdale's in the New
York area; Chiquita Brands, the world's biggest banana company, and
Kroger, which grew from a single grocery store started in 1883 by
Barney Kroger, with $372 of his own and $350 borrowed from a
friend, into the nation's biggest supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric, which makes more jet aircraft engines than
anyone else in the world, makes many of them in a huge plant in
suburban Evendale. And who could overlook the weirdly named Fifth
Third bank, formed in a 1908 merger between institutions that
insisted on retaining their identities?
</P>
<P>
   But Cincinnati missed what may have been its biggest economic
opportunity. At the turn of the last century, it was the world's
biggest manufacturer of carriages; when a couple of entrepreneurs
named Henry Ford and J.W. Packard came looking for capital to start
their auto factories, the local bankers turned them down. So they
went to Detroit instead.
</P>
<P>
   Having already missed the information technology boom, business
and medical leaders here are now working hard to make the city a
leader in biotechnology. Led by Procter &AMP; Gamble and the University
of Cincinnati, a task force is talking about the investment of
years of effort and hundreds of millions of dollars. A study
released by the group cited among the city's assets its quality of
life; but in entrepreneurial culture _ the willingness to take a
chance _ the study ranked this region 18th among 21 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the region reminded them of the Rhineland,
Germans flooded into the Ohio Valley in the 1840s and '50s,
eventually constituting a quarter of Cincinnati's population.
German-language newspapers were founded, beer gardens sprang up in
every neighborhood and German was taught in the public schools. All
that came to a swift end with World War I.
</P>
<P>
   But the Teutonic flavor lingers. The arty neighborhood north of
downtown is called Over-the-Rhine. Oktoberfest (inexplicably
scheduled for mid-September) is one of the city's many annual
fetes. Graeter's ice cream, dished up in shops around the city, is
another, super-delicious survivor of the city's Germanic past.
</P>
<P>
   Zoology is a German passion, too, and Cincinnati has long
boasted one of the nation's premier zoos, under Edward J. Maruska,
its widely respected executive director. Lately it has opened a new
Manatee Springs exhibit, home to Douglas and Stoneman, a pair of
the endangered cowlike marine mammals from the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   The most important legacy, however, is the city's love of music.
The May Festival, which dates from 1873, grew out of Saengerfests,
or songfests, that were given starting in 1849, with up to 2,000
volunteer chorus members. The Music Hall, a sauerbraten Gothic
palace that seats 3,400 people, with spectacular chandeliers and a
lovely lobby in cream and gold, was completed in 1878 as a home for
the festival. It now houses the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra,
Cincinnati Pops and Cincinnati Summer Opera as well.
</P>
<P>
   A distinguished roster of European conductors have taken charge
of the festival, which still concentrates on choral music. Among
them have been Eugene Goossens, Fritz Busch, Josef Krips and Max
Rudolf. In 1906, Edward Elgar traveled to Cincinnati to conduct his
``Dream of Gerontius.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1974, Americans have been at the festival's helm:
Cincinnati-born James Levine until 1979, James Conlon for the two
decades since then. Maestro Conlon is one of those American
musicians who have made their careers largely in Europe (mostly
France and Germany, in his case), but Cincinnati recognized his
gifts early. Now he is the principal conductor of the Paris Opera
and the Cologne Philharmonic, but he nonetheless returns to Ohio
each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Symphony, founded in 1895, also has a
distinguished history, having had Leopold Stokowski, Fritz Reiner
and Thomas Schippers as conductors; Schippers, who died young, was
a great local favorite who also worked at Bayreuth and, notably, at
Spoleto in Italy. The Spaniard Jesus Lopez-Cobos is the current
music director, and the orchestra, which plays a full
September-to-May season, remains more adventurous than most.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Cincinnatians are playing Glinka, Korngold,
Honegger, Nielsen, Griffes, Scriabin, Weill and Zwilich in addition
to more conventional musical fare.
</P>
<P>
   The Pops, probably the best-known such ensemble after Boston's,
has gained an international reputation under Erich Kunzel. It has
made no fewer than 65 records for Telarc, which have sold more than
seven million copies worldwide and earned the charismatic Kunzel
enough in the process to buy houses in the Bahamas and on Swan's
Island off the Maine coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer the Pops moves to Riverbend, a complex along the
Ohio River five miles east of town that was designed for the
orchestra by Michael Graves.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's theatrical pride and joy is the Aronoff Center for
the Arts, built in the heart of downtown to a design by Pelli. It
has three halls that can house everything from touring Broadway
musicals to the productions of the Cincinnati Ballet to small-scale
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The Playhouse in the Park, a professional company with the good
fortune to perform in a leafy aerie overlooking the city, will
present 10 productions this season, ranging from ``Much Ado About
Nothing'' to ``Wit,'' Margaret Edson's 1999 Pulitzer Prize winner.
The small but enterprising Ensemble Theater performs in a converted
bank building in Over-the-Rhine; Edward Albee has directed several
of his plays there. And the Cincinnati Opera puts on nine
performances of four operas every June and July (``Pelleas and
Melisande'' is one of the features in 2000) in the Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   As for the visual arts, the city has not one but two important
museums _the Cincinnati Art Museum and the Taft Museum _ both
linked with the remarkable Taft family. The fact that both lent
important works to the Ingres exhibition in Washington and New York
this year, a connoisseur's show if ever there was one, suggests the
quality of their best holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, the old Union Terminal, a railway station that
looks like a Bakelite Art Deco radio rendered in concrete, has been
turned into the Cincinnati Museum Center. A landmark of Deco
architecture, it continues to evoke the drama of travel in the
golden age of rail, while sheltering a history museum, a children's
museum, a museum of natural history and science and an IMAX movie
theater under its soaring half-dome.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Here is a sampling of local attractions, as well as other
information about Cincinnati: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where to Stay  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CINCINNATIAN, &LR;  601 Vine St., (513) 381-3000. Designed by
the city's favorite fin-de-siecle architect, Samuel Hannaford, and
thoroughly rebuilt in 1987, this is now Cincinnati's pre-eminent
hotel. Double room: $240 weekdays; $180 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OMNI NETHERLAND PLAZA, &LR;  35 West Fifth St., (513) 421-9100. The
decor is the thing in this Art Deco classic, built in 1930 and
embellished with Rookwood tiles, chromium torchiers and a sea horse
fountain. A 1983 renovation swept away a half-century's wear and
tear, and the place sparkles as it did when Churchill and Roosevelt
stayed there. Double room: $210 to $230 weekdays; $130 to $150
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WESTIN, &LR;  Fountain Square, (513) 621-7700. The location is
perfect, the tastefully redecorated rooms have plenty of elbow
room, and the hotel can even claim a footnote in history: the
infamous ``Jerry Springer Show'' originated from the premises in
its early days. Double room: $109 to $220 weekdays; $105 to $135
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where to Eat  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAMP WASHINGTON CHILI, &LR;  3005 Colerain Avenue, (513) 541-0061.
Created in 1922 by a Bulgarian immigrant, Cincinnati-style chili
took the town by storm. This improbable passion has never abated,
and now there are three chains with 150-odd outlets, plus
independents. Lean over when you eat; the stuff stains.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAISONETTE, &LR;  114 East Sixth St., (513 721-2260. This is the
Maisonette's 50th anniversary year. You can return to the 1960s in
this traditional, formal, softly lighted place, ordering things
like Dover sole along with the city's famously stodgy movers and
shakers. Superb desserts and wonderful wines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PALACE, &LR;  Cincinnatian Hotel (see above). The best of the
city's hotel dining rooms serves the closest thing Cincinnati has
to New American cooking. The menu includes seasonal regional
offerings like a soft-shell crab po' boy as well as many standard
items like grilled swordfish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JEFF RUBY'S, &LR;  700 Walnut St., (513) 784-1200. A brash
transplant from New Jersey, Jeff Ruby wore spats to the opening
benefit at this addition to his chain of Cincinnati watering holes.
Beef and lamb is dry-aged in a glass-walled cooler (cf Gallagher's,
New York), and smokers can enjoy their Delmonico steaks and Bibb
salads, their Jordan cabernet or Ducru-Beaucaillou and their cigars
in the Toots Shor room.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRIO, &LR;  7565 Kenwood Road, Kenwood, (513) 984-1905. A lot of the
culinary action in Cincinnati is in the suburbs, and Trio stands
out from a slew of other restaurants there for its mostly American
wine list (three Ridge zinfandels, 36 selections by the glass,
gentle prices). The food runs the middlebrow gamut from meatloaf to
designer pizzas to fine wood-grilled salmon.

`VIDEO HOUND,' NEW AND BIGGER; JAMES BOND ON DVD; NEW RELEASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even with the Internet, some of the most formidable video guides
are still measured in pounds and numbers of pages. In the case of
the new 2000 edition of ``Video Hound's Golden Movie Retriever''
(Visible Ink Press), that's 5 pounds and 1,700 pages (with 12 blank
ones for notes or whatever).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Craddock, who edited the ``Hound'' with Martin Connors, said
that about 1,000 movies have been added to this year's collection,
bringing the total to 24,000 or so. The guide lists 2,000 movies on
digital videodisc, which accounts for much of the growth. Also, he
said, people are watching a lot of old films on cable stations like
the American Movie Channel and Turner Movie Classics and requesting
that they be brought out on video if they aren't available already.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Hound'' lists only movies that are on tape and disc.
``We'd get calls all the time asking, `How come that movie isn't in
the book?''' Craddock said, adding that now many more of those
movies are on video.
</P>
<P>
   Category lists are always a highlight in the ``Hound'' and run
almost 200 pages in this edition. ``Adventure drama'' is one of the
more prosaic classifications, but categories roam from ``Bad Dads''
and ``Big Rigs'' to ``Sanity Check'' and ``Wonder Women.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Internet, the ``Hound'' lists the Web sites for
dozens of studios, actors, directors, films, film guides, cult
movie resources, film magazines, festivals, reviews and video
outlets. The price is $21.95.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, James Bond  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DVDs have plenty of room for extras (though the average release
is often bereft of them), but a new set of seven James Bond movies
from MGM has gone the extra step. For example, with ``Goldfinger,''
the inventory includes one movie-length commentary by Guy Hamilton,
the director, and another commentary by the cast and crew; a
making-of-``Goldfinger'' documentary and another documentary about
the film's popularity; a large collection of stills; radio
interviews with Sean Connery, and promotional spots and features.
</P>
<P>
   All of this can run to overkill, but it is frequently
entertaining. On one ``Goldfinger'' documentary, Hamilton says that
his long-delinquent London parking tickets inspired the idea for
the famous revolving license plates on the Bond car. Theodore Bikel
is shown reading for the role of Goldfinger. He lost hands down to
Gert Frobe. And for Shirley Eaton, recipient of perhaps the most
famous paint job in movie history, a doctor was on hand in case of
skin suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   The other films are ``Thunderball,'' ``Live and Let Die,'' ``For
Your Eyes Only,'' ``License to Kill,'' ``Goldeneye'' and ``Tomorrow
Never Dies.'' Some of the discs have even more extras than
``Goldfinger,'' including music videos, interviews with composers
and story boards. ``Live and Let Die'' even has a commercial for
the British milk board. The price is $34.98 each or $199.98 for the
set.

   NEW RELEASES

<P>
   `LOLITA'
</P>
<P>
   Although rejected by American theater exhibitors for fear of
backlash against the subject of pedophilia, Adrian Lyne's
adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel appeared last year on
Showtime. As Humbert Humbert, Jeremy Irons conveys astonishing
complexity, and the film's masterstroke is that this is Humbert's
story told in his own lyrical voice and from his own tortured
perspective. As the nymphet who is the object of his desire, Ms.
Swain is long-limbed, petulant and wisecracking. ``Rich beyond what
anyone could have expected,'' Caryn James wrote in The New York
Times, ``the film repays repeated viewings.''

<P>
   1997. Trimark. $14.99. 137 minutes. R.

   `ARLINGTON ROAD'
</P>
<P>
   Headed home one day, Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) finds a boy
wounded in the roadway and later, after rushing him to the
hospital, becomes friends with his parents, the Langs (Tim Robbins
and Joan Cusack), who happen to live next door. A professor who
specializes in urban terrorism, Farraday eventually has reason to
wonder where the diabolically pleasant Langs came from and then to
connect them to the kind of crimes he lectures about in the
classroom. The strength of Mark Pellington's well-paced and
cleverly constructed film ``lies in a string of ingenious little
surprises and in an overall deviousness that doesn't show until the
story is over'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37. 119 minutes. Closed captioned.

</P>
<P>
   `BIG DADDY'
</P>
<P>
   A fine specimen of belching young movie manhood, a highway toll
taker named Sonny (Adam Sandler) suddenly finds himself responsible
for a 5-year-old named Julian (alternately played by Cole and Dylan
Sprouse). Seems the boy's mother has reneged, and his father, a
friend of Sonny's, doesn't feel up to the task. That leaves the
caretaking to Sonny, who accepts in the belief that it will impress
his girlfriend, who promptly dumps him. A cut above a total
imbecile, Sonny perseveres, but that leads to another problem.
Normally flourishing on infantile, anarchic moments, Sandler is too
much the nice guy, which ``gives the film tepid predictability
instead of cutting edge'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $21.96. 95 minutes. Closed captioned.
PG-13. Release date: Next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   `JACK FROST'
</P>
<P>
   In snowy Colorado a struggling rock musician named Jack (Michael
Keaton) leaves his wife (Kelly Preston) and 12-year-old son (Joseph
Cross) to play a New Year's gig. One car wreck later, he has
departed this life, but then his boy discovers something odd in the
front yard. Yes, it's Dad, back as a snowman to romp with the son
he never had time for when he was flesh and blood. Bring on the
heavy emotional artillery in ``a film so sugar-coated that it makes
other recent efforts in this genre look blisteringly honest''
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Warner. $19.96. 95 minutes. Closed captioned. PG. Release
date: Next Tuesday.

theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in
earlier editions.

   `THE OGRE'
</P>
<P>
   In Volker Schlondorff's film, a French misfit (John Malkovich)
becomes a lackey for high-ranking Nazis and is sent to round up
young boys as conscripts. ``Malkovich gives an understated
performance that captures the ambiguity of a character who does
monstrous things yet remains a tenderhearted innocent,'' Stephen
Holden wrote in The New York Times. 1996. Kino. $79.95. 117
minutes. No rating.
</P>
<P>
   `THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC'
</P>

Coast blues, is filmed at the Blue Mirror Club, and King Louis H.
Narcisse leads his congregation of gospel rockers. In Nashville,

BRITAIN'S ROBBIE WILLIAMS INVADES THE U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't mind Robbie Williams: He's simply being himself.
</P>
<P>
   The British pop star, who is on his first U.S. tour, is heralded
in his native land as much for his music as his bad-boy behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Williams first made headlines as the rebellious member of the
U.K. boy-band Take That, a phenomenally successful outfit that sold
17 million albums and scored nine No. 1 singles.
</P>
<P>
   Williams grew tired of pre-packaged pop, however, and left the
band in 1995. He indulged in alcohol and drugs, popped up in
tabloids that reveled in his post boy-band weight gain and ranted
constantly about Gary Barlow, his former Take That bandmate.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed, however, with the 1997 release of Williams'
debut solo album, ``Life Thru a Lens,'' in the U.K. It faltered on
the charts before the 1997 Christmas single, ``Angels,'' was
released. Almost singlehandedly, that song revived Williams'
career, spending weeks at the No. 1 spot and solidifying the
performer's reputation as a solo force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   The album eventually sold more than 4 million copies, and a
second CD, ``I've Been Expecting You,'' met with similar success.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Williams is aiming for stateside listeners with ``The Ego
Has Landed,'' his U.S. debut album, which compiles the best tracks
from his two U.K. efforts. It's a joyous affair, full of glittering
pop melodies and witty lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   The first single, ``Millennium,'' made a few waves on MTV but
barely dented the pop charts. No matter _ Williams has been down
that path before. ``Angels,'' which he says is his favorite of the
songs he's written, was recently released as the second U.S.
single.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being in America for a week, I sort of pinch myself and
go, `Why do you feel so good?''' said Williams, 25, in a call from
London. ``It's because nobody knows me there. Then I'm thinking,
`You're here to promote a record that's gonna blow your anonymity
in America.' I'm wrestling between the two things.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversation, Williams is a barrage of paradoxes and
contradictions. He's sweetly insecure one minute (``I'm sort of
getting used to the fact that I'm good at what I do'') and raving
about his James Bond fixation the next (``You get to shoot
everybody, sleep with people and basically save the world''), which
he plays up in the tongue-in-cheek video for ``Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   He even admits an affection for Australian pop diva Kylie
Minogue (``I've got this crush onnd it's doing me in. It's
not professional. I can't even look her in the eyes.'') with whom
he recently recorded a duet.
</P>
<P>
   What's most refreshing about Williams, however, is his sincerity
and honesty regarding his ever-unpredictable career. He admits the
path he's reading isn't one he initially envisioned for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at school,'' he said. ``I didn't really know what I
wanted to do. I didn't wanna go to college and university to get an
education and do a 9 to 5. I still think I'm in the wrong job. I'm
just here because nobody else wanted to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Williams' unique way with a song, it's doubtful that just
any former teen idol could have accomplished so much.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own experience as part of the well-scrubbed hit
machine that was Take That, Williams remains vague. Much of the
problem undoubtedly stemmed from personality clashes between
Williams and Barlow (who also embarked on a solo career) and the
taut strings pulled by Take That puppet-master and manager Nigel
Martin-Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done all the talking I could probably handle about Take
That,'' he said. ``All I will say in the matter is that something
happened to me when I was in the band that really messed me up. The
whys and wherefores of that I don't really want to go into because
it will probably be too painful for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Take That _ which was conceived as the British answer to New
Kids on the Block _ scored a U.S. hit with the breezy ballad ``Back
for Good'' in 1995, but the band's major successes occurred
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Williams is competing with boy bands on the pop charts
all over again, and he has some pointed opinions about such groups
as the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync (who have problems of their own
regarding record contracts).
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the inner struggle for supremacy that these boys
have and these girls have _ this struggle and this complete
mistrust of their own ability,'' Williams said. ``It's funny
because all of them are trying to be the supreme one in the band
but also have no self-worth, no confidence, at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is even more candid about his bouts with alcohol and
drugs. He cleaned himself up for the most part, but it wasn't for
the usual reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vanity saved my life, I think, at one point,'' Williams said.
``I can't stand having an extra millimeter on my stomach, let alone
having a whole yard. When I was growing up, I lived for love, and I
lived for life. Very quickly, that was taken away from me through
drugs and through drink. With responsibility, I became a cripple. I
couldn't do it, and that's not me. I faced up to it, and I'm doing
all right today.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering Williams' success, that would be a serious
understatement. Along with album sales and hit singles, Williams
was recently named ``Sexiest Man in the World'' by a reader's poll
in the British edition of Cosmopolitan magazine. He also signed a
$3.2 million promotional deal with Pepsi Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Conquering America, then, seems the next logical step. Or maybe
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a bit too much to handle for me right now, to be
honest with you,'' Williams said. ``America's such a big place, and
it brings its own thing into your life that I'm a bit scared of.
I'm a bit insecure about the thought of going to America and
tackling it and if I want the responsibility of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Williams doesn't ascend to superstar status here, he can
always enjoy the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me a good excuse to travel,'' he said. ``People think
that I'm actually there to promote the single or an album. I'm not.
I'm there to eat food and see people. Golf spoils a good walk, and
fame, and what I do for a living, spoils a really nice travel card
around the world.''

DREW `NEVER' SEEMED THIS SWEET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `NEVER BEEN KISSED'
</P>
<P>
   1999, PG-13, Fox, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $34.98
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore is trying too hard.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Wedding Singer'' and ``Ever After,'' she shed her
bad-girl image. Fine _ but now she's pandering so much to sweetness
and light that she seems bent on being a modern-day Shirley Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Here she plays a young Chicago woman who had been mistreated by
classmates in high school. (Her four-year college experience is
disregarded as irrelevant.)
</P>
<P>
   Her crime? She was a wallflower.
</P>
<P>
   She gets a chance to make up for it in her 20s when her
newspaper sends her undercover to pose as a high schooler and get a
vague story on what kids are like.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``Message in a Bottle,'' Chicago newspapers are shown here
to be absurdly cushy. Barrymore, a copy editor, has a private
office _ with a window, at that _ and an assistant outside! Right.
</P>
<P>
   She also edits on paper, not a computer. Uh huh. And when she's
tabbed for field work, she's tracked by costly spy cameras, giving
the film a needless nudge toward ``EDtv'' and ``The Truman Show''
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Her school escapades start badly but inevitably turn toward
vindication and true love via a handsome teacher played by Michael
Vartan.
</P>
<P>
   As in too many movies, kids' vicious cruelty toward each other
is appalling and overdone. While showing less acting range than an
automated computer voice, the vulnerable Barrymore suffers
mightily, and her humor of haplessness goes only so far.
</P>
<P>
   Compensating are fun supporting players _ Molly Shannon and
David Arquette _ and an appealing sentimental side. ``Kissed'' may
miss in the brains department, but it certainly has a heart.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 2 1/2 stars &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `ARLINGTON ROAD'
</P>
<P>
   1999, R, Columbia TriStar, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $24.95
</P>
<P>
   This provocative film concerns anarchists bent on toppling the
federal government while concealing their cause by pinning
terrorist acts on crazed individuals.
</P>
<P>
   As a history professor whose wife, an FBI agent, was killed in a
Ruby Ridge-style conflict, Jeff Bridges is suspicious of both the
feds and his new neighbors (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), whose
wholesome facade seems to hide evil intent.
</P>
<P>
   As he struggles to expose the truth, Bridges goes too far off
the deep end for our sympathies. In some ways he's his own worst
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   But director Mark Pellington still tells a vivid and compelling
tale that bravely resists feel-good Hollywood formulas.
</P>
<P>
   On DVD, ``Arlington Road'' has a 20-minute ``making of''
documentary that's far from illuminating. Mostly, the filmmakers
sing each other's praises.
</P>
<P>
   No mention is made of the death of Bridges' father, actor Lloyd
Bridges, during production. Nor is any mention made of Houston,
where 90 percent of the movie was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Houston subbed for Washington, D.C., and its suburbs. The gated
community used for many scenes was in Pearland.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD also has an intriguing alternate ending, whose expanded
footage gives the movie more resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE'
</P>
<P>
   1999, R, Universal, CC, VHS priced for rental, DVD $29.98
</P>
<P>
   With Eddie Murphy and Martin Short on the marquee, this looks
like a comedy, and its marketing campaign hits hard on our funny
bones. But ``Life'' is more of a dramedy.
</P>
<P>
   It concerns two 1930s New Yorkers who wind up in a Mississippi
prison with life terms for a crime they didn't commit.
</P>

ART IMITATES LIFE

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ One of the most famous films of the French New Wave is
``The 400 Blows,'' Francois Truffaut's first feature work.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Truffaut's own youth, it's the starkly real and
unsentimental story of a young boy with little parental control or
affection. He has trouble in school and elsewhere, and eventually
winds up in a juvenile center.
</P>
<P>
   When watching ``Joe the King,'' the first film from actor Frank
Whaley, those familiar with Truffaut are immediately struck by the
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Whaley's film, about a young boy (Noah Fleiss) growing up poor,
is also stark and almost as unsentimental. The boy has no parental
guidance, although his mother loves him. His drunken father, played
by Val Kilmer, gives him plenty of angry, worthless advice. A
thief, the boy is always on the verge of trouble, and finally faced
with reform school.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Joe the King'' is close to the life of writer and
director Whaley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very much like Joe,'' said Whaley, whose more than three
dozen films and TV movies have included roles in ``The Doors''
(guitarist Robby Krieger), ``JFK,'' ``Pulp Fiction'' and the
upcoming CBS miniseries ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' (Nov. 7).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat of a criminal mind, and I was always late for
school. But deeper than that, I was always alienated,'' Whaley
said. ``I was constantly very lonely as a child.''
</P>
<P>
   You get into trouble fast telling a filmmaker, ``Gee, your film
sure seemed a lot like some other guy's,'' even if that other guy
was Truffaut. So it was a relief that Whaley was more than ready to
acknowledge the resemblance and debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Syracuse in the mid-'70s, there was not a lot of
exposure to movies. There was for a brief period of time a revival
house, and my mom, for some reason, took my brother and me to ''The
400 Blows.``
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never seen a foreign film, but that film really had an
impact on me. Not at first _ I was 16 _ but I couldn't stop
thinking about it. Afterward, I realized it paralleled my life so
much. I related to that boy, because it was like looking in a
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I became fascinated with Truffaut and other French
New Wave directors. When I got into my 20s, I rented it and studied
it and decided some day, I'm gonna make my version of `The 400
Blows.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley, 36, has come up a bit from the poor kid with a drunken
father (just like Joe's), always in trouble in school. We're
sitting in his room at the Toronto Four Seasons, where he is
alternating talking about ``Joe the King'' with trying to raise
money for his next movie. But Whaley is still dressed for the
streets, in black T-shirt, jeans and heavy black shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Whaley admits he could not have gotten the low-budget ``Joe the
King'' made without a little help from his friends. Ethan Hawke,
Austin Pendleton and John Leguizamo came aboard to do cameo roles
in the film. But Whaley still was way short of the needed financing
just two days before the film was to go into production.
</P>
<P>
   Kilmer, who met Whaley on ``The Doors,'' saved the day at the
last minute by agreeing to play Joe's drunken, abusive, but not
entirely uncaring father. (It's probably Kilmer's best performance
in years.)
</P>
<P>
   Kilmer was not a close pal, but he liked the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were close when we were doing `The Doors,' but we lost
touch,'' Whaley said. ``Somebody told me they saw him walking
around in Manhattan, so I sent my script to his hotel. I'd been
sending everybody my script.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Truffaut's life, he returned to the character from
``The 400 Blows,'' following him into adulthood in four films.
Whaley isn't sure he wants to go that far, but his next film as
writer and director will be an adaptation of a play about a
character who could be Joe when he grows up. So who knows?

SHORT ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD

<P>
   After 71 Years, an Expansion
</P>
<P>
   When it opened in 1928, the Philadelphia Museum of Art was the
largest art museum in the United States. But while museums all over
the country have expanded, Philadelphia's hasn't grown at all.
</P>
<P>
   So the the museum's purchase of a 1926 building on two acres
across the street, at 2501 Benjamin Franklin Parkway, qualifies as
a major milestone.
</P>
<P>
   The building has been home to the Reliance Standard Life
Insurance Co., a subsidiary of the Delphi Financial Group, since
1989. Reliance is seeking larger quarters in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The building went for $17 million, of which $2 million will be
contributed by the city. (The city of Philadelphia owns the
museum's buildings and gives it some operational support, but
private money makes up most of the museum's budget.)
</P>
<P>
   The building will give the museum an additional 100,000 square
feet of space. ``Now that we've managed to acquire the new
building, we will start work on a master plan,'' said Anne
d'Harnoncourt, director of the museum. ``We don't take possession
until late spring, early summer, so we have time to think about all
our spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum has hired the Vitetta Group, an architectural firm
based in Philadelphia that specializes in renovating historic
buildings. Ms. d'Harnoncourt said the building would probably house
some of the museum's administrative offices, a large library and
archives as well as public gallery space.
</P>
<P>
   That the museum chose the building across the street is fitting,
not only geographically but also architecturally. Both were
designed by the same Philadelphia firm, Zantzinger, Borie &AMP; Medary.
</P>
<P>
   But their styles are different. The Reliance building was
completed two years earlier than the museum and is considered one
of Philadelphia's finest Art Deco structures. It features gilt
panels, inlaid windows and sculpture and ornamental work by Lee
Lawrie, an artist whose work can be seen in the Library of Congress
and the National Academy of Sciences in Washington. The museum, on
the other hand, is a neo-classical temple inspired by ancient
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The museum had a chance to acquire the building in 1981 when it
was owned by the city. But museum officials declined because they
thought the expense of another building would be a financial
strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time the building hadn't been renovated,'' Ms.
d'Harnoncourt said. ``Now it's been thoroughly modernized and kept
up very well.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gift for Sale
</P>
<P>
   When Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney died last year, much of
the art she and her husband, John Hay Whitney, had collected was
inherited by museums. While alive (Whitney, who was called Jock,
died in 1982), the couple had extensive discussions with the
museums to determine which works each wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the bequests to the Museum of Modern Art turned out
to be a surprise. In addition to works by Picasso, Matisse, van
Gogh and Cezanne, the Modern received a 1909 George Bellows
sporting scene, ``Polo Crowd.'' It was the last of the three polo
paintings the artist did and the one experts consider his best.
</P>
<P>
   How did a work by Bellows, an artist that the Modern has never
featured, end up as a gift to a museum whose collecting mission is
modern art beginning with European Post-Impressionism?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure,'' said Kirk Varnedoe, the Modern's chief
curator of painting and sculpture. He added that if Alfred H. Barr
Jr., the museum's founding director, had asked Whitney for the
painting his request was not in the Modern's records. Whitney was
on the Modern's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense burying it in our basement,'' Varnedoe said.
So the museum is offering the painting at Sotheby's in New York on
Dec. 1. It is estimated to fetch $10 million to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dara Mitchell, director of American paintings at Sotheby's, said
she hoped the sales price would break the record for an American
painting at auction, which was set in 1996 when John Singer
Sargent's ``Cashmere'' sold for $11.1 million at Sotheby's in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney collection included three paintings by Bellows, who
is known mainly for his early 20th-century sporting subjects; the
other two were bequeathed to the National Gallery of Art in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polo Crowd'' which is highly colorful, with dynamic brushwork,
depicts horses and riders in a polo match against a friezelike
arrangement of spectators. ``It's such an impressive painting we
believe it will appeal to collectors in areas other than American
paintings,'' Ms. Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   What the Modern will do with the money has not been decided. ``I
do have some ideas but I can't talk about them yet,'' Varnedoe
said. ``I have to wait and see how the picture will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Going Uptown
</P>
<P>
   It took the Studio Museum in Harlem less than a month to appoint
Lowery Stokes Sims its new director. Ms. Sims, a 24-year veteran of
the Metropolitan Museum of Art and its curator of 20th-century art
since 1995, is replacing Kinshasha Holman Conwill, who resigned
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we began our search and found out that Lowry was
interested, we stopped,'' said George Knox, chairman of the
museum's board. ``We knew we couldn't do better.''
</P>
<P>
   When she begins her new job on Jan. 3, Ms. Sims plans to name
Thelma Golden chief curator. Ms. Golden was a curator at the
Whitney Museum of American Art until her resignation last year.
``She's certainly part of my dream team, and it's safe to say
she'll be coming,'' Ms. Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe de Montebello, director of the Met, said that Ms. Sims
had agreed not to sever all ties with her old home. ``She has
agreed to remain as a consultant to us in the area of outreach and
multicultural diverse audiences,'' he said.

IT'S A SCREAM: NEW BOOK SHOWS HOW FAR WOMEN HAVE COME IN HORROR
GENRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By MELISSA FLETCHER STOELTJE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mild-mannered philosophy professor Cynthia A. Freeland
has always loved horror movies.
</P>
<P>
   Devours them, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aristotelian philosophy expert and former women's
studies director had never turned her scholarly lens on the dark,
gruesome world of monsters, vampires and things that chew their way
out of you in the night.
</P>
<P>
   Not, that is, until she started reading feminist critiques of
slasher movies and found them to be tortured, convoluted things
that miss the obvious when it comes to why we love horror movies,
even as they scare the devil out of us.
</P>
<P>
   And so Freeland _ quite possibly the only philosophy professor
in the world with a picture of Pinhead, the demon from
``Hellraiser,'' taped to her file cabinet _ wrote ``The Naked and
the Undead'' (Westview Press, $25), which explores how the ``allure
of evil'' underpins all fright flicks.
</P>
<P>
   One major theme of her book is the way in which women are
portrayed in horror films, and how that portrayal has changed. We
caught up with Freeland in her office at the University of Houston
and asked her to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You write in your book that women and monsters are often
``paired.'' What do you mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: Very often women are sympathetic with the monster and somehow
can understand where the monster is coming from, because he's also
in an ``outsider'' position. One good example is ``The Creature
From the Black Lagoon,'' where the creature is the Gill Man from
South America. The male scientists just want to get him on a big
fish hook and take him back to the aquarium to demonstrate him as a
curiosity, but the women _ he's attracted to the women, following
them around with his goggle eyes _ are sympathetic to him, saying
things like, ``Poor guy, he's the only one of his kind; he must be
very lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the role of women in horror changed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do think it's changed. Women have gone from being pure
victims who just scream a lot and are the target of the advances of
the male monster, to being heroines sometimes, and sometimes even
the scientists themselves who create the monster.
</P>
<P>
   One change we haven't seen enough of, though _ and it's a little
paradoxical to say I would want this _ is more female monsters.
What you're interested in, after all, in horror are the monsters,
the vampires, the Pinhead, the Jason, the Freddy, the Leather Face.
Look at Hannibal Lecter: He's what's interesting. And maybe female
monsters would be somehow different and would teach us different
things about evil.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Maybe the idea of a female monster is too threatening? Or is
it that most directors, writers and producers are male?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it's both, but especially the second. The monster is
creative, and the filmmaker tends to empathize with the monster _
he's the source of the creative play, after all, the visual
spectacle in the movie. When there are female monsters, they're
usually either bugs _ and the problem with bugs is they don't
usually talk _ or female vampires. There're quite a few female
vampires, and they're often pretty interesting, like Catherine
Deneuve in ``The Hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   You have a few other instances (of female monsters), like the
Borg Queen in ``Star Trek: First Contact,'' which is not quite
horror but comes close. The problem with female monsters is the
only sphere for their monster-ness is sexuality, and so there could
be some other spheres.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You write that vampires are ``gender-benders.'' Is that why
we can have female vampires?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's true. A lot of vampires are kind of like transvestites
_ Bela Lugosi was almost a woman in some ways, with all the
lipstick and eye shadow and the cape and the elegant dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there such a thing as a true feminist horror film?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think perhaps the ``Alien'' series, up until the fourth
one, anyway, and (the '50s-era) ``Them!,'' even though (Dr. Pat
Medford, a female scientist who goes up against giant killer ants)
is still kind of subordinate to her father. Another is Roman
Polanski's ``Repulsion,'' a psychological thriller with a slasher
killer in it played by a woman. It doesn't look at all feminist,
and a lot of people see (the killer, played by Deneuve) as just
sexually repressed, but I read the movie as incredibly sympathetic
to her point of view. And it shows the sort of atrocities she
experienced in her life that drove her mad. It's all centered on a
remembrance she has of childhood sexual abuse. I've watched all
these videos, and I couldn't watch this one alone. I was so
frightened and disturbed by it, I had to get a friend to watch it
with me. ... It's every woman's nightmare, in a way: When you walk
alone into your apartment, go into the bathroom and all of a sudden
there's a man's face in the mirror behind you. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: How have monsters changed through time?
</P>
<P>
   A: The big change is that horror is so much more graphic. I
don't know that the monsters themselves are different _ Pinhead is
really just an update of the vampire. The ``Alien'' creature is so
high-tech and very realistic, done with digital imaging. On the
other hand, (Alfred) Hitchcock's ``The Birds'' seemed pretty
believable; Frankenstein's makeup was said to be so frightening it
made people run from the theater. But I don't think the real nature
of monsters has changed as much as the use of special effects. That
and the explicit gore, which has just multiply increased.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And don't all ``bad'' girls die in these explicit slasher
flicks?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, studies have been done on the body counts on all
those mainstream (teen slasher) series of the '80s, and contrary to
popular belief, there are more males killed than females, sometimes
far more males killed. The big difference is that the death scenes
of the girls last longer. The hypothesis is that you have a largely
teen-age male audience, and (such audience members) empathize more
with the pain and suffering of the girls, because it's like their
female side. If it was a boy up there suffering and screaming, they
would feel uncomfortable, because boys aren't supposed to scream.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You talk a lot about evil in your book and its relation to
horror movies. Please explain.
</P>
<P>
   A: Horror came about in the 1800s as a kind of secular
replacement of the formerly dominant religious framework. You
didn't really have horror back in the medieval world. You had
devils; you had hell. Then the new scientific, enlightenment era
comes in, and a lot of that gets naturalized. Where do all those
emotions go? They start to go in the direction of worrying about
the supernatural, or the undead. That, and science that you can't
predict and control, whether it's Dr. Frankenstein sewing parts
together or (Mira Sorvino) engineering giant cockroaches in
``Mimic.''
</P>
<P>
   (Horror) gives an explanatory system that enables you to
confront evil. Horror makes evil emotionally real. And it's the
only genre where evil can really win in the end. In all the other
genres _ detective, action-thriller, romance, western _ the good
guys invariably win. In horror, there's often a suggestion at the
end that we're doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So horror movies give us a safe way to explore evil?
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds banal to say you have to go to a horror movie to
see evil, when there's evil all around us _ Jasper, the Waco
conflagration, KKK rallies and so on. We can certainly see evil in
the world. Yet I think we avoid feeling the feelings about it. It's
kind of in the news, then off, and you watch something else on TV.
(Horror films) enable you to have thoughts and feelings and allow
yourself to go through the process of really thinking about what is
the attraction of evil. If I met Pinhead, would I be able to
resist? If I met Frank Langella, would I run away with him?
Probably! (She laughs.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: You also have a part in your book titled `Women and Bugs.'
What's that about?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the '50s, there was the baby boom, the move to the
suburbs, the end of Rosie the Riveter, the return of men to the
factories, this new idea of the family as the father, the mother
and two kids, and this new idea of women being in the nice suburban
home with all the nice appliances. What could threaten this
environment? In '50s movies, it was all about alien invasion. Some
people link this to the Cold War and communism _ the aliens always
come in hordes as faceless, collective monsters like ants, roaches
or termites. I don't know why this gets feminized into (female)
bugs. That might be the subject of another book.
</P>
<P>
   But the surprising thing about '50s (horror) movies is the
number of strong, independent women. They tend to be the sidekicks
of the men, but they still get to go along on the trip to capture
the creature. There must have been some kind of social phenomenon
happening _ remember, this was before Betty Friedan wrote ``The
Feminine Mystique.'' But the women were allowed to be strong and
brave because they were protecting their own young. Again, it's
maternal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do scary movies scare you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not anymore. I'm hardly ever bothered by them. But ``The
Sixth Sense'' really got under my skin. There was something about
that little boy and his face and what he had experienced, and the
horror of what you learn in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your all-time favorite horror movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've gotten increasingly fond of the movies in the '50s, and
I love the black-and-white classics, but (director David)
Cronenberg's movies are my favorites. I think ``Scanners'' is kind
of the perfect horror movie. It doesn't have a wasted moment in it;
it's very intense and gripping, with moral complexity. You have
empathy for the characters. It's got this epic dimension to it,
this battle between brothers who don't know they're brothers, who
don't know their father. It's got a Greek tragedy aspect to it. And
the exploding head is completely shocking.

JOE MONTANA FEELS YOUNG'S PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE ADAMS   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Joe Montana knows exactly what Steve Young is
going through. He understands his resolve to play football again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult decision because his body is telling him he's
fine,'' Montana said of his successor as the starting quarterback
of the San Francisco 49ers. ``His head about now is probably
starting to feel better too.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana incurred several concussions during his 15-year playing
career. He said he's sympathetic with Young, who announced
Wednesday that he had no immediate plans to retire from football
despite four concussions in the past 35 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with a very volatile part of the body, the
brain, and there's not a lot of history about these injuries,''
Montana said. ``It's not an easy decision either way for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was also the day that Montana was among the 71 NFL
former players, coaches and others named to this year's Hall of
Fame ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Montana spent 13 years with the 49ers, winning four Super Bowls.
He spent his last two years with the Kansas City Chiefs and retired
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 38, took over the 49ers' starting job in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Montana, who said he has not talked with Young about his former
teammate's health problems, said he started getting headaches near
the end of his playing career as a result of his concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting headaches for a long time, migraines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're starting to slow down. I spent at least three or four
days a year in bed. Black. I didn't want to see sunlight. I didn't
want to hear any noise. I'd put my head under the pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was the aftereffects of violent NFL injuries that
prompted Montana to give several media interviews Wednesday on
behalf of the Arthritis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He has osteoarthritis in his often-injured left knee. He said
he's lost track of the number of surgeries on the knee (``I think
six or seven''). He also is troubled by arthritis in his right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that was directly affecting me,'' he said.
``And you look around and see it's the No. 1 crippling disease in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He was diagnosed 10 years ago, while he was still playing, but
he just made it public earlier this year. He said his arthritis was
a direct result of his numerous football injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The arthritic pains were just part of the everyday life of an
NFL player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different because as a football player you live with a
lot more pain,'' he said. ``You never heal from one week to the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that quarterbacks are especially vulnerable to injury,
as during sacks when large defensive linemen often drive the
quarterback into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Montana, 43, said he still stays active, working out four to six
days a week. He's given up running for low-impact aerobic work on
the treadmill and stationary bike and does light weightlifting.

EASTMAN JOHNSON: CAPTURING THE MOODS OF A NATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Seattle, San Diego, Maine, Wis., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While the court battle continues over ``Sensation,''
the show of work by young British artists at the Brooklyn Museum of
Art that has drawn fire from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, it is nice to
know that the museum continues to go about its business of mounting
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   The latest, ``Eastman Johnson: Painting America,'' set in the
19th century, is a comfortable distance from controversy and a good
foil for the visual ballistics of the ``Sensation'' show. Johnson
(1824-1906) is represented here by 70 paintings and 32 drawings, a
mix of corny stereotype and original observation heavily influenced
by 17th-century Dutch genre painting.
</P>
<P>
   If he wasn't the most exciting of painters, Johnson was a solid
one, with a narrative focus on rural and domestic life; women,
children and old men, and a group of important African-American
subjects. Among his signature works are ``The Old Stage Coach,'' a
merry, multifigured scene of children at play that may have
inspired Winslow Homer, and ``The Boy Lincoln'' (1868), an
inspirational childhood portrait of Lincoln perusing a book in the
glow of firelight (only a sketch for it appears in this show).
</P>
<P>
   Although his name is now overshadowed by those of Homer and
Thomas Eakins, Johnson was for a couple of decades (1860-1880) the
leading figure painter in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, his boldest endeavor, before and during the Civil War,
was painting antislavery scenes, like his powerful canvas, ``A Ride
for Liberty _ The Fugitive Slaves'' (circa 1862). It focuses
intensely on a black man, his wife, child and baby on a single
horse, dashing toward the safety of Union lines. This and some
poignant individualized studies of black children follow the
beautifully composed but more cliched painting that first earned
him a name, ``Negro Life at the South'' (1859), later known as
``Old Kentucky Home.''
</P>
<P>
   In this populous scene, set in a seedy courtyard, a black man
strums his banjo for a casual, sympathetically portrayed black
audience as the mistress of the plantation looks in. But by 1870,
according to an interesting catalog essay by the art historian
Patricia Hills, Johnson, like other abolitionists during of
backlash of Reconstruction, lost interest in the course of black
lives and more or less dropped them as subjects.
</P>
<P>
   This show, the first Johnson retrospective in more than 25
years, was organized by Teresa Carbone, associate curator of
American art at the Brooklyn Museum, and Ms. Hills, chairwoman of
the art history department at Boston University. Billed as a
``full-scale critical re-examination'' of Johnson's work, the show
ties in handily with the growing revival of interest in figurative
painting.
</P>
<P>
   As an aspiring young artist in Maine, Johnson traveled from town
to town ``doing faces'' in crayon. In 1846 he followed his father,
a minor government official, to Washington, and quickly racked up a
roster of famous sitters, among them Dolley Madison, Mrs. Alexander
Hamilton and John Quincy Adams. Invited to Cambridge, Mass., by
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to draw his portrait and others _ among
them Nathaniel Hawthorne and Ralph Waldo Emerson _ Johnson did his
subjects graceful justice. The lively crayon-and-chalk likenesses
that resulted are hung together in the exhibition with that of the
Massachusetts antislavery Senator Charles Sumner. All were done in
1846.
</P>
<P>
   By 1849, however, the restless crayoneer was off to Europe for a
six-year stay that would give his career a substantial boost. After
studying in Duesseldorf with the American expatriate Emanuel Leutze
(1816-1868), painter of the grandiose ``George Washington Crossing
the Delaware'' (1851), Johnson moved on to The Hague, where he
settled in for four years, steeping himself in the work of
Rembrandt and genre painters like Pieter de Hooch. By 1853
Johnson's skills at portraiture and the figure were well honed. He
returned to Washington in 1855 as an accomplished painter ready to
take on American subjects.
</P>
<P>
   A detour in 1856 to Superior, Wis., where he joined his oldest
brother in Northwest land speculation, aroused his interest in
frontier life and the Ojibwa Indians, who still frequented the Lake
Superior territory they had ceded to the U.S. government. The
best-schooled of all the midcentury Indian painters, Johnson used
his traditional European training in shading and line to make a
series of individual portraits _ a selection is included in the
show _ that, for their accuracy of facial detail and reading of the
sitters' character, rank among the memorable Indian studies of the
period.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With his real estate investments wiped out by a financial panic
in 1857, Johnson left Ojibwa country to raise cash by means of more
conventional portraits. He never returned to his Indian subjects.
But after the success of ``Negro Life at the South,'' shown at the
annual spring exhibition of the National Academy in New York in
1859, he became one of the New York art world's brightest lights.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1859 and 1866 he sent a number of well-received
paintings on black themes to the National Academy's spring
exhibitions. The few he did on the Civil War and its aftermath
included the popular ``Pension Claim Agent'' (1867), a
heart-wringer that depicts the visit of a pension agent to the home
of an amputee veteran.
</P>
<P>
   But, always aware of his market, Johnson turned to more topical
subjects. After the draining war an exhausted country began to
savor home and hearth, an interest also fueled by Susan Warner's
earlier domestic novel, ``The Wide, Wide World'' (1850). Images of
kitchens, firesides, farms, shops and other settings of ordinary
life found wide acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a bachelor until his mid-40s, began to produce a series
portraying domestic interiors and familial relationships that were
fed by his close acquaintance with Dutch genre painting. The works
ranged from big, upscale group portraits with a cast of thousands,
like ``The Hatch Family'' (1871), commissioned by Wall Street
broker Alfrederick Hatch, to more intimate interior scenes, like
``Not at Home'' (circa 1873), a portrait of Johnson's young wife,
Elizabeth, hurriedly leaving her light-filled parlor on a staircase
in deep shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1870 Johnson discovered the old whaling port of
Nantucket, where for more than two decades he summered with his
family. He plumbed the island deeply for subject matter: old sea
captains, New England barns, farm life and simple kitchens. His
most highly praised work of the 1870s was ``Husking Bee, Island of
Nantucket'' (1876), a tableau of volunteer farm labor that showed
again his deftness in multiple figure orchestrations. The painting,
with its freer brushing and focus on composition rather than
narrative, was seen as a response to a new generation of American
realists returning from study in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1870s Johnson began to feel heel nips from Homer, a
friend and competitor 12 years his junior whose interest was also
in American genre. It is unclear who was influenced more by whom;
certainly their work at this point drew close in style and subject
matter. Johnson did his Nantucket extravaganza, ``The Old Stage
Coach,'' rife with children romping over the wheel-less carcass of
a coach, in 1871; Homer produced his equally exuberant childhood
playfest, ``Snap the Whip,'' in 1872, almost certainly cued by the
Johnson work.
</P>
<P>
   Striking silhouette-style figures of women outdoors, alone or in
groups, also frequent the work of both men in the mid-1870s.
Johnson's ``Woman on a Hill'' (1875-80), a single figure of a
fashionably dressed young thing looking out to sea from dunes,
roughly corresponds with Homer's ``Fresh Air'' (1878), a similar
figure with the addition of grazing sheep. And at first glance
Johnson's ``Hollyhocks'' (1874-76), a prettily deployed group of
women in a garden that evokes the French Impressionists, might have
been painted by Homer.
</P>
<P>
   Homer has long overtaken Johnson in the pantheon of American art
history. But this show, a worthy tribute to an artist who
successfully fused home-grown talent with European training to
convey a vision _ albeit a well-varnished one _ of real American
life, gives Johnson his due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eastman Johnson: Painting America'' is at the Brooklyn Museum
of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718)
638-5000, through Feb. 6. It then travels to the San Diego Museum
of Art (Feb. 26 through May 21) and the Seattle Art Museum (June 8
through Sept. 10).

`LOST FOR WORDS': A MATERNAL BOND GLOWS IN THE DYING OF THE LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life may not be as perfectly bittersweet as it is painted in
``Lost for Words.'' But it ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   This little gem of a drama, Sunday's ``Masterpiece Theater''
presentation, is an extraordinary dual portrait of two rather
ordinary people, an elderly woman and her middle-aged son. It
begins at a hospital, where the mother has just died, then doubles
back to recount the end of her life. That's all. It could be
anyone's story. Which is why it's so affecting.
</P>
<P>
   The script is by Deric Longden, based on his memoir. Longden
will be familiar to some viewers. This book was a follow-up to his
account of the prolonged illness and death of his first wife, who
showed her appreciation for his years of devoted attention by
selecting a suitable second wife, Aileen. She is blind and is
blessed with strength and good humor; she is never less than
stalwart during the crisis at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The film's Deric and his slightly dotty Mum, Annie, are probably
a bit more charming than the real-life Longdens. Real or not, they
live vividly in the understated performances of Pete Postlethwaite
and Dame Thora Hird, 83, a British national treasure. Under the
direction of Alan J.W. Bell, they touch your heart without ever
trying to bonk you on the head.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Thora's assignment is by far the tougher. She must hold the
film together by proceeding from spry self-confidence to frightened
frailty without ever breaking the spell. Or breaking a sweat. Her
performance is so seamless that you never notice her consummate
skill until the final credits are rolling. Then you remember the
little touches _ the way she eats an ice cream cone, for instance _
and marvel at them.
</P>
<P>
   When you first encounter Annie, she is preparing to sell her
house and move to a smaller one around the corner. The real-estate
agent has told her to show the house by appointment only. So she
makes appointments with all the prospective buyers at the same
time, turning the event into a jolly tea party at which she keeps
pointing out all the house's defects, most of them results of her
late husband's shoddy handiwork. Despite her unorthodox sales
pitch, or because of it, the house sells immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless Deric is worried about his mother. He begins
spending more time with her, observing her funny little habits,
like her fondness for the tonic she buys several bottles at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only have a teaspoonful,'' she tells her worried son with a
twinkle.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many?'' he demands, bemused, not angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Their conversations reveal an enduring bond, forged in the
shadow of Deric's overbearing father. ``I've been so happy since he
died,'' Annie confesses to her son. ``It's taken me a long time to
be able to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Deric tells Annie's doctor: ``She never let me down, you
know. Taught me to believe in myself all the time that my dad was
chipping away at my self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he can't let her down, as a series of strokes begin to rob
her independence and eventually her ability to speak coherently.
(Hence the title.)
</P>
<P>
   When the neighborhood pharmacist asks Deric to send his regards
to Annie and adds, ``She's a lovely woman,'' Postlethwaite pauses
to ponder this offhand remark. His reply is simple: ``Yeah. She is,
isn't she?'' But the actor's careworn face delivers a wordless
soliloquy.
</P>
<P>
   Aileen, played by Penny Downie, is rendered too upbeat to be
true. And the incidental characters are all cardboard cutouts. But
these shortcomings are on the margins. At the center, the film
looks squarely at the final indignities sprung by this mortal coil
and laughs at them ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   You'll laugh, too. Then you'll be moved; not by death, but by
life. &QL;

   THE TIGER LILLIES: ``Shockheaded Peter: A Junk Opera'' (NVC
Arts/Atlantic). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parents flustered by the horrors of the video arcade should
examine the classics of kiddie literature. Children's tales have
long incarnated the dark corners of the littlest psyches, from
Grimm's dark forest to Roald Dahl's rotting giant peach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shockheaded Peter,'' the English ``junk opera'' at the New
Victory Theater in Manhattan, is a delicious reminder of kiddie
culture's gory heart. It respectfully, and therefore audaciously,
reworks ``Struwwelpeter,'' a parody of children's cautionary tales,
by the Victorian psychiatrist Heinrich Hoffmann.
</P>
<P>
   In those verses, mischievous children meet outrageously cruel
fates. The id-stimulating mayhem reminds us that moral rectitude
can be a vengeful, life-squashing force.
</P>
<P>
   The lurid circus sideshow atmosphere of ``Shockheaded Peter'' is
effectively mirrored in its music, written and performed by the
Tiger Lillies. That trio of accordion, stand-up bass and portable
drum kit is led by Martin Jacques, a born carny with a
hermaphroditic castrato voice and a penchant for lurching rhythms
and creaky melodies.
</P>
<P>
   Songs like ``Snip Snip (Suck a Thumb)'' and ``Fidgety Phil''
hardly seem contemporary, except in their atmospherically rich
production and their obvious debt to Tom Waits.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques' piping voice can be hard to decipher in person, and
this recording makes it possible to catch every creepy detail of
his songs. It well captures the show's naughty mood. It also stands
as a resurrected classic for children, and grown-ups, with open
minds and stout stomachs.

CANADIAN COMPANY ACQUIRES SPORTS MANAGEMENT FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Before long, Steve Young, Troy Aikman, Drew
Bledsoe and Warren Moon may become almost as recognizable in
American pop culture as Mickey Mouse, Elvis Presley and James Dean.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the possible upshots of a multimillion-dollar deal
announced Wednesday in which the company headed by powerful
California sports agent Leigh Steinberg was acquired by Assante
Corp. of Canada, a financial planning firm that administers $22.3
billion in assets for high-profile and affluent clients.
</P>
<P>
   Assante reportedly paid $120 million in cash and convertible
stock to acquire Steinberg, Moorad &AMP; Dunn, which has offices in
Berkeley and Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of sports and business is changing dramatically,''
said Steinberg, who will become chief executive officer of Assante
Sports Management Group. ``Sports now have become content and
product for multiple platforms of entertainment delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo150 TV stations on 24 hours a day. There are video
games, the Internet, videotapes, all of which demand a lot of
content. We plan to move into the TV production business, using our
athletes in all sorts of TV shows, Internet programming and a
variety of other media and marketing uses. There are any number of
applications for athletes besides what they do on the playing
fields.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Steinberg's company continues a trend of
consolidation in the business, with the focus on marketing of the
athletes. SFX Entertainment Inc. earlier bought out high-powered
agents Arn Tellem and David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Assante, Steinberg said, has the backing of the
stable he and partners Jeffrey Moorad and David Dunn manage _ a
150-member list that includes football stars like Aikman, Bledsoe,
Moon, Young and Jake Plummer; baseball players such as Ivan
Rodriguez and Matt Williams; and basketball player John Starks.

   ``This is going to give them some exciting bridges to the
entertainment community,'' said Steinberg, who already has made the
leap himself as a technical consultant on several Hollywood movies.
``I've talked with Warren, Drew, Steve and Troy, and they're
excited about this opening new doors for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said several things were in the works as the
traditional contract negotiations he's handled for his clients were
combined with marketing and financial-service opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to buy 10 or 11 more sports agencies in football,
basketball, hockey, soccer, wrestling and boxing, and in the next
phase we'll go into motor sports, skating, tennis and golf,'' he
said. ``Over the next six months, we'll be rolling out these
companies through a series of announcements.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Weinberg, chairman and chief executive of Assante, which
is moving into the sports field for the first time, said, ``We're
very excited about this new partnership. I think this firmly
establishes us with the finest people in the sports management
business. We started looking into this marketplace more than two
years ago, and we selected Leigh's firm because nothing was even
close to it. Every arrow we saw directed us toward Steinberg and
Moorad.''

`PUNITIVE DAMAGE': IF THE KILLING IS OVER WITH, IT'S TOO LATE FOR
ONE STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   East Timor won its independence from Indonesia a couple of
months ago. You probably heard. President Suharto had already been
gone for more than a year. Indonesia's new president has now
appointed a ``national unity Cabinet,'' and the security council
has just created a United Nations mission to govern East Timor for
now. The killing and the destruction that began when Indonesia
annexed East Timor in 1975 may finally be over.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't be better _ or worse _ for ``Punitive
Damage,'' Annie Goldson's worthy documentary about a Malaysian
college student who died in East Timor for his cause.
</P>
<P>
   You see a lot of Helen Todd in ``Punitive Damage.'' A New
Zealander who has lived in Malaysia since the 1960s, Ms. Todd is
the mother of the film's subject, Kamal Bamadhaj. ``My worst
nightmare,'' she says early in the film, remembering his departure
for that final trip, ``was that he would end up in jail.'' He was
``the most cool and calm'' and logical young man, she recalls, and
she believed he could handle anything he encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Kamal (everyone in the film seems to call him, affectionately,
by his first name) was 20 and a student at New South Wales
University in Australia when he went to East Timor in 1991. It was
his second visit, and he was there on a political errand.
</P>
<P>
   He became one of the 270 unarmed demonstrators killed by the
Indonesian military that day in a massacre in Dili, East Timor's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Punitive Damage,'' which opens Friday in New York City , is
the story of Kamal's political activism and Ms. Todd's unusual
search for justice. In 1994 she traveled to the United States
(world capital of litigation) and sued the Indonesian general who
had authorized the massacre for the wrongful death of her son.
</P>
<P>
   The story is illustrated by old photographs of Kamal, film of
the actual massacre, re-creations of courtroom testimony and a
variety of talking heads. The most effective interview subject is
Allan Nairn, a journalist who has long covered East Timor and
witnessed the Dili massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, some of the other subjects and the recreations are quite
stiff. But Ms. Todd has a particularly gripping scene, one in
which, having talked to many people who saw Kamal the day he died,
she reconstructs and recounts the events of her son's last hours.
</P>
<P>
   His youthful political fervor now stands for that of all those
who died alongside him, and Ms. Goldson has given him a respectful,
meaningful memorial.
</P>

HALLOWEEN SPOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's capital can be a spooky place, but
this is the time of the year when it's not only okay but expected.
</P>
<P>
   That unique blend of costumed hi-jinks, make-believe and free
candy called Halloween is just around the corner. It's a rare
opportunity for children and adults to act silly without fear of
being sent to an asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But this is America, land of free speech and freer opinions.
Nothing is simple here, not even an excuse to party.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween brings its own brand of politics, featuring what has
become a routine argument between those who think the holiday is
just for jollies and those who read dark, ominous meanings into it.
</P>
<P>
   And there is always a cultural war between Halloween-friendly
souls who love to hand out stuff to kids and grumpy sorts who
regard the occasion as a candy ripoff by masked midgets from
unknown neighborhoods far away. Plus, there's the gulf between
modernists who will go for the new blue pumpkin and traditionalists
who think jack-o-lanterns only come in orange.
</P>
<P>
   Smart retailers discovered Halloween long ago and turned it into
a huge commercial venture, second only to Christmas in
revenue-raising. The National Retail Federation says all those
pint-sized ghosts and goblins going door to door begging for
handouts and the hordes of masked adults out for a good time
produced $2.5 billion in related sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since costumes can cost $50 a pop (without the mask), it's no
wonder. And costumes matter.
</P>
<P>
   My middle granddaughter, who graduated over the years from a
pumpkin to a princess to a leopard to Darth Vader, is this year
going as a roll of Lifesavers in a colorful tube she bought with
her own allowance. She's no longer happy in a simple outfit sewed
by her mother. She looks much cuter, I'm told, than she did as
Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   But some fundamentalist religious groups don't see the fun in
it. They take the whole thing very seriously, warning against
satanic practices based on pagan rituals bound to corrupt our
youngsters. They try to counter the Halloween tradition of trick
and treat with sermons and substitute events that extol the virtues
of clean living.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, schools and churches will hold supervised
children's parties forbidding costumes that are scary or that might
be politically incorrect. On both counts that means, presumably,
pirates with guns are out, and so are Al Gore, Hillary Clinton or
George W. Bush masks.
</P>
<P>
   These sanitized events are often called ``autumn festivals'' and
feature happy drawings, pumpkins and nutritional nibbles rather
than the traditional ghoulish music, sweets and grapes passed
around in the dark as eyeballs. Costume parades are the big
attraction, usually with parents and cameras in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   In other places, there will be Christian band concerts, morality
plays (script copies available for $150) and sermons against movies
and television programs that glorify witchcraft or at least make it
sound benign.
</P>
<P>
   It is a shame that Halloween is being dragged into modern
religious politics, although it doesn't hurt if the costumes become
more imaginative and the emphasis more on good cheer than imagined
scares. But to the extent that the holiday is used as a vehicle to
lecture about morality, abortion and other favorite conservative
causes, the spirit will go out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The event has its roots in a festival of the dead that
originated roughly 1,500 years ago, before reading and writing and
civilized thought. Druids and Celts danced and practiced horrible,
bloody rites that honored Satan in hopes of warding off further
evil.
</P>
<P>
   But for something like 50 generations Druids and Celts have not
been either revered or feared as functioning religious
institutions. This craziness did not happen yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient nonsense plays no threatening role in modern life. Over
the centuries, Halloween lost its overt religious message and
became a secular celebration, uncomplicated by the serious
overtones of Christmas, Hanukkah and Easter.
</P>
<P>
   And that has been its endearing charm. This is strictly for fun.
A chance to dress up and parade around is a hoot for all ages.
There's no harm in it, and everybody gets a big kick afterward out
of looking at the photographs of how silly our friends appear. It's
truly a great ``remember when.''

 &HT;    REPEAL URGED IN USE OF SECRET EVIDENCE AGAINST NON-CITIZENS
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Federal lawmakers and Arab organizations Thursday
urged Congress to repeal a law allowing the use of secret evidence
in the arrest and detention of non-citizens within the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., and Rep. Tom
Campbell, R-Calif., joined Hany Kiareldeen, (CQ) a Palestinian
immigrant, at a news conference to protest the use of secret
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen was arrested in March 1998 and detained for 19 months
by the Immigration and Naturalization Service because he was
suspected of having ties to a terrorist group. During that time,
his lawyers were not permitted to review the charges or to evaluate
the evidence of his case.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 anti-terrorism law allows the INS to detain immigrants
suspected of being a threat to national security without revealing
any of the evidence or charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen was released last week after a federal judge declared
his incarceration unconstitutional and a violation of his rights to
due process and fair treatment under the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling in this case will be a limited victory if we in
Congress fail to repeal the law that makes the use of secret
evidence legal in the first place,'' Bonior said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the court ruling, Bonior said, the INS is detaining 20
immigrants on the basis of secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of the two dozen detainees are Muslim and Arab,''
said Aly Abuzaakouk, executive director of the American Muslim
Council. ``Their detention on the basis of secret evidence leads
many to question whether it is national security, or politically
motivated bias, that is at issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior and Campbell introduced a bill, co-sponsored by 50 other
members, that would eliminate the use of secret evidence and would
extend the constitutional rights of due process and fair treatment
to non-citizens within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service defends the use of classified evidence,
but has not taken a position on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elimination of the use of classified evidence could result
in a significant risk to national security,'' said Russ Bergeron,
INS' director of media relations.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron added that the Supreme Court has previously ruled that
the INS may use classified evidence in certain cases where there is
a danger to national security. The INS will continue the practice
until legislation or a Supreme Court ruling changes it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the Judiciary
subcommittee on immigration and claims, said he will hold a hearing
on the bill in the near future.

COSTUME IDEAS FOR THE MILLENNIUM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're still unsure what you're going to wear to that
Halloween party, you might consider going as a Millennium Bug.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why this would be a great costume:
</P>
<P>
   1) It's topical.
</P>
<P>
   2) It's scary.
</P>
<P>
   3) You don't have to actually make a costume.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Bug is superior to other Halloween costumes like,
say, Austin Powers or Jar Jar Binks, because no one has ever seen a
Millennium Bug, therefore there is no pressure to make your costume
``authentic.'' If I say the Millennium Bug looks like an
avocado-shaped humor columnist wearing a stained golf shirt and
pants that should have been made into dust rags five years ago,
then, by golly, that's what the Millennium Bug looks like.
</P>
<P>
   (I should probably warn parents that this ``look'' might be too
frightening for young children. You might want to ``soften'' it a
bit by placing a grocery bag over your head or, better yet, a
body-length sheet.)
</P>
<P>
   Most people, I suspect, will go with some sort of insect-related
theme when making their Millennium Bug costume which, of course,
plays right into the hands (mandibles?) of those of us who live in
Florida. Insects are a fact of life in Florida, much like tourists,
but after you've lived here a while, you lose your natural
revulsion. Toward insects, I mean.
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely possible that the Millennium Bug is related to
our state bird, the Palmetto Bug, which looks to the untrained eye
like a cockroach on steroids. Since ``millennium'' means
``thousand,'' Millennium Bug could just be a shorthand way of
saying ``1,000 cockroaches'' as in, ``It's a good idea to wear
shoes if you go into the kitchen late at night. We've got a
Millennium Bug'' or ``We find if our Millennium Bug flaps its wings
at the same time, we don't need air conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Millennium Bug could just as easily resemble some
other kind of insect. A killer bee is one possibility, or maybe a
fire ant. (I have never seen just one fire ant; the smallest
denomination seems to be a millennium, though 10 times 10
millenniums of fire ants is not an uncommon sight, particularly if
you are foolhardy enough to walk across your yard barefoot.)
</P>
<P>
   Or you could decide that the Millennium Bug is not an insect at
all, but rather a bacterium. (Like fire ants, bacteria seldom if
ever operate alone, but for the purposes of a Halloween costume you
might be able to get away with it.) I don't know what a bacterium
looks like, though I'm imagining a sort of avocado-shaped blob
minus the stained golf shirt and frayed pants. You might want to
check with the Halloween party's host or hostess beforehand to make
sure the nude-infectious-tropical-fruit look doesn't ``clash'' with
what the other guests are wearing.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the literal sort, you might conclude that the
Millennium Bug is not a living creature of any kind, but simply a
particularly unfortunate computer-programming oversight. I'm not
sure how you would illustrate this in the context of a Halloween
costume. Maybe come as Bill Gates banging his fist on a fried
automatic teller machine, though I'm betting that more people would
be able to guess what you are if you come as a fashion-challenged
bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   The only bad thing about the Millennium Bug costume is that it's
only good for this year (we hope). Next year, you'll be back to
making the same dreary choice between Tinky-Winky and Stone Cold
Steve Austin. (Though a mix-and-match might be interesting.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you decided that the Millennium Bug is really
nothing more than a whole lot of Palmetto Bugs. Because
cockroaches, like tourists, never go out of style.

FALL FALLOUT: `AMY,' `WWF' AMONG EARLY HITS _
`ACTION,'  `WASTELAND' TOP LOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a scarcely noticed television oddity last Thursday, little
UPN was the third-rated network in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Being third-rated isn't usually a cause for celebration. Look at
the words _ third rate. But UPN is the sixth network. So ... (set
ital)yippee!(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The show that did the trick was ``WWF Smackdown!'' It's not
exactly ``Playhouse 90,'' but UPN will take progress where it can
find it. So in its first season, ``WWF Smackdown!'' is a big hit by
UPN standards. It's boffo. It's a monster. It's just plain buff.
</P>
<P>
   For that two-hour wrestling spectacle to succeed, something else
had to fail, woefully. The chief victims in this case were two
other new shows, ABC's abysmally low-rated ``Wasteland'' and Fox's
``Action.''
</P>
<P>
   Though baseball has been a wrench in the ratings gears, the
1999-2000 TV season is finally forming enough of a pattern to sort
out winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   It pains me to say it, but the winners emphatically include
``WWF Smackdown!'' and ``Judging Amy,'' and the losers apparently
include ``Action.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS' ``Judging Amy'' is, excuse the language, a chick show. It
isn't quick or strident or action-packed. It seems to be tapping
the same spongy audience that coalesced around NBC's
``Providence.'' It's way too much like ``Providence,'' to tell the
truth. Frizzy-haired, female professional, about 30, sheds
spouse/lover, leaves big city and returns to her roots in her
smaller-city hometown.
</P>
<P>
   The Nielsen numbers speak plainly. ``Judging Amy'' isn't a top
show among young men, but it is among girls and women in the key
18-to-49 demographic. That's all a show needs to win a place at the
table.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has extended full-season pickups to all its new dramas.
Besides ``Judging Amy,'' that means ``Family Law,'' perking along
nicely on Mondays, and ``Now and Again,'' delivering full-blooded
demographics on Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   As for the acerbic comedy ``Action,'' it hasn't exactly enjoyed
kid-glove handling. It's marooned on Thursday nights, it bounced on
and off the schedule because of postseason baseball, and it will be
consigned to inaction during the November sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no denying that after all the August buzz and
near-unanimous critical raves in September, ``Action'' tanked in
its series premiere. That set a fearful course, and the show hasn't
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the time slot, maybe it's the absence of an admirable
central character, maybe it's the showbiz insider humor, maybe it's
the bleeped expletives, or maybe it's just the usual lack of
audience enthusiasm for satire. Whatever it is, it's powerful. The
American public is sitting with its arms folded and its teeth
clenched; it won't watch ``Action.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox is struggling generally this fall, aside from ``Action.''
``Get Real'' is going nowhere. Neither is the half-hour rerun
version of ``Ally.'' ``Manchester Prep'' was aborted before it even
aired. This week, ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' and Chris Carter's
``Harsh Realm'' were axed.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's performance is a blow to Doug Herzog, the erstwhile
``Comedy Central'' guru who was brought to Fox to restore the
network's reputation for edgy, youthful programming. Instead Fox
has tumbled off the edge of the ledge.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is having a down year too, though it hasn't cashiered
anything yet. ``Snoops'' was given a full-season order at its
inception, but it isn't exactly setting Sunday night ablaze.
``Wasteland'' is vast, and not in a good way. ``Oh Grow Up'' and
``Odd Man Out'' are yawns. ``Then Came You'' is out of commission
until midseason, and then came (set ital)peee-uw(end ital) _ the
unfortunate time-slot flap over ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Once and
Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' has dropped behind ``Judging Amy'' in the
household ratings and will move to Mondays later in the season. It
also seems to have stalled creatively. But its female demographics
are still strong, and it has to be scored as a qualified success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack &AMP; Jill'' and ``Popular'' appear to be on the bubble at
the WB, which is having a so-so year. The animated ``Mission Hill''
hasn't been canceled yet, but it's by far the WB's lowest-rated
show. ``Roswell'' and ``Angel'' have won full-season pickups, with
decent numbers.
</P>
<P>
   UPN is positively giddy about its wrestling-inspired 2.7 rating
average for the young season, which translates into an average
audience just shy of 3 million households. The reason is that UPN
averaged a 2 rating last season. The jump to 2.7 looks spectacular
on graph charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parkers'' and ``Grown Ups'' are on order for the whole
season at UPN, along with ``WWF Smackdown!'' There's no call yet on
``The Strip,'' and ``Shasta McNasty'' is experiencing rocky
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The season race is between NBC and last season's household
ratings champ, CBS. NBC, the leader this fall, has cause for
optimism even though it was the first network to cancel a series _
``The Mike O'Malley Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Third Watch,'' ``The West Wing,'' ``Law &AMP; Order: SVU'' and
even ``Stark Raving Mad'' are alive with full-season orders. ``Cold
Feet'' is a candidate for cancellation, and the critically praised
``Freaks &AMP; Geeks'' isn't having an impact. All in all, though, it
has been
</P>
<P>
   a comeback year for the bully Peacock.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has its three dramas to cheer about, but it's dicey after
that. ``Work With Me'' has been canceled, with ratings identical to
``Ally McBeal'' reruns on Fox. ``Love &AMP; Money'' is on the bubble.
So is ``Ladies Man,'' which is failing to hold its ``King of
Queens'' lead-in on Mondays. In fact, the progression from ``King
of Queens'' to ``Ladies Man'' to ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' looks
too much like the letter ``V.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessons? For one thing, dramas are obviously in vogue in a
medium where comedy is usually king. The sitcom genre is ailing,
and no one has cured it yet.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that the two networks with the sexiest, edgiest
new shows, Fox and ABC, are foundering. The theory was that you had
to give viewers the electric buzzer treatment to get their
attention. Could be that the theory is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there's no mistaking the fact that in a season that seemed
tailored for viewers in their teens and 20s, it's the shows with
older stars that are demonstrating traction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging Amy,'' ``Family Law,'' ``The West Wing'' and ``Once
and Again'' emphasize character and life experience over
callowness. They're the shows that are sticking to the wall, while
a ``Wasteland'' slides to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps there were just too many young-skewing shows crowding
the fall schedule, leaving a clearer path for a ``Family Law.''
</P>
<P>
   If you know the answer to this and other mysteries of the
enigmatic tube, you too could be programming your very own
television network. And looking forward to being fired the first
time you guess wrong.

IN SEARCH OF MANHATTAN'S MOST ECLECTIC AND ELECTRIC NIGHTLIFE

establishments described in the article is at end.)

 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If ever there was a neighborhood to inspire a fashion
crisis, it's the meatpacking district.
</P>
<P>
   Between leather bars and honky-tonks, rock-and-roll grottos and
techno dens, it is nearly impossible to find a single outfit that
will please everybody. Doorman-guarded establishments like Fressen
and Oriont are looking for signs of disposable income and designer
labels. But you've got to be careful. Wear a tie to Hogs and
Heifers, and they'll cut it off.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner, at the cozy dance hall Baktun, revelers might
prefer club attire. (Boys dress baggy, girls dress tight.) But next
door, at the music club the Cooler, many listeners sport a kind of
second-generation grunge look, complete with T-shirts, goatees and
facefuls of studied apathy.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Mother, where on a recent Saturday night I was
warned in no uncertain terms that if I wasn't in black _ all black,
``head-to-toe black,'' as the organizers said _ I wouldn't be
getting in to ``Click and Drag,'' a weekly cyber-fetish party.
(More on this later.) They weren't kidding: a friend dressed in
dark gray recently spent an hour arguing his case on the sidewalk
and never made it past the velvet ropes.
</P>
<P>
   But such are the sacrifices, sartorial and otherwise, gladly
suffered by visitors to the meatpacking district, currently home to
some of Manhattan's most eclectic and electric night life. In less
time than it takes to take a company public, this red-blooded,
blue-collar neighborhood has become the city's ``it'' social scene,
with enough new restaurants, chic bars and smoky clubs to occupy
even the flimsiest of attention spans.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say it's user-friendly. Many of the area's
establishments are tucked away, without signs or outside windows,
on streets that, it should be noted, are often slick with animal
grease and its attendant odors. Depending on when you catch it, any
given block can be dark, deserted or downright putrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly like tripping over meat carcasses,'' said
Eugenie Hanmer, 26, a fashion stylist from Britain, who was seen at
Oriont recently. ``But this is really what the city's about, isn't
it?''
</P>
<P>
   That rawness and thrill of discovery, visitors say, gives the
neighborhood much of its appeal, especially as places like the East
Village and SoHo have become gentrified, and the city's night life
has become more sanitized.
</P>
<P>
   Food and drink run the gamut, from the polite French sensibility
of Le Gans to the brazen booziness of the Village Idiot, whose
rotund owner is prone to taking off his shirt and bear-hugging his
patrons.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a distinctly catch-all aspect to the area: geeks,
jocks, metalheads, suburbanites, urbanites, gays, straights and
bi-curious all have a place to go, as do artists and musicians,
hepcats and hipsters, punks and preppies. Heck, even
cyber-fetishists can get their clicks in the meatpacking district.
</P>
<P>
   That diversity is all the more impressive when you consider that
this is packed into an area roughly the size of Washington Square
Park. Bounded on the east by Ninth Avenue and on the west by the
Hudson River, the meatpacking district is only four blocks deep,
running from West 14th Street to Gansevoort Street.
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1990s this was almost exclusively the domain of
overnight laborers, primarily the beef-and-poultry movers who gave
the area its name, and the transvestite prostitutes who gave it its
seedy reputation. Nowadays those old-timers are giving way, taking
with them, say some resident meatheads, the area's reputation as
the last gritty outpost below 14th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to happen, just not this quickly,'' said
Mick McGee, the longtime manager of the bar Hogs and Heifers.
``This is the last neighborhood. It's the last frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a frontier that is rapidly being settled. A new restaurant
from Keith McNally, the owner of Balthazar, is under construction
at the corner of Little West 12th Street and Ninth Avenue, within
sight of graffiti reading ``Disgusted with Commerciali(s)m.'' Swank
condos have already risen along the western end of 14th Street, and
recent zoning changes allowing for new buildings as high as 12
stories may be an indication of things to come. Already the
street's galleries are ``side by side by side,'' as one resident
put it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this remains a neighborhood very much in flux: claimed by
many groups, owned by none. And while partyers may rule the
weekends, the wholesale meatpackers still crowd the streets till
dawn during the week. Then again, on a Sunday afternoon, when the
sun streams over the low buildings and brick streets, the area can
seem remarkably sleepy, as still as the dust inside of the
abandoned meat warehouses on 10th Avenue.

Carter is not saying how he is feeling and what he is thinking - he
asked coach Jim Donnan to be excused from media responsibilities
this week so he can concentrate on the game. Last year was the

 NEW YORK: 10th Avenue.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It could take a week to experience the two dozen bars and
restaurants here, not to mention the spacious new shopping
emporiums like Jeffrey New York, where Pellegrino evening bags
barely big enough for a pork chop go for $395. I opted instead for
a party platter, trying some of the old and some of the new, or as
much as my appetite would allow in one weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And like my limited wardrobe, coordinating it all would prove to
be the biggest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   I chose two compatriots for the first night of the tour: Gabe,
my younger brother, and Anthony, a freelance journalist. The first
stop was to be Fressen, a handsome new lounge and restaurant on
West 13th Street. But the locals had schemes of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Turning onto West 13th, we stumbled into an elaborate display of
used goods arrayed on a deflated cardboard box; the inventory
included a copy of ``Death of a Salesman,'' a bottle of VO-5
shampoo and an empty Beaujolais bottle. But this wasn't an ordinary
street sale. There were appetizers. Chips, nuts, bagels, three
bananas, a miniature can of Bumblebee tuna, all laid out by a
gentleman who apparently lives under a makeshift tent behind the
display.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give back,'' the tent man said, declining to give his name.
Just then, a well-dressed man and two female companions walked by
and tossed a dollar in the tent man's direction.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked them and turned to us. ``Eat up,'' he said. We
continued on.
</P>
<P>
   West 13th Street is the home to two of the neighborhood's older
establishments: the Lure, a leather bar for gay men, and Hog and
Heifers, a denim bar for straight ones.
</P>
<P>
   In between is Fressen, which opened in June and whose clientele
runs from the nicely groomed to the well maintained. The food has
received mixed reviews, but the bar had a strong buzz all summer.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was of little surprise when we received an earnest
warning from the model-cum-doorman that it would be a 20-minute
wait . . . for a drink.
</P>
<P>
   The bar was crowded, to be sure, but we were served quickly and
efficiently. The bartender apologized as he handed over three
generous drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry about the wait,'' he said, adding with a tone that
suggested alien invasion: ``We're starting to get a nightclub
crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Eeek.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was late 20s and early 30s: laid back, attractive and
chatty. Between the austere decor (branches, not flowers) and the
minimalist lighting, it's a nice place to begin an evening or end
one. So we drank up and left.
</P>
<P>
   From civil pleasures to, well, something completely different.
</P>
<P>
   Hogs and Heifers represents itself as a genuine
country-and-western bar, and so it seems from the outside, where
the husky bikers and the proud-to-be-American crew hang out. On
this particular Friday night, however, the crowd inside consisted
of an unwieldy number of young men in jeans and button-down shirts,
all guzzling Budweiser and looking for some good old-fashioned
country boy experience.
</P>
<P>
   Hogs and Heifers was made famous when young women (heavily
encouraged young women) took to shedding their brassieres as they
danced on the bar. And indeed there are several thousand bras
hanging batlike behind the bar.
</P>
<P>
   After the aggressive bar mistress demanded that my brother buy a
trio of bourbon shots with Budweiser chasers, we settled near the
jukebox. The music was deafening, but I caught a few plaintive
lyrics about damaged love and bad pickup trucks. (Or was it the
other way around?)
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, true to form, eight (count 'em, eight) young
women jumped on the bar and began to boogie to ``Sharp Dressed
Man,'' by Z.Z. Top. The crowd whooped a little, the ladies danced,
and nervous boyfriends looked on.
</P>
<P>
   The bar mistress was not pleased. ``If you can't drink and
appreciate the ladies,'' she shouted into a mike, ``there's a gay
bar around the corner.'' (And miss this riveting entertainment?)
</P>
<P>
   The insults seemed to work. Men pushed to the bar to buy drinks,
while above, the clomping reached a fevered pitch, capped when the
dancer chosen as the belle of the bar got a hefty tequila shot
poured down her throat by the now-appeased bar mistress.
</P>
<P>
   There was much rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop was Oriont, the Asian fusion restaurant and bar on
West 14th Street whose ``soft opening'' last month was a must for
the city's swank set. The reason? The restaurant's designer is
Christopher Ciccone, Madonna's brother, famous for his furniture
design and for being Madonna's brother.
</P>
<P>
   Ciccone has done admirable work. The two-story establishment,
which sports no sign but has a friendly doorman, has the feel of an
upscale opium den, with elaborately filigreed Chinese screens
separating the rooms and a dark, simple decor. A sushi bar at the
front gives way to a long, classy bar and a room full of small
tables, topped by candles and straight-backed chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage photographs of 1930s geishas hang on the walls, and a
wide range of world music, blues, reggae and salsa plays on the
sound system. By the time we left, around 1:30 a.m., the chairs
were pushed against the wall, the diners were dancing, and a bongo
player accompanied the prerecorded beats.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, the most beautiful and ethnically diverse of any we
had seen thus far, seemed impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who designed this place?'' said a woman at the bar,
conspiratorially. ``Madonna's brother.''
</P>
<P>
   We dipped into two music spots on the south side of the street.
Baktun is a self-described ``multimedia lounge'' featuring ``live
instrumental and electronic music, visual projection installations,
DJs, wordsmiths, live video mixes and ISDN broadcasts.'' Oh yes,
and beer and wine and stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Next door is the Cooler, a well-respected music club, a cool,
converted basement meat locker known for its devotion to live
music, whether it be reggae or rock. The night we went, the Boston
garage band the Lyres ripped into a late-night hourlong set for a
large appreciative crowd, while a few quiet slackers sipped beers
in the back-room bar.
</P>
<P>
   The last stop of the night was the Village Idiot, perhaps the
world's most aptly named bar and a chief cause of hangovers for
college students citywide. We stumbled in at 3 a.m. and immediately
met the owner, Tom McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   He was hard to miss. McNeil, a Santa Claus-size man, was
standing against the bar. Well, leaning against the bar. OK, fallen
against the bar. He was naked from the waist up, hairy from the
shoulders down, and the view from behind was just that. He said he
had just finished a drinking contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy,'' he said, turning to a young man at the bar,
``thought he could beat me at a pint of Guinness.''
</P>
<P>
   Fool.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil scooped his fallen opponent, my younger brother and
myself into an embrace and began gently butting heads with each of
us. ``Who's the oldest?'' he said. ``You're buying the drinks.'' I
broke away to purchase, leaving my brother in the belly of the
beast (almost literally).

 NEW YORK: (almost literally).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Village Idiot, which moved from a smaller location in the
East Village in 1995, has a strict drink-and-be-drunk policy;
teetotalers are frowned upon. The beer-scented bar up front gives
way to an airier back room, which resembles a low-rent German beer
hall. Frat-house decor (beer signs, street signs) and classic
country-and-western are standard fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, college and post-college crowds are a
mainstay, perhaps drawn by nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of school,'' said Jennifer Young, 23, a law
student. ``Undergrad, I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the front, I retrieved my brother and headed out.
When what to our wondering eyes should appear? The jolly McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke not a word but went straight into traffic, hailing a
cab and defying all logic.
</P>
<P>
   But I heard him exclaim as he rode out of sight: ``Don't leave
the bar, and have a good night.''
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon _ please don't ask about the morning _ I set
out to explore the more refined pleasures of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the galleries here are small, some of them offshoots of
larger establishments elsewhere. Still, the geographic
concentration is impressive. The Katzen-Stein Gallery is at 421 W.
14th St., the Cynthia Broad Gallery at No. 423, Long Fine Art at
No. 427. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the block looms Jeffrey, the white-hot clothing and
shoe retailer that opened earlier this year and has label mavens
flocking to it like wildebeests to a water hole. The mood inside is
one of high-end ecstasy: scores of young women clutch Manolo
Blahnik shoes as if they were long-lost children, as young men
stand transfixed by smooth black-leather jackets. All the while a
disk jockey spins tunes, and the register rings. I was scared for
my credit rating.
</P>
<P>
   But as with much of the area, some of the pleasures come in
small, out-of-the-way packages. At Bahay, at 9 Ninth Ave., an
artist, Argie Bucot, creates sleek ceramic plates, vases and bowls
in a studio in the back of the shop. Passerby, a casual cocktail
lounge, sits nearly hidden at the side of Gavin Brown's Gallery on
West 15th Street. And on the always-shadowed south side of
Gansevoort Street, the Gansevoort Gallery deals out antiques and
designer housewares.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer simplicity's sake, it's worth a visit to the Shin Budo
Kai, a martial-arts studio at 425 W. 14th St., a narrow,
well-lighted space where visitors are welcome to watch as
instructors teach wood swordplay and other forms of the art. After
the night I had had _ and the night to come _ I needed a little
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Food in the area breaks pretty much into two camps: meaty and
less so.
</P>
<P>
   In the former are the older places like the Old Homestead, the
venerable steak palace, and the Hog Pit, where barbecue is a
religion. Newer, harder-to-spell joints like Markt, Le Gans, Petite
Abeille, Oriont and Fressen have more varied menus (i.e, vegetables
and such) and more stylish design.
</P>
<P>
   Plunked perfectly in between is Florent, a meatpacking
institution that opened in 1986 and is still the neighborhood's
preferred late-night hangout. Ostensibly the place is French, the
decor is high diner and the food comfortably familiar. I would eat
my last supper (of the weekend) here, and wash it down with a drink
from Hell, a swank SoHo-style lounge down the block.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, I would attempt to go to Markt, heading to that
eight-month-old establishment at 401 W. 14th St. With its windows
open to the street, Markt is breezy and boisterous and Belgian:
mussels and beer are plentiful. On Saturday night at 9:30 there was
a half-hour wait for a table and a half-dozen languages being
spoken at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   My companion, Nina, and I moved on to Rio Mar, a homey Spanish
restaurant farther south on Ninth Avenue, where the streets are
brick and the crowds smaller. No luck here, either: patrons were
packed in tight, chowing on paella and tapas under paint-by-number
portraits of bullfighters mid-dance.
</P>
<P>
   We finally settled at Le Gans, across Gansevoort, a pretty
French bistro with French doors, French posters and a waiter who
spoke with a lilt straight out of ``Casablanca.'' After many
``monsieurs'' and ``madames,'' we headed to the final destination
of the weekend, the big daddy of meatpacking clubs, Mother.
</P>
<P>
   Crouched on the corner of West 14th Street and Greenwich Street,
Mother is host to a rotating series of weekly parties, each geared
to a specific crowd. Of late that has meant the drag revue ``Jackie
60'' on Tuesdays, an all-girl night on Fridays and (you got it)
``Click and Drag,'' home to the cyber-festish gang on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   I had been told about the black-only policy and had dressed
appropriately. But when I approached the front door, I had second
thoughts. There, guarding the entrance, was a man in a translucent
silver cape and reflective sunglasses with his head wrapped in
blinking blue-neon string. He didn't look happy with my attire,
which included a tie with just a tiny, little, itsy-bitsy bit of
gray on it.
</P>
<P>
   His co-gatekeeper let me in. And then things got really odd.
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the door I was met by Abby, the evening's hostess,
who was handing out a promotional freebie, a copy of ``Extreme
Fetish,'' a pornographic monthly that caters to proclivities like
high heels, house paint and ladies' undergarments.
</P>
<P>
   Abby led me through the Versailles Room, populated by sequined
drag queens, a middle-aged man in head-to-toe latex, young women in
fish-net tights and bustiers, and several young men who looked like
would-be Marilyn Mansons.
</P>
<P>
   We entered the darkened back room, where a dozen like-minded
folk danced to highly amplified trance and electronica music while
a projected image of a busty computer-generated sexpot contorted on
an overhead screen.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis at ``Click and Drag'' is on the juncture of
technology and sexuality. But as I peered into the room, I noticed
something: Each of the dancers was dancing alone.
</P>
<P>
   We went downstairs to the Dom Lounge, a sinister-sounding name.
And true enough, what was happening defied expectations: there,
dressed to the nines, or maybe to the Nine Inch Nails, were about a
dozen otherwise normal young men and women . . . playing with
computers!
</P>
<P>
   Dotted around the lounge were four computers, each with fetish
and Goth Web sites at the ready. The lounge also had a bar and a
television showing explicit sexual videos; nobody was paying much
attention to either.
</P>
<P>
   Father Todd, 24, talked me through the scene, even as he chatted
like a proud parent about his Web site, www.sabretooth.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is last refuge of really alternative fashion,'' Todd
said, showing off a female friend's fish nets and her removable
acrylic vampire teeth. ``These people are really eccentric, but
they have day jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the regulars, apparently, was Gekko, a smiley dominatrix,
and Mike the Robot, a young man dressed like a cut-rate cyborg, who
strutted around stiffed-armed, saying things like ``You talkin' to
me?'' in a cheesy ``Lost in Space'' accent.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't scared of his robo-machismo, and the more I talked to
Todd and his black-clad buddies, the more comfortable I felt. These
people, after all, were, well, kind of nerdy. I felt at home.
</P>
<P>
   Like other groups who convene in the meatpacking district, this
one had simply gathered to feel part of a community, to be with
people who like the same music, the same clothes and the same
ideas.

   It was the same ritual that was going on among the bachelor boys

CRYING BABIES CAN BE CALMED
</HEADLINE>
  (For release November 4)  
(rk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When my first child was born, he didn't cry much, for about a
week. Then, he cried nonstop for three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong?'' I asked the doctor plaintively, almost sick
from sleep exhaustion and worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colic,'' he said. And then, ``But I wouldn't worry too much
about the crying. Crying is a baby's job, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   In its own way, that advice was comforting. I stopped believing
I had to make the wailing stop, and started figuring out how to
sleep, eat and get some time for myself away from my crying infant.
</P>
<P>
   But in her just-released book ``Hush Little Baby,'' (Avery
Publishing, $9.95, 192 pages) mother and author Barbara Albers Hill
says a baby's cries communicate a need, and by becoming attuned to
different cries and moods, parents can help their baby while saving
their own sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Her book covers the eight primary reasons babies cry.
</P>
<P>
   Colic, which can result in crying jags of six or more hours, is
the first category. While the sure cause is unknown, it has been
proven that colic isn't a byproduct of a ``nervous'' or
``inexperienced'' mother. Most likely, researchers say, it's the
result of an immature digestive tract.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly seemed to be the case with my baby, who would
pull in his tiny legs and scream, seemingly in response to
cramping. The only thing that worked for us was the ``monkey
hold,'' in which my husband would place Adam's tummy on his hand
and Adam's head on the inside of his folded elbow, with his little
arms and legs hanging loose, and bounce him up and down while
walking around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, parents should try distraction, Hill says, since
screaming leads to gulping in air and makes the colic even worse:
``The longer you can silence your baby's cries, the calmer he will
become. Ultimately, your goal is to ease him into sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of her suggestions: Try simulating the womb with a
completely darkened room, putting on an infant hat and cradling his
head against the bumper of the crib and adding a ticking clock or
tape that mimics a heartbeat. Don't prepare evening meals by the
baby, because cooking smells seem to irritate colic. Massage the
baby's stomach and abdomen, and swaddle the baby. Run the vacuum or
a dehumidifier for white noise, wrap a hot-water bottle in a towel
and put it against the abdomen. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for
products to ease colic. Try music.
</P>
<P>
   Other causes of crying that Hill addresses are overstimulation;
feedings; physical discomfort, such as being chilly, overheated or
having diaper rash; illness; insect stings; or emotions, such as
anger, frustration, stress, or a desire for attention.
</P>
<P>
   She presents concise, common-sense strategies for each, which is
just what scattered, frustrated parents need.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the times when a little crying is a necessary
way to vent emotions, says Hill.
</P>
<P>
   What worked for your first child won't necessarily work for your
second or third, Hill warns.
</P>
<P>
   How do you finally decide on the right tactic to quell each
crying spell?
</P>
<P>
   The oldest method of all, says Hill: ``Trial and error.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ From her vantage point in a basement office at Corpus
Christi Church in upper Manhattan's Morningside Heights, Louise
Basbas has watched the early-music world in New York City expand,
contract and expand again since 1975, when she started the Music
Before 1800 concerts at the church. She has also seen period
instrument performers and their listeners shift their gaze from
medieval and Renaissance music, through the Baroque and Classical
eras and well into the Romantic. And although she has not been
entirely immune to the lure of modernity, she has mostly kept to
the repertory described in the title of her series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a trend for a while of early music creeping up to
Stravinsky,'' said Ms. Basbas, who is also the organist and choir
director at Corpus Christi, a Roman Catholic church. ``And groups
like Anonymous 4 are commissioning new works, as I have also done
over the years, although when I do, I ask that the new work refer
to an early text or melody. But I'd get my hand slapped if I did
too much contemporary music. People come expecting a concert that's
primarily early music.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we have Anner Bylsma and Malcolm Bilson playing
some 19th-century music for cello and fortepiano, and for the
millennium, Harvey Burgett is writing an organ fantasy on the
German hymn `Das Alte Jahr Vergangen Ist' for our Lessons and
Carols program, which will cover 400 years of music, starting with
William Byrd in the 16th century. It's fun to have a little bit of
that mix. But if too much is tilted toward music after 1800, it
becomes a contradiction of what the series is meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Basbas' series, which presents a varied sampling of American
and European early-music groups, as well as two annual concerts by
Corpus Christi's choir, is celebrating its 25th anniversary with
the season that opens on Sunday afternoon with the New York debut
of Musica Pacifica, a Baroque music ensemble from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Few early-music series in New York have been as durable as Music
Before 1800, and those that have been around for as long are either
presented by larger institutions, like the Metropolitan Museum of
Art or the Frick Collection, or are the annual self-produced series
by such tenacious groups as the Ensemble for Early Music, which is
now in its 26th season.
</P>
<P>
   In recent seasons, the Gotham Early Music Foundation has
expanded the field considerably. Ms. Basbas regards Gotham, which
she has described as ``a class act,'' as friendly competition and
noted that one of its founders, Douglas Dunn, had been on the board
of Music Before 1800 for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We collaborated with them on several projects,'' Ms. Basbas
said, ``but their style of doing things is very different from
ours, and we have a much smaller budget, so it was an unequal
relationship that was difficult to work out administratively. But I
think things have settled down. Their commitment is mainly to
cutting-edge early-music groups from Europe, and ours is primarily
to American performers. Also, although Douglas presents concerts
seven days a week, he has avoided having them on Sunday afternoons,
when we have our concerts, so it's a nice and generous
collaboration in that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Basbas came to New York in 1968, after completing her
graduate work in musicology at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. It was a time when New York's early-music world was in
considerable ferment. Noah Greenberg, the founder of the pioneering
New York Pro Musica ensemble, had died in 1966, and members of his
group splintered off to form their own ensembles or to work as
soloists and freelancers. City University had a thriving
early-music program centered around the countertenor Russell
Oberlin, and both Richard Taruskin and Alexander Blachly led
student ensembles at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a wonderful, lively configuration of people,'' Ms.
Basbas said, and for seven years she worked with many of them on
freelance jobs while also holding a job as a church organist in
Riverdale. ``Then I landed the job here at Corpus Christi, and the
pastor thought that having concerts on Sunday afternoons was just
great. So it all came together''
</P>
<P>
   In its first season, Music Before 1800 offered 16 concerts,
mostly by New York ensembles, some with organized rosters (the
Western Wind and Blachly's Pomerium were on that first bill) and
some drawn from what Ms. Basbas called ``an informal collective of
Young Turks in the neighborhood,'' meaning primarily at Columbia
University and on the Upper West Side. ``We didn't even have a
budget. The expenses were minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   Music Before 1800 quickly adopted a more formal structure. In
1978, Ms. Basbas put some distance between the church and the
series by incorporating Music Before 1800 as a separate nonprofit
organization. That made it eligible for government and foundation
support, which it would not have received as part of the church.
</P>
<P>
   As is typical of most performing organizations, about half of
Music Before 1800's budget of less than $100,000 is covered by
ticket sales; the rest comes from private donations and grants from
the New York State Council.
</P>
<P>
   Independence has also made it possible for Music Before 1800 to
present concerts elsewhere; over the years, there have been
occasional forays into Alice Tully Hall, St. Paul's Chapel at
Columbia University, the Church of the Blessed Sacrament and a
downtown art gallery, the Drawing Space. Mostly, though, they
perform at Corpus Christi, in an attractive and not overly
reverberant space that holds an audience of 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, we couldn't have survived financially if I
had to go out from the beginning and rent space,'' Ms. Basbas said.
``We have a rental agreement for Sunday afternoons, to secure the
sanctuary space, but the rest is just a very friendly agreement
with the church.''
</P>
<P>
   But rising administrative costs and performance fees mean that
Music Before 1800 now presents half as many concerts as it did in
its early days. The changing needs of the church that serves as
host to the series have had an effect as well. The sanctuary used
to be available most Sunday afternoons; now there are lectures
during Lent, which covers five Sundays in the heart of a concert
season.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Basbas, diplomatically making a virtue of necessity, said
that an eight-concert season is about right, with perhaps a return
to 10 over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the pattern of starting in October, usually after the
Jewish holidays, and going to April. We avoid the first Sunday in
November, which is the marathon, and we try not to have too many
concerts in the middle of the winter. We were stunned by a blizzard
and a couple of stormy Sundays a few years ago, and although we
didn't have to cancel any concerts, a stormy weekend is something I
lose sleep over when I have a group that might be playing in
Pittsburgh on Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Presenting concerts at the church also has musical
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to a group about programming, my most consistent
request is that they consider that this is very clearly a sacred
space. Profane music is not appropriate. And I discourage
theatrical presentations, because the sightlines in the church are
not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, I don't make programming suggestions. Other places
work differently _ they may have a piece in mind that they want to
hear, and can pay a fee for a group to learn new music. But I defer
to performers' judgment and present what they do the best. I'm more
interested in programs that have been worked on and carefully
developed. I guess that's one reason I enjoy Anonymous 4, Pomerium
and Lionheart so much.''
</P>
<P>
   All three are vocal groups, and all are performing at Music
Before 1800 this season. Anonymous 4, in fact, has just become a
resident ensemble at Corpus Christi. The Clerks' Group, from
England, is to bring another choral program to the series, and
there are the two concerts by Corpus Christi's choir, billed for
these performances as Music Before 1800 Productions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Musica Pacifica's performance and the concert of
19th-century cello works by Bylsma and Bilson, are the only
programs of instrumental music on the series, and although
instrumental groups have been plentiful at Music Before 1800 over
the years, Ms. Basbas prefers this season's balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a particular loyalty to vocal music, partly because
it's the music I work with and enjoy the most,'' Ms. Basbas said.
``But also, I think there are other concert spaces that are more
congenial to instrumental music. Another of the limitations of
Corpus Christi is the size of the ensemble we can have. We've had
small-scale performances of Bach's `St. John Passion,' and years
ago, we even had a chamber production of Handel's `Julius Caesar.'
But if you have more than 15 musicians, they're going to be
crowded, and the sound isn't going to be wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Basbas' programming philosophy seems to be a careful
balancing of her personal preferences with an ear toward stylistic
variety and the tastes of what has become a loyal following.
Concerts with recorders have been a consistent draw, she said, so
she tries to have one every season. This year Musica Pacifica _ a
quintet with recorder, violin, oboe, cello and harpsichord _ fills
that slot. It also meets Ms. Basbas' desire to have a group that
specializes in Baroque works.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Baroque is also represented in a concert by Ms. Basbas' own
Music Before 1800 Productions, built around a rarely heard Passion
setting by Cipriano de Rore from 1557. The concerts by Pomerium and
the Clerks' Group cover interesting corners of the Renaissance
literature, and Bylsma and Bilson press into the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Basbas acknowledges that having a concert series on a Sunday
afternoon in this neighborhood is a challenge in some ways. ``But
we are committed to making Morningside Heights more interesting and
even glamorous to people who don't know it,'' she said. ``Our
latest effort is to have advertising from restaurants and
bookstores in the neighborhood that are open on Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that, is Ms. Basbas not worried by the emergence of
organizations like the Gotham Early Music Foundation, which
presents an expansive season in more centrally located churches and
halls, or the New York Collegium, a new Baroque orchestra that also
draws on the early-music audience? ``Not at all,'' she said. ``A
lively proliferation of concerts is all to the good, as is the
increasing amount of Baroque opera we're seeing now. New York
should be a star place for early-music groups to perform, and it
is. European groups, even more than American groups, are dying to
play here.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, New York is a difficult place for people to
exist as early-music performers. ``Most of the instrumentalists and
singers I work with have day jobs or part-time jobs doing something
entirely different. Maybe if the New York Collegium becomes
established, it will provide a big chunk of work for people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no, we don't want to be the only people in town doing
this. If we were, people would  &UR; really &LR;  think early music was a
small and insignificant part of the music scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Music Before 1800 presents its concerts on Sundays at 4 p.m. at
Corpus Christi Church, 529 W. 121st St., Morningside Heights, (212)
666-9266. Individual tickets are $20; $15 for students and the
elderly. There are also several subscription options. Here is the
Music Before 1800 schedule for this season:

U.S. LAWMAKERS CALL ON MEXICO TO SCRAP CASH CAR-DEPOSIT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of Congress from along the U.S.-Mexico
border urged the Mexican government Thursday to drop a plan to
require people driving into the country beyond 15 miles to leave a
deposit of up to $800 in cash for their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials say the policy, slated to go into effect Nov.
1, is designed to discourage people from selling their
U.S.-registered cars in Mexico, depriving the Mexican government of
taxes paid on car sales. The car deposit would be refunded once a
person leaves Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Mexican Ambassador Jesus Reyes Heroles, the
lawmakers from border districts in California, Arizona, New Mexico
and Texas said the new policy conflicts with the spirit of free
trade between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the motivation to implement this program is to combat
the problem of auto theft along the border and reinforce duties
paid on new vehicles sold in Mexico, we strongly believe that this
will be counterproductive to cooperation between the United States
and Mexico,'' said the letter, written by Reps. Henry Bonilla,
R-Texas, and Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was sent to the Mexican ambassador on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the car-deposit policy, people crossing the border into
Mexico with plans to drive more than 15 miles into the interior
would be required to leave a deposit with Mexican border guards.
The fee would range from $400 for cars produced in 1994 or earlier,
$600 for models from 1995 to 1998 and $800 for cars made this year
or later.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz said the fee will hurt families living in the United
States with relatives in Mexico, many of whom can hardly afford to
travel to Mexico let alone leave a deposit at the border.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plan ``flies in the face of the spirit of free
commerce'' and will discourage trade and investment from the United
States.

   ``North America is supposed to be a free-trade zone, but here we
are with another proposal to bottle up the commerce and travel at
the southern border,'' Ortiz said.

   Ortiz agreed with Mexican officials that many cars are being
illegally imported into Mexico from the United States, or stolen
here, and then improperly sold in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had problems with cars on both sides of the border,''
Ortiz said. But, rather than impose a car deposit, Ortiz said
Mexican and United States law enforcement agencies need to work
together to combat the car problem.

BUMSTEADS VISIT UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BOB ARNDORFER   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Driving a nondescript sport utility vehicle,
one of the world's most famous couples slipped into town Monday for
a leisurely tour of the University of Florida. The Bumsteads did
not draw crowds but their visit was noticed.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening panel of Monday's ``Blondie'' comic strip, the
Bumsteads drive by what local readers immediately recognized as
University Auditorium and Century Tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't the college campus look beautiful right now?'' Blondie
says to Dagwood.
</P>
<P>
   It was meant to be Anywhere U., and the street they're driving
on isn't anatomically correct for UF. But there's no doubt about
the identity of the spired, gabled auditorium standing under the
watchful gaze of the carillon tower. No doubt to locals, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, it turns out, to its creators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ha! Ha!'' Dean Young laughed heartily into the phone from his
studio near Tampa. ``We wondered if anybody would pick up on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, 60, writes the comic strip his late father, Chic Young,
introduced in 1930 and drew until his death in 1973. Dean Young's
partner, Denis Lebrun, illustrates the story lines Young comes up
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a beautiful campus, and I always thought the
University of Florida had a beautiful campus, so I thought, shoot,
let's use it,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we try to disguise things. If people get a chuckle
out of it, then they may think those cartoonists are just having
fun. That's the whole point of doing a comic strip, to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he attended UF ``for a bit,'' laughing and saying
he'd like to leave it at that. ``It was a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   His partner, however, has a more personal connection to UF:
Denis Lebrun's son is a student there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen it yet, but I knew in advance about it,'' said
Devin Lebrun, a junior in electrical engineering from Tampa. ``I
went home to visit last month and my father told me to look for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said ``Blondie'' strips are completed about two months
ahead of the publication date. About three months ago, Denis Lebrun
visited his son in Gainesville. The concept for Monday's strip was
in place and the artist knew what was needed to illustrate it. So
while on campus, his son said, he probably took notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see him drawing anything while he was here, but he
might have sketched something,'' he said. ``Or he might have just
taken some mental pictures. He's really good at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sly detail in Monday's strip is in the middle panel. The
building the ageless Bumsteads drive by is identified in a sign as
``Engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   The young Lebrun isn't among the students shown walking by the
building. It's been a few years, he said, since his dad put him in
the funny papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the strip a couple of times,'' said Lebrun, who
turns 20 on Nov. 6. ``I had long hair then, and was shown in my
high school letter jacket. That was kind of neat. I have one of
them framed upstairs in my room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's my stepsister's turn,'' he said. ``Her name is
Courtney, and that's the name of Alexander's girlfriend now.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Young said, his old letter sweater from Van Nuys
High in California makes an appearance. And he thinks he probably
has a shirt in a closet somewhere like Dagwood's, the one with the
curious circle on the tummy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dagwood is like my alter ego,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   UF President John Lombardi said he wasn't surprised that UF
appeared in ``Blondie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course,'' he said, ``anyone who wants a world-class
background would think to put it at the University of Florida.''

 &HT;    BILLIONS OF BITS OF INFORMATION MAKE A WEATHER FORECAST
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most days Louis Uccellini enjoys reading the
columns of Washington Post sportswriter and humorist Tony
Kornheiser.
</P>
<P>
   But the thought of one Kornheiser column _ devoted to an
unforecast Washington snowstorm last March that caught morning
commuters on the capital's expressways _ causes Uccellini to grit
his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Uccellini is director of the National Center for Environmental
Prediction, which includes the National Weather Service. After the
service predicted with some confidence that Washington was in for a
snowstorm beginning sometime in the afternoon that day, he arrived
at his office early. At around 7 a.m., he opened the blinds.
</P>
<P>
   He saw heavy snow falling on the parking lot and said to
himself, ``We're going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Television meteorologists had used data and analysis from
Uccellini's weather service to assure thousands of trusting
Washington commuters that they could expect a ``dusting'' of rush
hour snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always remember the times we miss it,'' Uccellini said.
</P>
<P>
   The indignant Kornheiser declared in his column that ``a baboon
in a leisure suit'' could have done as well on the weather
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, nothing to it.
</P>
<P>
   Just divide the surface of the Earth into 1.4 million squares,
each about 12 miles on a side, then divide the atmosphere into 70
layers, so that each square becomes the bottom of a stack of 70
thin blocks of air, around 100 million blocks altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Put in numbers for temperature, pressure and humidity for each
block _ or for as many blocks as you can obtain data. Change all
the numbers every few minutes and figure out what the combined
effect will be as the air iblock expands or contracts, heats
up or cools down, rises or falls, takes on moisture or releases it.
</P>
<P>
   Although several billion dollars worth of new satellites,
computers, ocean buoys and software have dramatically enhanced the
Weather Service's forecasting skills in the past five years, the
resolution of the system is not fine enough to forecast snowstorms,
Uccellini said.
</P>
<P>
   If the blocks were smaller and computers powerful enough to
handle the calculations, forecast confidence would rise
accordingly. But improving the resolution to squares one mile on a
side, rather than 12, would increase the total number of blocks by
a factor of 144. Computers would have to keep a running computation
of interlocked conditions within something like 14 billion blocks
of air, rather than 100 million.
</P>
<P>
   But while the resolution is too coarse to forecast individual
snowstorms with great confidence, the center's predictions for
overall weather conditions this winter, issued last week, have a
confidence level of about 70 to 80 percent, Uccellini said.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonal forecast began with conditions in the Pacific
Ocean, along the Equator.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of these equatorial waters _ described in the
now-familiar terms ``El Nino,'' for years when the water is warm,
and ``La Nina,'' for years when it is cooler than average _ sets in
motion the circumstances that eventually define seasonal outlines
of winter weather in the United States, said National Weather
Service meteorologist Gerald Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Using reading from satellites, a network of buoys and ships at
sea, the Weather Service modelers plug in the temperature of the
water, both at the surface and for several feet down.
</P>
<P>
   Bell described the links between Pacific water and weather in
the United States in terms of the transport of heat.
</P>
<P>
   During El Nino, the warm ocean surface sends towers of water
vapor rising all along the Equator, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vapor condenses as it rises, releasing heat, which generates
thunderstorms that cool the lower atmosphere while they heat the
upper atmosphere. The cooler air near the surface attracts more
heat from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Along a zone of ocean that reaches more than halfway around the
planet, the water and the air become a huge machine to pump heat
upward.
</P>
<P>
   As it warms, air in the upper atmosphere above the Equator
expands, generating high-altitude north-south winds. As these winds
are caught by the rotation of the Earth, they feed into a
west-to-east jet stream that flows from Asia to the west coast of
North America.
</P>
<P>
   Thus reinforced, the jet stream brings cold and wet weather to
California and pulls warmer, moist air over the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the second winter in a row, the meteorologists
expect to see the opposite conditions, ``La Nina.'' Except for the
region around Indonesia, on the western side of the Pacific, the
water will almost certainly be cooler than normal this year,
meteorologists say.
</P>
<P>
   With cooler-than-normal water during the Northern Hemispheric
winter, thunderstorm activity over the ocean will be at a minimum,
so there will be less transfer of heat to the upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no El Nino winds from the tropics. Relatively
motionless air over the Pacific Ocean west of California will
develop into ocean storms and high pressure in that portion of the
upper atmosphere, the computers indicate. The storms and pressure
will deflect the jet stream northward.
</P>
<P>
   From Alaska, it will swoop down across western Canada, bringing
cool air into the Midwest and Ohio Valley before turning back to
the northeast, pulling warm air up through Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama and Georgia, Uccellini said at a press conference last
week. The U-shaped jet stream path across the continent will
generally define overall winter conditions in the United States,
Uccellini said.
</P>
<P>
   There are still ``wild cards,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The North Atlantic Oscillation is one. Like the El Nino-La Nina
shifts over the equatorial Pacific Ocean, the temperature of water
in the North Atlantic periodically swings from below normal to
above normal and back again.
</P>
<P>
   The changes influence a portion of the jet stream that flows
from the eastern United States to Europe. And interactions between
the Atlantic jet stream and the Pacific jet stream can change La
Nina winters in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995-1996, a La Nina winter was cold and snowy across the
eastern United States, for example. Last year, also a La Nina year,
the same region had a mild winter.
</P>
<P>
   Opposite phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation were a major
factor in the difference, Uccellini said. So far, there is no clear
signal from the North Atlantic for the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Code breakers and weather forecasters are the two largest
markets for mathematicians in the government,'' Uccellini observed.
``What we do is very mathematically based. We're getting much
better, but we'll never be perfect, no matter how good we get.''

TIBETAN SPLENDOR, BOTH SACRED AND SECULAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tibetan Buddhist art is like no other art. It burns with a
sharp, nervy incandescence, like a fire generously stoked but
tightly contained. The most comprehensive gathering of such
material in the West belongs to the Newark Museum. This fall an
unprecedented amount of that work is on view as the museum
celebrates its 90th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   How did Tibet come to New Jersey? By chance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, the year after the museum opened, one of its founding
trustees, Edward N. Crane, was on a ship bound for the United
States from Japan. Among his fellow passengers was a medical
missionary named Albert L. Shelton, returning from a six-year stint
in China and eastern Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The two men got talking, and Crane learned of _ maybe even saw _
the trove of Tibetan art objects, sacred and secular, that Shelton
was carrying in trunks and crates back to America. They included
liturgical vessels, religious paintings, ceremonial robes, jewelry,
weapons and carpets, some received as gifts, others salvaged from a
country beset by local wars and invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Crane quickly proposed that the exotic material make its Western
debut at the Newark Museum the following year. The exhibition
turned out to be a blockbuster, pulling a crowd of nearly 18,000
people within months. When Crane died after it closed, his family
bought the material from Shelton and donated it to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Newark has added to this core collection and has been hugely
fortunate in the specialists who have overseen its care. The
present curator of Asian art, Valrae Reynolds, has been with the
museum for nearly 30 years, and she is the organizer of the
splendid exhibition ``From the Sacred Realm: Treasures of Tibetan
Art in the Collection of the Newark Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is in two parts. One is a temporary display of mostly
secular materials in the first-floor special exhibitions galleries,
including a full-size embroidered tent too large to be shown
ordinarily. Religious art fills the refurbished permanent Tibetan
galleries upstairs, which incorporate a Buddhist altar consecrated
by the Dalai Lama in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism was the igniting spark for most of the art on view.
Legend has it that a seventh-century ruler was converted to the
faith by two of his wives, one Nepalese, the other Chinese.
Certainly the religion, which originated in India, took on a
distinctive character in Tibet, a blend of exacting intellectualism
and straight-from-the-gut emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Monasteries sprang up; one sees a fanciful vision of the very
first of them, Samye, in a 19th-century cloth painting or thangka.
Monks transcribed and preserved sacred texts, and artists brought
visual pizazz to minutely detailed cosmic systems, as in a painting
titled ``Wheel of Existence,'' where the stages of earthly life are
conceived as slices of a big, flat pie being nibbled away by a
voracious demon.
</P>
<P>
   Always central to the religion were the holy men called lamas.
Some, like the near-mythical Atisha (982-1054 A.D.), came from
India: he is seen as a gilded copper statuette wearing a pointed
Tibetan cap with aviator-style flaps. Eventually, Tibet produced
its own religious figures who also became the country's temporal
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   This tradition of religious leadership has lent Tibet a rosy
Shangri-La glow in the West, though the society was, on certain
counts, an unenlightened one: a feudal hierarchy controlled by a
powerful ruling class. When the Chinese Communists invaded in 1959
on the pretext of dismantling a repressive elitist system, their
stated intentions, though not their imperialist motives, made some
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, China has relentlessly ground Tibet's material
culture, as well as a large segment of its population, into dust.
But at Newark one can still get a sense of its original splendor.
In the secular items documenting various strata of society _
nomadic farmers and traders, urban officials and the aristocracy _
cosmopolitan flair prevails.
</P>
<P>
   A nomad woman's layered ensemble made in Labrang in the rural
northeast around 1930, for example, includes a silk robe lined with
sheepskin, a headdress studded with glinting Chinese coins and a
pair of smart Russian leather boots. A New Year costume belonging
to a male government official in the capital city, Lhasa, consists
of a blouse, sash, shawl and ruffled skirt incorporating fabrics
from India, Japan, and France.
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry comes in all shapes and sizes; even a brass milk pail
hook for a woman's belt is a chunky, turquoise-studded
tour-de-force. Furniture is lean and portable but intensely
ornamented, as in the case of a wood cabinet with painted narrative
panels influenced by Mughal miniatures.
</P>
<P>
   Certain luxury items have religious functions. Such is the case
with a hand-held prayer wheel of chased silver encrusted with
rubies, and a small arched, boxlike shrine meant to be strapped to
the body. Made of sheets of embossed silver and packed with amulets
and relics, it insured that the wearer was in constant intimate
contact with the divine.
</P>
<P>
   Such contact is the overarching theme of the third-floor
galleries, which will remain much as they are now for the next year
or so. The altar is the focus, with its vivid vermilion and yellow
walls (painted by the contemporary artist Phuntsok Dorjthe), and
its surrounding complement of ritual utensils and paintings,
including two matching images of the belligerent protective deity
Mahakala, one flame red, the other midnight blue.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of saints and holy men hang next door. One of them is
the-14th century sage Tsongkhapa, who founded the Gelugpa order of
Buddhism. He is depicted, larger than life-size, in an appliqued
collage of folded and pleated swatches of goldish silk here and
there stuffed with cotton batting so that certain features _ the
nose and hands _ swell out softly like flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Ecclesiastical garments made of similarly refined materials are
also on view: a monastic regent's cape, made in 1875, of imperial
yellow Chinese silk embroidered with peacock feather threads is a
stellar attraction. Old and fragile as it is, it looks dry-cleaner
fresh, attesting to the reverential TLC awarded in Tibet to items
with prestigious associations.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to religious art, the value of an object often
derives less from its physical form than from its history: where it
has resided, what ceremonies it has been involved in, who has seen
it or handled it. In many cases, though, it would be difficult to
separate spiritual content from esthetic form.
</P>
<P>
   An icon of Yamantaka Vajrabhairava, Conqueror of Death, has been
the object of rapt attention since it was cast centuries ago,
thanks in part to its impressive size and its eruption of dozens of
bristling, whiplash arms. A magnificent, flame-shaped silver Wheel
of the Law, with low-relief rays shaped like linked diamonds, has
long since crushed the base it rests on, though whether through the
sheer physical weight of the precious metal, or through an amassing
of centuries of psychic energy is impossible to say.
</P>
<P>
   The object's charisma is enhanced by the fact that it was the
centerpiece of Shelton's pioneering horde. Did he pull the piece
from a trunk, dazzling Edward Crane and convincing him that an
exhibition of Tibetan art in Newark would fly?
</P>
<P>
   There is no way of knowing. But there is also no question that
Tibetan art is still flying high at the Newark Museum nine decades
later, sending out its lambent, penetrating rays from a magnetic
source.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by moisture streaming northward from the Gulf of Mexico,
moderate to heavy rains will develop across the southern Plains
later Friday. A compact but potent jet stream disturbance arriving
from the southern Rockies on Friday night will act as a spark,
igniting the fuel and setting the stage for an inch or more of rain
by Saturday morning in parts of northern Texas, Oklahoma and
eastern Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Before these rains materialize, scattered showers will develop
near a cool front across the Middle West, the upper Mississippi
Valley and the western Great Lakes. But these showers will pale in
comparison to the heavier rains slated for the southern Plains on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain and high winds will lash the coast of British
Columbia on Friday as a potent disturbance arrives from the
Pacific. Though British Columbia will take the brunt of the
disturbance, moderate to heavy rains are possible in the Olympics
of northwestern Washington, where moist Pacific air is forced to
ascend the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, warm weather will bathe the southern California
coast as offshore breezes associated with a high pressure system
over the Great Basin keep cool Pacific air at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, warm weather will embrace much of the East from the
Deep South to the Ohio Valley, southern Great Lakes and Middle
Atlantic states as a warm ridge of high pressure holds steady over
the region. In the Northeast, a chilly early morning will be
followed by a milder afternoon as the ridge slowly builds
northward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Meaningful Rain &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first meaningful rain in 201 days fell Wednesday at
Sacramento, Calif., with a modest 0.13 inches measured at the
airport. The last time meaningful rain fell in Sacramento occurred
on April 19, when 0.19 inches fell. The 201-day period marked the
city's fourth longest spell without at least one-tenth of an inch
of rain. Moreover, Wednesday's rain brought to an end the city's
144-consecutive day streak without any measurable rain. The jet
stream, which migrates north over Canada during the warm season,
shifted south this week, steering a wet Pacific disturbance ashore.

BUDGET TUG OF WAR CENTERS ON TALE OF MISSING TUGBOATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Tenn.) (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In trying to nudge the public toward supporting
their idea of an across-the-board spending cut to balance the
budget, House Republicans have employed a tugboat. Two of them, as
a matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've lost two tugboats,'' House GOP Whip Tom DeLay of Texas
declared in amazement on national television Sunday, citing missing
Navy vessels as examples of waste that could easily be eliminated
to provide the necessary savings. ``My goodness. How in the world
can you lose a tugboat? It is bigger than a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, it could be DeLay and others who missed the boat. The
Pentagonhe Navy tugs were never missing though some
paperwork accounting for them was. According to the Navy, one of
the boats was scrapped, another sunk in an exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't lose the boats,'' said exasperated Pentagon
spokeswoman Susan Hansen, who has built a file and spent months
trying to debunk the myth of the missing boats. ``We just didn't
have the records on the things.''
</P>
<P>
   The missing harbor tugs first made headlines in March 1998 when
an agencywide audit turned up egregious examples of government
waste and put the Defense Department in the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   Priced between $583,000 and $875,000 each, the financial loss of
the tugboats and several other spectacular assets outraged
government watchdog groups as well as Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.,
chairman of the Senate Government Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Pentagon dug deeper, it found records for the
boats. And that is not all it found. Also located was an Avenger
surface-to-air rocket launcher that was tagged with the wrong
serial number and couldn't be traced at the time of the audit _
another piece of missing hardware cited by Republicans. Two hundred
cruise missiles listed as lost had been destroyed in compliance
with a treaty with the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the superheated political climate on Capitol Hill,
Republicans seized on the story of the tugs as a metaphor for
government waste. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, showed a picture on
the House floor Tuesday night of the tugs, offering a reward for
their safe return.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cannot be found,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When told the Pentagon said the boats were not lost, Sessions
spokesman Adrian Plesha said the department was still in error by
failing to account for the boats at the time of the audit and
losing countless other assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about the tugboats,'' Plesha said. ``In every
federal department and agency it's easy to find waste, fraud and
abuse and these are just larger examples of this.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, DeLay conceded the tugboats had been located. But
he credited the GOP focus on the subject with motivating the
Pentagon into quickly determining their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went to work under the pressure of getting their budget
cut and the pressure put on by the Republican Congress and today we
have great news that the tugboats have been found,'' DeLay told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart was not amused, accusing the
GOP of ratcheting up the rhetoric. He compared the Republican
tugboat claim to saying ``you won't be able to find your house if
you can't find the deed ... I think it's time for them to get
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Sticking up for the Pentagon, Lockhart suggested lawmakers
themselves don't always run a tight ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could find, probably, equipment that has been lost by
senators and congressmen,'' he said. ``I don't think that would be
too much of a stretch.''

RICKY RUDD'S STREAK ON THE LINE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Ricky Rudd, the countdown is on, and it is almost at zero.
</P>
<P>
   As the Winston Cup circuit heads for Phoenix, Ariz., Rudd has
three races left to keep the longest winning streak in the series
alive.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 16 years, Rudd has won at least once every season.
Closest to him is Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who has already won in 1999, has at least one victory
for 14 straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt had a run of 15 straight winning campaigns broken
in 1997 and Mark Martin has won 10 of the last 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   If Rudd can keep the streak intact, he stands a good chance of
extending it.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, who owns his own team, is selling his equipment and moving
to Robert Yates nex where he will replace Kenny Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Yates has one of the strongest teams in the sport, while Rudd,
who had to shut down his operation when his primary sponsor, Tide,
deserted him, has been scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   But he has scrambled before. In 1995, Rudd was winless with two
races remaining and snatched a victory at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he's supposed to have one of Yates' engines for the
Phoenix race on Nov. 7, which will give him a boost. Running a
Yates engine for the first time at Talladega, Rudd qualified second
and finished third, his best overall '99 effort.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd says he has not thought too much about the final three
races, but he has thought about his streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though our team and ownership days are winding down, my
biggest thoughts are on we need to win,'' Rudd said. ``I'd like to
go out of the sport with the win streak from day one as an owner
until the last day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be able to say we were able to win a race every
season. There's not many owners who can make that claim,'' Rudd
said. ``It might not happen, but we're giving it 120 percent trying
to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a Yates engine could give Rudd the edge he needs. Over
the last two years in particular, Rudd has made several changes at
the top of his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gearing up for an auction right now that will be
Thanksgiving weekend,'' Rudd said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were three people interested in buying his team.
``if they can come up with the money before the auction, then we
can work something out, but I'm looking forward to closing this
chapter and starting a new one,'' Rudd said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's a race to win.

PLANE CRASHES MAKE FREQUENT-FLYING ATHLETES THINK TWICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROSS McKEON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ As professional athletes, flying is simply
part of the job. There is no room for fear or apprehension when it
comes to stepping aboard and putting your complete trust in pilots
and an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, when an accident occurs, as with the crash of
plane carrying golfer Payne Stewart and five other people on
Monday, players take notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really sit back and think about it until you hear
something as terrible as this,'' said Ron Sutter of the San Jose
Sharks, a National Hockey League team. ``Then it makes you think.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutter has appeared in more than 1,000 regular-season National
Hockey League games, as have several of his teammates, including
Murray Craven, Vincent Damphousse and Bob Rouse. That's a lifetime
of flying for each. Between the exhibition and regular season, the
Sharks are scheduled to make 68 flights this season alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we use a good, reliable company,'' said Mike Vernon,
who admitted he thinks about the risks of flying more now that he
has a wife and children. ``Those things can happen. You just hope
it's not your day, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon spent the first 14 years of his career with Calgary and
Detroit. Since most of the air travel he's experienced is in the
dead of winter, Vernon recalls more than a couple of scary moments.
</P>
<P>
   Once he was aboard a plane struck by lightning. Another time
high winds forced a flight he was on to make three attempts at
landing in Chicago before finally touching down safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so bad, we were tossing and turning. That was probably
the worst flight we've ever been on,'' Vernon said. ``We had good
pilots and all, but it was a scary scenario. ... I seriously
thought we were maybe going to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven, meanwhile, is looking forward to the day he gets a
pilot's license because flying a small plane is a goal he wants to
pursue. On Monday, Craven was driving his small Porsche to practice
when a cement truck traveling alongside was forced to lock up its
breaks after a third vehicle cut him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to the rink, after hearing about Payne Stewart and guys
are asking, `Do you still want to be a pilot?''' Craven said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I could have been killed on that highway just as easily.
That truck would have demolished my car.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Woodcock recalled a time _ early in his 33 years as an NHL
trainer _ when the St. Louis Blues were taking a flight from
Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Minnesota. Shortly after liftoff, a flock of
birds flew into one of the plane's engines and forced an emergency
landing. Once a runway was covered with foam, the plane returned to
Winnipeg and landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotty Bowman was the coach there then,'' said Woodcock, the
Sharks' athletic trainer, ``and as soon as we get on the ground he
says, `We're taking the train.'''

 &HT;    VENDING MACHINES WILL OFFER MORE PRODUCTS
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Financial (f) categories

   WASHINGTON -- Aluminum cans of film from a vending machine?
Cameras? T-shirts? It's coming.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of new products and technological advances by vending,
office coffee service and food service providers are the highlights
of this weekend's National Automatic Merchandising Association
National Expo.
</P>
<P>
   The last decade has experienced an explosion of product
offerings from vending machines, said Bill Hurley, NAMA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   While soft drink, candy and snack machines still make up the
bulk of the market, non-traditional items, such as microwaveable
frozen food and bottled water, appear to be the ``next big thing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting creative,'' Hurley said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley said the industry is excited about the upcoming release
of the new dollar coin by the U.S. Mint in March, expecting it to
spur sales.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of gourmet coffee drinks have also increased
vending opportunities, he said. Newer coffee machines can grind
beans while you wait.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology highlights include refrigerated machines with
backup systems for power failures. Insulated machines were created
partially to put candy machines outdoors, said Robert Mara, a Mars
Inc., spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else can you get a Snickers bar that doesn't melt in the
summer?'' Mara said.
</P>
<P>
   Other machines come equipped with a device that won't let it
take your money without giving you the item you paid for. Some
machines can accept credit cards, an ideal option for more
expensive vending items, said Mike Lawlor, a spokesman for USA
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can take vending to another level,'' he said.

`WOMEN': MORE FEMALES ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Women'' (``Elles''), a sensuous but overstuffed soap opera
about women of a certain age confronting the usual insecurities,
offers one solution to the problem of how to cram five personal
dramas into the same movie. You hang them on the transparently
mechanical premise that one of the five characters is a television
personality preparing a documentary in which she asks her friends
what they would do if they had three wishes.
</P>
<P>
   It helps some that the journalist, Linda, is played by Carmen
Maura, a Pedro Almodovar favorite who sashays through the film with
a leonine authority and curses up a storm when betrayed. Ms. Maura
heads a formidable international cast that includes Miou-Miou,
Marisa Berenson, Marthe Keller, and Guesch Patti. The movie's
international crosscurrents (it was filmed in Lisbon by the
Portuguese director Luis Galvao Teles) lend it the slightly
baffling flavor of a French comedy seasoned with Iberian melodrama:
Rohmer crossed with Almodovar, but on a much lower artistic plane.
</P>
<P>
   Although the characters' problems include rebellious children,
ill health and unfaithful husbands, all five suffer from
40-something jitters about encroaching age and diminishing sex
appeal. Linda is so busy with her career that she takes her
reasonably happy marriage to her husband, Gigi (Joaquim de
Almeida), far too much for granted and barely notices at first when
he acquires a much younger girlfriend (Mapi Galan). Branca (Ms.
Patti), a narcissistic age-obsessed actress, singer and eternal
gamine, compulsively takes lovers right and left while ignoring her
troubled, resentful grown-up daughter, Tiago (Florence Loiret), who
turns to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Eva (Miou-Miou), a widowed university teacher, throws herself
headlong into an affair with Luis (Morgan Perez), a student 25
years her junior and the son of Barbara (Ms. Keller), a recently
divorced caterer who is still in love with her ex-husband, Edgar
(Didier Flamand). The most enigmatic and least credible of the five
women is Chloe (Marisa Berenson), a bisexual beautician and former
heroin addict who mopes through much of the movie and seems more
like a connecting device than a real person.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the personal dramas add up. But Miou-Miou as a lonely,
anxious teacher surrendering her heart to a besotted student who
happens to be a friend's son, then recoiling from him, strikes a
poignant note. So does Ms. Keller's Barbara, a hypochondriac who
flies into a panic when she begins having headaches and fainting
spells, and learns from her ex-husband, an ophthalmologist, that
she is indeed gravely ill.
</P>
<P>
   As seriously as it takes its characters ``Women,'' is so
determinedly upbeat that it subscribes to a phony quick-fix
mentality about several of their problems. It's really an upscale
version of the instant solutions to crises broadcast on daytime
television.
</P>
<P>
   But can a big hug and a promise to care more and do better
really turn around the bitterest of relationships? Like a soap
opera, ``Women'' ends with a wedding (of Barbara's daughter) at
which everyone is momentarily misty-eyed and forgiving. If only
life were that simple.

Supervisor is Lynn Hoogenboom. (888-346-9867).

   SPEND-CONGRESS (Washington) _ The House on Thursday will pass in
a party-line vote the last spending bill of the year, an $85
billion measure for health and education programs, along with a
nearly 1 percent across-the-board cut in federal spending.
President Clinton says he will veto the budget cut and the spending
bill, setting the stage for the final act in this year's budget
battle _ negotiations between the White House and Congress that
will go into high gear next week. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   ORE-SUICIDE (Portland, Ore.) _ Oregonians pride themselves on
being in the forefront on social issues. Five years ago, they
passionately debated and narrowly approved a measure making theirs
the first state in the country, and one of the few places in the
world, to allow physician-assisted suicide. And now, a day after
the U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure that would
effectively overturn the Oregon law and thus amounts to an
extraordinary rebuke of a single state, many people here said they
were deeply angry over federal interference in the issue. By Sam
Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   FRISCO-MAYOR (San Francisco) _ Mayors all over the country are
sailing the friendly waters of prosperity. But despite a booming
economy, low unemployment and plunging crime rates that mirror the
trend across the nation, voters in politically obsessed San
Francisco are not happy. San Franciscans are notoriously hard to
please, ousting the last two mayors after single terms, but Willie
Lewis Brown Jr., who entered office as Mr. San Francisco, as
colorful and irrepressible as the city considers itself, has
disappointed voters on all sides. By Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-DEBATE (Hanover, N.H.) _ Though he won't be standing side
by side with the other Republican candidates for president, George
W. Bush will still make his presence known in New Hampshire with a
live interview with the TV station sponsoring the debate two hours
before it begins. While the interview will give him an opportunity
to make his own pitch to New Hampshire voters, it won't spare him
the barbs and accusations of the other contenders who feel that
Bush is snubbing them. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Economic growth surged 4.8 percent in
the third quarter, higher than expected and the fastest pace this
year, as companies built up inventories and exports strengthened.
While the pace of growth raises the prospects of another increase
in interest rates by the Fed, other data showed inflationary
pressures remarkably tame. The Labor Department's Employment Cost
Index rose just 0.8 percent in the quarter following a 1.1 percent
second-quarter gain, which was the biggest in eight years. And the
GDP price deflator grew at a 0.9 percent pace in the third quarter,
down from a 1.4 percent rate the previous quarter. Stock and bond
prices surge in early trading after the reports. By Louis
Uchitelle.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ From his perch inside a glass
skyscraper, antonio pinho, vice president of exploration and
production for Texaco's Brazilian subsidiary, Texaco do Brasil, has
a panoramic view of the cube-shaped monolith that houses
state-owned oil company Petrobras.
 &HT;    But Pinho, a slight and bespectacled former geologist who's been
with Texaco for 25 years, no longer has to peer out his window at
his neighboring competitor, wondering what its next move will be.
Texaco and Petrobras recently became partners in their search for
new oil deposits, and Pinho is confident that the partnership will
greatly boost the U.S. firm's own maturing reserves. ``The name of
the game is building potential reserves to provide the revenues
your shareholders want,'' he says.
 &HT;    His self-assurance is reflected by Texaco's investing more
capital to enter Brazil's exploration and production sector than
any other company since the government ended the half-century-long
Petrobras monopoly two years ago.
 &HT;    Texaco was the leader of a consortium _ also involving Petrobras
_ that will spend an initial US$1.2 billion to develop the
deepwater Frade field where Petrobras has already discovered oil.
The Frade field is located in the Campos Basin, Brazil's largest
oil-producing region, which accounts for 75 percent of the
country's output and boasts some of the world's highest offshore
production rates. Frade, to be Texaco-operated, is expected to
produce 100,000 barrels of oil per day by 2003, nearly 10 percent
of Brazil's current oil output and just over 10 percent of Texaco's
current worldwide output.
 &HT;    The Frade field is in the yet-undrilled offshore area closest to
Petrobras's most recent major discovery _ the Roncador ``giant''
field in the Campos Basin with an estimated 2.7 billion barrels of
reserves. And Roncador isn't far from the Campos Basin's other two
biggest-producing fields, Marlim and Barracuda, both of which were
discovered in 1985.
 &HT;    Pinho says that oil companies constantly weigh risk versus
investment. But he adds that Texaco has committed a sizable amount
of capital in Brazil because discoveries of giant fields like
Roncador greatly decrease risk. ``There aren't many Roncadors,
Marlims and Barracudas discovered within such a relatively short
time period in any world [geological basin,'' he says.
 &HT;    Texaco's faith in the Campos Basin also led the U.S. major to
join an Exxon-led consortium _ also involving Petrobras _ that will
invest an initial $1.5 billion to develop the basin's East Albacore
deepwater field, where Petrobras has also found oil. East Albacore
is expected to produce 13 percent of Brazil's current output by
2003.
 &HT;    Another Texaco-led consortium has also formed a partnership with
Petrobras that will invest an initial $50 million to explore for
oil _ as opposed to developing already-discovered finds _ in
another Campos Basin deepwater area near Roncador. And in mid-June,
Texaco won the right to explore for oil independently in two areas,
and as a member of a consortium in one other area, as part of the
government's first-ever exploration-and-production licensing round
of 12 other deepwater areas not belonging to Petrobras.
 &HT;    Texaco is not alone in committing large sums to Brazil. Aside
from leading the consortium that will spend $1.5 billion to develop
the East Albacore field, Exxon formed a partnership with Petrobras
to explore for oil in two other offshore basins and won first
licensing-round bids to independently _ or as part of a consortium
_ explore for oil in two other offshore areas.
 &HT;    None of the world's other major oil companies have decided to
invest anywhere near the amounts that Texaco and Exxon have
committed. Mobil has made only modest exploration investments via
partnerships with Petrobras. Shell, a minority partner in the
Exxon-led consortium that will work the East Albacore field, was
also a minority member in one consortium that placed a winning $7
million bid for a first licensing off the coast of northern Brazil.
``We looked at the areas in terms of risk versus investment and, as
such, most of the areas being auctioned off weren't that
attractive,'' explains David Pirret, president of Shell Brasil.
 &HT;    Oil-sector analysts believe that Texaco has found Brazil's
deepwater acreage far more attractive because of the company's
pressing need to build reserves. While Texaco has invested heavily
in exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa
and the United Kingdom, many of its Gulf of Mexico fields are
reaching maturity.
 &HT;    ``Texaco's oil production has grown at a rate of 2 percent per
year over the last five years, which has been in line with other
major oil companies,'' says Douglas Terreson, Houston-based
international oil analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
``However, an important focus for Texaco has been in North America,
where the maturing nature of the region has forced Texaco to look
elsewhere _ to Brazil, in particular.''
 &HT;    Terreson adds that Brazil is particularly attractive to Texaco
because both it and partner Petrobras have developed deepwater
technological expertise. So far, Texaco is investing only in
deepwater Brazilian fields. Texaco coordinates the Gulf of Mexico
``Deepstar'' project that has pioneered technologies that can be
applied to deepwater exploration and production in Brazil, Nigeria
and the UK. Petrobras itself holds two deepwater world records _
for the deepest producing well at 1,855 meters and the deepest
exploratory well at over 2,300 meters. Exxon also touted Petrobras'
being a ``leader in deepwater [exploration and production
activity'' as one reason for its partnerships with the Brazilian
oil company.
 &HT;    James Clark, a New York-based oil analyst with investment firm
Credit Suisse First Boston, says another reason for Texaco's
interest in Brazil was its ``huge market'' and ``huge growth
opportunities downstream.'' Indeed, Texaco's Pinho agrees that
Brazil's considerable rate of oil consumption _ at 1.8 million
barrels of oil per day _ made it the best local market to sell oil
from Texaco's activities here.
 &HT;    But Nelson Ribas, Texaco do Brasil's vice president in charge of
marketing combustion fuels, says that Texaco's major stake in the
oil product distribution market was another reason for the firm's
substantial investments. Texaco gas stations account for 13.8
percent of the Brazilian market, with Petrobras, Exxon, Shell and
Ipiranga, a local distributor, accounting for the remainder.
 &HT;    ``Texaco's having administrative infrastructure already in place
for its oil product distribution activities means that we can and
will use that existing back office,'' Ribas says. ``This synergy
reduces our overall upstream/downstream costs and makes undertaking
E&AMP;P activities here more attractive.''
 &HT;    Texaco also plans to use the natural gas it finds in offshore
Brazilian areas to supply a $160 million thermoelectric plant it
plans to build in partnership with Petrobras and steelmaker
Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) in northern Ceara state by
2001. Texaco's stake in the plant further verticalizes its
participation in the Brazilian energy matrix.

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brasil _ Desde su oficina en un rascacielos de
vidrio y acero, Antonio Pinho, vicepresidente de exploracion y
produccion de la filial brasilena de Texaco, Texaco do Brasil,
observa el cubo monolitico que sirve de sede a la estatal
Petrobras.
 &HT;    Pero Pinho, un ex geologo delgado, que usa lentes y que trabaja
para Texaco desde hace 25 anos, ya no tiene que mirar por la
ventana hacia su competidor para preguntarse cual sera su proxima
decision. Texaco y Petrobras se aliaron recientemente para buscar
nuevos depositos de petroleo, y Pinho confia en que la union sera
positiva para las ya maduras reservas del gigante petrolero
estadounidense. ``Aqui la clave es encontrar reservas potenciales
para generar los ingresos que los accionistas esperan,'' afirma
Pinho.
 &HT;    Y esta seguridad se refleja en la decision de Texaco de invertir
mas capital en el sector brasileno de exploracion y produccion de
petroleo que cualquier otra empresa desde que el gobierno elimino
hace dos anos el monopolio que Petrobras tuvo durante casi medio
siglo.
 &HT;    Texaco fue el lider de un consorcio (en el que tambien participo
Petrobras) que invertira inicialmente US$1.200 millones en explotar
el campo submarino de Frade, donde Petrobras ya descubrio oro
negro. Frade esta ubicado en la Cuenca de Campos, la principal
region petrolera de Brasil, que genera el 75 por ciento de la
produccion nacional. Se espera que Frade, cuya operacion estara a
cargo de Texaco, produzca 100.000 barriles diarios para el ano
2003, casi el 10 por ciento de la produccion brasilena actual, y un
poco mas del 10 por ciento de la produccion mundial de Texaco.
 &HT;    Frade esta en la zona submarina sin perforar mas cercana a
Roncador, el mayor descubrimiento reciente de Petrobras en la
Cuenca de Campos, con reservas calculadas en 2.700 millones de
barriles. Roncador tampoco esta lejos de los otros dos grandes
campos productores de la Cuenca de Campos, Marlim y Barracuda,
descubiertos en 1985.
 &HT;    Pinho dice que las empresas petroleras constantemente calculan
el riesgo de las inversiones, pero agrega que Texaco se ha
comprometido a invertir una cantidad sustancial de dinero en Brasil
porque el descubrimiento de campos grandes como Roncador reduce
mucho el riesgo.
 &HT;    La fe de Texaco en la Cuenca de Campos tambien llevo a la
empresa a unirse a un consorcio liderado por Exxon (en el que
tambien participa Petrobras) que investira inicialmente unos
US$1.500 millones en explotar el campo submarino Albacore Este de
la cuenca, donde Petrobras descubrio petroleo. Se espera que
Albacore Este produzca el equivalente al 13 por ciento de la
produccion actual de Brasil para el 2003.
 &HT;    Otro consorcio liderado por Texaco tambien formo una sociedad
con Petrobras para invertir inicialmente US$50 millones en labores
de exploracion, en vez de explotar el petroleo ya descubierto, en
otra zona de la Cuenca de Campos cerca de Roncador. Y a mediados de
junio, Texaco gano el derecho a buscar petroleo de manera
independiente en esas dos areas, y como miembro de un consorcio en
otra area con una de las primeras licencias de explorcion y
produccion que otorga el gobierno en 12 areas submarinas no
pertenecientes a Petrobras.
 &HT;    Pero Texaco no es la unica en invertir grandes sumas en Brasil.
Ademas de liderar el consorcio que invertira US$1.500 millones en
el campo de Albacore Este, Exxon establecio una empresa conjunta
con Petrobras para buscar petroleo en dos cuencas submarinas y gano
la primera licitacion de derechos para buscar petroleo en otras dos
zonas submarinas.
 &HT;    Ninguna de las demas grandes petroleras internacionales han
decidido invertir al nivel de Texaco y Exxon. Mobil ha invertido
modestamente en labores de exploracion en sociedad con Petrobras.
Shell, socio minoritario en el consorcio liderado por Exxon que
trabajara en Albacore Este, tambien fue un socio minoritario en un
consorcio que ofrecio US$7 millones en la licitacion de una zona
submarina frente a la costa norte de Brasil. ``Estudiamos las areas
en terminos de riesgo frente a inversion, y en ese sentido muchas
de las areas que se subastaban no eran atractivas,'' explica David
Pirret, presidente de Shell de Brasil.
 &HT;    Analistas del sector petrolero opinan que Texaco ha encontrado
en Brasil campos submarinos mucho mas atractivos debido a la
necesidad de la empresa de hallar mas reservas. Y aunque Texaco ha
invertido con fuerza en labores de exploracion y produccion en el
Golfo de Mexico, Africa Occidental y el Reino Unido, muchos de sus
campos en el Golfo de Mexico ya llegan a su madurez.
 &HT;    ``La produccion petrolera de Texaco ha crecido a un ritmo del 2
por ciento anual durante los ultimos cinco anos, muy parecido a las
demas petroleras,'' afirma Douglas Terreson, analista petrolero
internacional de Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``Sin embargo, Texaco
se ha concentrado en Norteamerica, donde la naturaleza madura de
sus campos petroleros ha obligado a la empresa a buscar en otra
parte, particularmente en Brasil.''
 &HT;    Terreson agrega que Brasil es particularmente atractivo para
Texaco porque tanto esa empresa como Petrobras han desarrollado una
gran experiencia en tecnologia submarina. Hasta ahora Texaco solo
ha invertido en campos submarinos brasilenos. Texaco tambien
coordina el proyecto Deepstar, en el Golfo de Mexico, el primero en
usar tecnologias que pueden aplicarse a la perforacion y produccion
en campos de gran profundidad en Brasil, Nigeria y el Reino Unido.
 &HT;    Petrobras tiene dos records de tecnologia submarina: el pozo mas
profundo en produccion, a 1.855 metros, y el pozo exploratorio mas
profundo, a 2.300 metros. Exxon afirma que una de las razones de su
alianza con la petrolera brasilena es que Petrobras es un lider en
las actividades de exploracion y perforacion submarina a gran
profundidad.
 &HT;    James Clark, analista petrolero de la firma de inversion Credit
Suisse First Boston, dice que otra razon del interes de Texaco en
Brasil es 'su enorme mercado' y sus 'grandes oportunidades de
crecimiento en actividades de produccion y procesamiento'. De
hecho, Pinho, de Texaco, concuerda en que el considerable indice de
consumo de Brasil (1,8 millones de barriles diarios) lo convierte
en el mejor mercado local para vender petroleo de las operaciones
brasilenas de Texaco.
 &HT;    Pero Nelson Ribas, vicepresidente de mercadeo de combustibles de
Texaco do Brasil, afirma que la importante participacion de la
empresa en el mercado de distribucion de petroleo era otra razon
para la inversion sustancial de la firma en Brasil. Las gasolineras
de Texaco constituyen el 13,8 por ciento del mercado brasileno;
Petrobras, Exxon, Shell e Ipiranga, un distribuidor local, se
reparten el resto.
 &HT;    ``El hecho que Texaco cuenta con una infraestructura
administrativa para sus actividades de distribucion de productos
del petroleo significa que podemos usarla, y la usaremos,'' afirma
Ribas. ``La sinergia reduce nuestros costos generales y hace mas
atractivo iniciar actividades de exploracion y produccion.''
 &HT;    Texaco tambien planea usar el gas natural que encuentre en areas
submarinas brasilenas para alimentar una termoelectrica de US$160
millones que planea construir en sociedad con Petrobras y la
acerera brasilena CSN en el norteno estado de Ceara para el 2001.
El interes de Texaco en la planta verticaliza aun mas su
participacion en la matriz energetica de Brasil.

SPORTS COLUMN: A MIGHTY TEAM WITH A MORTAL TOUCH, THE YANKS REMAIN
HUMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They win. They feel.
</P>
<P>
   They go from first to third on a single. They surround a
teammate who has lost a father.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees are transforming the record books with their
deeds, while remaining human and fragile. Perhaps that will be the
legacy of this team that George Steinbrenner and Joe Torre directed
in the second half of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The players whose names are being etched into the record books
are still young and accessible. What they are accomplishing has a
mortal touch.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we all should thank Oprah Winfrey for putting emotions
on television in a tasteful setting. We live in a different world.
Ruth and Gehrig always seemed physically wary of each other, a
dozen yards apart even when they were side by side.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees not only win World Series (in pairs, now), they
also hug in public. The older he gets, the more Joe Torre becomes
kindly Uncle Joe, Zio Beppe, who is not afraid to put his cheek to
his lads' cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we can thank the zoom cameras and the freeze frames that
capture Derek Jeter's impish smile as he twits his Jedi grandpa,
Don Zimmer, or the reflective glance of Bernie Williams as he takes
it all in, or the intense stare of Joe Girardi, whether through the
mask or in the dugout, or the pained look of Paul O'Neill as he
performs his job hours after the death of his father.
</P>
<P>
   This franchise won 25 World Series in one century. Given the
advances of technology and media, we will have more intimate
memories of these boys of autumn _ the way they are _ than we do of
Ruth and Gehrig and DiMaggio and Mantle. It is a different age.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people depend on us for their daily feelings,''
Steinbrenner said Wednesday night. ``Our job is to make them
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness takes different forms. There is the sheer joy of a
city celebrating a championship from out of a void _ a Stanley Cup
in Detroit or Dallas, a basketball title in San Antonio, a Super
Bowl in Denver. There is nothing like a first time in any
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is different around the Yankees, with all the
championship banners and the monuments in center field, the echo of
history still booming under the eaves.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee fans have their form of happiness, a loud and lusty
celebration of excellence. In 1996 it was fresh and new, but by
this year, inevitably, it has matured or hardened a bit, into a
sense of entitlement, totally justified by the way the Yankees just
stomped all over the Braves in four games.
</P>
<P>
   To a neutral outsider, the totality of the Yankees can almost
come off as operatic, what with all the championships, all the
ancients, all the memories, all the veneration of Yankees who
passed from this world old or young.
</P>
<P>
   This year there was the ``5'' on the uniform sleeve for Joe
DiMaggio and the black band on the left arm for Catfish Hunter in
1999, and then three fathers of Yankees dying late in this season,
and the cancer operations of Joe Torre and Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, this might have seemed heavy, but the grace of this
team is that it seems real and even luminous to people who are not
true Yankee fans or even baseball fans.
</P>
<P>
   The old, old Yankees always had the faint whiff of cigars and
booze and pomade, straight from Toots Shor's or some other guy
place. This changed somewhere during the time of Donnie Baseball.
The other night there were wives and children and parents in the
clubhouse, right after the champagne shower.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the dousing is truly a bad message all around.
Baseball ought to get serious and ban it. (Plus, the stuff reeks
and stings; Steinbrenner seemed physically repulsed when Jeter
doused him Wednesday night.) Still, beyond the sodden ritual, there
is a wholesome feel to this club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the camera follows us in slo-mo,'' as Paul Simon
wrote, we see them putting their arms around Paul O'Neill, infusing
him with their love and energy. When this happens, the Yankees jump
from being a century's worth of glory and gloom, and they become
what they are, humans who persevered and excelled. And won. And
won. And won.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't realize is how hard it is to win a World
Series these days,'' Steinbrenner said Wednesday night. ``In the
old days you played the World Series. Now there's the division
series, the championship series and then the World Series. It's not
three times harder. It's five times harder.''
</P>
<P>
   With fans and the surrogate press prying into their lives,
peering into their dugout, lurking by their lockers, the players
have won three World Series in the last four years. They have won
12 straight World Series games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty amazing, when you think about it,'' said Brian
Cashman, the youthful general manager currently being bullied by
his boss.
</P>
<P>
   They have earned the right to be considered among the great
Yankee teams of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy from Gracie Mansion, you're on the air:
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said that if I could pick a Yankee team, it would be
the team from the early '50s that replaced DiMaggio with Mantle and
won five straight World Series,'' said this fan in his 50s in a
Yankee jacket, with a young son in tow, who somehow wound up in the
Yankee clubhouse Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there was the 1961 team, with all it did,'' Rudy from
Gracie Mansion continued. ``But now if you ask me, I would say this
was the best  &UR; team &LR;  the Yankees ever had. They didn't just win.
They demolished a great baseball team like the Atlanta Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee fans and Braves fans don't want to hear how inherently
unfair it is that franchises with vast television income can
outspend small-market franchises. But at least these teams have
won, unlike the laughingstock rich franchises in Baltimore and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The latest result of all this money and all this expertise will
soon be flapping in the breeze at the entirely outdated Wagnerian
edifice alongside the Harlem River. Twenty-five and counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice part is seeing our organization's players like Bernie
and Derek and Mariano move up in the lists of all-time Yankees,''
Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   The record book is a work in progress. Jeter just might have
helped win a fourth World Series in 1995 if club officials had
believed their eyes and instincts and gone with the mature kid at
shortstop in October.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Time is on their side. They have won three world
championships in four years, and they have not yet turned into
crusty louts. Rudy from Gracie Mansion was onto something. They are
a team. The slo-mo and our curious eyes await them in the next
century.  &QL;

WITH DROPPED JAWS, BRAVES RECOUNT THEIR UNDOING BY YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chipper Jones was shaking his head and chuckling a
little at the absurdity of the situation. The most consistent team
of the 1990s had just been rendered road kill by the Yankees, and
Jones could not even find it in himself to be terribly upset.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves may have painted a beautiful picture for
themselves this decade _ the best record over that span, the finest
pitching rotation of their generation _ but it was as if they had
just got a glimpse of Picasso at work. They could only stand back
in wonder, dazzled by the masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played pretty much a perfect Series,'' said Jones, the
Braves' third baseman. ``They were awesome, from the starting
pitching to the relief to defense to clutch hitting. They did it
all. If they play a perfect Series, they're going to sweep just
about anybody. They were awesome. We lost to a superior team.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little bitterness between these two teams, none of the
animosity that existed between the Braves and the Mets that
prevented them from saying a kind word about each other except
through tightly clenched teeth. It was telling, in the aftermath of
the Yankees' Game 4 victory Wednesday night, that only Manager
Bobby Cox _ who undoubtedly will have to answer questions about why
his team repeatedly dominates the regular season only to collapse
in the post-season _ seemed truly traumatized by the result.
</P>
<P>
   Cox admitted that he was unusually emotional after the loss _
more so than in 1996, when the Braves won the first two games at
Yankee Stadium, only to lose the next four. The rest of the team,
as second baseman Bret Boone explained afterward, had seen this
coming. Perhaps if the Braves had made this more of a Series, if
they had lost a Game 7, it would have been more difficult to
accept. Instead, the Braves simply gushed at what the Yankees do,
the patience they show at the plate, their discipline in executing
a game plan seamlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give any pitcher of his stature the chance to close out
the World Series, you'll see foam coming out of their mouth,'' John
Smoltz said of Roger Clemens, the pitcher who outdueled him for the
Game 4 victory. ``If I pitch 10 more games like this, I think I'll
win nine. Every hit they got was amazing. What amazes me is how
some guys lay off pitches. I couldn't believe some of the pitches I
threw and they laid off. I was throwing a ton of pitches they
should have swung at.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team plan. They attack the pitcher with the same plan
no matter who's there. They are so disciplined. They don't go up
free-hacking. The Yankees play like a National League team. They do
all the things they have to do to win. I don't know in 1996 if I
felt this way. I thought we should have won. You can't say we
should have won this Series. You can't feel we were the better team
_ no way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, especially, was overwhelmed by the Yankees' pitching
staff, which held the Braves' hitters to a desperate .200 batting
average. He likened Clemens' pitches to a chainsaw slicing through
the strike zone, and paid homage to a team that had had to battle
the long shadow cast by last year's record-setting season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played that team they had last year,'' Jones said. ``I
didn't think I'd ever seen a ball club stronger from 1 to 25 than
they were. If it's possible, I think this team is better. They
didn't win as many games in the regular season, but they were just
as dominant in the post-season. It was their pitching. We've got
some guys who are capable of swinging the bats and they shut us
down. Roger Clemens was as good as I've ever seen him. It's a
dominant performance by the staff that earned them the sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux joked that the Braves had to be pretty good to lose
so many World Series _ four of the five they played in the 1990s.
But he was more impressed with the Yankees' phenomenal number: 12
straight victories in World Series games, dating to the four games
in a row the Yankees won from the Braves in 1996 after the Braves
had taken a 2-0 lead in the Series. The Yankees have not lost in
the World Series since and have lost just three playoff games in
the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that they've won 12 straight,'' Maddux said.
``It's hard enough just to play in 12 games, let alone win them
all. That's something I would stick my head up really high about,
if I had that number on my side.''

`DREAMING OF JOSEPH LEES': A LOVE TRIANGLE IGNITED BY WHAT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though Samantha Morton proved herself a raw, electrifying
actress in ``Under the Skin,'' she now turns up in the kind of
tremulously carnal shy-flower role that once would have been played
by Sarah Miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreaming of Joseph Lees'' casts her as a prim-looking spinster
who works at a sawmill and sends a lusty pig farmer named Harry
(Lee Ross) in pursuit of her. Harry courts Eva (Ms. Morton) so
unabashedly that he makes her blush, which is to say that he gets
her attention. Harry's sister teases Eva about this, claiming that
Eva is ``lookin' at him like he was  &UR; burnin' &LR;  you from the inside
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreaming of Joseph Lees'' is set in 1958, when such thoughts
qualify as dangerously naughty. And it is shot on the Isle of Man,
where lonely, rugged panoramas replete with stone, mud and timber
create rebellion-ready mood. So Eva is eventually tempted to flee
the household of her stern, disapproving father and move to Harry's
house. But as the title suggests, Eva yearns for something more.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, she thinks about her distant cousin, a geologist
who lost a leg while working in an Italian quarry. (The sawmill's
way of cutting logs may be an unfortunate metaphor.) She has not
seen him since she was a 14-year-old with a schoolgirl crush. Then,
at a family wedding, Joseph Lees shows up in the form of Rupert
Graves and looks not at all the worse for wear. Unfortunately
Joseph is not an option, now that Harry is on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph, who sends his cousin books about Italian art, has an
undeniable effect on her. ``You and me, my darling, are made for
love!'' exclaims Harry, only to have Eva snap ``You and I, Harry.''
Eventually, she and the handsome geologist wind up entwined
together, talking about the earth's crust and other matters that
are beyond Harry. And Harry begins behaving differently, as if the
screenplay (by Catherine Linstrum) had flipped a switch.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Eric Styles, this earnest first feature pays
careful attention to drably authentic details (Harry's sweaters
have moth holes) and tells its glumly bodice-ripping tale with
somber sensitivity. Ms. Morton succeeds in seeming volatile and
alive even when the material is all too strained. Not content with
metaphorical import, the sawmill also becomes part of a suicide
attempt near the film's shrilly contrived ending. The screenplay
asks viewers to believe that a character would willingly get in the
way of a whirring blade.
</P>

 &HT;    FIRED PATCO WORKERS SUE FOR OLD AIR CONTROLLER JOBS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five air traffic controllers, fired for going out
on strike nearly 20 years ago, are suing the Clinton administration
for failing to rehire them.
</P>
<P>
   The group, all Florida residents, are members of PATCO (the
Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization), the union that
lost a dramatic showdown with President Reagan in 1981. When PATCO
flouted federal no-strike rules and staged a walkout, Reagan fired
all 11,000 strikers and banned them from being rehired.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton lifted the ban in 1993. However, the lawsuit
claims that the Federal Aviation Administration has refused to hire
most of the approximately 5,000 controllers who applied for their
old jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The legal complaint, a copy of which was provided by attorney
John T. Kennedy of Stuart, Fla., was expected to arrive Friday at
the Court of Federal Claims in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Taylor, an electrical contractor and president of the PATCO
Local in Stuart, said that he decided to lead a lawsuit effort
because the FAA had declined to recall him, although he had a
decade of experience as a controller and was a military veteran.
Taylor said that he first sought his old job in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which seenspecified amount of damages,
wages, benefits and reinstatement, charges that the FAA passed over
the PATCO veterans to hire younger workers with far less or no
traffic controller experience. The lawsuit accuses the FAA of
hiring convicted felons in some cases instead members of the PATCO
group.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Taylor are other Stuart residents, each with at least 11
years of controller experience. One plaintiff, James Black, is a
military veteran with 44 years as a controller. He continues in
that field under a federal contract, according to the legal
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the FAA declined to comment on the pending
lawsuit. However, a report to Congress from the agency last summer
said that 4,500 of the strikers had sought re-employment and that
the FAA had hired 715. The report also states that military
veterans are given preference.
</P>
<P>
   The PATCO group is asking the federal court to grant them class
action status, which would allow them to represent all PATCO
controllers who sought reinstatement, as well as their heirs and
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   PATCO was largely destroyed as a union after its run-in with
Reagan. Current FAA controllers are represented by the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association.

decade of experience as a controller and was a military veteran.
Taylor said that he first sought his old job in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount of damages,
wages, benefits and reinstatement, charges that the FAA passed over
the PATCO veterans to hire younger workers with far less or no
traffic controller experience. The lawsuit accuses the FAA of
hiring convicted felons in some cases instead members of the PATCO
group.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Taylor are other Stuart residents, each with at least 11
years of controller experience. One plaintiff, James Black, is a
military veteran with 44 years as a controller. He continues in
that field under a federal contract, according to the legal
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the FAA declined to comment on the pending
lawsuit. However, a report to Congress from the agency last summer
said that 4,500 of the strikers had sought re-employment and that
the FAA had hired 715. The report also states that military
veterans are given preference.
</P>
<P>
   The PATCO group is asking the federal court to grant them class
action status, which would allow them to represent all PATCO
controllers who sought reinstatement, as well as their heirs and
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   PATCO was largely destroyed as a union after its run-in with
Reagan. Current FAA controllers are represented by the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association.

FOR OPERA IN DETROIT HOW TO THRIVE IN A BLUE-COLLAR CITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ As an opera lover who sees several performances a
month in Vienna and other European capitals, Astrid Eywo is used to
occasionally sitting elbow to elbow with American tourists. But on
Oct. 29 she will be the tourist, having flown here from Vienna for
the opening of the Michigan Opera Theater's production of Jules
Massenet's ``Werther.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Eywo is making the trip because she learned on the Internet
that Andrea Bocelli, the blind tenor, would be making his North
American opera stage debut in the title role here, with the
mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves. ``You have so many big artists in
Detroit,'' Mrs. Eywo said. ``I am so looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit is still a blue-collar city better known for cars than
culture, much less opera. But the Michigan Opera Theater here is
thriving. Its budget has nearly tripled in the last five years, it
has moved into an enormous opera house and it has begun to attract
international stars who usually appear in places like Chicago and
San Francisco if they travel beyond New York at all.
</P>
<P>
   While government support for the arts has been fading, the
Michigan Opera Theater is growing because of lavish support from
three local businesses that also happen to be the world's three
biggest corporations: the General Motors Corp., the Ford Motor Co.
and DaimlerChrysler AG. After two difficult decades during which
their support for the arts sometimes lagged, particularly at the
former Chrysler Corp., all three auto makers now have record
profits. They have been sharing some of their new wealth with
cultural institutions in southeast Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Opera Theater has also acquired a powerful and
valuable ally: Jennifer Nasser, an enthusiastic fund-raiser and
opera lover who is the wife of Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's new chief
executive and president. Her work, both in persuading Ford to
bankroll big opera events and in organizing her own galas to raise
money, demonstrates how one influential supporter in a community
can help put an arts group on a sound financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she and David DiChiera, the opera's founder
and general director, have been trying to use the opera to bridge
the deep racial animosity that divides the mostly black city of
Detroit from its mostly white suburbs. The opera company frequently
produces works with African-American singers. It has also renovated
a cavernous downtown theater as its opera house and holds charity
benefits there to encourage wealthy suburbanites to venture into
the city.
</P>
<P>
   The opera has used the auto makers' deep pockets partly to put
on extravaganzas. The Three Tenors _ Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo
and Luciano Pavarotti _ made their only North American appearance
together this year at a concert on July 17 at Tiger Stadium,
sponsored by Ford for the opera's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Some purists view a ``Werther'' with Bocelli, who is best known
for singing operatic arias and love songs in stadiums with
microphones, as another potential extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find out when he gets onstage whether he can keep up
with someone like Graves and whether his voice can fill a hall,''
said Steven H. Cornelius, the music critic at The Toledo Blade.
``Whether or not it was a good artistic judgment, it certainly was
savvy marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   But other opera experts say the six coming performances of
``Werther'' demonstrate that the Michigan Opera Theater has
established its artistic importance as well as its financial
health. The appearance of Bocelli and Ms. Graves on one stage,
combined with the decision by Steven Mercurio, a prominent
conductor, to lead the performances, shows that the Michigan Opera
Theater can do more than just hire a famous singer, said F. Paul
Driscoll, the managing editor of Opera News, a New York-based
monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that Bocelli is appearing but that the
Michigan Opera Theater is able to give him absolute, blue-chip
support, and that's an indication of how far they've come,''
Driscoll said. He said he considered it one of the best regional
operas in the country. Like many regional operas, it has no
full-time orchestra or chorus, though its members regularly perform
with the company and are paid.
</P>
<P>
   Known more for Motown than Mozart, Detroit does not have an
opera tradition. While the ``Werther'' performances have nearly
sold out (some box seats, at $250, are left) last-minute tickets
have often been available for other productions.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 19th century, Detroit had several opera houses that
presented touring groups, and there were even a couple of
short-lived attempts to set up local opera companies. The Michigan
Opera Theater was started by DiChiera in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   That was a difficult time in Detroit. The nation's worst riots
of the 1960's took place here in 1967, leaving 43 dead and hundreds
injured, mainly blacks shot by white police officers and National
Guardsmen. The city's tax base was devastated by white flight to
the suburbs during the 60's and 70's, when the city's white
population plunged to 250,000 from 1.6 million. Foreign competition
and high oil prices brought the local auto makers to the brink of
financial collapse by the early '80s. Art Deco skyscrapers built in
the '20s when Detroit was one of the world's wealthiest cities were
abandoned to vandals; some of their broken windows still stare
emptily across the downtown area, which is only now beginning to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1970s and 1980s, the Michigan Opera Theater
performed at a succession of local theaters. DiChiera, who had been
a music professor at Oakland University in Detroit's northern
suburbs, made a point of basing the opera in the city and tried to
stage operas that would draw blacks, Polish-Americans and other
large ethnic groups in the city and inner suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 the company was able to buy a magnificent but abandoned
hall in the city center for just $600,000. Opened in 1922 as the
4,250-seat Capitol Theater, it was designed by C. Howard Crane, an
architect who also designed Orchestra Hall, the home of the Detroit
Symphony Orchestra. Although the Capitol was used for vaudeville
and films, Crane built it just like a large European opera house,
with similar acoustics and elaborate details.
</P>
<P>
   Its neighborhood had been so devastated by 1989, however, that
the purchase was widely questioned. ``Everybody thought we were
really insane, we had no touch with reality, this was such a
forsaken area,'' DiChiera recalled.
</P>
<P>
   To raise money for renovations, he turned to the auto makers.
Philip E. Benton Jr., who was Ford's president, and his wife, Mary
Ann, already on the opera's board, became chairmen of the
fund-raising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Each auto maker made an initial gift of $1 million. Ford has
become the opera's biggest supporter since then, although GM
sponsors the spring season and DaimlerChrysler sponsors the
separate dance series.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Theater's one shortcoming was its small stage. So in
1990 the opera company bought a derelict commercial building behind
the stage, tore it down and built an enormous opera stage for the
hall, which was remodeled to seat 2,730 people with plenty of elbow
room.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Renamed the Opera House, the building reopened in 1996. But the
Michigan Opera Theater was running out of money and could not
afford to paint the walls or carpet the floors backstage. At the
first performance, the lights showed a fine haze of dust kicked up
by the singers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nasser, who had just joined the board, was appalled by the
dust. ``It hit the opera singers the worst, because they have to
take in great gulps of air.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked Ford's huge real estate division, Ford Land, which
owns much of the nearby city of Dearborn, Mich., to fix the
problem. Crews installed dry wall, spread 22,000 gallons of paint,
carpeted the backstage areas and furnished the dressing rooms. The
dust disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nasser has thrown herself into opera events since then,
organizing some without asking Ford's help. She has been successful
partly by appealing to the strong inferiority complex that many
Detroit area residents have about their city's cultural standing.
</P>
<P>
   When the board decided to invite the Three Tenors for a
fund-raising concert to pay off part of the Opera Hall's mortgage,
Ford sponsored it, with all proceeds going to the opera.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's contributions to the opera here this year total $2.5
million, making it one of the biggest corporate supporters of opera
in the United States. The company has several reasons for doing
this, said David G. Ropes, Ford's advertising and marketing
director.
</P>
<P>
   The company tries to support civic causes in cities where it has
extensive operations, particularly in its hometown. It also backs
its executives' involvement in local institutions. Ford wants to
improve Detroit's reputation, to make it easier for the company to
hire the best and the brightest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been difficult to recruit into Detroit over the
years,'' Ropes said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nasser attends the opening night of every opera here with
her husband _ they are always in black tie in the Ford box _ and
goes to frequent business meetings at the Opera House. She makes a
point of telling other society matrons in the suburbs that the
city's crime rate has fallen and that the area around the Opera
House is particularly well patrolled by police.
</P>
<P>
   The opera continues to emphasize ethnic diversity in its casting
and productions. The crowds attending the opera are still mainly
white, but, DiChiera said, ``I look around at our audiences,
they're getting younger, and with a growing representation from the
African-American community, and for me, in Detroit, those are two
main goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Opera Theater still faces potential problems. One
is its heavy reliance on the auto industry, which doesn't weather
recessions well and might trim charitable giving during the next
one. DiChiera said that with most of the opera company's
construction debts now paid off, he hoped to build an endowment so
the operating budget would be less dependent on gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The company also depends heavily on DiChiera, 64, who manages
almost every detail. He has not chosen a successor but said he
hoped to put the opera on a financial footing that would make it
easier for the board to find a replacement someday.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's downtown is beginning to revive, mainly because Dennis
Archer, the Mayor since 1994, has tried to bring businesses back
into the city. A new baseball stadium now stands almost complete
across the street from the opera, and a new football stadium is
about to rise next to the baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Noise should not be a problem, DiChiera said, because the opera
has built itself an office building on the side of the facing the
stadiums. Still, a parking shortage may loom.
</P>
<P>
   DiChiera said the stadiums would help the opera in the long run,
by persuading more people that it is safe to drive into the city
again from the northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really rather deal with the problems of where people
park,'' he said, ``than the problem of getting people to come
down.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner ignored some of the questions
shouted at him in the Yankees' clubhouse after his team completed
its World Series sweep of the Atlanta Braves on Wednesday night,
but the mention of a particular word turned his head, a word rarely
heard in baseball in the last quarter century: dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won the World Series in three of the last four
years, averaging 100 victories in the regular season. If
championships and dominance are prerequisites, then they are
baseball's first dynasty since the advent of free agency 23 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The system that gives established players the right to solicit
contract offers and jump from team to team _ as well as the amateur
draft and the multiple layers of post-season playoffs _ has made it
much more difficult for teams to repeat as World Series winners.
The vast majority of the teams that are deep in cash, like
Steinbrenner's, have failed to secure success. ``To have a dynasty
today under free agency,'' said Tal Smith, a longtime baseball
executive and currently the president of the Houston Astros,
``you've got to have unlimited resources and good management.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams won back-to-back championships 17 times in the first 73
years of World Series play, but in the last 23 years, title-winning
teams have repeated just 3 times. The Yankees won four consecutive
championships from 1936 to 1939 and five straight from 1949 to
1953, and the Oakland Athletics won three straight from 1972 to
1974. No team has won three consecutive World Series since then.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees of '96-'99 are the first team since free agency
began to win three titles in four seasons, and they will pursue
their third consecutive title next year; presumably, they will be
poised to continue their dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Their best position player, shortstop Derek Jeter, is 25 years
old, and their best pitchers, Mariano Rivera and Orlando Hernandez,
will be tied to the team for at least the next two seasons. Bernie
Williams, their cleanup hitter, has six years remaining on his
current contract. The organization's infrastructure and farm system
are among the strongest in the majors: baseball scouts say
infielders Alfonso Soriano and Nick Johnson will become stars after
they reach the big leagues within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, the Yankees pitcher, was asked about the team's
place in history. ``It makes you wonder,'' he said. ``I don't think
a lot of us are that far along in our mind with what this means,
how do we compare, what did we just do. I think it's more about
enjoying the moment for what it is, and let you people talk about
history and where we fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Through collective bargaining between the players' union and
baseball owners, free agency _ the system within which players
could leave their team after six years of service time and sign
elsewhere _ began after the 1976 season. Free agency, as well
arbitration rights for players with between three and six years of
service time, rapidly escalated salaries, and players began
changing teams constantly. Maintaining a particular collection of
players became far more difficult, either because key players
wanted to go elsewhere once they became free agents, or because of
budgetary constraints. Dynasties, as they were loosely defined,
largely became a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to free agency, if you were able to assemble talent
through scouting and development and judicious trades, you were
able to retain that talent,'' Smith said. ``Today it's a much
shorter span of control. It becomes increasingly difficult to
maintain continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first seasons after the advent of free agency,
Steinbrenner seized on the newly created system and blended stars
like Reggie Jackson and Goose Gossage with an already formidable
team that included Thurman Munson, Ron Guidry, Chris Chambliss,
Willie Randolph and Graig Nettles. The Yankees, who had won the
American League pennant and been swept by Cincinnati in the World
Series in 1976 _ the last season before free agency _ won
back-to-back World Series in 1977 and 1978.
</P>
<P>
   They finished fourth in their division in 1979, won the division
but lost in the playoffs to Kansas City in 1980, and returned to
the World Series in 1981, where they lost to the Dodgers.
Steinbrenner's insatiable appetite for dominance then drove the
Yankees into the decline that lasted more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Before the current group of Yankees, the Oakland Athletics of
1988-92 may have been the most awesome club of the free agency era,
averaging 102 victories over three regular seasons from 1988-90 and
playing in the World Series in those three seasons. Rickey
Henderson was their leadoff hitter and Jose Canseco and Mark
McGwire powered their run production, and Oakland had an
experienced pitching staff that included the starters Dave Stewart
and Bob Welch and the closer Dennis Eckersley.
</P>
<P>
   As good as they were, the Athletics won the World Series once
(1989), and in their other two appearances, they lost to the Los
Angeles Dodgers in five games (1988) and the Cincinnati Reds in
four (1990).
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays won back-to-back championships in 1992 and
1993, only the second team of the free agency era to do so, spurred
by a deep and patient lineup (Roberto Alomar, John Olerud, Joe
Carter and Paul Molitor) and solid pitching (Tom Henke, Duane Ward,
a late-season hired gun named David Cone). The Blue Jays, playing
in the competitive American League East, were not as dominant
during the regular season as the Athletics, or the current Yankees,
averaging 94 victories from 1991 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves have made it to the post-season in every year
since 1991, and they have been baseball's most consistently
successful team in the last decade. But the albatross history will
hang on them is their record in the World Series: they won in 1995
and lost in 1991, 1992, 1996 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur draft, which began in 1965, helped to make it more
difficult for teams to stockpile talent; if the draft had been in
place years before, Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle would almost
surely have played elsewhere. The leagues were split into divisions
before the 1969 season, and then into thirds before the 1995
season; now four teams from each league qualify for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But even though there is added opportunity to appear in the
post-season, there is greater risk, as well. The Yankees of Babe
Ruth, DiMaggio and Mantle went directly into the World Series after
taking the pennant. The current Yankees went through two rounds of
playoffs before winning the World Series; despite those obstacles,
they have won 9 of 10 post-season series in the last four years,
including 12 consecutive World Series games, and 22 of 25 games in
the last two post-seasons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have an enormous financial advantage over most
teams; they have a greater margin for error in making personnel
decisions, and have more freedom in taking chances on amateur free
agents, like Hernandez, who is turning out to be a huge bargain
after signing a four-year, $6.6 million deal. But the Los Angeles
Dodgers spend millions and millions and have not won consecutive
championships, and neither have the Baltimore Orioles, the
Cleveland Indians, the Atlanta Braves or the other big-budget
teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the first years after free agency, players wanted to sign
with the Yankees because they paid the highest salaries and offered
a winning tradition; in the latter half of the '80s, however,
Steinbrenner's often reckless restructuring and the pressure he
placed on players scared free agents away.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the Yankees have developed and paid to keep
their own talent, like Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter, and the
resulting success and clubhouse culture _ the players generally
have a strong respect for each other, their opponents and the sport
itself _ is viewed as a model by other teams and players. Stars
like Chuck Knoblauch and Roger Clemens have forced their teams to
trade them to the Yankees. The Yankees have lots of money, have
used it wisely, and have earned the right to be called a dynasty.
``They've completely demonstrated their superiority,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner joked about the word, laughed it off. But
re-creating the Yankees' dynasty he followed as a child is what he
has wanted since purchasing the team and promising to be a
hands-off owner 26 years ago.

 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKEVILLE, Conn. _ On the rainy, early-morning hours of a
Saturday in October, month, a traveler here might have mistaken the
Interlaken Inn for a ``Great Gatsby'' set. In a roped-off lot,
three rows of cars evoked the 1930s, an age of automotive innocence
when ``motoring'' was an act of faith in a machine _ and was often
an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, only two of the four dozen English cars in the lot
had been built before World War II. All were products of Morgan
Motor Co. of Malvern Link, Worcestershire, which in 1937 locked
into a body design _ low-slung scoop fenders tightly hugging two
seats and a radiator cowl _ to which it has stubbornly and
successfully clung for more than six decades.
</P>
<P>
   The company, too, is an anachronism. Resisting modernization,
the world's oldest privately held automobile company still builds
each car by hand, resulting in a wait of up to six years for one of
the dozen or so machines it produces each week.
</P>
<P>
   And other than adding air bags, Morgan has resisted many safety
modifications. Thus, the only two dealers in the United States _
Isis Motors of San Francisco (www.morgancars-usa.com) and Cantab
Motors Ltd. of Purceville, Va. _ must modify each car to conform to
United States standards, bringing the cost of a new Morgan to about
$61,000. Until Morgan adopted a new Rover engine several years ago,
Isis and Cantab had to convert each car to run on propane.
</P>
<P>
   Here in western Connecticut, an unexpected shower had moved in
overnight. It glazed the cars, making them glisten even in the
stingy light of overcast skies, but it slowed preparations for the
concourse d'elegance of the 21st autumn gathering of the 3/4 Morgan
Group Ltd. of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The threat was more than lost time. The Morgan celebrates style,
not utility or comfort; canvas tops and tonneau covers afforded
interiors little protection from the rain.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m., the only two people on the lot were Dean Meyer and
his wife, Bea Pinon, drying and polishing their newly restored 1964
four-seater. Ms. Pinon stretched the tonneau cover as Meyer swept
away the puddle in its center.
</P>
<P>
   The Ridgefield, Conn., couple were tending a machine that by
Meyer's own account was ``probably overrestored'' _ in some ways
closer to perfection than when it left Malvern Link 35 years
before, and worth 20 times its original price. He opened the bonnet
to reveal a pristine engine surrounded by shining chrome and
nickel.
</P>
<P>
   The traits that distinguish fans of British sports car from the
owners of classic Porsches and Ferraris include an essential sense
of humor. With the exception of the Jaguar line, these cars were
affordable toys for people of limited means. Morgans, like the
original MG's and Triumphs, were inexpensive playthings for young
men who, it was assumed, would outgrow them within the cars'
presumably brief life spans. Yet the roadsters proved resilient.
Even the Morgan's ash-wood frame, still used today, has survived
the years and the bumps remarkably well.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgans have their weaknesses. For example, experts
recommend a complete overhaul of the suspension, steering and
brakes every 15,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The first Morgans were glorified motorcycles, three-wheelers
(the 3 in the 3/4 Morgan Group) powered by outboard motorcycle
engines. Introduced by the company's founder, H.F.S. Morgan, in
1910, these popular ``trikes'' did not evolve into an actual car
until 1935. Even the Morgan's biggest fans will allow that its
ergonomics have not improved much in 64 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real appeal of the Morgan is a sort of anti-appeal,'' said
Burt Fendelman, a corporate lawyer for Citicorp and three-time
Morgan owner who organized this fall's gathering. ``They're not
comfortable. They're not practical. They're not even weatherproof.
But they're rugged and a wonderful driving car, very tight in their
handling, with no power steering or brakes or anything else. They
offer a closeness to the road, a feel that can't be matched.''
</P>
<P>
   Those handling characteristics were in evidence at the afternoon
autocross event, where even the original trikes barely leaned as
wheels screeched through tight, stable turns. What is more, the
cars are simply so much fun to drive that comfort and utility
quickly become nonissues to anyone infected with the Morgan bug.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, a 47-year-old management consultant, and Ms. Pinon, 43,
an airline attendant, keep a 1986 BMW 535is as their ``daily
driver.'' They also have the beginnings of a bona fide collection _
a '59 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud I, a '66 Jaguar E-Type and a '93
Dodge Viper. But their Morgan stands out because it was originally
Meyer's everyday car. He bought it in 1974, while at the University
of California at Berkeley, because the Morgan was the only ``cool
car I could afford.''
</P>
<P>
   The restoration (which cost ``about $40,000'' and resulted in a
car ``worth about $40,000 _ you do the math'') was undertaken,
Meyer said, ``to celebrate our 25th anniversary.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``our,'' Ms. Pinon was quick to clarify, referred to Meyer
and his Morgan: ``He's been with that car longer than he's been
with any woman.''
</P>
<P>
   While many sports car enthusiasts are devoted owners, the
difference, said Fred Cohen of Upper Monclair, N.J., ``is that most
Morgan owners I know actually drive our cars.'' And not just on
sunny summer weekends. Cohen occasionally drives his Morgan to his
job at Conde Nast in New York. And once, when he left the top at
home expecting pleasant weather, he and his wife, Lita, drove more
than 80 miles in pouring rain to a club meet. ``We only got wet if
we stopped,'' he said, ``so we just kept driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the character of the 3/4 Motor Group was reflected in
two unusual aspects of its concours. First, the judging was by
popular vote _ no panel of experts deducted points for a
hardware-store bolt or frayed window trim. Another was that most of
the cars had been driven here, some from hundreds or thousands of
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   In a far corner of the concours sat a cream-and-burgundy '66
Morgan, a car whose beauty derived not from a waxy shine but from
the patina of character. When its owners, John and Gladys
McNaughton, opened the bonnet, they revealed an engine caked in the
grime of thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs a cleaning really bad,'' McNaughton allowed.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the other owners, whose cars glistened beneath the
parting clouds at mid-morning _ even Meyers, whose car won best of
show _ held the McNaughtons and their Morgan in awe. One clue to
that respect could be found atop the oil-soaked firewall, where a
voltage regulator with Cyrillic labeling had been bolted. The
memento dated from 1995, when the McNaughtons celebrated their
retirement by driving their Morgan around the world. When, halfway
through Russia, the generator gave out, a local mechanic dug around
in his shop and found a possible replacement, said McNaughton, a
portly man with a snow-white beard who would attend the awards
banquet that night in a Scottish kilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we tried it out, there were sparks shooting out,'' he
said. ``So he bolted on this Russian voltage regulator. It got us
all the way to London.''
</P>
<P>
   The generator was replaced in England, but McNaughton said he
could not bring himself to remove the regulator, because ``I see it
as part of the car's history now.''

<P>
   Halloween is coming. And while we could celebrate by renting
``The Blair Witch Project'' or reading aloud H.P. Lovecraft's
horror stories, we decided we wanted to go ghost hunting. The Ghost
Hunting 101 manual, which we found on the Internet, advised against
beginners seeking out ghosts on their own. So we contacted the
author, the New Jersey-based ghost hunter Dave Juliano, to ask how
we should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Juliano is the creator of a Web site devoted to the paranormal
(www.theshadowlands.net/southjersey) and the co-director of South
Jersey Ghost Research, a ghost-hunting club with 35 active members
and dozens of affiliate clubs around the country. Its members
identify places with possible hauntings (cemeteries, old houses,
historic battlefields) and organize investigations using
audiovisual and other equipment. Their goal is to bring back proof
that ghosts exist.
</P>
<P>
   On the Shadowlands Web site, the club receives about 400 queries
a week from people who think their homes are haunted. ``This is a
busy time of year for us,'' said Juliano. ``We're booked through
January for every weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   October is busy for the ghost business in general. A
ghost-hunting group in Los Angeles has been charging people to
participate in an ``investigation'' of a haunted theater on
Hollywood Boulevard. And the Philadelphia Ghost Hunters Alliance
has been holding sold-out seminars on ``the what, why and where of
the spirit realm'' in a historic haunted mansion. On a recent
Friday night, we accepted Juliano's invitation to join his club in
its investigation of the Burlington County Prison in Mount Holly,
N.J. Before the prison was closed in 1965, guards reportedly had
seen cigarettes floating in midair in one of the supposedly empty
cells.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Driving toward Mount Holly on the New Jersey Turnpike, we
wondered how we would respond if we actually saw something. What if
a transparent apparition, dragging a rusty ball and chain, walked
up to one of us and tried to bum a smoke?
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after exiting the turnpike we found ourselves on a road
lined with old red-brick mansions with columned porticos. In the
darkness we felt as if we had passed through a portal and entered
an early-19th-century village. The prison was hard to miss. It is a
handsome gray stone building with iron bars over its windows. Out
front we spotted Juliano, a stocky 31-year-old with a shaved head,
directing a group of about 15 people laden with equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Each ghost hunter wore a photo identification badge with name
and rank, ``investigator'' or ``team leader.'' A few had crucifixes
carefully positioned outside their shirts and many were dressed
completely in black. If their IDs hadn't read ``South Jersey Ghost
Research,'' Juliano and his crew members might have been mistaken
for a bomb squad.
</P>
<P>
   As the ghost hunters filed through the heavy, oak-paneled front
doorway, we took a moment to admire the building. Above the
entryway ``prison'' is chiseled in stone, flanked on each side by a
carving of skeleton keys surrounded by chains.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to open as a museum in March, the prison is being
restored to look as it did when it opened in 1810. From Prison
Museum Association members, who were observing the proceedings, we
learned that the Boston strangler once spent the night in the
prison and that executions were performed in the building's
backyard. Some people consider the building to be haunted, and
South Jersey Ghost Research was given three hours to see what it
could find.
</P>
<P>
   Juliano, a refrigeration and heating technician by trade, came
well prepared. His metal briefcase was packed with equipment: tape
recorders, digital cameras, red-beamed flashlights, electromagnetic
field detectors (or EMFs), temperature gauges, walkie-talkies,
extra batteries and laminated cards with a prayer to St. Michael
asking for his ``protection against wickedness and the snares of
the Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the chilly stone walls, cells with doors of iron lined
each of the prison's three floors, and a team of investigators was
designated for each floor. Juliano's team set up its equipment on
the third floor in a central cell with a vaulted ceiling and a
high, tiny window _ the death-row cell. ``There are legends that
you can hear people screaming and wailing,'' asserted Karen Smith,
the coordinator of capital projects for Burlington County. ``The
people who spent their last days here were shackled by leg irons to
a bolt which is embedded in the floor.'' Among the tales that Ms.
Smith has heard is one about the persistent spirit of a man
executed in the mid-1800s for killing his wife by bludgeoning her
with a table leg. The stories of hauntings began immediately after
the murderer was hanged from the prison scaffold.
</P>
<P>
   With the lights on, Juliano's team set up a night-vision
camcorder in one corner of the death-row cell. Electronic sensors,
including a motion detector and temperature gauge, were placed
strategically around the infamous bolt. If a ghost were even to
blink in here, it would be busted.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When the ghost hunters finished setting up their equipment on
each floor, the team leaders conferred on walkie-talkies and, in
one weird instant, the lights went off throughout the building.
``OK,'' said Juliano. ``Let's see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dark the ghost hunters quietly began patrolling the
corridors. Some carried EMF detectors, others cameras, others tape
recorders. There was even a documentary film crew from Bard College
videotaping the search. Outside it began to rain, which added to
the creep factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see `The Sixth Sense?''' asked Juliano in the gloom.
``When the little boy in the movie says, `You know when your hair
stands up on the back of your neck? That's them.' That's exactly
how I feel when I know something's around. I call it my spider
sense; it's a tingling.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   We accompanied Juliano and an investigator, Anne Perlegruto, as
they slowly headed from the death-row cell down the right cell
block. Juliano's spider sense soon became activated and it appeared
we were stalking something, though we were not sure what. Passing a
line of tiny cells with stone walls, Juliano stopped periodically
and quietly said, ``Flash,'' eerily lighting up the whitewashed
hallway and grated cell bars with his digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We ended up in the corner cell, where he got on his
walkie-talkie and announced, ``Third floor, right wing, last cell,
orb photo in the right-hand back corner, where I observed a man
waking down the hallway and into the cell.'' Drat! He had just
seen the evening's first ghost, and we missed it completely. Maybe
we lacked Juliano's arachnid sensibilities. We eagerly studied the
orb photograph, now stored on his digital camera, which showed a
tiny bright dot _ or orb _ floating in the dark cell. Was this the
glowing end of a cigarette?
</P>
<P>
   On past investigations Juliano and other club members have
collected reams of such supernatural evidence (the best of it is
posted on their Web site), including photographs of ``ectoplasm''
(misty vapor), audiotapes of ghost voices (saying things like
``help me'') and readings of rapidly dropping temperatures (known
as cold spots). ``I'd rather have a reading on the EMF detector, a
temperature drop or a picture than just me saying I see a spirit
standing there,'' said Juliano. ``When you can get all of this
evidence together, that's as good as you're going to get short of a
ghost going on `Larry King Live' and saying, `I'm dead, but I'm
here talking to you.'''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Juliano's determination to prove ghosts are real comes from
personal experience. When he was growing up, he spent years seeing
ghosts in his parents' house _ a glowing, childlike apparition,
small black imps, an enormous face speaking from the wall _ but no
one believed him. ``I was terrified,'' he said. ``When this stuff
happens to you, you're always questioning your sanity. There was no
one to come in and say, `Yes, there is something happening here,
but you don't have Satan living in your basement.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Later in the hunt we observed something strange. In the cell
next to death row, we noticed that an antique prison cot made of
canvas and brass had been moved. When we first saw it, it had been
propped up against the wall. Checking again, we found the cot down
on the ground as if ready to be slept on.
</P>
<P>
   Hurrying out of the cell, we shared our discovery with the team
members stationed on the floor. All denied moving the cot and no
one recalled hearing it fall. Blame was quickly shifted to the
spirit world. ``Objects being moved is very common,'' explained the
team leader, Tome Wilson, in the dim light of the corridor. Wilson,
21, a fine arts student at York College of Pennsylvania, has had
plenty of experience with this phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   He roomed with a poltergeist for a few months, he said: ``It was
classic. Doors would slam. Small glass objects would explode.
Pictures would come off the walls. Kitchen objects would throw
themselves around.''
</P>
<P>
   After agreeing that moving a cot is more likely the act of a
benign, sleepy spirit than an angry, vengeful one, we marched back
into the cell with an EMF detector lent to us by Juliano. We
scanned the cot, but got a normal reading. Strange. We theorized
that if there were a ghost here, it had floated off to a quieter
place for a nap. Perhaps it was disturbed by the cacophony of
two-way radio transmissions and motion-detector alarms accidentally
being tripped every few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   We decided to do a little exploring on our own. Heading down
steps into a long passageway, we found ourselves in the offices of
the future museum. After wandering around in the dark for an hour
it was a relief to be in a well-lighted room. The first thing we
saw was a perfectly rendered miniature gallows _ complete with a
tiny noose _ displayed on a table.
</P>
<P>
   From that cheery scene, we headed back into the dark and down to
the basement where there had been a flurry of activity. We met up
again with Wilson, who told us he had observed a pinkish cloud
hovering in the darkness near the doorway to a cell. And when he
took flash pictures there with a digital camera, he said, a ball of
light showed up on the images.
</P>
<P>
   The club's other co-director, Jon Williams, 19, showed us a
digital orb photograph taken in that area and then told us that an
EMF detector stationed in the basement had recorded a highly
unusual reading. Apparently the club's psychic investigator,
Hildred Robinette, had also felt things. She was upstairs, where a
two-degree drop in temperature in the death row cell had been
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   We went up to investigate. Unlike the other club members, Ms.
Robinette did not carry any equipment. She said she had seen ghosts
all her life and could even carry on conversations with them. She
said she had seen the ghosts of three men in the basement and that
one had told her his name, Andrew Morrison. ``There's a lot of
anguish here,'' she said. Even though she seemed a little shaken by
her experience, she finally entered the death row cell just before
11 p.m., and quickly rushed out. ``I could see him crouching
down,'' she said, agitated. ``He said, `What are you looking at?'
He was real teed off and he didn't want me in there. Then he
started cussing at me. He's really a nasty person. I don't like
him.'' We peered into the dark, cramped cell, but received no
greeting, nasty or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Robinette seemed to have received a strong
impression, we were not the only ones wondering where all the
ghosts were. When the three-hour ghost hunt was up, we asked Wilson
how he would rank the ghostly activity here on a scale of 1 to 10.
He said: ``With 10 being blood dripping from the walls and
chandeliers spinning, and 1 being nothing? This place would be a
2.''
</P>
<P>
   Packing up at the end of the evening, Juliano was a bit more
optimistic. After all, he considered this simply a preliminary
investigation. ``I know I saw things and we've heard some stuff,
but we have to see what we've captured on video and audio,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   We bid adieu to the intrepid ghost hunters and their spectral
quarry, and ran from the dark walls of the prison to the comfort of
our car. Although our first ghost hunt did not entirely convince us
of the existence of the spirit realm, we agreed to keep an open
mind. As we prepared to drive away, we noticed that the documentary
makers were videotaping our car. Was a ghost making a jailbreak and
hitching a ride with us?
</P>
<P>
   On our drive back we mulled over the incident of the cot, the
pinkish cloud, the words of the psychic and the mysterious orb
photographs. The rain began to pick up even more and finally came
down in sheets. Ghosts or no ghosts, we had to admit: it was a dark
and stormy night. . .

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Chris O'Donnell has been in New Zealand for the last
four months, up on top of a mountain most days, and he's only
halfway through shooting ``Vertical Limit,'' a thriller about
trapped climbers that is set for release next summer. This is
making it very difficult for O'Donnell to promote his new film,
``The Bachelor,'' which opens on Nov. 5 and which happens to be the
first film he produced. But it's also keeping him out of Hollywood
during the final anxious days before the movie's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to do as much as possible for the movie, but it's
kind of nice not to be too involved with all the hoopla around
it,'' he said. ``You know, when you're an actor you come onto a
movie, do your part and then you're finished. But when you're the
producer, too, it's different. `The Bachelor' I was on for two
years, and it really became a part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of O'Donnell's deal to play Robin in the last two Batman
movies _``Batman Forever'' in 1995 and ``Batman and Robin'' in 1997
_ he was given a production deal and a suite of offices on the
Warner Brothers lot. Such deals were once quite common in
Hollywood, almost part of every rising actor's status pack, but in
the current cost-cutting climate they are becoming much less so.
Often, they resulted in no films and turned out to serve little
purpose other than providing the actor's friends a place to flop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those deals where they give you some offices and
some overhead expenses,'' O'Donnell said. ``So I thought, well, I
might as well take advantage of it. I may as well try to build a
business here. My idea was to hire some really young, hungry people
and get some projects going.''
</P>
<P>
   What he found, he said, was that hiring the young, hungry people
was easy, and getting projects moving only slightly less so. But
actually getting the movies made was a long, frustrating process.
``Setting up a movie and getting it greenlit is a whole different
deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bachelor'' is based on the old Buster Keaton feature,
``Seven Chances,'' about a man who learns that he has 24 hours to
get married or lose a huge inheritance. The story, and the dollar
figures, were all updated from Keaton's version, but it is still at
heart a comedy, one that includes a shot of hundreds of women in
wedding gowns chasing O'Donnell down a San Francisco street.
</P>
<P>
   After New Line bought the script on spec, O'Donnell said, ``we
had to deal with everyone's notes on it.'' More writers were
brought in for rewrites, a director was hired and the setting was
changed from New York to San Francisco, for fear that the filming
would stretch into an East Coast winter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell has also just produced a television movie for CBS,
``The Miracle on the 17th Green,'' which is set for broadcast in
December. ``The whole TV side of the business is exciting,'' he
said. ``Business-wise, there's a lot of money to be made in TV, and
it is a business, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Drama in the Real
</P>
<P>
   When making a film based on an actual incident, it is necessary
to find the dramatic thread that holds the story together, that
allows it to be not merely a recitation of facts but a living drama
with characters who are fully rounded and who speak to that drama.
For Michael Mann, the director of ``The Insider,'' that discovery
came when he grasped some fundamental truths about the story's two
main characters: Jeffrey Wigand, the former tobacco executive
turned whistle-blower, and Lowell Bergman, the ``60 Minutes''
producer who persuaded him to spill the beans and then fought to
get the interview broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was looking for with Jeffrey was his psychology, what
he is obsessive about, what drives the man, why he did what he
did,'' said Mann. ``You don't look for how this man is like
everybody else. You look for how he's different.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal was not to make a documentary with actors, but to make
a drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film, as it relates to Jeffrey, has one and only one
motive _ to put you under the skin of Jeffrey, walking in his
shoes, through a dramatized battlefield and minefield of the
heart,'' Mann said. ``We don't pretend to be, nor do we want to be,
the complete historical record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider,'' which is to be released on Nov. 5 and is
generating a lot of early Oscar buzz, is not just Wigand's story,
though. It is also about the relationship between the
whistle-blower, played by Russell Crowe, and the producer, played
by Al Pacino. And, Mann said, it was in thinking about the
characters of the two men that he had the central insight that made
the story click for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an answer that was terribly interesting to me,'' he
said, ``which gets to the moment when I thought, `This truly is a
drama and I should make this film.' It's when I realized that
Jeffrey and Lowell are total opposites _ even their rhythms were
different _ that it was kind of a beautiful dramatic counterpoint.
They had only one thing in common.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, Mann said, was that the identities of both men were
deeply tied up in their actions, in what they did in life, and that
each of them had very definite limits beyond which he would not go.
Yet at the same time, he said, he did not want to present the men
as one-note heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not my intent that these are heroic moments at all,''
Mann said. ``It is a failure to read the film accurately to say
that these are romantic characters and heroic moments. They're not.
Jeffrey's character in the film is as flawed as everybody else, and
that's what made him attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Buy American
</P>
<P>
   For the French director Luc Besson, one of the advantages in
making his most recent films in English is that it allows him to
work with American actors. Francophiles may not like what he has to
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really so much better than French actors,'' said
Besson. ``When you can have a John Malkovich or a Dustin Hoffman or
a Faye Dunaway in your film, it is really so much stronger. We have
some good actors in France, but not like here.''
</P>
<P>
   All three of those actors are in ``The Messenger: The Joan of
Arc Story,'' Besson's latest film and something of a departure for
the director of ``The Professional'' and ``The Fifth Element.''
Besson said he began reading books about Joan of Arc a few years
ago and became obsessed with the subject. In the film, he hoped to
re-create as much as possible the reality of life and warfare in
medieval France, as well as the atmosphere of court intrigue and
spirituality. In the end, though, he found that he had to tone down
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see in the film is really so much milder than it
actually was,'' he said. ``It was horribly brutal, really. You
couldn't show it.''
</P>
<P>
   Have Card, Will Film
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the term they use, credit-card filmmaking?'' Glen Goei
asked as he made his way to the airport in Los Angeles after
several days of feverish promotion on ``That's the Way I Like It,''
his film about romance and disco dancing in Singapore in the 1970s.
``I took credit-card filmmaking to the absolute limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Goei lives in London, his parents are still in Singapore and he
has brothers in Australia, so he applied for and received credit
cards from each country, then ran them up to the limit to finance
his film, which the authorities in Singapore told him was the first
feature film to be shot there since 1990. ``The budget of the film
was a half million, and everything was in overdraft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goei had trouble finding a competent crew and decent, trained
actors; indeed, outside of the male lead, all of the roles in the
film were played by people who had never acted before. ``We had a
radio disk jockey, a guy who just left the army _ we just placed an
open call for auditions,'' Goei said. ``Now, all of them are acting
full time. I have that to answer for.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the film, Goei had directed only some small-scale theater
pieces in London. So it took a leap of faith to mortgage himself to
the hilt and shoot a disco movie back home in Singapore. Then,
through serendipity, someone saw his film in a lab in Sydney and
asked if he could take a copy and try to market it at the Cannes
Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the very first day, Harvey Weinstein happened to stumble
into a screening and bought the film,'' Goei said. ``He called me
up. At the time, I didn't know who Harvey Weinstein was.'' Goei
soon found out, and the check from Miramax helped him pay off his
entire credit-card debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all quite surreal,'' he said.

by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).

<P>
   `THE BEST MAN,' starring Taye Diggs, Morris Chestnut, Nia Long
and Harold Perrineau. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee (R, 118 minutes).
This feel-good ensemble film turns Diggs into a bespectacled but
hunky novelist en route to a friend's wedding. There he finds
temptation in the form of an old flame and a lot of genial guy talk
about the meaning of marriage. No problem here is too complicated
to be settled by a good-humored dance scene. Another demonstration
that current movies about upscale black characters have much more
solid traditional values than ones about catty white teen-agers
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hillary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberley Pierce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BRINGING OUT THE DEAD,' starring Nicolas Cage and Patricia
Arquette. Written by Paul Schrader from a novel by Joe Connelly.
Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 115 minutes). An intense, volatile
film full of sorrow and wild, mordant humor. This time it took prop
garbage on the streets of Hell's Kitchen to create a sufficiently
hellish ambiance for another nighttime tour of Manhattan. But
Scorsese has mellowed significantly since his ``Taxi Driver'' days,
and his uneven but impassioned, visually inventive new film is more
contemplative than it looks. Cage gives a fine, soulful performance
as a New York ambulance driver haunted by ghosts. Ving Rhames is a
major scene-stealer as one of his partners (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CRAZY IN ALABAMA,' starring Melanie Griffith and Lucas Black.
Directed by Antonio Banderas (PG-13, 104 minutes). Ms. Griffith, in
a black fright wig, plays a madcap murderess named Lucille who
heads from Alabama to California after disposing of her husband.
The film is set in 1965 and means to link Lucille's quest for
freedom with the civil rights movement. That's quite a stretch. The
star vamps gaudily, but at least bragging rights to the phrase
``the directorial debut of Antonio Banderas'' are within reason.
His direction is adequate and unobtrusive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DOUBLE JEOPARDY,' starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones and
Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Bruce Beresford (R, 106 minutes). In a
touristy thriller that roams from the coastline of Washington state
to the French Quarter of New Orleans, Ms. Judd plays a woman who is
free to kill her husband because she has already gone to prison for
the crime (see title). Not even she is beautiful enough to get away
with rote acting and a far-fetched plot, but she perks up as her
character becomes less of a victim. In this coed homage to ``The
Fugitive,'' Jones is on hand as another weathered sourpuss with a
knack for barking orders. Beresford directs so unremarkably that it
takes a line like ``I feel like I've grown in the last six years''
to signal the passage of time (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EARTH,' starring Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna and Maia
Sethna. Directed by Deepa Mehta (not rated, 99 minutes). It is 1947
and India is about to explode into ethnic violence as British
colonial rule ends and the country is partitioned into two nations,
mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. These momentous
changes are observed by Lenny (Ms. Sethna), the 8-year-old daughter
of a well-to-do Parsi family in Lahore. As Hindus, Muslims and
Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old friends become
deadly enemies. Caught in the middle is Shanta (Ms. Das), Lenny's
beautiful Hindu nanny, who has two Muslim suitors. The movie's
child's-eye view somewhat mutes its dramatic sweep (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `FIGHT CLUB,' starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena
Bonham Carter. Directed by David Fincher (R, 135 minutes). The
sardonic, testosterone-fueled science fiction of this grunge
parable means to hit raw nerves. Making a tougher but less
stomach-turning film than his earlier ``Seven,'' Fincher taps into
the nexus of computer-age malevolent fantasy and attempts to
psychoanalyze an entire culture in ways that aren't entirely clear
until the film's whammy of a denouement arrives. A reckless but
fascinating attempt, expertly acted, to make sense of contemporary
frustrations (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `JULIEN DONKEY-BOY,' starring Ewen Bremner, Chloe Sevigny and
Werner Herzog. Directed by Harmony Korine (R, 94 minutes). Working
in accordance with the Danish set of directorial strictures known
as Dogma '95, the enfant terrible director of ``Gummo'' finds
creative ways to bend the rules. Inventively and kinetically shot,
this film about a schizophrenic is vastly more interesting on its
visual merits than for its hazy, indulgent drama. As the ranting
father of the title character, Herzog goes enthusiastically over
the top. The luminous Ms. Sevigny remains Korine's secret weapon
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   `THE LIMEY,' starring Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda. Directed by
Steven Soderbergh (R, 89 minutes). From a director for whom the
quirky stylistic exercise is standard style, this is a handsome
throwback to the salad days of its two iconic stars. Stamp, in a
stony, magnetic performance punctuated by flashbacks to his early
career, plays an ex-con seeking revenge for the death of his
daughter. He becomes the nemesis of Fonda's slick Hollywood
hipster, in another role that's piquantly tailor-made. Soderbergh
resurrects the lean, hard-boiled look of John Boorman's ``Point
Blank'' as he dissects and considers these two tough customers from
every conceivable perspective (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LUCIE AUBRAC,' starring Carole Bouquet and Daniel Auteuil.
Directed by Claude Berri (R, 116 minutes). What lifts this taut
World War II thriller based on a true story above the ordinary are
the impassioned performances of Ms. Bouquet and Auteuil as Lucie
and Raymond, a married couple who are fighters in the French
Resistance. When Raymond is arrested by the Nazis and convicted of
war crimes, Lucie conceives an audacious plan for his escape. Ms.
Bouquet and Auteuil are as romantically intense as Bogey and
Bergman in ``Casablanca,'' but here the woman is the one who ends
up doing the thinking for both of them (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `RANDOM HEARTS,' starring Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott
Thomas. Directed by Sydney Pollack (R, 131 minutes). Pollack's
characteristically solid, incisive direction has become a throwback
to the days of subtler movie storytelling. But it still rivets
attention during the first half of this star-crossed romance, which
tells of two people who meet after their spouses die in the same
plane crash. The plot becomes very thick indeed when it develops
that the dead spouses were having an affair, and the survivors fall
into a bittersweet relationship of their own. Ford is taciturnly
forceful, Ms. Scott Thomas a shade too familiar, as
credulity-stretching complications ensue (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ROMANCE,' starring Caroline Ducey, Sagamore Stevenin, Francois
Berleand and Rocco Siffredi. Written and directed by Catherine
Breillat (not rated, 93 minutes). A solemn, sexually graphic
exploration of the nature of a woman's need for male attention and
erotic love, even if its insights are already familiar to readers
of Cosmopolitan and the Marquis de Sade. And it's doubtful that the
film's intellectual aspects would command the same attention if its
camera did not make the actors' genitals as familiar as their
faces. The carnal and cerebral erotica here have already achieved
the considerable feat of shocking France, but the film is often
stilted and methodical to the point of tediousness. It hovers
between passion and philosophical argument without often achieving
Ms. Breillat's ambition to fuse the two (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE,' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107 minutes).
What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy
(Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist
(Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age mush
(think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon Birch''). When you
trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story
doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note
performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Osment's
intense portrayal of the tormented child (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE STORY OF US,' starring Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer.
Directed by Rob Reiner (R, 90 minutes). The first unofficial Jack
Lemmon comedy for the baby boom generation. As an ode to the ups
and downs of middle-aged marriage, this arthritic suburban story is
enough to make single people want to file for divorce. Willis makes
iffy casting in the role of a sensitive father and husband, while
Ms. Pfeiffer is not well served by a role that makes her scream so
hard that her neck turns red. Together, with the help of noisy
friends and acquaintances, these two run through the long history
of a marriage with the help of a criminal set of wigs and
hairpieces. Small talk turns to matters like home repair jobs and
prostate trouble (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE STRAIGHT STORY,' starring Richard Farnsworth and Sissy
Spacek. Directed by David Lynch (G, 110 minutes). As the least
likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off a G-rated miracle, Lynch
rises to the challenge with exhilarating vigor. It may not sound
like much, but this account of an old man making a long trip on a
riding lawnmower turns out to be a slow moving, folksy looking,
deeply spiritual film with the power to hold audiences in thrall.
And as Oscar may well note next spring, it would not have been
possible without Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its
heart. Lynch's famously unwholesome imagination crosses a new
frontier to explore simple virtues and natural beauty. The result:
a supremely improbable triumph (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THREE KINGS,' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice
Cube. Written and directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes).
The prodigiously talented writer-director of ``Spanking the
Monkey'' and ``Flirting With Disaster'' has made a much more
ambitious film, with mixed results. His gimlet-eyed Persian Gulf
War film has a ``Catch-22'' absurdist edge, but it also has an
oversupply of visual affectations. Vertiginous music-video camera
tricks jazz up the otherwise straightforward story of American
soldiers who have larcenous designs on Saddam Hussein's captured
gold and then develop conscience pangs about their own roles in
Iraq. There are many clever peripheral touches, but there's
something tamely conventional at the film's core (Maslin).

   One Closing, a Second Likely
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a move likely to set off a Broadway theater grab,
one major Broadway musical confirmed a January closing while
another seemed poised to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The first is ``Ragtime,'' the Tony-winning epic of
turn-of-the-century America. The show, producers said, will end its
run at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts on Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is never easy to make the decision to close a show,'' said
Scott Zeiger of SFX Entertainment, the producer. ``This is
particularly true of `Ragtime.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ragtime'' still regularly ranks as one of Broadway's
highest-grossing shows. But it also carries one of the industry's
steepest weekly costs, sometimes more than $600,000, part of a
legacy of the fallen impresario Garth Drabinsky, who liked
grandiose effects and even grander contracts. The high cost was
acceptable when the show was grossing over $800,000, as it did for
much of last year. But of late the show's sales have slipped; last
week the gross was $600,240.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky, whose bankrupt company, Livent, was bought by SFX in
August, has been indicted on federal fraud charges and is fighting
extradition from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Zeiger's statement did not speak about creating a slimmed-down
version of ``Ragtime,'' although SFX officials have said that is a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, officials for ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' said this
week that they told their cast on Tuesday that it was likely the
show would close in January, before a national tour. Tim Hawkins,
its executive producer, said no final decision had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Baroness Orczy's 1905 tale of deception and derring-do
in the French Revolution, ``Pimpernel'' opened at the Minskoff
Theater in November 1997 to mixed reviews and sluggish box-office
figures. It soldiered on, however, until the fall of 1998, when its
original producers sold it to Cablevision, which hired new stars
and a new director and reworked several trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   It reopened in November to better reviews and box-office sales.
But the blush was soon off the rose, and in April the show closed
to make way for ``Saturday Night Fever.'' The plan was to cut its
ensemble to 29 actors from 41 and reopen a slimmer and better
version at the Neil Simon Theater this fall. All that fell into
place except for the bit about making the show better. Critics
called the latest ``Pimpernel,'' which opened on Sept. 9 and was
informally dubbed ``Version 3.0,'' an anemic imitation of the
musical's previous incarnations. Box-office sales, while slowly
improving, have hovered around $340,000 a week this month, just
below breaking even.
</P>
<P>
   Both closings would make Broadway houses available as several
musicals are looking for homes, including the revival of ``Jesus
Christ Superstar,'' rumored for the Ford Center, the revival of
``The Music Man,'' and ``Wise Guys,'' the new Stephen Sondheim/John
Weidman musical, which starts a ``developmental workshop
production'' Friday at New York Theater Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   An Eyebrow Fan Club
</P>
<P>
   You probably don't know Jason Antoon's name, but if you've seen
``Contact,'' now playing at Lincoln Center, you know his eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Antoon, 27, plays several characters in the musical, but the
most memorable is a knowing barkeep whose undulating brow signals
that something a bit unusual might be going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now have an eyebrow fan club,'' Antoon said deadpan. ``I
have it on my resume as a joke, but I think it clinched the part.''
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles native and a former surfer, Antoon studied acting
at Carnegie Mellon University before coming to New York in the
mid-1990s. (His uncle was the late A.J. Antoon, the director,
though the two met only once.)
</P>
<P>
   In New York he found work as an understudy on two off-Broadway
shows, covering three roles in ``Picasso at the Lapin Agile'' and
four characters in ``Scapin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess ultimately I'm a character actor,'' Antoon said. ``I'm
not the blond-haired, blue-eyed guy. I'm not the guy staring at the
tree and falling in love with the girl. I'm his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Those character skills are put to good use in ``Contact,'' where
Antoon also takes turns as a glowering husband and as the voices of
three other characters on an answering machine: a British agent, a
drunk friend and a passive-aggressive therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Considering his previous gigs, Antoon says he is as surprised as
anyone to have a leading role in a musical. ``When I walked into
the first rehearsal, I'm in my actor clothes, which are basically
my clothes, and everybody else is in tights with their legs over
their head,'' he said. ``I'm like, `Why is everybody singing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley to Broadway
</P>
<P>
   The theater season is becoming a political season.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of Monday's ``Broadway for Hillary'' bash, which
raised $1 million for Mrs. Clinton's as-yet-unannounced Senate
campaign, another prominent Democratic candidate, this one for
president, is coming to see a show _ and collect some checks.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Bill Bradley will attend a benefit performance of
``Kiss Me, Kate'' at the Martin Beck Theater, with tickets running
from $250 to $1,000 (similar to Mrs. Clinton's rates). The
performance is being organized by the producers Rocco Landesman,
Emanuel Azenberg and Roger Berlind.
</P>
<P>
   It will also, presumably, include the type of quality face time
that donors love; at Mrs. Clinton's event, a 15-minute intermission
ran long as a throng descended on the first lady and President
Clinton, who also attended. They sat house right; no word yet on
Bradley's position.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ Leave it to Spalding Gray to open a show on Halloween. Gray's
latest monologue, ``Morning, Noon and Night,'' opens at the Vivian
Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center on Sunday. It will be seen on
Sundays and Mondays through Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edgar Oliver, the East Village's crepuscular performance poet,
will lead a creepy ensemble in a one-night-only showing of ``Chop
Off Your Ear'' on Tuesday at the Angel Oransanz Foundation, 172
Norfolk St.

RELEASED IMMIGRANT URGES CONGRESS TO END USE OF SECRET EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Palestinian immigrant mistakenly held by a
government agency for 19 months on secret evidence accusing him of
terrorism Thursday urged Congress Thursday to outlaw such actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just could not believe that something like this could happen
in America,'' said Hany Kiareldeen, who was detained by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service in two New Jersey jails on
allegations that he had links to terrorists and had plotted to kill
Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to tell them they were wrong, but they wouldn't listen
and then they wouldn't even show the evidence against me,'' said
Kiareldeen, who has lived in the United States since 1990 and who
worked in an electronics store in Passaic, N.J., before he was
jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen, 31, had become a national test case of the INS's
ability to detain and deport immigrants based on evidence they are
not allowed to see and witnesses they cannot question.
</P>
<P>
   The INS arrested Kiareldeen in March 1998 for overstaying a
student visa. Soon afterward, the agency accused him of plotting to
kill Reno and of hosting a meeting with the New York World Trade
Center bombers a week before the 1993 attack. But he was never
charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   During his immigration hearings, Kiareldeen, a native of Gaza,
used rent receipts, phone records and other testimony to show that
he did not live at the address of the alleged meeting and that he
was not planning to kill Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Newark, N.J., U.S. District Judge William Walls
ruled that detaining an immigrant on the basis of secret evidence
was unconstitutional, and Kiareldeen was ordered freed. A
three-judge immigration appeals board delayed Kiareldeen's release
until Monday to give the Justice Department _ the INS' parent
agency _ a last chance to decide if it wanted to continue pressing
its case. The department declined to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, the Department said that it and INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner believed ``that after submitting the
evidence to an immigration judge and the board, the process has
taken its course, and as a result the department has decided not to
take the extraordinary step of appealing the board's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS, which has about 300,000 removal proceedings pending,
has used secret evidence in about two dozen cases to detain
immigrants in recent years, according to agency officials.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Rep. David E. Bonior, D-Mich., speaking at a news
conference here, called on Congress to pass the Secret Evidence
Repeal Act of 1999, which would ban the secret evidence in
immigration cases.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior said Congress mistakenly gave the INS authority to use
secret evidence when it passed the 1996 Anti-terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act in the wake of the April 19, 1995,
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City that
killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
   He said the only effective solution to cases like Kiareldeen's
would be to eradicate the practice of using secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hany Kiareldeen's release will be a hollow victory unless we
permanently discard this law,'' said Bonior, a co-sponsor of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's other co-sponsor, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said
he was confident Congress will pass the proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most members of Congress have no idea that this is allowed,
and when I tell them about it, they're outraged and ask immediately
how they can help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday Kiareldeen reiterated his previous testimony
that he is not political or religious, does not know any of the men
convicted in the bombing, and did not know who Reno was until he
was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to live my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen's lawyer, David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown
University, said it was ``unbelievable'' that the INS is continuing
to use its secret evidence authority after a judge ruled it was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the two dozen similar INS cases in recent years,
Cole said it was a ``tragedy'' that Kiareldeen ``lost more than a
year of his life, and, yet, there are many others still sitting in
jail without the right to even see the evidence that's keeping them
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Aly R. Abuzaakouk, the executive director of the American Muslim
Council, a Washington-based advocacy group, applauded the release
of Kiareldeen, but said he believed it would not force the
immigration agency to change its policy. He said the only thing
that would end those practices and repair the damage they had done
to Arab-Americans and Muslims would be the passage of the
Campbell-Bonior bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in our community are aware of secret evidence, and it
is having a chilling effect on their expressing themselves on
issues,'' Abuzaakouk said.
</P>
<P>
   But Donald Mueller, a spokesman for the immigration service,
said the agency's decision to release Kiareldeen did not mean that
it would abandon the use of secret evidence altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to use this authority when national
security is at stake,'' Mueller said.

CONE STAYS, BUT WILL HE REALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. ews Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees were 90 minutes into their new
yet continuous reign as World Series champions and David Cone was
standing near the first-base line at Yankee Stadium doing
television interviews. Except for some reporters, security guards,
police officers and the ever-accommodating Cone, the Stadium was
mostly barren.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not stop Cone from staying on the field and trying
to squeeze something more out of an amazing Wednesday night that
had turned into Thursday morning. For Cone, who does not know if he
will pitch again for the Yankees, the experience could go on and
on. He did not want to think about removing his champagne-soaked
pinstripes, so he prolonged the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was ushered from the interviews by two security guards, but
they might as well have been mannequins to the player who is the
Yankee of the people. When he reached the dugout, a few fans pushed
baseballs toward him and he deliberately signed each one, squeezing
a few more minutes out of the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen police officers surrounded Cone on the top step of the
dugout and begged him to pose for pictures with them. Like a
gregarious New Yorker, he was not just in the picture. He was the
picture. He inserted himself into the middle of this blue wall,
leaned into the officers and played to the cameras like he was at
the annual family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going through my mind is to enjoy this night for what
it is and really soak it up,'' Cone said. ``I honestly don't know
what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   There was elation and confusion in his voice _ so excited to win
a second straight World Series, so puzzled about where he will
pitch next season. For five years he has been the most vocal Yankee
and one of many reasons they have won three of the last four World
Series titles; this season, he provided a signature Yankee moment
when he pitched a perfect game against Montreal on July 18.
</P>
<P>
   But the future is fuzzy. Early Thursday morning, he was still a
Yankee, still squeezing out memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel lucky,'' Cone said. ``I feel very privileged and very
humbled to be a part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, he was standing in the runway between the dugout
and the clubhouse, a quiet place that had been raucous two hours
earlier. The police had finished snapping pictures with him, so now
he stopped and chatted with a handful of reporters. He was about 15
feet from a blue and white sign above the runway that includes a
quotation from Joe DiMaggio: ``I want to thank the good Lord for
making me a Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   It was appropriate that Cone stopped so close to the quotation
because Cone has indicated he would love to stay with the Yankees.
But the Yankees have numerous off-season decisions to make to keep
their payroll in control, and George Steinbrenner and Cone have
both admitted the decision over his status will be delicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to talk about that at this moment,''
Steinbrenner said Thursday. ``We have to sleep on what we're going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone added: ``It's pretty unpredictable. I've had the time of my
life playing for the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone was emotional during the American League division series,
discussing how he might not fit in anymore and hinting that a
Yankee official had told him he would not be part of plans for next
season. Cone rambled for almost an hour that day, using reporters
as amateur psychologists and wondering why his 12-9 record and 3.44
earned run average might not be enough to keep him with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, it seemed more than conceivable that Cone would
not return. But he went from not pitching in the division series to
pitching two impressive games in the league Championship Series and
the World Series, going 2-0 with a 1.29 ERA. Even Cone admitted
that the postseason is what really matters to the Yankees and those
starts ``really can determine your future here.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who has spoken to Cone said he would surely return if
the Yankees offered him the same contract he had this season, for
$8 million and an additional $1.5 million in incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Cone will be 37 in January. Though a two-year offer from the New
York Mets or the Baltimore Orioles might seem tempting, he is in
the midst of an historic period with a team that should be favored
to win the World Series again. But Cone, who admitted the Yankees
``probably could have gotten me for less last year,'' will most
likely have to accept less than $9.5 million to stay.
</P>
<P>
   If Steinbrenner had seen how Cone meandered from television
camera to television camera on the field, then stopped in the
dugout with the fans and the officers, and then remained in the
runway with the reporters, it would have been especially apparent
to him how much Cone loves being a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   Cone said he felt ``very blessed'' because for four months in
1996 he did not know if aneurysm surgery would prevent him from
throwing a baseball again. But after having the aneurysm removed
from his right armpit, he helped lead the Yankees to their first
world championship in the '90s. Now, after career-threatening
surgery, arthroscopic surgery, several cortisone shots and a
perfect game, he leaned against a wall in the runway and discussed
the magnificence of three World Series rings within four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just seems like the culmination of so much emotion and so
much drama,'' he said. ``Back to my aneurysm surgery, to Joe
Torre's situation in spring training, all the way up to today with
Paul O'Neill's father dying. The clubhouse was a little eerie after
the victory. There was so much relief and grown men crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone let loose some of those emotions in his own way. He kept
buzzing from place to place at the Stadium, grabbing for more and
more images while slowly winding down another special season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year was much more difficult,'' he admitted. ``There was
so much emotion. I think everyone feels such relief that we were
able to continue this run that we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he glanced ahead and said, ``And now, nobody knows what's
going to happen.'' With that, he cruised up the runway and into the
clubhouse, where some of his teammates still remained, to squeeze a
little more out of part of his that he did not want to end.

INS CUTS TIME IT TAKES TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Immigration and Naturalization Service, which
faces a persistent backlog in citizenship requests, said Thursday
it now takes immigrants just one year to have their applications
considered.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last October, the INS took an average of 28
months to consider an application fully, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner told reporters that the agency's
efforts to expedite requests are not complete and that she plans to
cut the processing time further, to six months, by next October.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas and an outspoken INS critic,
assailed as a ``gross misrepresentation'' Meissner's claim that the
agency ever took an average of 28 months to process applications.
Instead, the INS has taken on average 14 months, said Smith, who
chairs the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims,
which oversees the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Additional resources provided by Congress combined with a
declining number of citizenship applications have helped the INS to
process more citizenship requests,'' Smith said. ``But this (issue)
is not about statistics and bar charts; it is about serving people,
which this administration needs to do better. It seems to me a
reasonable goal to process citizenship applications in 90 days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Meissner rejected the claim that the number of applications
has declined, noting that more than 6.4 million immigrants applied
for citizenship between 1993 and 1999, exceeding the total number
of applicants during the previous 37 years.
</P>
<P>
   INS received 720,468 citizenship applications during fiscal year
1999, which ended Sept. 30, and expects to receive 700,000 this
fiscal year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal year 1999, 872,485 immigrants became naturalized U.S.
citizens, the INS reported.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to increasing the speed of processing, INS has
raised the number of citizenship requests it considers annually,
Meissner said. The agency handled more than 1.25 million of the
approximately 2.6 million pending applications in fiscal year 1999,
compared to handling 610,547 during the prior year, the INS chief
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner attributed the INS' improved processing time to an
enhanced computer system, additional federal funding to handle
applications and the hiring of 200 more adjudicators.
</P>
<P>
   ``An avalanche of applications had overwhelmed understaffed
offices'' by last October, Meissner said. ``An agency needs to
react, and we've reacted.''
</P>
<P>
   INS has been under heavy pressure from members of Congress,
particularly those who represent large immigrant districts, to
expedite citizenship requests. Congress, at Meissner's request,
earmarked $175 million to the INS last year to help the agency
handle applications.
</P>
<P>
   This year the INS seeks an additional $124 million for
application processing. But President Clinton and Congress have yet
to reach accord on INS funding.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton this week vetoed funding legislation for the departments
of Justice, Commerce and State, saying the measure lacked
sufficient funds for police and for paying off the U.S. debt to the
United Nations. The INS is a Justice Department agency.

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
Bush/``The Science of Things'' (Trauma/Interscope) On Bush's third album, frontman Gavin Rossdale, the bubble-grunge
Brad Pitt, is worried about the ``urang-a-tans.'' At least he's got
a cause. The ``urang-a-tans'' song, the ridiculously titled ``The
Disease of the Dancing Cats,'' is just one example from an album
and band that tries so hard to be edgy that the cumulative effect
makes you wonder if Rossdale is merely putting us on.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The London quartet's midtempo stop-start rhythms, dynamics and
cringe-a-minute lyrics continue to posit Bush as a Nirvana/Pixies
knockoff for the alienated end of the Britney Spears demo, but this
time they've missed the melodies and hooks.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the tuneless current hit, ``The Chemicals Between
Us,'' and possibly album-opener ``Warm Machine,'' it doesn't seem
likely ``The Science of Things'' will add much to Bush's collection
of radio songs (``Everything Zen,'' ``Little Things,''
``Glycerine,'' ``Comedown'') that stations like KROQ are apparently
mandated to spin every 20 minutes. Hey Gavin, nice guitar noise,
though. (2 stars)

<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Willie Nelson/``Night and Day'' (Freefalls/Pedernales) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's first instrumental album is a lovely, low-key affair
featuring a host of longtime collaborators from his Family band.
Nelson clearly signals his intentions with the opening numbers,
``Nuages'' and ``Vous Et Moi,'' songs associated with legendary
gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt. With fiddler Johnny Gimble making
like Stephane Grappelli, Nelson engagingly works his way through
jaunty selections like ``Sweet Georgia Brown'' and Reinhardt's
arrangement of the title track. Nelson, who will perform next month
in Thousand Oaks and Cerritos, displays affection and understanding
for the classic material, and it shows in this distinctive release.
(3 stars)

 &QL; 
Soundtrack/``Rob Zombie Presents ... The Words &AMP; Music of
Frankenstein'' (Zombie A-Go-Go/Hip-O) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's alive ... ALIVE!'' Frankenstein's monster lives again on
this journey through three classic horror films that have
fascinated audiences for nearly 70 years. The disc, released just
in time for Halloween, is a highly entertaining montage of quotable
dialogue and grandiose score segments selected by monster fan
Zombie from the films ``Frankenstein'' (1931) and two sequels,
``The Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935) and ``Son of Frankenstein''
(1939). Included is a 22-page booklet jammed with behind-the-scenes
photos and reproductions of the films' poster art. (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Matthew Sweet/``In Reverse'' (Volcano) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sweet's uneven new project might disappoint fans hoping for a
reprise of the note-perfect pop of his widely praised 1991
masterpiece, ``Girlfriend,'' but it offers some mighty impressive
moments nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Peppered throughout these 14 tracks are gems like ``Faith in
You,'' which suggests Sweet could revisit his previous poptastic
glory at the drop of a guitar pick despite the ambitious Phil
Spector-ish wall-of-sound production that dominates ``In Reverse.''
While the effect is stunning on ``I Should Never Have Let You
Know'' and ``Worse to Live,'' the nine-minute ``Thunderstorm''
falls flat.
</P>
<P>
   Pop archeologists should note the presence of Carol Kaye, who
played bass on ``Pet Sounds'' and countless other '60s and '70s
classics. (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike Murphy &QR; 
 &QL; 
Eurythmics/``Peace'' (Arista) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The echo of ``Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)'' that
Scottish-born diva Annie Lennox inserts into ``17 Again,'' the
opening cut of this botched reunion record, only demonstrates how
far this project is from the wit and melodic invention of the duo's
'80s heyday. The album unfortunately has a by-numbers feel, and
where earlier songs burst with ideas, ``Peace'' feels like a so-so
solo effort from Lennox or Eurythmics partner Dave Stewart. Buy the
greatest hits instead. (2 stars)
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young/``Looking Forward'' (Reprise) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Songs about the ``first rays of sun breaking through our
windowpane'' and Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young reunions are
generally best avoided. The tepid ``Looking Forward'' breaks both
rules. This dull album attempts to trade on past glories while
rarely recalling CSN's groundbreaking debut, or the equally
marvelous second album that brought Y into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   While the quartet's background harmonies are often still strong,
the songs borrow from a number of sources. Stills' ``Seen Enough''
gives Bob Dylan a co-writing credit since it leans on the
``Subterranean Homesick Blues'' melody for the verses. Crosby's
``Stand and Be Counted'' was apparently influenced by Tom Petty's
``Mary Jane's Last Dance,'' and Young apparently borrowed his own
``Heart of Gold'' for ``Slowpoke.'' (1 1/2 stars)
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuser &QR; 
 &QL; 
Various/``Verve Elite Edition Collectors' Disc 1954-65'' (Verve) &QL; 
Herb Ellis and Jimmy Giuffre/``Herb Ellis Meets Jimmy Giuffre''
(Verve) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Compilations aren't usually of much interest to jazz fans, who
tend to be completists favoring entire albums in their original
form. But the ``Elite Edition Collectors' Disc 1954-65'' (3 stars)
succeeds, gathering fascinating outtakes of familiar tunes from
greats like Louis Armstrong, Bill Evans, Coleman Hawkins and Oscar
Peterson. The record is part of a limited series, as is the 1959
Ellis/Giuffre collaboration. Joined by a stellar lineup including
Bud Shank, Art Pepper and Jim Hall, Giuffre pits his dark saxophone
lines against Ellis' sunny, melodic guitar. Needless to say, given
the talent involved, this meeting was a very good idea. (3 stars)
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
Method Man &AMP; Redman/``Blackout!'' (Island Def Jam) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wu-Tang Clan's Method Man and the Def Squad's Redman first
collaborated on the 1995 hit single ``How High'' (included here as
a remix). This pungent hard-core rap summit will please fans of the
genre, while various cameos ensure nobody gets tired of the same
two voices.
</P>
<P>
   Imaginative production by the duo, along with Erick Sermon and
Wu-Tang's RZA on such standouts as ``Mic Checka,'' ``Well All Rite
Cha'' and the title track, should keep this one alive through the
holidays. (3 stars)

&HT;        BILL TO FUND VALLEY WILDLIFE REFUGE HANGS IN BALANCE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 - An Interior Department spending bill that
funds the Lower Rio Grande National Wildlife Refuge and Corpus
Christi's coastal bend does not do enough for the environment,
according to President Clinton, who is expected to veto the measure
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The way the bill stands now, the wildlife refuge would receive
$2 million for land acquisition, a 25 percent increase over last
year's funding. It also includes $823,000 for the construction of a
wastewater treatment facility at the Padre Island National Seashore
at Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Democrats don't like the bill because Congress
cut $196 million from the $442 million that Clinton requested for
the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which funds land acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a veto, Congress would have to reconsider the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Corpus Christi, who had pushed other
lawmakers to fund the two projects, said both the refuge and the
water facility deserve to be included in whatever final spending
bill is approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to the economy, it brings a lot of tourism to
the area, and at the same time, you are working for the
environment,'' Ortiz said of the refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service uses federal money to buy
property bordering on the 100,000 acre, four-county refuge. The
service and environmental organizations would like to acquire up to
132,000 acres, most of which is now farmland.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the principal (land tract) that we are interested in
finishing out now,'' said Mary Lou Campbell, an environment
advocate from Mercedes who is conservation chair for the Sierra
Club's Lower Rio Grande Valley. ``It's very important that congress
appropriate this money.''
</P>
<P>
   The refuge is one of the most biologically diverse areas in the
nation -- home to nearly 500 different species of birds.
</P>
<P>
   The area is threatened by the rampant clearing of trees so that
the land can be used for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 95 percent of the four-county area has been cleared
or altered,'' said Nancy Brown, public outreach specialist for the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   The interior bill lacked funds for land acquisition at the Palo
Alto Battlefield National Historic Site, which has a battlefield
from the Mexican-American War.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Congress will add this money when
it takes reconsiders the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz said he was disappointed the historic site was overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budgets are tight,'' he said. ``But this is part of our
history, so we are going to try [to fund it].''

BARGAIN-HUNTING INVESTORS POUNCE ON BANKRUPT NIKKO ELECTRIC  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The vultures are coming! The vultures are coming! The
``vultures'' are investors who specialize in buying bankrupt and
distressed assets, and two of the top vultures are Rothschild
Recovery Fund, a private equity fund run by Rothschild Inc., and
Japan Recovery Capital Partners, which is managed by a joint
venture of Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Bank.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, they are expected to announce plans for a
reorganization of Nikko Electric Industry Co., an automotive parts
supplier that has the distinction of being the first Japanese
company this century to be put into bankruptcy by its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Such investors, most of them Americans, have been circling Japan
for the last few years, but most have limited themselves to making
investments related to real estate.
</P>
<P>
   So Rothschild's move to take over Nikko Electric is yet another
foray by a foreigner that would have been unthinkable in the
Japanese economy of even two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will open a new direction for other bankruptcies
and distressed corporations in Japan,'' said Wilbur Ross, senior
managing director of Rothschild Inc. and an eminence grise of the
U.S. bankruptcy system.
</P>
<P>
   But Ross and his partners intend to modify the standard U.S.
blueprint for reorganizing a bankrupt company. They are inviting
some of Nikko Electric's biggest suppliers, which include Delco
Remy International, Komatsu, Isuzu Motors and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, to become investors along with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would make it more like the Japanese system, where
customers and vendors traditionally have counter-invested in each
other,'' Ross said. ``We're trying to blend American techniques
with the historical way things are done in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan runs counter to current trends in Japan, where even the
most staid companies are starting to shed their
cross-shareholdings.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild and Japan Recovery say, however, that giving Nikko's
customers a stake in the potential upside of the deal will insure
their good will _ and continued business.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they can coax Nikko Electric's lenders into writing off
a substantial portion of the outstanding debt may be a bigger
challenge, although Ross said the banks in general had been
supporting his plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikko Electric bankruptcy is known in Japan because of the
unusual way the company ended up under the administration of a
court-appointed trustee. Japan is one of the few countries in the
world where employees can petition the court to put their company
under its care without management's agreement; Nikko Electric's
employees did just that earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   They contended that the company, which has annual revenue of
roughly 90 billion yen ($864 million ) and about 15 billion yen
($144 million) in liabilities, was badly mismanaged and too focused
on gaining market share at the expense of products.
</P>
<P>
   After going to the company and doing an assessment of the
employees' claims, the judges at the Tokyo District Court decided
to dismiss the management and appoint Jinjiro Suzuki, a lawyer, as
trustee.

HOUSE VOTES TO REDUCE FUNDING FOR HIV PREVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Thursday voted to cut spending for
AIDS prevention, drawing a rebuke from critics who say the
reduction is ill-timed because of the high rates of infection among
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The provision for cutting the program by $25 million, to $139
million from $164 million, was tucked into the bill that funds the
departments of Labor and Health and Human Services. The House
approved the reduction 218 to 211 and the Senate is expected to
follow suit despite a veto threat from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for blacks and gay organizations expressed outrage at
the House action.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Donna M. Christian-Christensen, the nonvoting
representative from the Virgin Islands who focuses on health policy
for the Congressional Black Caucus, said more money is needed to
fight the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. She said the AIDS
virus is ``running rampant through the African-American
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian-Christensen, a Democrat, said the cut ``flies in the
face of what we know is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the Congressional Black Caucus AIDS Initiative
last year to bolster prevention and treatment among minorities. The
money is part of an estimated $7 billion that the federal
government spends each year on a wide range of AIDS prevention
programs.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Congressional Black Caucus had asked the
government for a huge increase _ $349 million _ for prevention
programs for blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Pacific islanders and
American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides personnel and medications and advice for
prevention and treatment services in cities such as Atlanta,
Chicago, New York and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While blacks represent 13 percent of the population, they
account for roughly half of all new HIV infections, AIDS cases and
AIDS deaths, according to October reports from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Researchers estimate
that between 240,000 and 325,000 blacks are infected with the
virus, amounting to 1 in 50 black men and 1 in 160 black woman.
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanics represent 11.5 percent of the population, the
Centers for Disease Control estimates that they account for 20
percent of the new HIV infections.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths from AIDS have been declining in the overall population,
falling by 42 percent in 1997 and 20 percent in 1998. However, the
rate of death from AIDS for blacks declined only 35 percent in 1997
and 17 percent in 1998, according to the Centers for Disease
Control.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is an affliction
in which the human immunodeficiency virus weakens the immune
system, subjecting the body to serious infection. AIDS is most
often spread through sexual contact, sharing contaminated needles
and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the Human Rights
Campaign, criticized Congress for reducing funding for HIV and AIDS
programs for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of rising HIV infections in communities of color
and in the face of a slower decline in AIDS deaths rates in
communities of color, this $25 million cut is unconscionable and
clearly shows the disregard that some people have for people who
are living with HIV and AIDS,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lew, a member of the president's advisory council on HIV
and AIDS, said the new federal program targeting money for minority
HIV prevention has just begun taking root.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum has just begun,'' said Lew, who is from San
Francisco. ``To go back on it in the second year is really sending
the wrong message.''

`THE DEAD:' A MUSICAL THAT DARES TO BE QUIET

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes a murmur is more startling than a shout.
For its first enchanted hour, ``James Joyce's `The Dead,''' the new
stage adaptation of the classic short story at Playwrights
Horizons, makes a sterling virtue out of a trait rarely associated
with American musicals: shyness.
</P>
<P>
   In reconceiving Joyce's great, elegiac tale of a Christmastime
gathering in gaslight-era Dublin, this production, which opened
Thursday night, achieves a soft-spoken, hesitant air of intimacy
that has you leaning forward like a fascinated eavesdropper.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying a group of friends and relatives assembled for a
Yuletide feast of shared songs and stories, the actors, led by
Christopher Walken and Blair Brown, seem to be pitching their
performances to one another, rather than to anyone beyond the
proscenium, and even this is realized with a gentle, uncertain
quality that would send Ethel Merman into shock. In a genre
characterized by brassy extroversion, ``The Dead'' is a quiet
revolutionary: a musical that dares to be diffident.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, this show, which has a book by Richard Nelson and a
score by Shaun Davey, is far from perfect. Midway through, it takes
a jolting wrong turn into overstatement and sentimentality.
Mercifully, this doesn't tarnish the affecting originality of the
evening's first half. ``The Dead,'' which was directed by Nelson
and Jack Hofsiss (who left the production early this month), is as
lopsided as a lean-to. But when a musical successfully claims new
ground these days, it is reason to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The last and best-known of the stories that make up Joyce's
``Dubliners,'' ``The Dead'' would scarcely seem to lend itself to
easy dramatization. Its most momentous occurences are shifts in
perception in the mind of its central character, the teacher and
writer Gabriel Conroy (here played by Walken). Nonetheless, the
director John Huston, in his last movie, caught exactly the
elusive, lambent mood of the story, conjuring the pathos of
characters tethered to a realm of shadows, the dead of the title,
that they are destined to join.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's version is, oddly enough, at its weakest when it tries
hardest to transmit this sensibility. Calling the show ``James
Joyce's `The Dead,''' while considerately awarding Joyce the
titular status of commercial heavyweights like Stephen King and
Judith Krantz, is to some degree deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments of true epiphany here. But they are less
Joycean flashes of unbidden insight than visions of ordinary people
transported by the powers of music. Defined with both delicacy and
exhilaration, such moments recall the inspiriting eruption into
dance by the provincial sisters in Brian Friel's ``Dancing at
Lughnasa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dead'' takes place mostly during the annual Christmas
party of the elderly Morkan sisters, Kate (Marni Nixon) and Julia
(Sally Ann Howes), and their niece, Mary Jane (Emily Skinner), all
of whom teach music. Joyce's tale is infused with references to
singers and composers and prominently features two traditional
songs. Davey has provided his own substitutes for these, adapted
from Irish poems, and added a host of other numbers. Some are of
the classic organic-musical variety, in which speech melts into
song; the other, and better, efforts are conceived as parlor
pieces, performed as entertainment by those at the party.
</P>
<P>
   The night's signal event, in which Gabriel realizes he has never
truly known his wife, Gretta (Ms. Brown), has been radically
reconfigured by Nelson, and the physical indications of mortality
in the story dramatically scaled up, with Aunt Julia now
conspicuously ill, rather than merely frail.
</P>
<P>
   These deviations are not necessarily improvements, and the
script itself is hardly the best work of Nelson (``Some Americans
Abroad,'' ``Goodnight Children Everywhere''). Nor do the songs of
Davey, who wrote the lyrics with Nelson, stand securely on their
own. The band of musicians, directed by Charles Prince, plays with
unobtrusive moodiness, but the songs' strength has everything to do
with how they are sung.
</P>
<P>
   This means with considerable self-consciousness and little
obvious professional polish, though the cast features singers of
well-honed skills from three generations, from Ms. Nixon (famous
for providing the singing voices of stars like Audrey Hepburn and
Natalie Wood on film) to Daisy Eagan, the young Tony-winning star
of the Broadway musical ``The Secret Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone is indelibly set when the three Misses Morkan lead off
the evening's preprandial songfest with a trio. They are initially
a bit stiff, even embarrassed, in need of the touches of
reassurance they give one another. Their singing, while sweet, is
faltering. For these very reasons, the number, like many of those
that follow, is inexpressibly moving and an unmediated expression
of character rare in musicals.
</P>
<P>
   For roughly the next hour of the play's intermissionless 100
minutes, this sense of song weaving awkwardly through the prosaic,
repetitive business of a party that changes little from year to
year is wonderfully sustained, and it is a compliment to say that
you are rarely aware of the period scenery (David Jenkins),
costumes (Jane Greenwood) or the subtly shifting lighting (Jennifer
Tipton). One of the guests or hostesses may leave the stage while
others are singing; uneasy glances and whispers are exchanged; Mary
Jane sheds silent tears when her Aunt Julia forgets the words to a
song she has long known.
</P>
<P>
   The duet performed by the Conroys (with charming choreography by
Sean Curran), in which Gretta exudes womanly warmth while Gabriel
gives off a distancing awareness of his limitations, is a whole
portrait of a marriage in miniature. The sexually tinged friction
between Gabriel and the young, politically minded Molly Ivors
(Alice Ripley) is provocatively limned in a rousing ditty about
Parnell. The plaintive eagerness of Freddie Malins (Stephen
Spinella), a drunk of a middle-aged boy, is given stirringly
rough-hewn life in a jaunty barroom song.
</P>
<P>
   Spinella performs this number with his back to the audience,
underscoring the sense of our being allowed a privileged glimpse
into a closed world. It is impossible to sort out what in the
inspired mise en scene comes from Hofsiss and what from Nelson, but
there is a generous reciprocity among the actors, a sense of each
being aware of the slightests of mood among the others.
</P>
<P>
   Walken, an actor known to make a diet of chewed scenery, is
magnetically low-key here, and the tone matches the defensiveness
and intellectual detachment of the Gabriel of Joyce's story. Even
when he steps outside of the play to address the audience, Walken
somehow projects an intense inwardness. It's an eccentric
performance, for sure, but more often than not it works.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, who has come solidly into her own as a stage actress
in the last year or so, is Walken's perfect foil, vibrantly
maternal and sensual. She is earthier than Anjelica Huston was in
her more enigmatic take on the character in the movie, and this
feeds nicely into the evening's central theme of hidden life
beneath commonplace surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a visiting opera singer, the performance artist John Kelly
seems a tad too exotic, though he also gives off an engagingly
humble restraint. Ms. Ripley and Ms. Skinner (who was in ``Side
Show'') and Spinella are all first-rate, and Ms. Nixon and Ms.
Howes, who bring to the show their own nimbus of a life in musical
theater, are deeply touching.
</P>
<P>
   It's when ``The Dead'' breaks the rhythmic domestic flow of the
party, overstating elements that are already eloquently implicit,
that the production deflates. Certainly, the sugary duet between
Aunt Julia and her younger self (Ms. Eagan) could be eliminated.
Davey has not found the music to match either Gretta's great
revelation after the party or Gabriel's reaction to it. What should
be the show's emotional climax feels like an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's real pinnacle has been scaled some time before.
This happens when after dinner the prim Kate and Julia unexpectedly
break out into a slightly risque, musical-hall style number,
``Naughty Girls.'' The initial astonishment of their guests gives
way to intoxicated delight. Soon, they have all joined hands in a
flowing, ecstatic line of movement that brings to mind Matisse's
famous ``Dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   That the revelry is abruptly terminated only enhances the
joyousness of what has occurred before. Such moments of
transcendence are, as Joyce well knew, as close to heaven as
humanity ever comes.

official in charge of homeless services expressed concern Thursday
that a new work requirements for homeless people might wrongly
deprive some families of shelter. By Nina Bernstein.

 &HT;    No time of mourning for Atlanta sports fans
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Time for a brief pause in weeping over the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has captured a bevy of top sports events in the 1990s
and more is on the way, from the Super Bowl next year to the NCAA
Men's Basketball Final Four in 2002 and again in 2007. And
Atlanta's boosters say they will bid for more, including The
Goodwill Games in 2005 and Super Bowls in 2005 and 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta has every right to be proud,'' says Frank Stadulis,
president of the United Sports Fans of America, a Florida-based
national association for fans. ``They are overall a fan-friendly
city.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s made for a remarkable turnaround in a city dubbed
Losersville by Sports Illustrated in 1988. The magazine was taking
aim at what up to then had been the pathetic performances of
Atlanta's professional sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed. This year, the Atlanta Falcons made it to
the Super Bowl. The Atlanta Braves have been in five of the last
eight World Series, though they have a record there of 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name me another city that has had two of its teams in the
finals in the same year,'' says Gary Stokan, president of the
Atlanta Sports Council, which has helped lead the charge to host
more events.
</P>
<P>
   But Stokan likes best talking about sporting events that have
come to Atlanta regardless of which teams are playing.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, according to the local sports council, is the sports
capital of the world. That's the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other city in the world has had the Olympics, the Final
Four and the Super Bowl,'' Stokan says, pausing only briefly to
acknowledge that the Final Four and the Super Bowl aren't played in
other countries. ``Debate me. Look at the events we are bringing
in. Look at the economic impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The sports council says that in the five years leading up to
2003 the area will bathe in $4.5 billion worth of economic impact
from regular season games to big name events like the Super Bowl,
the PGA Championship and Major League Baseball's All-Star Game.
That's not much less than the estimated impact of the 1996 Summer
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons this is good for metro Atlanta, Stokan
says.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Super Bowl, where tickets are notoriously
difficult for regular fans to come by, metro Atlantans will have a
chance to see top sporting events up close if they can pony up the
ticket money.
</P>
<P>
   Top sporting events also usually capture prime TV audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's priceless,'' Stokan says. ``There is no other way Atlanta
could get the kind of positive national and international media
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of the value of TV images should be taken with a grain of
salt, says John Bevilaqua, an Atlanta sports marketing consultant
who sat on the sports council shortly after it was formed in the
mid 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I question how much substantive value it really does have,''
says Bevilaqua, though he does see it as generally positive.
</P>
<P>
   As for the pronouncement that Atlanta is the world's, or even
the nation's, top sports city, Bevilaqua says, ``We have had some
pretty good success, but so have some other cities.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix, even
Orlando, which has the Disney sports complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, Atlanta,'' says Mark Jaffe, executive director of the
Greater New York Chamber of Commerce. ``Not only are we the world
champions of baseball but we are the sporting-event capital of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by sheer number of teams alone and events we should claim
that title above any city,'' says Jaffe, who figures the New York
metropolitan area has at least 10 professional sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Sporting News came up with its own list of best sports
cities earlier this year. Based on won-lost records of major sports
teams, the publication concluded that New York is at the top,
followed by Dallas, Denver and then Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has his own measures. Last summer the Travel Industry
Association of America found that Atlanta tied with Chicago in
attracting the largest percentage of the nation's sports-related
travelers in the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
   The competition to host big sporting events has grown far more
intense since the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles highlighted the
potential economic and image payoffs from sports. In 1985, when
Atlanta created its sports council, there were 10 similar
organizations in the nation. Now, there are more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta boosters have their hopes set on the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are calling it the decade of the destiny where we truly
will be recognized as the sports capital of the world,'' says
Stokan of the sports council, which recruits businesses and local
governments to put up money to host events.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to events Atlanta has already been selected to host,
Stokan says local boosters will bid for more, including:
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl in 2005 and 2006. Bids go out in May.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodwill Games in 2005. Bidding begins either later this
year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA Men's and Women's soccer finals in 2002 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The ESPN X Games in 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the biggest events, like the Super Bowl, Stokan says
he expects Atlanta's top competitors will be New Orleans, Los
Angeles, Indianapolis and New York.
</P>
<P>
   There are still a few holes in what Atlanta has to offer
sportswise, Stokan acknowledges. It doesn't yet have the facilities
necessary to attract a Major League Soccer team or top outdoor
track and field events. The sports council is hoping to win backing
to add professional soccer facilities near Stone Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Add continued financial support from business and government,
and Atlanta might be able to continue hosting big sporting events.
Of course, that doesn't guarantee some things _ like the Braves
winning a World Series.

AS LIABILITIES MOUNT,   THE REORGANIZATION OF DAEWOO BOGS DOWN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Efforts to overhaul Daewoo, the huge South Korean
conglomerate that the Korean government pulled back from the brink
of bankruptcy this summer, are losing momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and analysts are increasingly skeptical that the
government can meet its self-imposed year-end deadline for
beginning a solid reorganization of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to sell Daewoo's assets are bogging down. Creditors are
bickering among themselves, as well as with the company and the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daewoo is so much bigger, more troubled and more inaccessible
than any of the other companies that have been sold here that it's
hard for people to come to grips with it,'' said Taesoo Jung, head
of Arthur D. Little's Seoul office.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company's liabilities seem to keep
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only now are the government and the lenders starting to
appreciate the enormity of the probable discrepancy between asset
values and liabilities,'' said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., senior managing
director of Rothschild Inc. and an adviser to and investor in
several South Korean companies and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Daewoo have pulled the benchmark South Korean
stock index down 17 percent since the group flirted with bankruptcy
at the end of July, even though the nation's economy continues to
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Korea First Bank, which is leading the group representing
Daewoo's domestic creditors, recently finished valuing the assets
and liabilities of Daewoo Corp., the group's trading and
construction business. Its research suggested that 11.8 trillion
won, or $9.8 billion at current exchange rates, of the $24 billion
in assets the unit said in August it had were viable.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation's debts, on the other hand, came to 26.3
trillion won, or $21.95 billion, more than double the assets.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 85 percent of Daewoo's debts to foreign lenders were
made to Daewoo Corp. and Daewoo Motor Co., the group's
car-manufacturing business. ``The principal issue for foreign
creditors is whether Daewoo Corporation gets treated fairly or
not,'' said Jeffrey D. Jones, a lawyer at Kim &AMP; Chang in Seoul, who
represents many foreign companies doing business in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   He said many loans were made to Daewoo Corp. that were then
funneled to other Daewoo group projects that might have had more
value than the corporation itself.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's financial crisis was the subject of a meeting at the
Imperial Hotel in Tokyo Thursday, attended by 125 people
representing 71 of Daewoo's 200 foreign bankers, bondholders and
other lenders. Daewoo and its advisers at Ernst &AMP; Young sought to
lay out to the creditors the assets and liabilities of the 12 major
group affiliates selected for reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo is trying to persuade its foreign creditors to freeze
repayment of the roughly $7 billion in debts they hold to give it
some breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee that represents those lenders, headed by Chase
Manhattan, has insisted on veto power over Daewoo's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Both Daewoo and its Korean creditors, whom it owes more than $50
billion, are reluctant to give the foreign creditors so much
influence. After the formal presentation Thursday, the foreign
representatives who attended were invited to break into small
groups for discussions with representatives from Daewoo's Korean
creditors. But the meeting still resulted in a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the foreign bankers' committee said this
occurred because ``domestic banks were proceeding with
restructuring plans for the affected Daewoo entities without the
active involvement of foreign creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   But the foreigners face an even bigger hurdle among themselves.
Because loans to South Korean companies are not typically extended
by a syndicate of lenders led by a bank that makes decisions for
the group, each foreign lender is effectively an independent
operator.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to reach a consensus among 200 lenders, owed an average
of $28 million each, is a herculean task.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanics of achieving even a consensus _ and technically
you need unanimity _ are going to be horrific,'' Ross said, ``and
therefore it raises a very significant question about what is going
to come out of this meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   That matter aside, there are signs that sales of Daewoo assets
are not proceeding as smoothly as the government had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   A widely publicized sale of Daewoo's electronics group to Walid
Alomar &AMP; Associates, a private equity fund in Beverly Hills, has
foundered since the deal was announced two months ago. Daewoo's
domestic creditors expressed doubt that Walid Alomar had assembled
the money to complete the deal and added that it had placed too low
a value on the assets it wanted to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar has argued that the creditors have an unrealistic
expectation about the value of what they are trying to sell.
``We're waiting to see what the creditors feel the company is worth
and how our deal relates to that value,'' said Steven Kalabat, a
Walid Alomar director.

 &HT;    NASCAR-NOTEBOOK
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NASCAR world also was saddened by Monday's plane crash that
killed Payne Stewart. Also aboard the aircraft were a pair of
business agents: Robert Fraley, who represented Joe Gibbs, owner of
the No. 18 and 20 teams; and Van Arden, who represented Ray
Evernham, former crew chief of Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers are
with their families,'' Evernham said. ``(Arden and Fraley) did a
lot for NASCAR and our sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Halloween treat
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR gave Winston Cup drivers a treat in their Halloween bags:
No race this weekend after 12 consecutive weeks of races. Points
leader Dale Jarrett plans to go trick-or-treating with his kids.
Jeff Gordon and his wife plan to catch up on the latest movies.
Dale Earnhardt will celebrate his wife's birthday. Steve Park will
trade his stock car for a motorcycle. ``I just want to relax a
little bit,'' Park said. ``Take a deep breath, then come back and
finish out these last (three) races.''. . .
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott, Mike Skinner, Jeremy Mayfield and Ricky Craven
will test on Monday and Tuesday at Atlanta Motor Speedway in
preparation for Winston Cup's final race of the season on Nov. 21
at the track. . . . A.J. Foyt has succeeded with his intentions of
attracting a ton of attention for his full-time entry into Winston
Cup next year, but it is for the wrong reasons. The 2000 Daytona
500 is slightly more than three months away, and Foyt has not found
a driver.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis in Memphis
</P>
<P>
   There will likely be an Elvis Sighting in Sunday's Busch race at
Memphis Motorsports Park. Hut Stricklin, whose day job is driving
of the No. 38 Ford, also is well-known as an Elvis impersonator.
``It all started a few years ago at one of my New Year's Eve
parties,'' Stricklin said. ``I dressed up as Elvis and sang a few
songs, and since then everyone thinks I'm an Elvis fanatic.'' . . .
Ron Young of Conyers has a simple goal for the Sam's Town 250: Just
make the field. Young is trying to qualify for the first time in a
Busch event after 10 years of racing in the Slim Jim All-Pro
Series. ``This is our first experience at this level, so making the
show and running a few laps would be a big accomplishment for us,''
said Young, 29, who will also attempt to qualify the No. 71 Chevy
for the season-ending race in Miami on Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Nerve-wracking race
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR might have inscribed Dale Jarrett's name on the Winston
Cup trophy, but it can't do the same for with the Craftmans Truck
Series. Points leader Greg Biffle has two other drivers, Jack
Sprague and Dennis Setzer, within 25 points heading into the last
race at California Speedway on Saturday. ``I have fun racing all
the guys, and this just goes to show you how competitive this
series is,'' Biffle said. ``I certainly hope that it is the three
of us duking it out in California with 25 laps to go. That would be
the ultimate goal, I think, for all three of us to be in position
to win the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra laps
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear has removed its tires from CART and IRL racing, but the
tire company remains firmly committed to stock-car racing. ``(Our
withdrawal from open-wheel racing) will have no impact on our
strong relationship with NASCAR,'' said Stu Grant of Goodyear. ``In
fact, it may even serve to strengthen the relationship.''

 &HT;    Carter's silent before Gator game
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia's Quincy Carter hasn't said a word this
week. But the sophomore quarterback's silence speaks volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, the 10th-ranked Bulldogs' marquee player and the most
frequently interviewed member of the team, went to coach Jim Donnan
on Monday night and asked to be excused this week from his media
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   He has no gripe with newspapers or television stations. Carter
told Donnan he wanted to dedicate his time and energy to preparing
for Saturday's game against fifth-ranked Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `What are the chances of me not doing (any
interviews) this week?' I said, `Pretty good; I'm the coach,'''
Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   That shows how important beating Florida is to Carter. But his
desire has nothing to do with a deep-seated dislike of the Gators
or with Georgia's lack of success in the series this decade. For
Carter, his reputation is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Tennessee game Oct. 9, Carter pointed out that he
was 0-for-3 against the ``Big Three,'' Tennessee, Florida and
Georgia Tech, and noted that Georgia quarterbacks ultimately are
judged on how they perform in those games.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers manhandled the Bulldogs 37-20 as Carter was
chased all over the field, sacked three times and pressured
countless others. Despite the harassment, Carter completed 20 of 34
passes for 228 yards and two touchdowns, and he was not
intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, I've seen Quincy play going all the way back to
Southwest DeKalb High School, and he's the most unbelievably poised
guy I've ever seen,'' Georgia running back Jasper Sanks said.
``Nothing gets to him, even when things aren't going good. And when
we really need something to happen, that's when he's going to make
a play. He's a warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia and Carter got through the next two games unscathed, and
Carter put together his best game of the season Saturday against
Kentucky. He passed for 304 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for
87 yards as the Bulldogs rolled up 577 yards on offense en route to
a 49-34 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear immediately after the game that Carter's mind
was already on the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played great on offense, but we've got to put away those
turnovers,'' he said. ``We can't beat a team like Florida making
mistakes like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs had five turnovers against Kentucky, including a
40-yard return of a Carter interception that led to a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators' defensive preparations this week have focused on
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned about him just like we were Tee Martin,''
coach Steve Spurrier said. ``They both can pass and run, and that
can present a lot of problems when you go against somebody mobile
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators lead the SEC with 28 sacks for minus-200 yards. But
Donnan did not seemed overwhelmed with their ability to pressure
the passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they've played against a quarterback who can
negate the rush like ours can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven games into the season, Carter's Heisman Trophy candidacy
seems a faint memory. But it would get a boost with a spectacular
performance in Saturday's nationally televised game if Georgia
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have been nearly the team we have been the last
two years without (Carter),'' Donnan said. ``Just looking at the
stats doesn't do him justice. If you watch tape on him, it's just
unbelievable some of the things he does. We just need to give him
some help.''

 &HT;    Emotions running high at Tour Championship
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ No shot could have been struck to approach the moment
established in an early morning mist at Champions Golf Club
Thursday. Commenced and then culminated by the solemn sounds of a
lone bagpiper, a stirring memorial service to Payne Stewart on the
No. 1 teebox will be the 1999 Tour Championship's lasting vision.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, who gave the eulogy, choked out the words in
grief-stricken fragments, sobbing but somehow getting through it.
Many of the other 28 competing players were seated in front of the
podium, some fighting back tears and others failing to. The
bagpiper played ``Going Home,'' a Scottish hymn, in his errie
entrance through the mist, then ``Amazing Grace'' at the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne was a very emotional guy,'' Lehman said. ``He loved to
laugh and he wasn't ashamed to cry. So I'm not going to be ashamed
of my tears this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman said he was up all night worrying about his remarks,
afraid he would ``completely collapse, blubbering, and not be able
to say a word.'' But Lehman's words were as soothing as they were
sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six people got on a Lear plane Monday and today there's wives
without husbands, there's kids without fathers, there's a golf
world missing a hero, a tour missing a great champion and a bunch
of people missing a great friend,'' he said. ``All of us were a
part of Payne and Payne was definitely part of us. And when he died
on Monday, a big part of us died, too.''
</P>
<P>
   When they finally got around to golf, which wasn't easy for
anyone, another of Stewart's close friends, Sea Island's Davis Love
III, took the lead at 7-under par 99 after 27 holes of the $5
million event. Play will be suspended today for services in
Orlando, then resumed with 27 holes on Saturday and 18 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The only other golf-related story of any meaning became Tiger
Woods, who trailed by a stroke at 6-under, injuring his left wrist
and shoulder on the 15th hole, while trying to advance his ball
after it came to rest in front of a large rock.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lehman somehow regrouped after the service to shoot
even par for 27 holes, he admitted, ``I feel like I'm running on
empty emotionally. There's not much gas left in the tank.''
</P>
<P>
   All the players wore black ribbons, some an extra swatch of
tartan fabric pinned to caps or bags.
</P>
<P>
   Love and Justin Leonard had ``PS'' on the back of their caps.
</P>
<P>
   Comfortable with the decision to play, Commissioner Tim Finchem
said, ``We play in testimony to Payne. We hope that by showcasing
his absence on this golf course and among his peers, we will bring
focus to all of his fans around the world that at his core, Payne
Stewart, the champion, is irreplaceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Estes offered a bizarre, symbolic gesture for Stewart. On
his opening shot at the 10th teebox, he struck the ball with his
putter, moving it 16 feet. Turning around, he said softly, ``The
first shot's for Payne.'' Estes hit a 3-wood second shot from there
and double-bogeyed, but finished 2-under. Estes said he was
symbolizing the 15-foot putt Stewart made at Pinehurst in June to
win the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   While Love said he admired Estes' thoughts, he added, ``I don't
think Payne wants us throwing away strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a tough time gathering up enough emotion to play,'' said
Love, who lost his father in a 1988 plane crash. ``When that little
airplane flew over with that banner (saying `We will remember you,
Payne.'), I had a little 4-footer straight in, and I think it took
me about 10 mintues to putt. You shouldn't have to play golf with
tears on your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Andy Martinez, Lehman's caddie, ``I've never felt so
unmotivated on a golf course. I don't care if we were playing for
$50 million.''

   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK (MONDAY NIGHT) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (4-2) vs. Green Bay (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holmgren was 84-42 in seven seasons as Green Bay's head
coach, a .667 winning percentage, second only to Vince Lombardi's
.758. But it got boring for Holmgren. He became itchy. He wanted to
run his own team with total authority and Seattle was happy to
oblige. Through six games he has the Seahawks moving in splendid
direction and now returns to Green Bay for the first time. He will
find Ray Rhodes in his old job and several familiar faces,
particularly Brett Favre at quarterback. Holmgren helped to mold
Favre. Favre wants to show Holmgren what he now misses. Expect a
huge game from Favre (he has passed for 608 yards, second most in
the National Football Conference) and an equally large one from
back Dorsey Levens (he averages 4.0 yards per carry and has caught
26 passes). Watch end Green Bay end Keith McKenzie (5 sacks)
explode for big plays. Watch the Packers and their delirious fans
stick it to Holmgren. Packers, 30-17.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (4-3) vs. Baltimore (2-4)
</P>
<P>
   These teams have never played and both enter off losses, Buffalo
by 10 points at Seattle and Baltimore by 27 at home against Kansas
City. Tony Banks, the former Rams' quarterback, makes his first
Baltimore start. The Ravens certainly have a capable defense.
Baltimore has not allowed a 100-yard rusher or receiver this
season. Its 3.1 average yards per carry allowed ranks second in the
American Football Conference to only San Diego's 2.9. If Banks can
play turnover-free, the Ravens can swipe this game. He will
struggle early but flourish late.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 17-16.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (5-1) vs. Cincinnati (1-6)
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play very well. They got after us on a lot of long
plays. The one long play we had double coverage and he still got
out. You can't do that to a heck of a player. So many thing went
wrong I don't know where to begin.'' That was Bruce Coslet, the
Bengals' head coach, trying to explain how Colts' receiver Marvin
Harrison ripped his pass defense and how the Bengals were so
hapless in their 31-10 loss last week to Indianapolis. Coslet is
running out of explanations. And excuses. And time.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 29-10.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (4-2) vs. Kansas City (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   Erik Kramer, the Chargers' quarterback, has completed a spiffy
19 of 25 fourth-quarter passes for 240 yards. Nice numbers. Problem
is, overall, he has completed only 76 of 138 passes and has thrown
only 2 touchdown passes and 9 interceptions. That ruins the
Chargers' wonderful defense, one that has not allowed a 100-yard
rusher in 25 consecutive games. Kramer will likely give way to Jim
Harbaugh and he will face a pass defense that has gained at least
two interceptions in each of its last five games. San Diego won the
first meeting between these divisional rivals, 21-14, earlier this
month. This is Kansas City's time as it surprisingly gains sole
control of first place in the AFC West.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (2-4) vs. Atlanta (1-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have disintegrated. They have become a shell of
their Super Bowl team. They are committing turnovers at an alarming
rate, are gaining only 288 yards of offense per game and even
sure-footed kicker Morten Andersen is struggling, having connected
on only six of 11 field goal attempts. Their meltdown on Monday
night against Pittsburgh _ where the Falcons twice in the fourth
quarter were inside the Pittsburgh 5 with a chance to win but could
not _likely sapped the life from this team. It requires a major
effort from the Atlanta coaching staff to keep this team from
completely sinking. For at least another week, there are few
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers, 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (3-4) vs. Washington (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Synder, the Washington owner, was seen storming toward
the Redskins' locker room after their debacle in Dallas, a 38-20
loss. Synder was not happy. After a 30-minute meeting with Norv
Turner, the Washington head coach, Synder exited with a red,
flushed face. Synder was not happy. The Redskins strode into Dallas
full of bravado and left embarrassed and perplexed. They collapsed
in a big game and now return home to heal open wounds. Chicago
gains the return of quarterback Shane Matthews but it matters
little. Washington is on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins, 33-17.
</P>
<P>
   Giants (4-3) vs. Philadelphia (2-5)
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have two fewer victories than Washington but have
allowed 38 fewer points than Washington. Philadelphia can play
defense. It leads the league in takeaways with 19. Its 14
interceptions are second-most in the league. But on offense, behind
quarterback Doug Pederson, Philadelphia has crawled. The Giants
were lucky to beat the Eagles the first time _ a raw 16-15 victory
in New York earlier this month _ and will need another champion
effort from its defense to repeat the feat. It gets it, especially
from linebacker Jessie Armstead, roaring toward another pro bowl
season.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (0-7) vs. New Orleans (1-5)
</P>
<P>
   Did you know the Browns have committed the fewest penalties in
the AFC? They also have the fewest victories _ zilch. Fewer
mistakes usually means more victories but the Browns problems are
complex. Their offense averages only 198.7 yards gained per game.
Their defense allows 405.9 yards per game. They are minus 8 in
turnover differential. Cleveland can begin to look toward next
year's draft, another No. 1 pick, and free agent help that can plug
holes. New Orleans, too, is a team with complex issues. Though
Ricky Williams leads all rookie NFC backs with 403 rushing yards,
his injuries hampered his early-season impact. The Saints are
recovering from a 31-3 beating at the Giants and appear in
disarray. This could get ugly, a game featuring two teams with one
total victory. New Orleans postpones expansion Cleveland's
first-ever victory.
</P>
<P>
   Saints, 23-13.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (6-0) vs. Tennessee (5-1)
</P>
<P>
   This is a break-out game for both teams, a marquee matchup and
attention-grabber that neither franchise or it players are
accustomed to gaining in recent years. The balls should fly high
and often, especially if Steve McNair returns from his back injury
at quarterback for the Titans. The Rams have scored 217 points, the
Titans 142. Thus, the Rams are far more explosive. It will be a
tantalizing matchup at running back where Marshall Faulk of the
Rams battles Eddie George of the Titans. Two factors will nudge the
game Tennessee's way: 1) The Titans' battle-tested early season
where five of their six games have been decided by 3 or fewer
points (they are 4-1 in those game) and the fact they have erased
second-half deficits in four of their five victories. 2) Tennessee
comes off a bye week, having enjoyed two weeks of preparation. It's
a thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Titans, 25-24.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Miami (5-1) vs. Oakland (4-3)
</P>
<P>
   Miami starts Damon Huard at quarterback again, on the road this
time against Oakland. The Raiders will be ready and waiting. In
facing cornerbacks Charles Woodson and Eric Allen, Huard will be
overmatched. Oakland will make a statement early, shoving Tyrone
Wheatley right at the Dolphins and attempting to become the first
team to score a rushing touchdown on them. That is a statistic that
the Raiders simply will not let stand. The Raiders receivers vs.
the Miami secondary is also favorable for Oakland. Nearly
everywhere the Raiders look, they find matchups that they like.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 23-16.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (4-2) vs. Indianapolis (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   Are the Colts all grown up and ready for Dallas? That is what
this game is all about _ growing pains. Indianapolis owns the
league's best passing game, averaging 277.2 passing yards per game.
It ranks fourth in total offense at 365.0 average yards gained per
game. It has outscored its opponents 41-9 in the first quarter. The
matchup of receiver Marvin Harrison vs. Dallas cornerback Deion
Sanders will be a joy. This will be a signature game for the Colts.
Dallas, though, won't make it easy.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 22-20.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (3-4) vs. Denver (2-5)
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota appears to have found its groove, scoring 40 points on
the 49ers. The Vikings' 147 first downs gained (89 passing) are the
most of any NFC team. Minnesota is 3-1 in its last four road games
vs. AFC teams and its new quarterback, Jeff George, has 5 touchdown
passes, 2 interceptions and a 119.3 quarterback rating. Though
Denver lost a close game last week at New England, it will rebound
at home. What turns this game is the Broncos' ability to rush
George, creating havoc and turnovers. Watch Denver's rookie kick
returner Chris Watson, exciting, elusive and dangerous with a 27.9
kickoff return average.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 27-25.
</P>
<P>
   New England (5-2) vs. Arizona (2-4)
</P>
<P>
   This is a game Arizona could win with Jake Plummer at
quarterback. It is a game they can't win with Dave Brown at
quarterback. Brown starts for the injured Plummer and faces a team
still celebrating its big victory last week over Denver that
stopped a Denver hex over New England. Now the Patriots travel to
Arizona and will start slowly and sluggishly. They are depleted at
linebacker but have enough left to deal with Brown. Tight end Ben
Coates (10 catches, 3 touchdowns in three career games vs. Arizona)
usually gives the Cardinals fits.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots, 19-17.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (3-3) vs. Detroit (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dungy, the Tampa Bay head coach, has seen enough of
quarterback Trent Dilfer. After a victory, albeit a ho-hum 6-3
victory over Chicago last week, Dungy benched Dilfer. Eric Zeier is
the new Tampa Bay starter. This is not a game for a frolicking
debut. Detroit is solid at home and in prime time games where the
lights shine bright. They are eager to show the nation how they
have overcome the loss of Barry Sanders to leap into first place in
the NFC Central. Expect a strong game from Lions' quarterback,
Charlie Batch. At running back, with Ron Rivers injured and out,
Greg Hill will produce. A glimmering victory for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 20-9.

   BUYOUT-LAUSD (Los Angeles) _ (story will move late) A power
struggle over Los Angeles Unified leadership peaks with the school
board vote to buy out Superintendent Ruben Zacarias or fire him if
he refuses to leave. Zacarias, at a news conference, vowed to fight
any attempt to remove him from his $188,000-a-year-job. Citing
President Harry S Truman, he said that he will stay in the kitchen
because he can stand the heat. During hte late-afternoon and
evening board meeting, members are expected to name former Pasadena
school district Ramon Cortines as interim superintendent, pending a
nationwide search for a new leader. The board also will consider
the appointment of Howard Miller as chief operating officer. Dozens
are expected to speak against the move. By Greg Gittrich and Rick

chancellor of New York City schools until a run-in with the mayor
over who runs the city. He was superintendent of Pasadena schools,
until the board fired him when he refused to work with a newly
hired deputy superintendent. Cortines is being sued by the parents
of a boy who was molested by a track coach in Pasadena. The suit
claims Cortines was present during a meeting during which the

ISRAEL'S EL AL OPTS TO BUY JETS FROM BOTH U.S. AND EUROPEAN
MANUFACTURERS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After 10 months of internal debate over whether it
should buy its next jets from Boeing or Airbus, El Al, Israel's
national airline, has come up with a Solomonic solution: It will
purchase three Boeing 777s and three or four Airbus A330s.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected decision, made in a marathon board meeting that
concluded early Thursday, ends a battle that pitted the United
States against the European Union and the airline's management
against its politically appointed board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a good price, we got the best aircraft for our needs,
and we hope we made everybody happy,'' said El Al spokesman Nachman
Kleiman.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the Seattle-based aviation giant that built every
current plane in El Al's fleet, was favored by the company chairman
and its board and, it was widely believed, by the Israeli
government. Airbus, the European consortium that is Boeing's only
rival, was reportedly favored by El Al's professional managers on
the grounds of relative cost and access to the West European
market. The company and Israeli leaders were lobbied intensively on
the sale by senior U.S. and European government officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisions were reached on the basis of professional
statistics and figures which were set before the decision makers
and did not reflect any outside influences whatsoever,'' the
airline said.
</P>
<P>
   The hotly contested contract had been presented byEl Al as a
choice between three wide-body Boeing 777s and an Airbus package of
two two-engine A330s and two four-engine A340s, for a purchase of
about $400 million. Instead, the company will buy from both
companies and spend up to $700 million, an expenditure it said was
justified by a re-evaluation of the potential cash flow from
operating the new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies had argued that keeping the purchase all with one
brand of airplane would cut maintenance and pilot training costs,
and many industry analysts agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Both aircraft manufacturers had cut prices in making final
offers to El Al earlier this week, and both had pledged to spend at
least half the value of the order on suppliers and subcontractors
in Israel's aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing sweetened the deal further by awarding El Al a new $40
million contract for overhauling jets owned or leased by Boeing, El
Al disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing purchase was authorized immediately, and the planes
are expected to be delivered in 2001. The El Al board will convene
in two weeks to approve the purchase of either three or four Airbus
planes, with delivery by 2003.

 &HT;    CLINTON PLEDES ASSISTANCE TO NIGERIAN PRESIDENT
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton welcomed the leader of Nigeria's
fledgling democracy to the White House on Thursday, saying the
first steps away from military rule in Africa's most populous
nation sent a signal across the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ``Nigeria is a pivot point on which the future of
all Africa and much of the world will turn,'' Clinton pledged to
assist the new government of President Olusegun Obasanjo with
efforts to step up U.S. foreign aid, trade and investment in
Africa's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's election last February ended more than 15 years of
often harsh autocratic control of Nigeria, one of this country's
largest suppliers of crude oil. It was viewed by many analysts as
the most significant political development in Africa since the 1994
toppling of apartheid rule in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   With Obasanjo standing by in long, flowing traditional Nigerian
attire, Clinton told reporters at a White House news conference
that Obasanjo's government ``has signaled a new day for Nigeria,
and new hope for Africa _ a fitting capstone to a decade of
remarkable democratic revolutions from
</P>
<P>
   Poland to South Africa, to the important transition now underway
in Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo, a former military officer who headed Nigeria's
government from 1976 until 1979 following the assassination of the
former head of state, spent three years in prison for opposing the
military dictatorship of Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo was released after Abacha's sudden death under
mysterious circumstances last year. A caretaker government pledged
democratic elections, which Obasanjo won earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that democracy is a process and not an event,''
said British-educated Obasanjo, speaking in English.
</P>
<P>
   He asked for Clinton's help, though, in seeking forgiveness of
Nigeria's foreign debt, which Obasanjo estimated at up to $30
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot talk of being able to do what we need to do to
nurture, to sustain democracy, and to give our people democracy
dividend, bearing the burden of debt that is hanging over us at
this point in time,'' said Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton countered, though, that the best Nigeria should hope for
in the near term is a holiday on part of its interest payments. As
an exporter of more than $1 billion worth of oil each month _ 40
percent of it to the United States _ Nigeria doesn't qualify for
most third world debt reduction aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we ought to get whatever relief we can,'' said
Clinton. ``Even the rescheduling relief is worth something. It
takes a burden off your back now, and gives you a chance to get
some breathing room, and doesn't raise the questions of
creditworthiness, so that we can get more investment into Nigeria
and more loans into Nigeria as well, if they're necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY MAY END HERE.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, said Clinton, additional debt relief would likely
be pegged to the progress Obasanjo's government makes in
liberalizing the country's political and economic systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigeria is a great country. You've got a large population,
vast resources, goodlocation, all that oil,'' said Clinton. ``You
have to be well-governed and competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Obasanjo pledged that Nigeria would play by the
new rules of the global marketplace, working to root out
corruption, set up a working system of laws and courts and and set
clear and transparent rules and regulations to govern commerce and
safeguard investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are eliminatingcorruption as a way of life in Nigeria,''
Obasanjo said.

CONGRESS PASSES THIRD TEMPORARY SPENDING MEASURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress passed a third temporary spending measure
Thursday to keep the government operating through Nov. 5 amid signs
that Republican leaders and the White House may be close to an
agreement on final Year 2000 spending matters.
</P>
<P>
   The House also gave its approval Thursday to a 1 percent
across-the -board cut in spending, which it insisted will help
prevent lawmakers and President Clinton from dipping into Social
Security programs next year to fund government programs.
</P>
<P>
   But despite optimistic talk of an agreement on final 2000
spending matters, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas,
suggested that it could take up to two more weeks to work out
details giving both sides some of what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of coming to a final agreement on a very,
very short list of items,'' Armey told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said Republicans are ``willing to talk with the president
on every subject'' on his budget wish list for next year, including
money to pay the nearly $1 billion U.S. debt owed to the United
Nations, and to hire more teachers and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The financial obligation to the United Nations remains
controversial to many Republicans who object to how the money may
be spent in the international arena, particular on matters related
to birth control and abortion. But Armey said, ``We will work with
him on that, and we will work with him on teachers, and
on...(putting more) police on the street. It is not a long list of
items.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also sounded hopeful, telling reporters that Americans
should not be concerned about a possible repeat of the 1995-96
government shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no government shutdowns,'' Clinton said, calling
on Republicans to work with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a partisan fight on this. This is crazy for us to
be having a big partisan blowout because (we) both made a
commitment not to spend the Social Security surplus and then it
turned out to be harder than necessary, and all of it is being
mixed into a sort of a combustible political mix,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to sit down like grown-ups, go out and tell the
American people the truth and work through this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, the Republicans pushed a massive $327
billion bill through the House on Thursday, funding the Departments
of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services that does not
include money for hiring the 100,000 new teachers Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed on a party-line vote 218-211, was the
last of the 13 appropriations measures needed to fund government
departments and agencies in the 2000 fiscal year. Eight have been
signed into law by Clinton, but the rest have either been vetoed or
will be vetoed as soon they reach Clinton's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had promised to veto the education, labor and health
measure, not only because of his concern about the lack of funding
for new teachers, but also because it contains an across-the-board
cut in overall spending of nine-tenths of 1 percent, which amounts
to about $3.5 billion. Even though they knew a veto was certain,
Republicans passed the measure to claim that they completed all of
Congress' legislative business this year without tapping into the
Social Security Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has characterized the spending cut proposal as
irresponsible, saying that it would have an adverse impact on
defense and child care programs. But he also objects to another
provision in the bill that would prohibit the National Institutes
of Health from using $7.5 billion of its nearly $18 billion budget
next year until the last two days of the fiscal year. The delay
would prevent the NIH from awarding billions in medical research
grants.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, condemned the bill for that reason
and accused Republicans of protecting pork barrel spending
projects.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH spending delay, aimed essentially at rolling over money
into the 2001 fiscal year, and the across-the-board cut, are just
two of many unusual accounting techniques Republicans are using in
the their budget deliberations this year to avoid borrowing from
Social Security surpluses to help pay for government operations.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached with Clinton in 1997, Republicans
agreed to hold spending in the 2000 budget to $580 billion. But
despite utilizing $14 billion in Non-Social Security surpluses this
year and creative accounting efforts, the Congressional Budget
Office estimates that all 13 appropriations bills will total about
$611 billion. That means, according to CBO figures, that the bills
will actually spend about $17 billion in Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats seized on the latest CBO assessment as evidence
that Republicans, as Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., put it, have
perpetrated ``a phoney, manipulative debate'' on the American
people about not spending Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Armey and Republicans leaders continued to insist
that next year's budget will be balanced without dipping into the
retirement account or raising taxes. They also waved around their
own CBO letter suggesting that no Social Security money had been
used in putting together the budget. That letter, however, was the
result of a GOP leadership directive ordering the CBO to score the
2000 budget differently from the way it normally counts the
spending in annual bills.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement over the Social Security issue sparked a bitter
exchange between some members during debate on the labor, education
and health bill. At one point, Democratic Rep. Charles Stenholm,
one of the most conservative members of Congress who often votes
with Republicans, accused his GOP Texas colleagues of trying to
deceive the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for a little honesty,'' he told Armey at one point
in the debate, imploring him to acknowledge that Social Security
money will be spent unless an agreement can be worked out with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Stenholm also asked Armey why, if Republican leaders ``are
serious about protecting Social Security,'' they refused to work on
crafting a Social Security reform bill this year ``instead of
spending eight months promoting a tax cut'' that Stenholm suggested
would have ended up undermining the long-term stability of the
pension program.
</P>
<P>
   Before passing the last of the spending bills, the House and
Senate voted to extend temporary spending through Nov. 5 in order
to avoid a government shutdown and allow Clinton and Republican
leaders to work out their differences. Clinton was expected to sign
the measure Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time since the start of fiscal year 2000 on
Oct. 1 that Congress and the president had to take action to
prevent a partial government shutdown. The second temporary
spending measure was due to expire at midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the stopgap spending measure, combined with the
narrow approval the last spending bill, was expected to put
pressure on both sides to wrap up their negotiations, which have
been hung up on policy differences more than funding levels.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for example, wants $1.4 billion in education money set
aside specifically for hiring new teachers, but Republicans have so
far offered only $1.2 billion that would be given to states to be
used as they choose.

AT TYCO, ACCOUNTING `BATHS' BEGIN BEFORE THE DEALS CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tyco International was a high-flying stock with a reputation for
acquiring and improving the performance of companies in distinctly
low-flying industries. Then questions were raised about its
accounting and the stock began to slip.
</P>
<P>
   In a bravura performance two weeks ago, L. Dennis Kozlowski, the
chairman and chief executive, held a teleconference with analysts
to defend the company's accounting against questions raised by
David Tice, a money manager and analyst whose publication ``Behind
The Numbers'' is widely respected. Tice suggested that Tyco might
be abusing accounting rules by setting up big reserves when it made
acquisitions. Kozlowski vigorously denied it. ``There is,'' he
said, ``no risk that investors will wake up one day and find out
there's something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I decided not to do a column on Tyco. The company
does set up big restructuring reserves for many of its
acquisitions, and such reserves are subject to abuse because they
can be used to conceal operating expenses. But did Tyco abuse them?
There was no proof that it did.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out that the questions raised by Tice are not the
only ones that can be raised regarding Tyco. His questions dealt
with what Tyco does after it makes acquisitions. Perhaps more
interesting is the issue of what happens to Tyco's purchases just
before the deals close. Call it ``The Case of the Hidden Bath.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is important because Tyco's reputation is based on the
improvements it reports in operations after it takes over
companies. It is famous for cutting costs and improving revenue.
But in two recent purchases _ of AMP Inc. and U.S. Surgical _ the
companies took big losses just before the acquisitions closed as
sales dropped sharply and expenses soared. Those losses were,
however, never reported to investors. By the time the reports would
have been due, the acquisitions had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't disclosed clearly,'' Mark Swartz, Tyco's chief
financial officer, acknowledged in a telephone interview Thursday.
But he said, rightly, that you could get at them by doing a lot of
arithmetic involving various filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. That's how I got the numbers, after I was
tipped off about the issue by Jim Chanos, the president of Kynikos
Associates, a firm that has a short position in Tyco.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco provided information on the hidden quarters, with far more
detail than could be determined by the laborious arithmetic. It
turns out that U.S. Surgical took a $190 million write-off to lower
its asset values just before the deal closed. That will help in two
ways. First, it makes the comparison with future quarters easy.
Second, it will help profits by reducing depreciation charges. But
nowhere was that disclosed in SEC filings.
</P>
<P>
   Such accounting, Chanos said, helps to explain ``why these
low-growth or no-growth businesses show great growth coming out of
the box'' after they are acquired by Tyco.
</P>
<P>
   Swartz assures me that any analyst interested in such detail
already had the figures and says that the company has complied with
SEC disclosure rules.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is time for the SEC to change the rules. There is no
reason why such figures should not be disclosed clearly to all
investors. As for Tyco, the fact the company kept such things out
of SEC filings is not reassuring. It certainly made it harder for
investors not privy to analyst discussions to evaluate how the
company was doing.

FALUN GONG MEMBERS MEET WITH FOREIGN JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Members of the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual movement
held a daring, clandestine meeting with a handful of foreign
journalists Thursday to appeal for international help against a
relentless government crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Risking serious criminal charges for speaking out at an illegal
meeting, Falun Gong members described a worsening pattern of
harassment, arrests and even physical abuse since their movement
was banned in July. They insisted, against all evidence, that if
national leaders only knew the facts, they would see the movement
as wholesome and unthreatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want is not much _ we just want a peaceful place to
practice,'' said Jiang Chaohui, a devotee who recently had to
resign his assistant manager's job in a joint venture in the
southern province of Fujian. He came to Beijing last week, he said,
``to report the truth to the highest authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   But like hundreds of other practitioners who have converged on
Beijing in recent days, dodging the police, Jiang, 35, has
discovered that the right to petition the authorities for justice
means little because the government has decided that it must
destroy the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong, which melds elements of Buddhism and Taoism with
traditional qigong exercises that are said to harness cosmic forces
in the body, has been wildly popular since its founding in 1992,
especially among middle-aged and older people, who believe that it
enhances health. The writings of its leader, Li Hongzhi, who now
lives in New York, advocate clean living, and suggest that
committed practitioners can even attain supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   But China's top leaders, who were shocked in April when
thousands of Falun Gong members converged without warning at the
Communist Party leadership's compound in Beijing to demand official
recognition, portray the group as a threat to party rule and social
stability. Li, its leader, is said to harbor covert political goals
and to exploit the gullible to enrich himself.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers at Thursday's news conference vehemently rejected
such characterizations. They included two policemen, both Communist
Party members, from the northeastern province of Liaoning who said
they had been forced by their superiors to choose between their
careers and their devotion to Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Master Li told us the universal law unselfishly,'' said
one of them, Wang Zhiguo, 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``So on Oct. 15 I took off my police uniform and came to
Beijing,'' Wang said, and he hopes somehow to convince national
leaders that Falun Gong is no threat.
</P>
<P>
   After the group was declared an illegal organization on July 22,
a few dozen top leaders were arrested while thousands more who
refused to repudiate the philosophy have suffered temporary
detentions and sometimes have lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's meeting, 11-year-old Qu Yuyan said he had not been
allowed to attend his school, in the northeastern province of
Heilongjiang, because he practiced Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   In the official news media this week, Falun Gong was labeled a
``cult,'' perhaps setting the stage for harsher measures since
cults are illegal. And with the announcement that many of the
arrested Falun Gong leaders had seen top-secret documents
concerning the campaign against the movement, it is considered
certain that show trials and long sentences for perhaps dozens of
leaders are soon to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``No responsible government will allow a cult to harm people's
lives and security, destroy public order or social stability,'' a
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Zhang Qiyue, said Thursday. The state
press has compared the group to cults like Aum Shinrikyo in Japan,
whose adherents released nerve gas in the Tokyo subway system in
1995, and the Branch Davidians, who died fiery deaths in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A second policeman at Thursday's covert meeting with
journalists, Shi Jingsheng, 35, said, ``The government decided we
are a cult because they have listened to false reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who practice Falun Gong, he said, ``cultivate themselves
to be truly kind.''
</P>
<P>
   When his bosses forced him to criticize Falun Gong, he said, ``I
couldn't bear it,'' so he left for Beijing. ``I told my leader that
I still wanted to be a good policeman and a good citizen,'' he
said. ``This is not contradictory: Falun Gong asks us to be better
policemen and better party members.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, for the fourth straight day, some of the many
believers who have gathered in Beijing walked onto Tiananmen Square
or around the adjacent Great Hall of the People as a form of silent
witness, or protest. Dozens were seen being away led by the police
to buses, which took them to temporary detention centers or
sometimes back to their home provinces.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker at Thursday's clandestine meeting, a 31-year-old
hairdresser named Ding Yan from Shijiazhuang in nearby Hebei
province, said she and others were badly mistreated after they were
arrested on Tiananmen Square on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   She said that her arms were twisted into painful positions
before she was handcuffed, and that she had been beaten in the
face. ``Even though you treat us this way,'' she recalled telling
the police, ``we don't hate you because you don't understand us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Ding also described the long hunger strikes of another woman
jailed in Shijiazhuang, a radio broadcaster who had aired a program
sympathetic to Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 adherents attending Thursday's covert meeting concluded
it by demonstrating the key exercises that are said to keep the
Falun _ an inner cosmic wheel _ spinning, drawing good forces into
the body and expelling bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   At the very end, they chanted in unison one of Li's poems, ``To
Be a Person,'' which includes lines like, ``Have serene assurance
in yourself and don't strive for fame,'' and ``To be free of lust,
keep a pure heart and quell your desires.''

   Biddy's detailed response, filed without a lawyer, is partly
handwritten, partly typed.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy, who is white, could not be reached for comment. Northlake
Foods, a Waffle House franchisee, is also named in the lawsuit,
filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. Atlanta-based Waffle House
is not named in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Arrington, of Atlanta, contends in the initial complaint
that he and four friends decided to stop at the restaurant after a
night of partying at a nightclub. According to the lawsuit, the
group placed their orders for grits, eggs and sausage with the
waitress, who was also black.
</P>
<P>
   The group claims Biddy filled the orders of white patrons, even
those who came in later, but refused to fill their orders.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy used obscenities and racial slurs, the suit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy denies those allegations, although he admits getting in
trouble with his employer before because of his temper.
</P>
<P>
   He begins by questioning whether the plaintiffs are even
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have met one or two African-Americans before and they talk
funny, they have an accent, but these people...did not have an
accent like the people I have heard from Africa,'' he said in the
filing.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy claims that when the plaintiffs came in the restaurant and
placed their orders with the waitress, Lawanda Baker, that he was
backed up on orders at the grill. He said she initially called out
the orders improperly. When that was resolved, he said be began to
cook the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, at no time did I intentionally refuse to prepare
anyone's order,'' he said in his answer. He also denied using
racial slurs and profanity.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs ``kept raising hell and calling me names,'' Biddy
said in the filing. Biddy said he called the police when the
plaintiffs became rowdy and threatened him. They left before police
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy asked to have the case dismissed and asks for unspecified
damages and attorneys fees in his countersuit for emotional
distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of their aggressive nature, their loud and vulgar
language, their threats, combined with what I observed as bulges in
the pockets of two of the plaintiffs and the fact that one of them
stood up and threatened to kill me, I believe they had guns and
weapons on them, and so I feared for my life,'' he said. ``Also,
there were five of them, including four grown men.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Robert Proctor, who has successfully argued against
several affirmative action cases in the metro area, is representing
Northlake Foods. Proctor was on vacation Thursday. An associate
confirmed that he didn't represent Biddy but declined additional
comment.
</P>
<P>
   David C. Cole, who res the plaintiffs, said Biddy's
admission in the filing that Northlake supervisors had previously
talked to him about his temper ``supports our case.''

 &HT;    Sears takHome Depot with decor stores
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. is poised for an upscale counterattack on
Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Sears will soon start a national expansion of Great Indoors, a
new home decor and remodeling concept that debuted in Denver last
year. A second Great Indoors opens next week in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
followed by 15 more stores over the next year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Longer-range plans call for 150 stores, including possible sites
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Like Home Depot's Expo concept, Great Indoors goes after the
upper-income female shopper who wants to revamp an entire room.
Sears designed the new format to recoup sales lost to Home Depot
and Lowe's, and retailers like Bed, Bath &AMP; Beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good sign that Sears is pushing forward on a successful
division,'' said Alan Mak, an analyst with Argus Research. ``This
is a high-margin business, and it's one of the areas that's working
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Home-related merchandise is one of the fastest-growing areas of
retail. Great Indoors raked in first-year sales of $42 million in
Denver. Analysts have estimated the average Home Depot Expo
generates sales of $60 million, compared with roughly $43 million
at traditional Home Depot stores.
</P>
<P>
   Both Expo and Sears present wall coverings, cabinets, flooring
and appliances in lifelike bathroom and kitchen settings. Taking a
cue from Home Depot's popular workshops, Great Indoors also offers
free seminars on painting, decorating and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   There are some differences, though. Great Indoors sells more
furniture and bedding, while Expo aims to dominate in rugs and
lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the new Great Indoors will compete directly with Expo
in the same market, including Dallas and Detroit. A Great Indoors
also will open near Denver. Sears did not identify the remaining 11
sites for its rollout, other than to say it was looking at the top
40 U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   While metro Atlanta certainly leads the list of possible sites,
the market already is highly competitive. Home Depot alone has 33
warehouse stores and two Expos. Another Expo is on the drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that 14 Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse stores in metro
Atlanta, plus scores of other home furnishing chains.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Expo will operate 26 stores by the end of next year
and plans to have 200 by the end of 2005. Home Depot is targeting
large metropolitan areas and affluent cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of demand for these types of products,'' said
Mak, the analyst at at Argus Research. But he said few markets are
big enough to accommodate both Expo and Great Indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some markets, one will be weeded out, and given the savvy
of Home Depot, I doubt it will be them,'' Mak said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's stock closed Thursday at $74.56 1/4, up $4.87 1/2.
Sears closed at $27.68 3/4, up 18 3/4 cents.

OREGONIANS RESENT HOUSE VOTE TO CURB THEIR ASSISTED-SUICIDE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Oregonians have long prided themselves on being
in the forefront on many social issues _ sometimes with ideas that
catch on in the rest of the nation, and sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   They were among the first to decriminalize marijuana and to
approve its use for medicinal purposes, and they legalized abortion
years before the Supreme Court issued the Roe vs. Wade decision.
They were the first to conduct an election entirely by mail, and
they have long had some of the strictest growth-management
regulations in the nation. They even live in one of two states that
resolutely refuse to let customers pump their own gasoline at a
service station.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the people of Oregon passionately debated and
narrowly approved a measure making theirs the first state, and one
of the few places in the world, to legalize physician-assisted
suicide. Two years ago, amid legal challenges to the so-called
``Death with Dignity Act,'' the state's residents voted 60 percent
to 40 percent to reaffirm it.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a day after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a
measure that would effectively overturn the Oregon law and thus
amounts to an extraordinary rebuke of the popular will in a single
state, even many of those who opposed the law said they were angry
over impending federal interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they doing this?'' said Ronald Nelson, owner of a
dance shop and studio owner here, who voted twice against
legalizing doctor-assisted suicide. ``The people in Oregon had a
vote. I may not agree with it, but is Congress really saying that
our vote doesn't count, it doesn't matter? That's just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   From the governor to people in the street, Oregonians were
invoking the phrase states' rights Thursday, and the congressional
action only seems to have solidified the notion that the people of
Oregon, arguably the most aggressively libertarian in the country,
should have the right to decide this issue themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is a strong libertarian impulse at work here,
of people wanting to be free to make decisions without the
government coming in,'' said James Moore, a professor of political
science at the University of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``But another thing is going on right now,'' Moore added,
``People may fight like cats and dogs here over issues such as
this, but if there is a whiff of outside interference over these
things, Oregonians will all gather together and defend their right
to fight and send a message to the outside, that you cannot dictate
to us.'' For precisely that reason, he said, a referendum today on
doctor-aided suicide would probably gather even more than the 60
percent yes vote it got last time.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many here insisted that far too much was being
made of the issue by Congress anyway: despite predictions by
critics that Oregon would be flooded with those seeking death, they
noted, just 15 people took lethal medication last year, the first
full year the measure was in effect.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, resistance here to the House action is clearly
strong and intensely felt. The state's congressional delegation,
which includes several members who voted twice against legalizing
physician-assisted suicide, is staunchly united in trying to stop
the bill that passed the House on Wednesday on a 271-156 vote. Sen.
Ron Wyden, a Democrat who said he opposed the Death with Dignity
Act, has pledged to filibuster the bill in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Kitzhaber, who is a physician, and the staff of the
state attorney general's office are exploring possible legal
challenges if the measure passes the Senate and is signed by
President Clinton, which remains far from certain. (The Clinton
administration, which opposes provisions of the House bill that
could force doctors to spend up to 20 years in prison for
prescribing lethal medication, is looking for ways to revise the
House measure in the Senate, said U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
in Washington on Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   And some doctors here are already saying they may engage in
civil disobedience by continuing to offer mentally competent,
terminally ill people lethal prescriptions, or perhaps by employing
what they call a creative sidestepping around the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the House bill does not overturn the Oregon law,
though it effectively does so by banning the use of any federally
controlled substance for the purpose of aiding suicide. Some
doctors said they might explore whether there are substances
outside of federal regulation that could be offered to patients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Peter Rasmussen, a cancer specialist in Salem, who says he has
helped two terminally ill people end their lives by prescribing
barbiturates that were added to a chocolate pudding mixture, said
in a telephone interview Thursday that he was disappointed by the
House vote and that a federal law prohibiting doctor-aided suicide
should and would face legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that this will wind up in the courts,'' he said.
``And to do that you need to have a case, and I would consider
being part of such a case.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen also said he believed doctors remained within their
rights to discuss suicide with patients who were facing painful
death from diseases such as cancer, from which 13 of the 15 people
who took their lives here last year suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are still things we could do,'' he said. ``If
what the patient is looking for is a painless, sure way of quickly
ending his life, as physicians I think we can offer advice as to
what would work and what wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, an adult of sound mind, who, in the opinion of
two doctors, has less than six months to live, may request
authorization for lethal drugs. The person must sign a single-page
form. Doctors may prescribe but not administer the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, known as the Pain Relief Promotion Act,
stipulates that the use of controlled substances to alleviate pain
is a ``legitimate medical purpose,'' but doctors have disagreed
over whether its effect would be to strengthen or weaken
protections for doctors who prescribe drugs for pain control.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association and the National Hospice
Organization have supported the bill, while their state
organizations here in Oregon oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why Oregon was the first and only state to authorize
doctor-aided suicide remains a matter of debate. The state
certainly has a strong populist tradition and was, just after the
turn of the century, one of the first to approve a statewide
initiative system providing for popular vote on measures such as
the Death with Dignity Act.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to classify the state's political philosophy
and, between liberal-leaning Portland and conservative swaths in
much of the rest of the state, Oregon has sent an eclectic mix of
politicians to Washington and to the state capital in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that appeal to that populist streak in terms
of both left and right,'' said David Fidanque, executive director
of the Oregon branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``The
Death with Dignity Act is one that really brought together folks
from the left and from the right who believe government has no
business telling people how they should die.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other interpretations of the libertarian impulses
here. ``Personally, I think Oregonians are still in kind of a
flashback to the '60s,'' said Johnnie Adams, a 49-year-old
convenience store manager who said she was enraged by the House
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't come forward to the 1990s,'' she said, ``but that
doesn't mean it's wrong or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And some say that even the libertarian pigeonhole does not
really fit. There is the prohibition of self-serve gas, which
Oregon shares with New Jersey, and that seems to spring from both
ecological arguments (attendants are less likely to spill) and a
general sense that the ban preserves jobs. There is also the
willingness of Oregonians to impose zoning laws and sharp
restrictions on land use, though Moore suggested there was a
libertarian basis for the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's seen as a way of protecting people's lands from the
arbitrary decisions of government and especially from the arbitrary
decisions of your richer neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly strong opponents of physician-assisted
suicide who endorse the House action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought to begin with that people should be able to
vote on whether they want to take their own lives or not,'' said
Angela Johnston, who owns a plumbing and contracting business here.
Joseph Journagan, a Portland construction worker, said: ``There are
a lot of other ways for people to take their own life without
getting a doctor involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing sentiment here seems to be opposition to the
House action, 3,000 miles away in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Shemarya told reporters at a news conference here
Wednesday, organized by proponents of the Death with Dignity Act,
that her partner had taken great satisfaction from her prescription
for lethal drugs, even though she ultimately died without using
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always a very independent woman, and this gave her a
sense of control,'' said Ms. Shemarya, adding: ``Congress has no
right to tell Oregonians that their vote doesn't count.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERICHO, West Bank _ Sometimes the young mayor of the oldest
city in the world gets ahead of himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Mayor Abdel Karim Sidr's sleepy Palestinian
town has been shaken awake by such a sudden spate of development
that he finds himself dizzy with concern: does he have a future Las
Vegas on his hands?
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going too fast in Jericho,'' Sidr, 37, said. He
pointed to the casino, the resort village, the cable car, the fancy
parks, the shiny orthopedic hospital and the six small factories
already open as well as to the high-rise hotel, the international
airport and the quickie wedding parlor in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying in Arabic that expresses my concern'' he
said. ``Money attracts even the person who prints it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the street outside his office, though, one is struck by the
very lack of bustle. Blazing hot under the desert sun, the heart of
Jericho seems, as always, on permanent siesta and in firm
possession of its rickety charm. While plans call for a futuristic
tower to rise from the town center, it now features a forlorn kiosk
topped by a giant, dented banana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little early to talk about a boom,'' a merchant, Nahida
Halteh, said as she presided over the new souvenir display case in
her clothing store, whose carved camels have yet to gallop out the
door. ``But it is possible, for the first time in a long time, to
talk about a future.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible to talk about 700 new jobs that virtually
eliminated unemployment in the last 18 months, a doubling of the
annual municipal budget to a still paltry $3 million, and,
astonishingly, not only saunas and Jacuzzis but also what the new
Jericho Resort Village promises will be the very first oxygen room
in the Middle East. (``Don't ask me how it works,'' said Riyad
Hamad, the assistant general manager. ``But it has to do with
health things.'')
</P>
<P>
   Sidr said the Palestinian Authority had just signed a contract
with an Italian company to build a second Palestinian airport
several miles north of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Jericho, a town of 15,000, braced itself for
something big.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was about to return from
exile, crossing the border from Jordan directly into Jericho, which
was to become the first independent Palestinian city in the West
Bank. Surely he would make it his capital, people thought.
</P>
<P>
   News organizations from around the world rented every rooftop in
town, and eager entrepreneurs happily cut down palm trees so the
cameramen's views would not be obstructed. Real-estate speculation
sent prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
   But after the arrival and the celebration, Arafat and the
Palestinian forces moved to Gaza. Only one official, Saeb Erekat, a
senior peace negotiator and the Minister of Local governments,
chose Jericho as a base _ and that was out of loyalty to his
family's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   The town, which is dotted with ancient ruins, fell into a
depression, and not the superficial kind that strikes when other
places challenge its claim, generally accepted by archeologists, to
be the oldest continuously inhabited city. (No one ever contests
its title as lowest city: 820 feet below sea level.) The low
spirits were not helped by drought conditions that every year
harmed its production of bananas, oranges and papaya.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, though, the money, if not the rain, started trickling
in. First came international donations, totaling some $30 million
for public works. Then, last year, the $50 million Oasis Casino
Resort opened, giving impetus to a revival of the tourism industry,
which hopes to ride the millennial pilgrimage wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jericho's always been a forgotten town,'' said Hamad, a
Jerusalemite. ``All these projects will lift it and put it on the
map.''
</P>
<P>
   International donations built a sleek modern hospital, a
municipal water system that is about to open, a high-quality soccer
stadium and a luxurious park, complete with color-lit fountain.
Palestinians from all over the West Bank began traveling to Jericho
for its open-air night life, changing the nature and the self-image
of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tickets for the Ehab Tawfik concert this weekend are going for
$25, but it's not too much,'' the mayor said, shrugging, as he
referred to an Egyptian pop star. ``In Vienna, they charge $200 for
the opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Although mellow Jericho was hardly the heart of the intifada,
the Palestinian uprising against Israel killed its winter business
over a decade ago, scaring away the Israelis who used to flock
here.
</P>
<P>
   The casino, which represented the first large, for-profit
international investment in Palestinian territory, started drawing
Israelis and foreign tourists back, if at first only to the
periphery of town. The casino, whose parking lot is always filled,
is pumping some $1 million a month into the local economy, not
including the tax revenues, which go to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, the casino,'' the mayor said nonetheless. ``This is a
subject I don't like to speak about.''
</P>
<P>
   Another touchy subject is that of the proposed wedding chapel.
Abdel Wahab Darawshe, a former Israeli Parliament member, said he
expects to open a civil marriage hall in Jericho soon. It would
cater to secular Israelis who do not want to be wed by an Orthodox
rabbi, as required in Israel; many now fly to Cyprus. Darawshe said
the Palestinian Authority authorized him to set up the business,
from which it will collect marriage registration fees.
</P>
<P>
   But many residents of Muslim Jericho, opposed to secular
marriage as to gambling on religious grounds, find the idea
repulsive, and Sidr said he would block the chapel. ``I'm not
responsible for solving the secular-religious problems of Israel,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Cashing in on the Mount of Temptation is another story. A few
months ago, a modern cable car system began making the climb up the
barren, rocky slope to the site where Jesus supposedly withstood
temptation by Satan after his baptism in the Jordan River. On the
terraced cliff, hard by the caves where tradition says Jesus fasted
for 40 days, a French restaurant is preparing to open.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of a $10 million complex created by a wealthy
Palestinian family, the Sinokrots, who were given an exclusive
franchise on cable cars by the Palestinian Authority and a free
``forever'' contract by the Greek Orthodox Church, which controls
the mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular business will change the itinerary of the
Christian pilgrim,'' said Amir Dajani, the operations manager, who
is looking at package deals with Israeli resort operators on the
Dead Sea. ``And its impact on Jericho will go far beyond the
casino, whose patrons are too busy to even use the toilet, much
less set foot in town. If you want my opinion, in 10 years there
will be 10,000 hotel rooms here.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point the only game in town is the resort village, which
has 58 rooms and 46 bungalows and caters to Israeli-Arab families
and European tour groups. The lush resort, in a barren landscape,
is almost always full, and often a study in contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, a tour bus picking up 100 Spaniards who had just
finished lunching on the poolside veranda was delayed at the gate
before leaving. A herd of goats crossed the drive before the
resort's elegant gates.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKEVILLE, Conn. _ On the rainy, early-morning hours of a
Saturday in October, month, a traveler here might have mistaken the
Interlaken Inn for a ``Great Gatsby'' set. In a roped-off lot,
three rows of cars evoked the 1930s, an age of automotive innocence
when ``motoring'' was an act of faith in a machine _ and was often
an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, only two of the four dozen English cars in the lot
had been built before World War II. All were products of Morgan
Motor Co. of Malvern Link, Worcestershire, which in 1937 locked
into a body design _ low-slung scoop fenders tightly hugging two
seats and a radiator cowl _ to which it has stubbornly and
successfully clung for more than six decades.
</P>
<P>
   The company, too, is an anachronism. Resisting modernization,
the world's oldest privately held automobile company still builds
each car by hand, resulting in a wait of up to six years for one of
the dozen or so machines it produces each week.
</P>
<P>
   And other than adding air bags, Morgan has resisted many safety
modifications. Thus, the only two dealers in the United States _
Isis Motors of San Francisco (www.morgancars-usa.com) and Cantab
Motors Ltd. of Purcellville, Va. _ must modify each car to conform
to U.S. standards, bringing the cost of a new Morgan to about
$61,000. Until Morgan adopted a new Rover engine several years ago,
Isis and Cantab had to convert each car to run on propane.
</P>
<P>
   Here in western Connecticut, an unexpected shower had moved in
overnight. It glazed the cars, making them glisten even in the
stingy light of overcast skies, but it slowed preparations for the
concourse d'elegance of the 21st autumn gathering of the 3/4 Morgan
Group Ltd. of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The threat was more than lost time. The Morgan celebrates style,
not utility or comfort; canvas tops and tonneau covers afforded
interiors little protection from the rain.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m., the only two people on the lot were Dean Meyer and
his wife, Bea Pinon, drying and polishing their newly restored 1964
four-seater. Ms. Pinon stretched the tonneau cover as Meyer swept
away the puddle in its center.
</P>
<P>
   The Ridgefield, Conn., couple were tending a machine that by
Meyer's own account was ``probably overrestored'' _ in some ways
closer to perfection than when it left Malvern Link 35 years
before, and worth 20 times its original price. He opened the bonnet
to reveal a pristine engine surrounded by shining chrome and
nickel.
</P>
<P>
   The traits that distinguish fans of British sports car from the
owners of classic Porsches and Ferraris include an essential sense
of humor. With the exception of the Jaguar line, these cars were
affordable toys for people of limited means. Morgans, like the
original MG's and Triumphs, were inexpensive playthings for young
men who, it was assumed, would outgrow them within the cars'
presumably brief life spans. Yet the roadsters proved resilient.
Even the Morgan's ash-wood frame, still used today, has survived
the years and the bumps remarkably well.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgans have their weaknesses. For example, experts
recommend a complete overhaul of the suspension, steering and
brakes every 15,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The first Morgans were glorified motorcycles, three-wheelers
(the 3 in the 3/4 Morgan Group) powered by outboard motorcycle
engines. Introduced by the company's founder, H.F.S. Morgan, in
1910, these popular ``trikes'' did not evolve into an actual car
until 1935. Even the Morgan's biggest fans will allow that its
ergonomics have not improved much in 64 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real appeal of the Morgan is a sort of anti-appeal,'' said
Burt Fendelman, a corporate lawyer for Citicorp and three-time
Morgan owner who organized this fall's gathering. ``They're not
comfortable. They're not practical. They're not even weatherproof.
But they're rugged and a wonderful driving car, very tight in their
handling, with no power steering or brakes or anything else. They
offer a closeness to the road, a feel that can't be matched.''
</P>
<P>
   Those handling characteristics were in evidence at the afternoon
autocross event, where even the original trikes barely leaned as
wheels screeched through tight, stable turns. What is more, the
cars are simply so much fun to drive that comfort and utility
quickly become nonissues to anyone infected with the Morgan bug.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, a 47-year-old management consultant, and Ms. Pinon, 43,
an airline attendant, keep a 1986 BMW 535is as their ``daily
driver.'' They also have the beginnings of a bona fide collection _
a '59 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud I, a '66 Jaguar E-Type and a '93
Dodge Viper. But their Morgan stands out because it was originally
Meyer's everyday car. He bought it in 1974, while at the University
of California at Berkeley, because the Morgan was the only ``cool
car I could afford.''
</P>
<P>
   The restoration (which cost ``about $40,000'' and resulted in a
car ``worth about $40,000 _ you do the math'') was undertaken,
Meyer said, ``to celebrate our 25th anniversary.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``our,'' Ms. Pinon was quick to clarify, referred to Meyer
and his Morgan: ``He's been with that car longer than he's been
with any woman.''
</P>
<P>
   While many sports car enthusiasts are devoted owners, the
difference, said Fred Cohen of Upper Monclair, N.J., ``is that most
Morgan owners I know actually drive our cars.'' And not just on
sunny summer weekends. Cohen occasionally drives his Morgan to his
job at Conde Nast in New York. And once, when he left the top at
home expecting pleasant weather, he and his wife, Lita, drove more
than 80 miles in pouring rain to a club meet. ``We only got wet if
we stopped,'' he said, ``so we just kept driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the character of the 3/4 Motor Group was reflected in
two unusual aspects of its concours. First, the judging was by
popular vote _ no panel of experts deducted points for a
hardware-store bolt or frayed window trim. Another was that most of
the cars had been driven here, some from hundreds or thousands of
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   In a far corner of the concours sat a cream-and-burgundy '66
Morgan, a car whose beauty derived not from a waxy shine but from
the patina of character. When its owners, John and Gladys
McNaughton, opened the bonnet, they revealed an engine caked in the
grime of thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs a cleaning really bad,'' McNaughton allowed.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the other owners, whose cars glistened beneath the
parting clouds at mid-morning _ even Meyers, whose car won best of
show _ held the McNaughtons and their Morgan in awe. One clue to
that respect could be found atop the oil-soaked firewall, where a
voltage regulator with Cyrillic labeling had been bolted. The
memento dated from 1995, when the McNaughtons celebrated their
retirement by driving their Morgan around the world. When, halfway
through Russia, the generator gave out, a local mechanic dug around
in his shop and found a possible replacement, said McNaughton, a
portly man with a snow-white beard who would attend the awards
banquet that night in a Scottish kilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we tried it out, there were sparks shooting out,'' he
said. ``So he bolted on this Russian voltage regulator. It got us
all the way to London.''
</P>
<P>
   The generator was replaced in England, but McNaughton said he
could not bring himself to remove the regulator, because ``I see it
as part of the car's history now.''

COMMENTARY: THE GREAT ENCOUNTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given their assets and handicaps, Vice President Gore and Bill
Bradley came off quite nicely in their first television whatever.
But the questioners in the New Hampshire audience, so well educated
and well mannered, did themselves no credit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the process of becoming so well mannered and well
educated had boiled out of them all interest in human beings except
themselves and their families. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's great asset is that he does not remind voters of Bill
Clinton when he opens his mouth or shows his face. Gore's handicap
is that he does. Gore took a leap away from Clinton before the
president's name was even directly mentioned. Many Americans still
somehow admire the president, but I have not met any who are eager
to have him or his shadow hanging around public life any longer
than legally essential.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That also happens to be a great asset for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
in his contest for the Senate with a candidate who is running on
her wedding ring. She would not be campaigning in New York even for
a council seat from Staten Island if she had not been married to a
president all these years, and capitalized on them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley behaved with dignity, never once bit their
lips, and politely answered the questions they were asked _ almost
all on health insurance and education.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both agreed Americans needed lots more of both. True enough, but
only their wives and reporters who have to listen to the candidates
every day could tell the difference between them as men and
candidates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that will turn out to be terrific for Americans _ a choice
between two similar great men, if great men we judge them to be if
we ever get a look at them in real intellectual combat. That
depends on two groups of people _ journalists and audience.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The journalists are often more interested in the gossip of
politics than what candidates are actually saying. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under a photo of Gore and students, a caption writer on a
favorite paper squeezed in the fact that he had been talking to
them about drugs. All excited, I read the whole story, but found
not a word about drugs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And not a word about drugs crept into the TV encounter. Nobody
asked either candidate what he would do about the drug plague, and
how to meet the legalization campaign that spends millions not for
drug therapy but to convince America the plague was really good for
them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody asked if either man had an idea how to deal with the
historic victory of Saddam Hussein. He wiped out the U.N.
inspection system he had pledged to obey as the price of keeping
his head after the Gulf War. Richard Butler, the head of the
inspectorate wiped out by Saddam with the eager help of Western
Europe, China and Russia, tells me that Saddam is already resuming
work toward nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We must therefore assume New Hampshire would accept Saddam's
word not to conduct nuclear tests, or has its own antimissile
system, with filters against deadly chemicals and flesh-eating
bacteria. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many other Americans have no interest in ``foreign
affairs.'' But, pray, isn't that why we have elections _ to pick
leaders who will wake us up? How will we do that if we do not grab
our one chance to ask hard questions face to face with the two men
on the platform? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someday the spicy Sen. John McCain may get a chance to
``encounter'' the governor of Texas. The probable first question to
this war hero: Do you ever lose your temper?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bush will tell us one good reason we should vote for him
other than that he has been a Southern governor. Seems to me that
he will play that down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe questioners for a McCain-Bush debate will ask about issues
that apparently never penetrated New Hampshire, like how they feel
about America's enriching the Chinese Communists and strengthening
their armed forces. Maybe they will ask about persecution in
various lands of religious worshipers, most of them happening to be
Christians, and what we should do about Sudanese who enslave other
Sudanese, happening to be Christians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They say we get the presidents we deserve. What did we do to
deserve Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lincoln and also Bill Clinton? Maybe
we also deserve the questioners in TV encounters. After all, they
also were made in America.

 &HT;    Bradley, Gore spar over costs of health plans
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The day after their first town hall meeting, Vice
President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley on
Thursday turned up the rhetoric on their health care proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in Iowa, Gore compared Bradley's $65 billion health
care plan to Gov. George W. Bush's proposed tax cut, saying both
would return the country to an era of deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the Bradley campaign and the Bush campaign have had
serious problems with fiscal responsibility,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Bradley criticized Gore for failing to provide
specific cost estimates for his own health care proposal. Bradley's
campaign also issued a three-page memo disputing Gore's assertion
that Bradley misrepresented the cost of his plan.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpened criticism on both sides followed a more subdued
exchange the two candidates had over health care during Wednesday
night's town hall meeting in Hanover, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   During that meeting, Gore cited a study by Emory University
health policy expert Kenneth E. Thorpe that said Bradley's plan for
near universal health care coverage would cost $1.2 trillion over
10 years, or roughly double what Bradley says the plan would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign strongly disputed the charge Thursday, citing
its own experts, who found Thorpe's analysis to be flawed because
it did not take into account off-setting savings in Bradley's plan.
``Gore is attacking Bradley's plan simply because it is
comprehensive and bold,'' Bradley's campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign also accused Gore of misrepresenting his own
plan to provide expanded health care coverage for poor children.
The campaign said Gore's claim that his plan would cover 90 percent
of all uninsured children was ``inaccurate'' because the plan was
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's health care plan would allow the parents of poor children
to buy into a new Medicaid insurance plan for the poor and provide
tax credits to small businesses that provide coverage for their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan also would cover half of a Medicare patient's
prescription drug bill, up to a maximum of $2,000. It would carry a
$24 monthly premium.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's analysis of Gore's plan, which the vice president did
not mention in Wednesday's town hall meeting, found it would also
cost $48 billion more than Gore estimated and cover fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan would essentially eliminate Medicaid and allow
poor children and families to enroll in the private network of
insurance plans that cover federal employees. The federal
government would subsidize all or part of the premium, depending on
income.
</P>
<P>
   For Medicare patients, Bradley's plan would cover the cost of
prescription drugs, but require patients to pay a $25 monthly
premium and a 25 percent drug co-payment. The plan would also have
a $500 deductible, but no annual cap.

4 TEAMS OF BIOLOGISTS INDEPENDENTLY DISCOVER FAMILY TREE OF
FLOWERING PLANTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Calif., Mass., Wash., Colo. Canada, New Caledonia)   By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than a hundred years of arguing, theorizing and
frustration, evolutionary biologists have at last answered a
question so difficult that Darwin himself called it the
``abominable mystery'': how did the world's flowering plants, the
most diverse and important group of plants on earth, first evolve?
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual confluence of discoveries, four teams of
researchers studying plant DNA have independently and
simultaneously come up with the same answer to this highly
contentious question, deciphering the earliest history of flowering
plants and identifying the three most ancient groups in its family
tree. The first of the results to be published appears in Friday's
issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   The three most ancient groups are water lilies, relatives of the
spice star anise and the oldest of all, a group now represented
only by Amborella, an unremarkable bush found only on the South
Pacific island of New Caledonia.
</P>
<P>
   Identification of the groups and the drawing of new family trees
will allow botanists to follow with new precision the evolution of
many important characteristics of flowering plants, from their
defining trait, the flower, to their most delicious, the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The four teams, involving scientists from many universities in
several countries, came to identical conclusions, though the
results of only one team, comprising scientists from Harvard, have
been published so far. Between them, the teams include most leading
researchers using plant DNA comparisons to understand the early
history of plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the answer,'' Dr. James Doyle, a paleobotanist at the
University of California at Davis, said of the identification of
the three groups and their arrangement on the new family tree of
plants. Doyle was not involved with the studies but, like others,
he expressed confidence in the results. ``It's all come to a huge
crescendo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeff Palmer, molecular evolutionary biologist at Indiana
University who is a member of one of the four teams, said: ``All
too often people get results that conflict with one another, and
you're left wondering what the truth is. These studies reach the
strong conclusion and it's the same strong conclusion. It really is
a remarkable event.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that in the past a number of different plants
have been proposed as the most ancient, among them magnolias,
birches, oaks and the monocots, a group that includes grasses and
lilies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anything you could come up with has been suggested,''
said Dr. Dick Olmstead, a plant evolutionary biologist at the
University of Washington who is studying the problem with Dr. Sean
Graham of the University of Alberta, who together formed one of the
four teams.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the new findings, scientists say the progenitor of
flowering plants _ a group that includes orchids, corn, oaks and
cactuses _ was most likely woody, possibly shrubby or viney, with a
flower bearing an unusual female reproductive structure whose parts
were glued together by a sticky secretion rather than fused into a
seamless structure, as they are in modern flowering plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to really change our view of what the most
ancestral type of flowering plant was like,'' Olmstead said.
</P>
<P>
   Each team of researchers took slightly different approaches to
determining the family tree of flowering plants and pinpointing its
most ancient groups. Olmstead and Graham studied a large number of
slowly evolving genes. Dr. Douglas Soltis and Dr. Pamela Soltis, a
husband and wife team at Washington State University, and their
colleagues looked at fewer genes but studied those genes in a wide
variety of plants.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's Science article, Dr. Sarah Mathews and Dr. Michael
Donoghue of Harvard University described a new technique that they
used to look into the group's history. The researchers studied a
gene that had duplicated itself into two copies in the earliest
flowering plants, providing two independent road maps to the
evolution of the group _ maps that, as the researchers expected,
turned out to be very similar.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists say the new findings do not indicate which
nonflowering plant sprouted earth's first flower. While nearly all
researchers have enthusiastically accepted the new work, a few have
sounded cautionary notes over the answer to this question, which
has been so problematic in the past.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. William L. Crepet, a paleobotanist at Cornell
University, said he would not be shocked if there were some
shifting around in these early branches of the family tree as
studies continued, but he added, ``It looks pretty good for
Amborella right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For biologists seeking a window into the early evolution of
flowering plants, the new findings are invaluable. Of particular
interest is Amborella, the bush catapulted from obscurity to
botanical stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us had never seen it,'' Palmer said. ``Now all of a
sudden everyone's going to want to get it into their botanical
gardens, post signs on it and start studying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Floyd and Dr. William E. Friedman, plant evolutionary
biologists at the University of Colorado at Boulder, are studying
the evolution of a part of the seed, called the endosperm, that
nourishes the plant embryo (or the human who eats the seed).
</P>
<P>
   To fully understand the evolution of this feature, which is
unique to flowering plants, Ms. Floyd said she and Friedman were
studying the endosperm in Amborella, using material from the
arboretum at the University of California at Santa Cruz where the
only Amborella in the continental United States grows.
</P>
<P>
   Amborella, as well as water lilies and relatives of star anise,
will help biologists answer other long-standing questions, like
what kind of water-transporting or circulatory systems were used by
the earliest flowering plants, and how were their flowers
pollinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the types of things that people have been
speculating about for decades, centuries,'' said Dr. Pamela Soltis
of Washington State University, ``and now we can actually address
them.''

   HANOVER, N.H. _ Thanks to this week's presidential debates _
forums, town halls, whatever you want to call them _ we now know
that Bill Bradley's idea of a great leader is Jimmy Carter
(``integrity''), Woodrow Wilson (``the ability to see around
corners'') or Mikhail Gorbachev (``courage''). Who could not find
this interesting? Once again, Bradley demonstrated that he is a new
kind of candidate, a man who skips the predictable tributes to
Lincoln and FDR, and instead names three former heads of state so
high-minded their constituents practically ran them out of town on
a rail.
</P>
<P>
   How many of you watched the debates on TV? (I don't want to see
any hands from people who taped. Sure, you're going to watch them
later, right after all six hours of ``Middlemarch.'') No matter.
We'll boil them down for you. We have nothing better to do with our
time _ in fact, we can travel right up to New Hampshire and watch
them on the spot, in a large hall where people are not permitted to
click over to the Weather Channel when Steve Forbes starts
explaining his economic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic debate seemed weightier because Bradley and Gore
are both perfectly credible presidential candidates. That's more
than you can say for the Republican crew, which featured John
McCain vs. a whole bunch of peculiar people with single-digit poll
numbers and a lot of time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush was forced to skip the event in order to watch
his wife receive an award in Texas. Family is very important to
Bush, who was undoubtedly looking forward to arguing foreign policy
with McCain, and hearing more about his experiences as a heroic
prisoner of war. But he apparently did not have enough clout to get
the ceremony scheduled on another day. This is yet another reminder
that Texas has a weak-governor system.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has a personality without a thermostat, and when he
tries to look animated he practically crashes into the wallboard.
On Wednesday he hijacked the auditorium early on, begging for a
chance to do a pre-debate Q&AMP;A. (``This person has a question! Do we
have time for his question?'') He tossed in a little Spanish and a
long joke, and made endless attempts to create Clintonesque
mind-melds with the audience. (``How old is your child, Corey? . .
. Are you unionized, Earl?'') At the end, he refused to be dragged
offstage. (``Can I say one more word? I would like to stay!'') He
bore an uncomfortable resemblance to the kid who asks the teacher
for more homework. Bradley, lounging on his stool, arms folded
across his chest, looked like the high school athlete watching the
class nerd volunteer to stay and clap erasers.
</P>
<P>
   ``His gestalt is the gestalt of the time,'' said the Bradley
adviser Rick Stengel. ``This elbowing back and forth, that's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Either due to excess gestalt or lack of a good retort, Bradley
refused to fight back when Gore attacked his health insurance plan,
saying it would cost $1.4 trillion and eat up all the money for the
rest of the Democratic agenda. That made the vice president look
like the stronger candidate _ overstimulated, yes, but aggressive.
If Bradley keeps refusing to grab the initiative, he is going to
undermine the media-wide ban on use of basketball analogies and
force somebody to start recalling how, when he was a Knick, he
preferred passing the ball to making the critical shot.
</P>
<P>
   But what, by the way, ever happened to Gore's own budget-busting
Big Idea for high-quality preschool for every child in the nation,
which he bellowed at every opportunity back when he was working on
the theory that shouting a speech made it more interesting? The
campaign contends it's still there, although on Wednesday night it
had dwindled away to ``we've got to focus on preschools.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you weed out 80 percent or so of the Gore-Bradley debate _
the parts where they agree with each other and the parts where each
man starts talking about ``dreams'' _ you get down to some very
interesting questions. Do Americans want a Big Idea, if it costs a
lot of money? Which one? Is anybody willing to suggest trade-offs _
eliminating the new aircraft carrier we're building in Trent Lott's
district? The new fighter planes we're building in Richard
Gephardt's district?
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of time, the World Series is over, and we're
actually finally about to enter the 2000 election year. Let the
games begin.

 &HT;    Official faces marijuana possession charges
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Bill Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia was
charged with possessing marijuana when he landed at Atlanta's
Hartsfield International Airport earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Blacklin, 46, was arrested by the Clayton County Drug
Enforcement Task Force on Wednesday after U.S. Customs Service
inspectors allegedly found 13 grams of marijuana in his underwear,
according to Police Maj. Jim Thompson, commander of the task force.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at a business conference he is attending at the
Ritz-Carlton Hotel in downtown Atlanta, Blacklin denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charges are not true,'' he said. ``I was stopped, but I
didn't have anything on me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Customs Service officials tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Blacklin was spotted by a dog specially trained to sniff out
narcotics and other controlled substances among international
passengers at the airport. The 13 grams of marijuana were
discovered during a ``pat-down'' search by customs inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We confirm that he was stopped and marijuana was found,'' said
Dennis Murphy, a Customs Service spokesman in Washington. Blacklin
was fined $500 and turned over to the drug task force, which
charged him with violating the Georgia's controlled substance law.
Blacklin was released from jail Wednesday evening after posting a
$2,250 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Blacklin had flown to Atlanta from Moscow to attend the
U.S.-Russia Business Council's annual meeting. As the president of
the American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow, Blacklin is responsible
for fostering ties between U.S. corporations and Russian
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming president of the chamber in 1997, Blacklin
worked for a number of major American corporations, including
Westinghouse and Motorola, according to his ex-wife, Ducana
Blacklin, who lives with their three children in the Washington
area.

GLENN SAYS HE WANTS TO STAY PUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Other superstars around the league would
have been talking about restructuring their contract by now. Not
Terry Glenn. In the fourth year of a six-year deal, Glenn, who has
39 receptions (a league-leading 18.4 average), has decided he will
not bring up his contract until he's had a full, healthy year, and
when that time comes, he wants to remain a Patriot for the rest of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I would love to be a Patriot forever,'' Glenn said
Thursday. ``This is where I started. I see a lot of guys bouncing
around and it's not necessarily that they're not good anymore. For
example, the Curtis Martin situation. He was a great player around
here but the organization felt they didn't need Curtis Martin for
that kind of money. They felt they could get another player for
less for the same production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever want to feel that. I go out and practice hard
every day and (want to) stay at the level where I don't feel you're
going to get another player at my level. There are a lot of good
players out there, but you have to find players who work well in
your system, and I think this is the perfect place for me and I
never want to leave here.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's resurgence this season has transpired because he's been
healthy. He takes it, as the old cliche goes, one game at a time _
not one injury at a time, as was the case in the past. He's doing
all he can to earn his $2.1 million this year and $2.3 million next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not right now,'' said Glenn about a renegotiation. ``I'm not
on that boat. I'm just trying to get through a healthy season
before I can even start thinking about stuff like that. I don't
even want to bring anything up about it because my past here hasn't
been all that great, even though I've given it my all and when I'm
out there, things happen for the good. I want things to happen for
a whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's comfort zone with the team is because he sees a strong
core of players who could be here for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got me, Drew (Bledsoe), Willie (McGinest), Ty (Law) has
made his mark; Lawyer (Milloy) is a great player who should be
here. Ben Coates to me is a guy who hasn't caught a lot of balls
but he's a good player. You don't find many tight ends who do what
he does. He's perfect with Drew. Ben is a tight end who's in the
right place. You could go out and get a tight end who's faster, but
you have to have the chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teddy Johnson is a great player we need to have back to
exploit what we can do defensively, and I'll add Andy Katzenmoyer
to that list also. He's shown flashes of what he can be and when
Ted comes back, we can put him back to a position that he may be
even better at than the one he's playing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he's been healthy through seven games, the last two weeks
have been tough _ he didn't have a catch vs. Miami and had just two
receptions for 80 yards (including a season-long 67-yard catch) in
a win over Denver. Every week, Glenn must fight and claw to get
open, and each week the coverage seems to get tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm really pleased about is the way we've started,'' said
Glenn, always bringing the conversation back to the team. ``Two
games we should have won, but our future is looking great. I'm over
the past injuries, but we still have a lot of the season left and a
lot can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he feels he's having an All-Pro season, Glenn
shied away from the question. ``I feel I'm doing fairly well with
my personal goals, but I don't like to think about those,'' he
said. ``I don't try to fulfill just personal goals because I have a
lot of team goals that I put first. We accomplish those team goals
and things should happen for me and for all of us on a personal
level.''
</P>
<P>
   He kicks himself for not being able to make plays early in the
Denver game when Bledsoe went to him quickly _ Glenn dropped a ball
because the sun was in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to take me away; trying to make it difficult
for me as opposed to the prior weeks, which we all expected,'' he
said. ``I expected it. They've done a good job of when they're
going to do it (double-teams). They don't do it on every down. But
when they do it, it just seems to come at the right time for them
and the wrong time for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for people to say, `well, he had him one-on-one.'
Well, maybe we were running the ball on that play. There might be
another play where Drew's first read is not me. But they're doing
it when the first read is me. We're going to try to get other guys
involved, but sometimes when you do that it throws off the
quarterback. We just have to keep making adjustments. I'm just
gonna fight through them. Like last week, I just have to make plays
when I get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been interesting to Glenn how the receiving draft class of
'96 has fared. All of the first-rounders went to AFC East teams.
Since they were drafted, Keyshawn Johnson (drafted first by the
Jets) has the most catches with 256 for 3,515 yards and 25 TDs;
Marvin Harrison (drafted 19th by Indianapolis) has 241 receptions
for 3,187 yards and 29 TDs; Glenn (drafted seventh) has 206
receptions for 3,071 yards and 13 TDs, and Eric Moulds (drafted
24th by Buffalo) has caught 145 passes for 2,399 yards and 14 TDs.
Glenn also has the most 100-yard games of the group (10).
</P>
<P>
   ``(Keyshawn's) a great player who makes plays,'' said Glenn.
``But a lot of guys under him thought they were good also, such as
myself. I felt I was the best receiver in the draft no matter who
went first. Keyshawn was a taller receiver out of USC. But he
stayed his senior year, I left early. All those guys fell in line.
Each guy was put on a competition level by the media. A lot of
people thought Marvin should go before me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking Marvin's a great player. (He) has really stepped
his game up and is having a Pro Bowl year. He might be having the
best year in the league. I'm happy for him because he was the last
in the bunch to really show what he could do. And now I'm coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots needed three players to have healthy years:
Bledsoe, McGinest, and Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   And one game from the midpoint of the season, all three have
been healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These hamstrings can go at any time,'' Glenn said. ``I put
`Icy-Hot' on my hamstrings, I stretch really well before practice
and try to prevent those kind of injuries. I'm not going to say I'm
never going to get hurt again, but things can happen, so I'm taking
a lot of precautions.''

SAN FRANCISCO'S HIGH-FLYING MAYOR MAY CRASH ON ELECTION DAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For an hour, it was 1995 again, when Willie
Lewis Brown Jr. was the newly minted mayor and San Francisco was
dazzled by his possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Brown played the crowd at City Hall like Mozart on the piano,
vowing to right what's wrong and to better what's right, and
tempering the high notes with quiet moments and meaningful pauses.
And when he was finished Monday with what he called this ``last
state of the city address to be given by any mayor in this
century,'' the chamber, so packed a person could faint, erupted in
the loud, long applause usually reserved for a Broadway hit.
</P>
<P>
   Then 1999, one week before the mayoral election, came rushing
back.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallway outside the chamber, someone held a newspaper
with the latest San Francisco Chronicle poll. It showed Brown with
33 percent of the vote, far short of the 50 percent plus one vote
needed to win the election Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby stood former Mayor Frank Jordan, who is one of Brown's
three main opponents, drawing a crowd as he wondered aloud where
the $1 billion increase in the city's budget over the last four
years had gone.
</P>
<P>
   Near him lingered Tom Ammiano, the president of the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors, who entered the race less than two
weeks ago as a write-in candidate. Ammiano was exulting over the
newspaper poll, which put him in a statistical tie for second place
without even being listed as one of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Given the polls, a run-off election in December seems likely.
And while the prevailing thought is that Brown, who entered office
as Mr. San Francisco, would win that race, no one is taking his
victory for granted. The fact is, San Francisco's mayor, a master
of the political universe who spent three decades in the California
Legislature (15 years as the speaker of the Assembly before a new
two-term-limit law forced him from office in 1995), is no longer
Prince of the City.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a booming economy, low unemployment and plunging crime
rates that mirror the trend across the nation, voters in
politically obsessed San Francisco are not happy. And while this is
not as surprising as it sounds _ San Franciscans are notoriously
hard to please, ousting the last two mayors after single terms _
Brown, as colorful and irrepressible as the city considers itself,
has disappointed voters on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   To his more liberal constituents, he is too cozy with developers
and other big business interests. To more conservative voters (a
conservative here is a moderate Democrat anywhere else in the
country), he does not pay enough attention to quality-of-life
issues like traffic and is too close to the fringe groups that give
San Francisco its reputation as a hotbed of radical chic.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Trying to cater to competing constituencies is a tricky
business. Earlier this month, the mayor ordered the confiscation of
supermarket shopping carts that homeless people use to haul their
possessions, on the grounds that they were stolen property. The
move was seen as a response to merchants' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But even with public compassion toward homeless people at a
seemingly all-time low, publicity about the operation brought
outrage and sympathy. Brown stopped the operation before it began,
both denying he had ordered it and claiming it was misunderstood.
That, in turn, caused the more conservative pundits and business
people in the city to label the mayor a waffler.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The hard truth for Brown is that many San Franciscans believe
the city is not better off than it was four years ago. Half the
voters in the latest poll said that homelessness, considered the
city's No. 1 problem, has gotten worse during the mayor's term. A
third of the voters said the city's trouble-plagued public transit
system has deteriorated, while only 23 percent said it had
improved. And 43 percent of those polled say that a major problem,
the lack of affordable housing, has worsened, while only 14 percent
said the condition had improved. The mayor's administration has
also been plagued with accusations of cronyism and corruption in
several city agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, at least, Brown had the edge among liberals.
Both of his leading opponents up until then _ Jordan and Clint
Reilly, a political consultant and Jordan's former campaign
manager, who has spent more than $3 million of his own money on his
campaign _ are considered more conservative. So Brown concentrated
his heaviest campaigning in the more traditionally conservative
Asian neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But the write-in candidacy of Ammiano, a former
special-education teacher who is gay, has thrown that liberal vote
into question.
</P>
<P>
   The Ammiano campaign, as it exists, has galvanized disenchanted
voters who had planned to sit out the election, his supporters
contend.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I know was sitting around saying, `Gosh, who am I
going to vote for for mayor?''' said Tim Redmond, executive editor
of The Bay Guardian, a liberal weekly newspaper that repeatedly
urged Ammiano to run.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond estimated that several thousand voters who had planned
to stay home or vote for one of the fringe candidates, will write
in Ammiano as their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this pent-up frustration has been released because all
of a sudden people have a place to go with it,'' he said. ``I
haven't seen this kind of excitement in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Brown campaign seems resigned to losing some support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that we're disappointed that Tom Ammiano has
entered the race and will probably help the more conservative
candidates by doing so,'' said P.J. Johnston, a spokesman for the
mayor's re-election team.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the threat, Brown's campaign brought no less a
liberal heavy-hitter than the Rev. Jesse Jackson to town Tuesday.
The mayor and Jackson made a series of stops in neighborhoods like
the Castro, a largely gay district, to remind voters of Brown's
long civil rights credentials. Jackson's presence certainly
attracted attention, though he tried to deflect it to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Brown is the real thing,'' Jackson would say, as
passers-by vied to shake his hand.

THE GOOD AND BAD OF MODERN INDOOR ARENAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now if you were sitting in a midcourt Staples
Center floor seat costing $350, would you like to know the score
and how much time was left at any given point in the game?
</P>
<P>
   If the answer is yes, then on Wednesday evening it would have
been tough patooties for you, pal.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so you couldn't see anything resembling a score on the
octagonal scoreboard, and there aren't any sideline scoreboards in
the building, and the scoreboards waaaaaaaaay back there on the
endline are significantly smaller than any good Indiana high school
scoreboards, and nowhere in the building were you offered
cumulative team stats, which are known in the arena trade as
``hustle stats'' (something even the FleetCenter, that K Mart of
indoor arenas, manages to do), but at least you could hear the
music very nicely on the spectacular Bose sound system.
</P>
<P>
   That $350 a pop is only for a Clippers game, by the way. When
the Varsity, er, the Lakers play, that same seat zooms to $1,150
(yup, even vs. Vancouver).
</P>
<P>
   Look, the $375,000,000 Staples Center is beautiful, and it's
about time LA moved itself into the 21st century with a thoroughly
modern arena. The Great Western (nee Fabulous) Forum was a '60s and
'70s anachronism. The Staples Center gives LA a proper venue for
its two NBA teams, its NHL team, a forthcoming Arena Football team,
and all the predictable concerts, shows, and mega-events, including
the 2000 Democratic National Convention and the 2000 Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   And the scoreboard situation will improve, according to Bobby
Goldwater, the arena's senior vice president and general manager.
``We're waiting for some software,'' he says. ``We'll have
everything in place by the first (regular-season) game next Tuesday
night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Staples Center is everything _ good and bad _ we've all come
to expect from a modern indoor sports/entertainment venue. If one
thing is clear by now, it is that the modest druthers of a
committed sports fan who needs nothing more than a comfortable seat
and a few places to grab a hot dog and something to drink have been
overwhelmed by the seemingly insatiable demands of an entirely
different class of people whose priorities mystify the rest of us.
As one member of the Clippers' stat crew said during Wednesday
night's inaugural Staples Center basketball game (a Clipper loss,
naturally), ``To be honest, I had no problems with the Sports
Arena. The sight lines were great. I didn't need all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Luxury suites are now the engines that drive all indoor and
outdoor arena/stadium construction, so it should come as no
surprise that what distinguishes the Staples Center, as opposed to
all other such venues that have sprouted up in the past decade or
so, is the overwhelming visual spectre of the suites. It's not that
there are so many _ 160, or 50-some fewer than Chicago's United
Center _ as much as it is how big they are. In all other buildings,
the suites are clearly adjuncts. Not here. In this building the
clear impression is that the suites are totally and utterly primary
and the 16,000 other seats are clearly and utterly secondary. Now
we all know this to be the actual case, but in no other new arena
is it made so obvious. There is no ambiguity here. The seats here
are attached to the suites, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen, that noted Man of the People, had his own
commentary on the Them-vs.-Us nature of the modern arena. Surveying
the scene as he formally opened the building Oct. 18, he looked up
at the suites and said, ``Come on out, now. The show is starting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a have-have situation,'' protests Goldwater, a longtime
Madison Square Garden executive who is now one of the many proud
Staples Center poppas. ``Yes, we have great luxury suites. But it's
also a good deal for the average fan. For example, in the Forum
there are four restrooms and four refreshment stands. Here we have
55 restrooms and 23 refreshment stands. And we have 1,200
television monitors.''
</P>
<P>
   From a GM's viewpoint, there's a lot to be proud of. Philip F.
Anschutz, a publicity shy multi-billionaire, is the big money man
behind the project and he did it right. There are, for example,
81,000 square feet of Terrazzo tile in the joint, not to mention 11
escalators and 10 elevators. It is LA, after all. It took a
monumental effort by both municipal and private forces to make this
downtown enterprise come to life, and they weren't about to do a
half-baked job.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine this building not becoming a financial
success. With all those teams and all those shows and all those
Happenings, the building will be heavily used. ``Between now and
the end of June, we only have eight nights when the building is not
committed to something,'' Goldwater points out. ``And we've
reserved two days for changeover practice from basketball to hockey
and vice-versa.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to six basketball-hockey doubleheaders, the Staples
Center will be the scene of an interesting home-and-home series
between the Clippers and Lakers Jan. 4 and 5. On the 4th, the
Clippers will host the Lakers. On the 5th, the Lakers will host the
Clippers. And have we mentioned that each team has its own personal
floor?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping the league office would want to allow us to
have a little fun with that,'' says Goldwater, ``and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   People here will like it. Intelligently located at the
convergence of several major freeways, and properly glitzy, the
Staples Center will quickly become the sports and entertainment
mecca for the entire West Coast. LA has gotten what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a building that was right for us,'' points out
Goldwater, ``just as Indiana has done with a building that was
right for Indianapolis. They've got their `fieldhouse' look. We've
got outdoor terraces. You wouldn't want an outdoor terrace in
Indianapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the Hoosier State you'd damn well better have a decent
scoreboard, even for an exhibition game.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. economy turned in its best quarterly performance of the
year this summer, virtually guaranteeing enough momentum to carry
the nation to its longest economic expansion in history early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Strong growth often leads to shortages and rising prices. But as
the economy expanded at a brisk 4.8 percent annual rate in the
June-September quarter, inflation turned out to be mild and the
cost to employers of wages and benefits rose only modestly. The
combination of robust growth with little evidence of higher
inflation was so popular on Wall Street that the value of stocks
and bonds soared. The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than
227 points, or 2.19 percent, to 10,622.53. Other indexes chalked up
similarly impressive gains.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's sharp rise reflected an expectation that the
Federal Reserve's policy-makers _ who have raised interest rates
twice this year in an attempt to prevent the economy from
overheating _ may be less likely to do so yet again at their next
meeting, on Nov. 16. And even if the Fed pushes rates slightly
higher again next month, analysts say, it now appears more likely
to refrain from further increases in the near future unless
inflation shows clear signs of worsening.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department, at the same time as it provided its
fresh snapshot of the economy, also released a sweeping revision of
its past data, stretching back to 1959, that is intended to make
the government's measures of economic performance reflect the new
electronic technologies that are now so important. The revised
numbers showed the 1990s to be a decade of notably stronger
economic growth than originally reported, although not stronger
than any of the last four decades.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes the performance of the economy in the 1990s
is the length of the expansion, which began in March 1991 and will
surpass the 106-month record set in the 1960s if it lasts until
next February.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials cited the latest growth numbers
as evidence of the success of their economic policies. President
Clinton called the 1990s expansion ``the soundest in decades.'' And
Martin Baily, chairman of the White House Council of Economic
Advisers, linked the economy to what he described as the
administration's success in shifting the budget from deficit to
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private sector is generating the strong growth,'' Baily
said, ``but good economic policies have created an environment for
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Caveats, however, punctuated the euphoria. ``What we have here
is consumption and investment growing faster than income,'' said
Albert Wojnilower, an economic consultant in New York. ``How are
people doing this? They are borrowing money, counting on the gains
in the stock market and in the value of their homes to help them
carry their debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Labor Department released its Employment Cost
Index for the third quarter Thursday. This is the government's
broadest measure of labor costs, covering benefits as well as
wages, salaries and bonuses. It is closely watched on Wall Street
for evidence that rising labor costs will force companies to raise
prices, a prospect that often prompts traders to sell stocks and
drive up interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the strong economy and the labor shortages evident
in an unemployment rate of only 4.2 percent, the index rose by only
0.8 percent and 3.1 percent over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The broadest measure of the economy's performance is the gross
domestic product, which tracks the rising value of all goods and
services produced in the nation. Growth had slowed in the second
quarter, to a 1.9 percent annual rate, but bounced back sharply in
the third quarter, with the GDP, at an annual rate, rising by $106
billion to an inflation-adjusted $8.88 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The largest component of that growth was attributed to a 4.3
percent rise in consumer spending, which was stronger in the third
quarter than in the second. But a big part of the increase in
output resulted from businesses deciding to build up their
inventories rather than draining them as they did in the second
quarter. They carried out this stockpiling in anticipation of
future sales, particularly sales of new car models, and also as a
precaution in the event of year 2000 computer-related disruptions,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the inventory expansion came from motor vehicle
stockpiling at the dealer level,'' said Brent Moulton, associate
commissioner at the Bureau of Economic Analysis, ``but
manufacturers also stockpiled, mostly durable goods _ aircraft
parts perhaps, appliances, machinery and equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepped up investment, in computers, software, trucks, buses and
aircraft, also played a big role in the third-quarter jump in
economic growth, and an increase in government spending at all
levels contributed to the rising economy. But strong growth in the
future seems uncertain to many economists. They expect the economy
to start slowing by early next year and point to what they see as
the first signs of that slowing.
</P>
<P>
   The housing market has weakened as mortgage rates have risen,
they note. Vehicle sales have edged down from their summer peak and
consumer spending, while still strong, has grown more slowly since
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have experienced four consecutive months of declines in
consumer confidence, and debt is inordinately high,'' said David
Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. ``That has to take
its toll.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The puzzles in Thursday's reports were the mild labor cost
increases despite widely reported labor shortages and the slower
rise in a price index that the Commerce Department uses to
calculate economic growth. The index rose at a 1.3 percent annual
rate in the second quarter and 1 percent in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever merchandise is in short supply because of the strong
economy is brought in from abroad, and that helps to hold down
prices,'' Wojnilower said, noting that imports had risen in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Business executives insist that they have difficulty raising
prices because of growing competition in a global marketplace.
What's more, labor costs are not rising rapidly enough to force
price increases _ for a variety of reasons, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   One involves inflation. Because it is mild, workers are
demanding smaller increases. The widespread availability of
temporary workers means that employers are not under pressure to
raise wages to fill jobs. Bonuses and profit sharing have
increasingly replaced raises. And manufacturing employment has
declined by 500,000 jobs since March of 1998, with many of the
displaced workers taking service sector jobs at lower pay.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lazar, an economist and partner at the ISI Group, a Wall
Street firm, cites mergers as still another explanation for mild
labor cost increases. ``The reason workers are not pressing for
higher wages,'' she said, ``is that mergers are running high and
layoffs as companies combine operations. Layoffs keep labor on the
defensive.''

 &HT;    Angels have history of high standards
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis and Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Blue Angels, an envelope-pushing team of crackerjack Navy
pilots, was formed following World War II to boost Navy morale,
attract recruits and catch the admiring eye of Congress with
death-defying barrel rolls when budget time rolled around.
</P>
<P>
   But even the daredevil Angels have been deviled by crashes that
have killed 25 of their number through the years, including two
pilots killed Thursday near Moody Air Force Base in South Georgia.
No spectator has ever been harmed, however, and until Thursday, the
Angels had not had a fatal accident in over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Blue Angels were formed in 1946, the team, based at
the Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida, has performed for more
than 322 million people, flying 60 to 70 shows a year at some 35
sites across the nation. The six-pilot team now flies F/A-18
Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday, the last crash involving the squad was in 1990.
The last death was in 1985, in Niagara Falls, N.Y. Lt. Cmdr.
Michael Gershon was killed when two planes collided during an air
show.
</P>
<P>
   The team flew into heavy weather in 1995 when their commander,
Donnie Cochran, a Pelham, Ga., native, stepped down, saying he was
worried about his own flying performance and did not want to
threaten his pilots' safety. Cochran was the first black man ever
to lead the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran had taken the team back into intensive training after
lining up above the wrong runway during a high-speed, low-level
maneuver at Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Every Blue Angel maneuver involves a series of procedures that
must be performed in precise sequence and with split-second timing
_ a tightly choreographed aerial ballet staged at 400 miles an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   At Oceana, one of the heart-stopping maneuvers above a crowd of
150,000 people called for four of the Angels' fighter jets to cross
simultaneously over a single point from different directions, using
two runways as their marks.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran, who was said to have trouble ``hitting his marks,''
approached the point over the wrong runway. He resigned as leader,
citing concern for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that same year, the Angels had canceled a show because
of performance problems with a pilot who was later replaced.
</P>
<P>
   So sensitive are the Angels to their high-profile mission that
team members can be dismissed for even the appearance of
impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   This June, the group commander removed a pilot and a team public
affairs officer for ``a loss of trust and confidence.'' An official
said the two had been directed to end a ``personal relationship,''
which involved jogging together and other activities of a
non-sexual nature, to avoid the perception of an inappropriate
relationship. The two ignored the directive and were reassigned,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another scandal threatened the Angels' image in 1994, when the
Navy grounded Cmdr. Robert Stumpf, team leader at the time, because
he was under investigation for possible involvement in the 1991
Tailhook sexual harassment scandal. During the now-infamous
Tailhook Symposium, Stumpf was present in the unit's hospitality
suite as strippers performed. Although the convening authority
sought to charge him with conduct unbecoming an officer, he was
cleared by a special board of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But he remained on a list of officers named in the Defense
Department Inspector General's Tailhook report as being potentially
guilty of wrongdoing during the convention. He has since retired.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Angels' worst accident was in 1973, when two pilots and
a crew chief were killed when two planes flying belly-to-belly
collided.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has its own precision flying team, the
Thunderbirds. The Thunderbirds were grounded for almost a month
this spring after a minor in-air collision in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pilots involved was subsequently removed from the
team.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first such action in six years and only the second
time the Thunderbirds had put shows on hold since a 1982 crash that
killed four pilots.

 &HT;    2 members of the Blue Angels die in crash
 &HT;    By Alan Judd and Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two members of the Navy's elite Blue Angels flying team were
killed Thursday when their F/A-18 Hornet crashed on a farm near
Moody Air Force Base in South Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The jet crashed into pine trees at 12:20 p.m. Naval officials
did not immediately identify the victims and said they did not know
whether the team would fly in an air show at the base near
Valdosta, Ga., this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first fatal crash involving the Blue Angels since
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Peters of Douglas, Ga., said she saw the Blue Angels fly
over the grocery store where she was shopping just before the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came over in a beautiful formation. I think there were
six of them,'' she said. ``It was probably a half an hour later
that we saw the smoke. I didn't hear a crash or anything. Someone
said they must be burning garbage. Then a little while later the
fire trucks came by. It was just a big, black billowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilots in the Blue Angels dazzled 15 million people with their
aerial acrobatics last year. They typically fly in 60-70 air shows
a year and had 68 shows in 36 sites in the United States and Canada
on this year's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. Jack Papp, a spokesman at the Pensacola Naval Air Station,
said the Blue Angels had just arrived in Valdosta when the crash
occurred. The team was flying over the site of the air show _ a
routine task before any performance. The idea, he said, is to
``become familiar with the terrain'' and to note the location of
power lines or other obstructions.
</P>
<P>
   Four jets were flying at the time of the crash. Papp said the
planes were circling the air field and preparing to land. He said
there were no civilian casualties or damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``With crashes, we can't confirm anything,'' he said, ``because
it's under investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet that crashed is the only two-seater in the team; it's
often used to take reporters on flights.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Blue Angels are chosen through a ``rigorous selective
process,'' Papp said. They are considered among the best fliers in
the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The maintenance is top notch. You also have top-notch naval
aviators.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington D.C., Ken Bacon, a Pentagon spokesman, said the
Navy is eager to learn from the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if any sort of procedural or maintenance problems
are revealed by the investigation they will be addressed
aggressively by the Navy,'' he said. ``This is its premier flying
team ... and you can be sure the Navy will do whatever it can to
make sure that this team is at the very top of its ability to
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   The group was formed in 1946. The deaths Thursday brought to 25
the number of Blue Angels killed in air shows or training.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was devastating news at Pensacola Naval Air Station,
home of the 14-member Blue Angel crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks your heart,'' Papp said.
</P>
<P>
   He said other members of the Blue Angels stayed in Valdosta
after the crash. He did not know when they would return to
Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're feeling it right now,'' Papp said. ``Any time you lose
shipmates like this, it's a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   At American Legion Post 240, about two miles from the naval
station's main entrance, a group of military retirees and their
wives had just finished their weekly bingo game when they learned
of the crash on television.
</P>
<P>
   Several gathered at the post's bar, sipping drinks and watching
a wide-screen television set for updates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely terrible,'' said Libby Lee, a military spouse, as
she sipped a Busch beer mixed with Sprite. ``Oh, my God, it's
terrible. Those Blue Angels, they do a beautiful job. Scares the
holy hell out of me, but it's a beautiful job.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the bar, a retired Navy aviator sat alone, dressed
in his old uniform. In a barely discernible whisper, he said he
couldn't talk about the crash. He stared straight ahead and drank
his beer.

SPORTS COLUMN: BELLINGER ENJOYS THE TASTE OF THE BIG TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the cacophonous end of another memorable Yankees
World Series run, the cameras sought out the stars, and their faces
glistening with champagne lit up the night. Far away from center
stage of this now familiar theater, Clay Bellinger found his wife
outside the clubhouse, they kissed, and their eyes welled with
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Bellinger had two-week-old Cole in her arms, while
trying to keep her other children _ 7-year-old Ashli and 4-year-old
Cody _ from disappearing into a mass of Yankee families and famous
friends. Spike Lee edged past. Then Billy Crystal and George
Steinbrenner, with his best buddy, the mayor, while all the
familiar television faces dashed about, none of them stopping to
put a microphone in the face of the Yankee they most likely did not
know.
</P>
<P>
   In this telegenic age of overexposure, it is virtually
impossible even for the most casual of fans to not recognize a
champion New York Yankee. There are only slightly more than two
dozen, but here was one _ his uniform drenched, his light brown
World Series champions cap backward _ who could walk down a
corridor, be a face in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``My face is going to be in the team photo of the world
champions,'' Bellinger said after the Yankees had swept the Braves
and the season out of New York late Wednesday night. ``And it's
going to be there forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Forever is a long time, but Clay Bellinger, who for a decade has
harbored big-league dreams as if scripted for `Bull Durham',
finally found the best company to spend it with. At 30, without a
major league statistic to his name, he fought his way onto the
Yankees at as good a time as any to be a member of the most
famously successful team in a hundred years of American sports.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best of all times, considering the record three
million plus who this season paid their way into a ball park the
owner once claimed people were terrified to go near. Certainly it
would be difficult to refute the argument that the Yankees' 25th
championship team _ its hefty payroll and its near-metronomic
post-season precision notwithstanding _ is the most endearing of
all. From the cancer-stricken manager, right on down to the last
utility man.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Clayton Daniel Bellinger, who a year ago watched
the Yankees sweep San Diego like the rest of America, fighting
sleep after a long day's work. He had gone home to Chandler, Ariz.,
after hitting .224 at the Yankees' Class AAA Columbus farm. He
needed a job, supplementary income, the way it used to be for all
but the superstars, the chosen few, in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked in a warehouse, shipping and handling,'' Bellinger
said. ``When you're a minor leaguer, when you've got a family to
support, that's what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   One year later, after an almost unfathomable life turn, he could
count on as much of a World Series share, several hundred thousand
dollars, as Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   He is 6 foot 3, 195 pounds, out of Oneonta, N.Y., and was thrown
a life preserver by the Yankees' organization after being released
by Baltimore two years ago. Don Zimmer took a liking to him, the
grizzled, limping bench coach with more than a half-century in the
big leagues struck by the passion of a young man just dying for a
taste. Prostate cancer hit Joe Torre early last spring. The interim
manager Zimmer, an old softy at heart, was an emotional mess
himself breaking the news to Bellinger that he had finally made the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clay called me from Anaheim and he was crying,'' Jennifer
Bellinger said. ``All those years, all those towns, and it finally
had paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a six-week demotion in late July,
Bellinger toured major league America for the first time, and
perhaps last. He saw Yogi Berra come home. He saw Joe DiMaggio
mourned. He saw David Cone's perfect game. He had 45 at-bats, nine
hits, a Yankee Stadium home run on Sept. 2. I know Torre has stated
his professional reasons for including a .250 career minor league
hitter on the post-season roster, instead of a Jim Leyritz or Shane
Spencer. I wonder, though. In the spirit of this team's public
vulnerability, its tender disposition, I am inclined to believe
that someone made a sentimental decision along the way.
</P>
<P>
   His 31st birthday coming next month, his major league future
hardly assured, Clay Bellinger got into four post-season games, had
a playoff at-bat. His parents are coming down from Oneonta for
Friday's parade that will roll slowly along the Canyon of Heroes.
For a man who labored 10 long years to get here, this procession
cannot move slowly enough.

 &HT;    Rise in hate crimes stirs concern at ADL forum
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Millennium Madness. Generation Y. World Church of the
Creator.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years these could become buzzwords in the
language of violence in America, leaders of the Anti-Defamation
League were told Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Killorin, special agent in charge of the Atlanta office of
the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said that
despite a recent downturn in crime, especially youth crime, the
future does not necessarily look all that bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say the darkest clouds are behind us, but I fear
the darkest clouds are still ahead of us,'' Killorin said at the
opening session of the ADL's 85th annual national meeting in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ADL leaders worry that three separate violent incidents this
summer aimed primarily at Jews could be the harbinger of more
attacks and a reversal of a decades-long decline in anti-Semitic
views in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents included the burning of three synagogues in
Sacramento, Calif., allegedly by two brothers with ties to the
anti-Semitic World Church of the Creator; shootings in Indiana and
Illinois that killed two and wounded six and were carried out by a
former member of the World Church of the Creator; and the shootings
by an avowed white supremacist at a Jewish community center in Los
Angeles. David Lehrer, director of the ADL's Los Angeles office,
said the violence in his community that was directed primarily at
children caught many Jews by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of the Jewish community (in Los Angeles)
anti-Semitism is an esoteric subject that really doesn't apply to
them. It's something that their parents had to deal with,'' Lehrer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The confessed gunman, Buford Furrow, who shot and killed a
Filipino mail carrier before he gave himself up, has been linked to
the Aryan Nations and the Phineas Priesthood. Both are virulently
anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   Many right-wing extremist groups such as Aryan Nations are using
the advent of the new millennium to foment hate, according to
experts, by predicting a breakdown in society that will lead to
race wars and an eventual end-time battle.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of age of the so-called Generation Y could also lead
to increased violence, Killorin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 2012, we will have the largest bubble of young men that
we've ever had in the country,'' Killorin said. ``The end of
Generation X and the beginning of Generation Y has brought us these
high school shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   But this summer's incidents have made more people aware of
anti-Semitic activity and other hate crimes, ADL members said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Bernstein, director of the ADL's San Francisco office,
said the Sacramento community drew together after the synagogue
burnings to provide support and money to help rebuild them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is noghtened consciousness and awareness of
hate,'' Hirschhaut said.

SCOUTING REPORT ON THE FRONT OFFICE: GREAT JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lineup on the field included names like Knoblauch, Jeter,
O'Neill, Williams, Martinez, Girardi and Brosius. Everyone knows
them. The names in the Yankees' other lineup are not so well known:
Michael, Didier, Taylor, Oppenheimer, Webber, Wurth, Hansen, Caro.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, among that other lineup, Gene Michael is known because
he has performed a vast variety of duties for the Yankees in the
last three decades _ playing, coaching, managing, general managing
and scouting. He has never performed better than he did the past
two months in directing the staff that scouted the three teams the
Yankees easily vanquished in the postseason, concluding with their
four-game World Series sweep of the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   As scouts are quick to point out, the players have to take the
information and execute on the field, but it was obvious that the
Yankees took critical information onto the field with them. They
won 11 of their 12 postseason games, strongly indicating that they
knew something about their opponents before they pitched to them
and swung at their pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very much impressed with what the Yankees did against
the Braves' hitters,'' Carmen Fusco, the Mets' director of
professional scouting, said Thursday. ``I was at the games and
watched what they did, and their crew did a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' scouts had the benefit of watching the Mets'
pitchers hold the Braves to a .223 batting average after they had
hit .304 in their division series against the Houston Astros.
``They pitched their hitters very much the same way we pitched
their hitters,'' Fusco said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves batted .200 against the Yankees, needing three
eighth-inning hits in Game 4 to get even that high. Before that
flurry of singles, the Braves were hitting .187 in the Series.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner gushed about a lot of things in the
emotional aftermath of the team's record-tying second successive
World Series sweep, but he particularly praised the role the scouts
played in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about the scouting staff of Gene Michael and the
job they did on scouting these teams,'' the owner said. ``I'll put
them up against anybody. They all deserve a bow.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think that one of the first steps Steinbrenner took when
he and his partners bought the Yankees in 1973 was to slash the
scouting staff on the premise that the team didn't need as many
scouts as it had. At least he didn't say, as Marge Schott did when
she ran the Cincinnati Reds, ``All they do is watch games.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steinbrenner subsequently learned that scouts are the
backbone of an organization and rebuilt his staff. Now the Yankees
probably lead the league in some scouting areas.
</P>
<P>
   They have, for example, two advance scouts to follow coming
opponents during the season where other teams have one. For the
post-season, they started with two scouts on each possible
opponent, then doubled that number as teams began dropping out of
contention.
</P>
<P>
   Michael stepped down as Steinbrenner's general manager after the
1995 season rather than take a cut in pay. He became a scout for
the team, watching games played in East Coast cities, then was
named director of major league scouting. He was responsible for
planning the postseason scouting strategy, deploying organization
scouts throughout both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   He also headed the eight-man contingent that watched the Mets
give the Braves a difficult time. Joining him were Bob Didier and
Wade Taylor, the advance scouts; Ron Hansen, a major league scout;
Joe Caro, who scouts professional players out of Tampa, Fla.; Damon
Oppenheimer, a national cross-checker from Phoenix, and two scouts
whose primary job is to find the best amateur players, Steve Webber
of Watkinsville, Ga., and Leon Wurth of Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two scouts on every team in contention in September,''
Michael said, describing the plan of attack the scouting team
followed. ``We do the American League first. We started Sept. 3
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sept. 17 we started on the National League. We had two on
each contending team over there. We stayed on them until they were
eliminated or we knew they were not going to be in it. We stayed on
the Mets. We stayed on Atlanta. We stayed on Houston all the time
until they weren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   When a two-man team followed a team, Michael said: ``One does
the offense. One does the defense. Then they both do strategy,
outfield arms, bunting, who bunts, who steals, counts they steal
on, tendencies. By having one doing offense and one doing defense,
they can get better detail during the game because it's tough
watching the pitchers, watching the defense, watching the hitters
on the other team. We have the luxury of putting a little bit more
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Braves-Mets series, Michael said, he, Oppenheimer,
Didier and Taylor watched both teams, Webber and Werth focused on
the Braves and Hansen and Caro did the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Mets lost,'' the former shortstop said, ``Hansen and
Caro went home and the six of us met on Atlanta and put the report
together. The three scouts who did the hitters for Atlanta were
scouting for our pitchers. We all get together and give an opinion
on it. Then we did a consensus sort of thing about their pitchers
for our hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Scouts derive a special pleasure from watching a postseason game
and seeing their ideas unfold on the field. Then there are the
instances where a pitcher or a hitter doesn't follow the scouts'
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally you're going to see a mistake, in your opinion, now
and then,'' Michael said. ``You see something you disagree with,
like what a pitcher should have thrown, and you wonder why. You try
to cut that down. You try to give them a better idea. I think our
guys did a pretty good job with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael thought of one exception, the approach some hitters took
against Pedro Martinez, the Boston pitcher, who was No. 1 in the
American League this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a lot of changeups to a couple of our hitters and it
seemed like they were never ready for them,'' Michael said. ``They
were looking for the fastball, but he threw so many changes. Any
time a pitcher is going to throw that many changes I think it's
kind of silly to look for that many fastballs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Martinez game was the only one the Yankees lost in this
postseason.

SMITH QUITS PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND MAY REJOIN GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eyeing a powerful committee chairmanship, New
Hampshire Senator Bob Smith abruptly abandoned his sputtering,
independent run for president Thursday and prepared to rejoin the
Republican Party just four months after bolting the GOP in a blaze
of acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's act of political gymnastics foreshadows a showdown
between two staunch conservatives over who will succeed the late
Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island as head of the Senate panel
responsible for the nation's environment: Smith, who would have
seniority if he had remained a Republican, or the committee's next
senior Republican, Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that also could influence the course of New Hampshire
politics, Smith was poised to lay claim to the chairmanship by
vaulting back to the Republican Party that he denounced in July as
a meaningless bastion of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith declined to formally announce his plans until
after Chafee's funeral Saturday, the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott, cast Smith's return to the GOP as a virtual certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is coming back to the party, I believe,'' said Lott, who
has met with Smith regularly in recent weeks in a prelude to
Smith's expected turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's return to the Republican camp was seen as his best
chance of reviving his damaged political standing in New Hampshire,
where his defection outraged many GOP activists. The move also
could short-circuit whatever plans either of the state's two
Republican House members _ US Representatives Charles F. Bass or
John E. Sununu _ might have to challenge Smith if he seeks
reelection in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference outside the Capitol, Smith said he was
shuttering his presidential campaign for lack of grass-roots and
financial support. His fund-raising had grown increasingly meager,
as polls showed scant interest in sending him to the White House.
``It wasn't meant to be,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith's rise to the environment panel's chairmanship is meant
to be, his colleagues said, he has no choice but to embrace the GOP
membership he so recently renounced. Senate Republicans elect the
committee chairmen, and several members said they would not vote
for Smith unless he reclaims his GOP seniority by returning to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe would rank second among committee Republicans if Smith
returned to the GOP fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite certain Senator Smith will not get it unless he
rejoins the Republican Party, commits to working with the party and
ceases his criticisms of the party,'' said Senator Susan M.
Collins, a Maine Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Smith's GOP seniority would all but guarantee his
chairmanship. But other senators said Inhofe is not expected to
shrink from the challenge, particulary amid lingering resentment
among some Republican members over Smith's defection.
</P>
<P>
   In leaving the GOP, Smith called the Republican platform ``a
fraud.'' Speaking on the Senate floor, he said, ``Maybe it's a
party in the sense of wearing hats and blowing whistles, but it's
not a party that means anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who needs every Republican he can get to control the GOP's
Senate majority after the 2000 elections, said he welcomes Smith's
expected return from the independent ranks. But he alluded to the
lingering disdain for Smith's parting comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows we were not pleased with that,'' Lott said, ``and he
has already indicated he understood.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he stood by his criticism, Smith said, ``Yes,'' though
he suggested his remarks had been misunderstood or misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   With some foes preparing to protray him as a blatant opportunist
for switching allegiances so soon after Chafee's death, Smith said
he has spent weeks privately discussing his return to the GOP with
party leaders in Washington and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception that it might be something else is just wrong
and unfortunate,'' Smith said. ``We had a death here, and that kind
of got in the middle, but we had been talking'' about his return to
the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Smith's surge toward the committee chairmanship sent
a chill through the ranks of environmental advocates. Smith, who
consistently opposes the advocates' agenda, received a 13-percent
score in the most recent tally by the League of Conservation
Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry &UR;  &LR; of Massachusetts, a senior Democrat on
the environment committee, struck a diplomatic tone, hailing Chafee
for working ``with Democrats to prevent dozens of pieces of
devastating environmental legislation from becoming law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Smith is inheriting John Chafee's chairmanship,'' Kerry
said. ``I hope he will be motivated by Chafee's environmental
stewardship as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Cook, president of the Washington-based Environmental
Working Group, said he and his colleagues were ``extremely
nervous'' about the prospect of Smith or Inhofe succeeding Chafee
on the panel. Inhofe's most recent score from the League of
Conservation Voters was zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about the bottom of the barrel and the metal
band that runs around the bottom of the barrel,'' Cook said of
Smith's and Inhofe's environmental records. ``If either of these
gentlemen had been in charge of this committee in recent history,
we would have dramatically different environmental laws, and they
would be bad.''

IN ANOTHER SPORT IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, A SIMILAR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their 25th World Series championship puts the Yankees well ahead
of all major league baseball teams and nearly all other franchises
in the professional sports leagues of North America. But the
Yankees lead one team by just a single title: the Montreal
Canadiens of the National Hockey League, who have won the Stanley
Cup 24 times. The Yankees passed the Canadiens on Wednesday night
when they beat the Atlanta Braves by 4-1 to take the 1999 baseball
championship in a four-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer total of championships, no other franchise in any city
or any sport is even close to the Yankees and Canadiens, who are
situated roughly 300 miles apart on different sides of an
international border. Even their team names evoke something
patriotic beyond their sports. In colonial times, yankee referred
to a native of New England; later, of course, it became slang for
American. The name Canadiens is derived from the French word for
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the teams of the national imagination,'' said Ken
Dryden, the Montreal goalie for six of those Stanley Cup
championships. Dryden, now the president of the Toronto Maple
Leafs, is an enthusiastic baseball fan.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other two major leagues, basketball and football, the
Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association have won 16
championships and the Green Bay Packers of the National Football
League have won 12.
</P>
<P>
   Dryden played in Montreal for Coach Scotty Bowman, who won five
championship rings with the Canadiens and three more with other
teams. Bowman's two most recent titles came with the Detroit Red
Wings, his current team, which will seek its third cup in four
seasons next spring. That feat would equal that of Yankee Manager
Joe Torre, who has three championships since 1996. Bowman knows
baseball and he knows Torre, too. They met in the 1960s in St.
Louis, when Bowman coached the Blues and Torre played for the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare what is common about dynastic teams in sports,
Bowman said: ``A lot of things are the same. Every season, they
seem to add players who help them get over the top. These teams
have role players who play big roles, and the stars come through.
The ownership in Montreal was real devoted and their focus was
always on winning, both the Bronfmans and the Molsons before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave you the feeling they would do everything they could
to win the cup. You feel that's what they want more than anything
else. If they don't get it, they aren't happy. I think George
Steinbrenner gives you the same feeling with the Yankees. It makes
it a real easier job for the coach or the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare the Yankees and the Canadiens, Bowman said:
``They both have pretty good histories. Both have had a few dry
spells, but a lot of hot spots, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Yankees, the Canadiens are not the team of the
current decade. They are more like the forgettable Yankees of the
late 1960s and early 1970s. In recent seasons, Montreal's fortunes
have grown as cold as its ice. The team's last championship was in
1993 and the previous one was in 1986. Their last consistent run of
success came when Bowman's teams won four consecutive cups from
1976 through 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Dryden, when asked to compare the current Yankees to the
Canadiens of the Bowman era, said he sees some similarities between
the management styles of Bowman and Torre. ``Scotty was important,
Scotty was central,'' Dryden said. ``But he never insisted on being
the main guy. Torre is that way, too. Torre demands with a more
friendly face than Scotty, but the demands are still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman grew up in Montreal as a fan of the minor league Royals,
a baseball farm club for the Brooklyn Dodgers. For Sunday
doubleheaders, he and his friends took one-hour bus rides from
their neighborhood to the ball park at Delormier Downs to see
Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe and the other boys of
summer as they worked toward the majors while baseball's racial
barrier was being broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-hundred, ninety-seven feet down the right-field line,''
Bowman recalled. ``Left field was 370. Kind of a funny park.
Robinson's team won the Little World Series in September. It was
just about snowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman saw his first major league baseball game in New York at
the Polo Grounds in 1951, a World Series game between the Yankees
and the Giants. He and a friend took a bus from Montreal, and they
bought their tickets on the sidewalk before two of the games. ``We
scrounged it, somehow,'' said Bowman, who was 18 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when he was already well established in
hockey as the general manager of the Buffalo Sabres, Bowman saw
Mickey Mantle while waiting to change planes at Chicago's O'Hare
airport. He got Mantle's autograph for his son, who was then in
Little League. Bowman said Mantle did not recognize him but was
gracious about signing. Mantle personalized the greeting by using
the boy's name. (It is Stanley, as in Stanley Cup.)
</P>
<P>
   Comparing dynasties in different sports is inexact and tricky.
The Canadiens' first cup was won in 1916, before the formation of
the modern NHL. By then, the major leagues of baseball had been
playing a formal World Series for more than a decade. The
Canadiens' second cup came in 1924, when teams from outside the NHL
could still challenge for the trophy. Montreal's best continuous
streak came from 1956 through 1960, five consecutive championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have won 16 titles in a league that was the last to
form, in 1946. On a proportional basis, no team has dominated its
league more than Boston, which won 11 of 13 championships between
1957 and 1969, including eight in succession. The Canadiens' best
span was 16 championships in 27 years, from 1953 through 1979 _
exactly the same as the Yankees' best sequence of 16 championships
in 27 years, between 1936 and 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In the National Football League, the compilation of titles is
muddled because the Super Bowl has been played only since 1967, and
it was not considered the league championship until 1970. In those
first years, the Super Bowl was a special game between the
champions of the NFL and the American Football League. And although
the NFL was formed in 1920, no formal championship game was held
until 1933, when the Chicago Bears beat the Giants, 23-21. The
Packers finished first in three consecutive seasons, 1929 through
1931. They are the only team to win three consecutive titles, and
they did it again by winning championship games in 1965, 1966 and
1967.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern era, with drafting, free agency and expansion, it
will be more difficult for any franchise in any sport to build a
dynasty similar to the Yankees and the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Yankees and Canadiens, their greatest dynasties were
in dynastic times, when it was easier to have dynasties,'' Dryden
said. ``In some ways, the deck wasn't entirely stacked, but they
had more benefits. There were natural advantages. They basically
stemmed from the fact that there wasn't a draft. You could go out
and tie up players. That's what makes dynasties harder today to
create and sustain.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Dryden knew the Yankees and Canadiens had a similar
number of championships, he did not realize until Thursday that New
York had surpassed Montreal's total. When the bottom line _ 25 to
24 _ was mentioned to him, Dryden paused and sighed. ``Geez,
Murphy,'' he said, softly, the disappointment evident in his voice
over the line from Canada.

HOPES OF CLONING A MAMMOTH DIM AFTER FROZEN SPECIMENS ARE FOUND TO
BE DAMAGED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Germany, France)   By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hopes of cloning a frozen Siberian mammoth have been
dimmed by the finding that DNA retrieved from other mammoths
retains genetic information but is highly fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   Alex D. Greenwood, a molecular biologist at the American Museum
of Natural History, said on Wednesday that he had examined DNA from
the teeth of a mammoth found in the permafrost in Alaska, where it
died almost 14,000 years ago, and from the jaws and soft tissue of
mammoths found in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The animals have been frozen since their deaths and appear very
well preserved. ``I have samples of bone marrow that stink like
rotting meat,'' Greenwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their apparent freshness and promising odor, at the
genetic level the mammoths' remains were in rockier state. ``Even
though the samples are pristine, the DNA has suffered terribly over
time,'' Greenwood said. ``My studies show you can retrieve snippets
of DNA, but that's a long way from cloning an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of cloning a mammoth has come from Larry D. Agenbroad
of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. A geologist who has
long been interested in mammoths, Agenbroad was called in as a
consultant by Bernard Buigues, a French polar explorer who learned
of an intact mammoth, 11 feet tall, that was found in permafrost in
the Taimyr Peninsula of Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Agenbroad told The Associated Press earlier this month that
besides studying the animal's stomach contents, a primary task
would be to clone a mammoth by extracting DNA and letting it
develop in the egg of an Asian elephant, the mammoth's closest
living relative.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen mammoths are usually excavated from the ice with
hot-water jets that destroy both their soft tissues and the
surrounding materials, which may hold essential clues to the cause
of death and the environment at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taimyr mammoth was cut out of the ice intact, the first
mammoth to be retrieved in this way, Agenbroad said on Wednesday.
Last week it was airlifted to a military airstrip at Khatanga in
Siberia, where it is to be stored in an ice tunnel as soon as the
entrance to the tunnel can be enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   The specimen is a male mammoth, about 40 years old when it died.
Radiocarbon testing of its hair found that it died 20,380 years
ago, Agenbroad said. He has invited other scientists to conduct a
thorough examination of its tissues and did not seem particularly
discouraged by Greenwood's findings. Flesh or hair may yield better
quality DNA samples than a tooth, Agenbroad said, and in any case
``the cloning is an exciting possibility but it's not our main
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood said the Taimyr mammoth was ``a beautiful find, but in
terms of DNA my guess is that it will be like most other samples,''
meaning the DNA would be heavily degraded and fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   Even if intact DNA were available, he said, trying to clone it
in an Asian elephant, a species from which mammoths diverged some 5
million years ago, would be ``the equivalent of crossing a human
with a chimpanzee.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Agenbroad and Greenwood are interested in the many ice age
animals, and possibly even people, whose bodies lie preserved in
the permafrost of Siberia and Alaska. DNA would be of great help
for many kinds of biological study, particularly in determining an
animal's evolutionary history and the size of its population.
</P>
<P>
   Many early claims of recovering DNA from tissues millions of
years old, such as dinosaur bones or insects embedded in amber,
have proved impossible to repeat. Any DNA in such tests probably
came from modern contaminants, such as bacteria, or the scientists'
own fingerprints. The early cloud of disrepute that settled on the
field was somewhat dispelled after scientists learned the rigorous
experimental procedures necessary to avoid contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of ancient DNA as old as 30,000 years are now regarded
as plausible. In 1997 Dr. Svante Paabo, an authority on ancient DNA
at the University of Munich in Germany, isolated DNA from the
skeletal remains of a Neanderthal of the same age.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood, who trained in Paabo's laboratory, hopes that further
studies of mammoth DNA will allow him to reconstruct their
evolutionary history and perhaps the manner of their extinction.
The snippets that have been analyzed so far, which he and his
colleagues describe in the November issue of the journal Molecular
Biology and Evolution, suggest that mammoths are more closely
related to Asian elephants than to African elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier mammoth studies have focused on the DNA of the
mitochondria, components of the cell that provide its energy. As
each cell may have a thousand mitochondria, this kind of DNA is
much more plentiful and easier to retrieve from ancient samples
than is the DNA of the nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoths and elephants cannot be compared on the basis of their
mitochondrial DNA, which led Greenwood and his colleagues to
develop techniques for recovering the much rarer genes of the DNA
in the cell's nucleus. The nuclear DNA, they hope, will allow a
much broader range of genetic studies.

AMID THE CHEERS, QUESTIONS ABOUT 2000 BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees' championship celebrations have evolved
beyond the uncontrolled spraying of champagne. Sure, there was some
dousing done after they wiped out the Atlanta Braves in the World
Series, completing their sweep with a 4-1 victory in Game 4 at
Yankee Stadium on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens, having finally shed the tag of postseason
underachiever, was soaked, and Derek Jeter dumped some champagne
over the head of a giggling George Steinbrenner, the Yankees'
principal owner, who indicated that he would get even. But after
the immediate euphoria, many of the Yankees celebrated in their own
way _ Clemens retrieved two of his sons, David Cone posed for
pictures with New York's finest, Scott Brosius played with his
children as they ran around the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, whose father had died earlier in the day, spoke
with emotion about Charles O'Neill, his voice rising, sounding not
so much like an All-Star baseball player but like the youngest
child who already missed his father.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, had traded hugs with Brosius
and infielder Luis Sojo and his bench coach, Don Zimmer; it felt
like family, Brosius said afterward, and while this family had
reason to celebrate, there was a real sense in the Yankees'
clubhouse that this had been a very difficult year, personally and
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Torre was treated for prostate cancer in March. Outfielder
Darryl Strawberry had struggled in his recovery from colon cancer,
and a relapse in his drinking problem led to his subsequent arrest
for solicitation and drug possession. All year, too, the Yankees
had grown weary of the constant comparisons to the record-setting
1998 team: the players complained that it was the news media doing
this, but O'Neill, Cone and others acknowledged that the players
themselves had fallen into this trap, and that only increased the
tremendous pressure that sometimes wore on them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the 1999 Yankees can say that they had the
best record in the American League, that they blew through the
playoffs by winning 11 of 12 games and that they won their third
World Series in four years. ``It was absolutely sensational to be
able to accomplish what we accomplished this year,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said: ``This has to rank at the top. Three out of
four is pretty damn good. It's not like it used to be. You have
three layers of playoffs. The third layer of playoffs doesn't make
it twice as difficult _ it might be five times as difficult. There
are more chances for a team to become unfocused and slip up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees have remained focused, and there is no doubt
that during their victory parade Friday they will feel the first
bit of the pressure that will face them next season when somebody
yells or asks aloud: can they become the first team since the
Oakland Athletics of 1972-74 to win three consecutive titles?
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, figures the
planning for the 2000 season will begin ``just about the time the
parade ends,'' in discussions that will take place over the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' first decision of the off season will very likely
be whether to exercise a $6.5 million option on O'Neill, which must
be determined within the next six days. The Yankees are seeking
ways to restrain and reconfigure their payroll, to rearrange their
budget so they can pay their two best players, shortstop Derek
Jeter and the closer Mariano Rivera, both of whom are eligible for
arbitration after making $5 million and $4.25 million,
respectively, this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees might feel greedy and pursue a deal for another
outfielder, like Toronto's Shawn Green or Cleveland's Manny
Ramirez, both of whom will be eligible for free agency after the
2000 season. But in the short term, that route would be far more
expensive and complicated _ the Yankees would have to trade top
prospects and arrange a contract extension for the new player that
would cost them tens of millions of dollars _ than keeping O'Neill
for another year. O'Neill will be 37 next season, but this year he
hit a respectable .285 and drove in 110 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is under contract at $8.1 million for next year, but he
has the right to demand a trade within 15 days of the World Series.
Executives with other teams suspect that when Clemens was swapped
to the Yankees in February, Steinbrenner reached an understanding
on a contract extension with his agents _ the same sort of
arrangement made when the Yankees traded for Chuck Knoblauch before
the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens seemed evasive when asked about his future with the
Yankees in the clubhouse after the sweep, saying he hoped it would
work out so he could stay with the team. For the immediate future,
he has full control of the issue. If Clemens, having achieved the
goal of winning a championship, wanted to finish his career in his
home state, Texas, and live closer to his ailing mother, Bess
Clemens, then he could effectively force the Yankees to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Cone is eligible for free agency, after throwing well most of
the season, making the American League All-Star team and earning
$9.5 million this season, $8 million in base salary and $1.5
million from an incentive clause.
</P>
<P>
   Cone has not explicitly stated what he wants in his next
contract, but there is a very simple Yankees equation as they
consider their options. They have a five-man rotation and already
have six candidates for starting jobs under contract: Clemens, if
he chooses to stay; Orlando Hernandez, who made $1.85 million; Andy
Pettitte, who made $5.95 million and is eligible for arbitration;
Hideki Irabu, who made $2 million; Ramiro Mendoza, who is eligible
for arbitration, and Jeff Juden, who has agreed to a one-year,
$500,000 major league contract after spending almost the entire
season at Class AAA Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   If it is important to Steinbrenner and his executives to retain
Cone, then all parties involved will make it happen _ and if he
does come back, it will likely be because either Pettitte or
Clemens is traded. The big X factor in Cone's case, of course, is
how Steinbrenner will react if the Mets become seriously involved
in bidding for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees must decide whether to keep Pettitte for another
year or revisit trade talks with the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Joe Girardi is eligible for free agency, and while the
conventional wisdom is that Girardi will ultimately sign with the
Chicago Cubs, Steinbrenner could intercede again and find a way to
bring him back, at a salary greatly reduced from the $3.4 million
Girardi earned this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton, who played an important role as the left-handed
setup man out of the bullpen, may get bigger offers from other
teams and may not be back. The designated hitter Chili Davis will
not be back with the Yankees, and it seems unlikely that Jim
Leyritz will be retained. The Yankees might explore the possibility
of trading Brosius to rid themselves of his $5.25 million salary,
and they are expected to talk to the San Diego Padres about a
possible deal for pitcher Andy Ashby, especially if Clemens is
gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will be honored Friday for what they accomplished in
1999, but right away the executives who put this team together will
be thinking about next year.

HAUTE COSTUMES RIGHT FROM THE CLOSET 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BARBARA DE WITT 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The apples are bobbing, the brew is bubbling, and the bewitching
hour is almost here.
</P>
<P>
   You still don't have a Halloween costume?
</P>
<P>
   Quit whining about how dumb costume parties are. And don't
complain that all the good costumes were already sold when you got
to the store.
</P>
<P>
   Just scare up something out of your closet and have a happy
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right there between your new work suits and old sweaters
is a haute Halloween ensemble just waiting to party. And we don't
mean a sheet with holes for your eyes and nose. Besides, with all
the designer sheets these days, it's hard to find a ghostly white
one without lace trim.
</P>
<P>
   Think you can't pull it off in time? Take a gander at some
costume ideas that Daily News staffers came up with:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mummy: Wrap yourself with old white rags, strips of sheets or
a white tablecloth, and accent with gauze. Get a bit muddy and walk
with a limp, dragging one arm.
</P>
<P>
   _ Traffic signal: Wear a black top and pants and pin, sew or
tape a circle of red, yellow and green fabric on your chest. Felt
is best, but even colored paper will work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gypsy: Start with a long, full skirt. Add scarves, big
earrings, stacks of bracelets, an anklet, and rings on each finger.
If your hair isn't long and wavy, wrap a scarf around it and tie in
the back with the ends hanging down your back.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cowboy: Jeans, a plaid shirt, cowboy boots and hat are the key
ingredients. No plaid shirt? Try a white T-shirt and a denim
jacket, accented with a bandanna scarf tied around your neck or a
bolo tie left over from the '80s. Also check your accessories
drawer for a western-themed belt to complete the ensemble. That
beaded souvenir belt from Colorado will do.
</P>
<P>
   _ Movie star: Get yourself glammed up with a slinky gown and a
fur or feather boa to drag behind you. Add dark glasses and strike
a pose.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fashion maven: Go as a New York fashion plate in all black (or
navy) with a gold chain belt from the '80s, and three watches on
one wrist (for L.A., New York and Paris). Big black-and-gold
glasses are a nice touch, especially if they have a designer label.
Carry a fashion mag under your arm or sticking out of a black tote
bag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Farmer: Overalls, hiking boots and a colorful hanky sticking
out of your back pocket.
</P>
<P>
   _ Columbo: Rumple your hair, chew on a cigar butt, and wear a
tan trench coat that you've rolled up and stepped on before
wearing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mickey Mouse: Start with a black turtleneck and black tights.
Add red shorts and suspenders, if you've got them. Then paint your
nose black and add your mouse ears from Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fat cat: Wear a man's white dress shirt, with pillow
underneath, stuffed into pants. Then pin a pair of black leggings
on the back as a tail. Paint whiskers on face with black eyeliner,
stick a cigar in your pocket or mouth, and stuff fake (or real)
dollars in between the buttons on your shirt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grapes: If you're like a lot of families, you've got a stash
of balloons. Hopefully you've got a bunch of purple, red or green
balloons that can be blown up and taped on a black body suit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Freudian slip: Wear a black slip with the words ID, EGO, SUPER
EGO spelled out in silver glitter. Sheer black stockings, sexy
sandals and a boa complete the look.
</P>
<P>
   _ Miss Scarlet: Wear last year's Chinese print sheath, flutter a
fan, and go as the mysterious Miss Scarlet who is a suspect in the
who-dunnit game of Clue. Or, if you're a ``Gone With the Wind''
fan, dress up as Scarlett O'Hara in a white dress with an emerald
green ribbon around the waist, pinch your cheeks, and talk with a
southern drawl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Magnum, P.I.: Got a Hawaiian shirt and a pair of khaki shorts?
Go as that hunky fashion-impaired private eye played by Tom Selleck
back in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monk: If you have a brown or black hooded robe, wrap it up and
bow your head. Wear brown sandals, and you're ready.
</P>
<P>
   _ Art museum: Hang two prints of famous paintings around your
neck _ one on the front and one on the back _ and put on a little
cap with a sign pointing the way to the restrooms, the gift shop
and the cafe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beatnik: Ah, the '50s coffeehouse scene. Wear black leggings
or stretch pants and a black turtleneck sweater. Add dark glasses,
a beret and bongos.
</P>
<P>
   _ Artist: Wear a man's dress shirt with the tails out, a beret
and a mustache drawn with an eye liner pencil. Add a palette (made
out of cardboard, aluminum foil and marking pens) and paint brush
to hold.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gold medalist: Wear a matching sweats outfit with foil medals
dangling from ribbons around your neck. Carry a small American flag
and bouquet of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   _ '50s gal: Wear a poodle skirt if you have one, or roll up your
jeans to the knees. Wear bobby socks and oxfords, or white anklets
and black flats. Top with a man's white dress shirt worn untucked,
and bring a pen for guests to write their name and slogans like
``Daddy-O'' on your shirt. Put your hair in a pony tail, wear red
lipstick, and chew bubble gum.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tofu: Get a box large enough to wear, cut out head and arm
holes, wrap it in white paper, and go to the party as tofu.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cloudy day: Wear a light blue sweat shirt and sweat pants with
cotton balls glued on it. And carry a squirt gun. When asked what
you are, say, ``I'm partly cloudy with a chance of showers.'' Then
start squirting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hippie: Anything from the '60s and early '70s (or now), that
includes patched jeans, ponchos, Apache-style headbands over hair
combed with a center part. Add strands of beads, and lots of rings,
then draw a peace sign on your cheek. Go barefoot or wear any
rugged, earthy sandals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wood nymph: Remember ``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' and slip
into an earthy or metallic-colored slip dress (think ethereal) with
flowers in your hair and lots of body glitter. Go barefoot or wear
sandals, and carry a branch you snipped off a tree or bush for a
woodsy prop.
</P>
<P>
   _ Geek: Wear khaki pants with a white dress shirt. Put a bunch
of mechanical pencils and a slide rule in your shirt pocket. It
helps if the pants are cuffed ultra-short, above the ankles. Add
glasses and slick your hair down with a side part. A hard briefcase
('70s-style), and any items (compass, flashlight, screwdriver)
dangling from belt or belt loops are a plus.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mafia man: Wear a dark suit with black shirt and tie and black
shoes with those little tassels (very Italian). Add dark glasses
and slick your hair back with gel. &UR;  &QL;

REGIONAL IS HEADED FOR A SOFT LANDING, ECONOMISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight boisterous years of economic expansion that has brought
prosperity even to remote corners of northern New England now
appears headed for a soft landing. But the question remains when.
</P>
<P>
   Economists who are members of the New England Economic Project
on Thursday hedged their forecasts of a downturn, saying the
surprising strength of the current expansion has caused them to be
wrong in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major question for the Maine economy is when the slowdown
will come,'' said Charles Colgan, a University of Southern Maine
professor who took part in a project meeting in Needham.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by the success of financial companies such as MBNA Corp.,
Maine is experiencing stronger job growth this year than in 1998,
so strong, Colgan said, that a logging company has been unable to
fill positions in rural northern Aroostook County, where such a
problem is rarely seen.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Delay, economist for the Public Service Co. of New
Hampshire, characterized his state's economy as ``one of the
strongest in the country,'' with about 10,000 jobs added this year
alone.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, the boom has reached into the usually depressed
corner known as the Northeast Kingdom, and economic growth
statewide is more than 1.5 percent. ``It's tough to complain,''
said Jeffrey Carr of Economic and Policy Resources Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But the best may be over, the economists said. Job growth across
New England this year is expected to be 1.6 percent, down from 2.3
percent last year. Job creation next year is expected to slow to
less than 1 percent. Their projections for Massachusetts were
similar.
</P>
<P>
   As employers have made clear for several years, the downside of
the expansion is that much of New England is experiencing a labor
shortage that is driving up wages in the Massachusetts high-tech
sector.
</P>
<P>
   The economists said this labor shortfall is spreading to the
other states. Wages in New England rose more than 6 percent in the
first quarter, compared to the same period last year, while
national wages went up 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the economists said they are beginning to see
signs of a slowdown caused by increases in interest rates by the
Federal Reserve and the labor shortage. Consumer confidence has
also dropped this year in New England, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no recession in sight, they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Fed will be successful in engineering a soft
landing,'' said Alan Clayton-Matthews, a professor of political
economy at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But they warned that if the stock market should crash and
consumer demand plunge, the blow would be worst in Massachusetts,
which has become reliant on its booming financial industry and a
high-tech sector funded by initial public offerings and venture
capital.

NO. 1 PRIORITY   FOR SEMINOLES: CLEAN UP BAD ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, we've had enough. In case you missed it, the latest news out
of Florida State is that Tay Cody, a junior cornerback, was
arrested Tuesday and charged with possession of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Bowden immediately suspended Cody for Saturday's
game against Virginia _ at least. ``I'm suspending him for the next
game and maybe more, until the facts are in,'' said Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we think Bowden is one of the class acts in college
football, one of the classiest in all of athletics. He wants to do
the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to win national championships. Nothing wrong with
that.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of the recent arrests of Peter Warrick, Laveranues
Coles, and now Cody, and an assortment of other crimes and
misdemeanors dating back to the FootLocker case a few years ago,
the ``facts,'' as Bowden calls them, seem pretty compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Something is wrong at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska had the same problem in the later days of Tom Osborne,
and because Osborne wasn't touchy-feely with the media, he was
hammered for running a program that coddled athletes who were not
exactly candidates for Citizen of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   But because Bowden will bring you into his office, sit you down,
and look you in the eye and tell you he treats his players like his
own children, he has been treated in a kinder, gentler fashion.
</P>
<P>
   However, it looks more and more like the problem at Florida
State is not so much with the athletes as with the people who are
recruiting them.
</P>
<P>
   Few programs have been better over the past decade than FSU. The
Seminoles have not finished lower than No. 5 in the national
rankings since George Bush was elected president. And there's
nothing to suggest they will finish any worse anytime before the
next presidential election, when the next generation of George Bush
could very well be vying for the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we recognize that each case is different and that some
people might have agendas that involve targeting members of the No.
1 team in college football.
</P>
<P>
   We also realize that coaches cannot control their athletes 24
hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   But it's happening too much at Florida State. The question is,
why.
</P>
<P>
   Should the recruiters do background checks as well as checking
their stopwatches when scouting high school players?
</P>
<P>
   Should they make citizenship as much a priority as touchdowns?
</P>
<P>
   Bowden does not run an exceptionally tight ship in terms of
discipline. Florida State players and students are what they are,
for everyone to see. ``The one thing I do tell them is, don't do
anything to embarrass yourselves or the university,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, players have embarrassed both themselves
and the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it rains, it snows,'' said Bowden, his point taken
despite his confused cliche.
</P>
<P>
   But Bowden remains philosophical. ``It's life,'' he said, ``and
you've got to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He will do just that as he guides his team through the rest of
the season, perhaps winning his second national championship,
perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue here is not the present but the future. Bobby
Bowden has worked too hard for too long to see his reputation
become tarnished by the misdeeds of a few players whose sense of
right and wrong and judgment appear clouded.
</P>
<P>
   However, like other coaches, he has to be held accountable.
Bowden has been at FSU since 1976, and if you look at the sum of
those years, there have been more than a handful _ more than
several handfuls _ of off-the-field incidents.
</P>
<P>
   This year's team is typical. Superbly talented, but lacking
discipline. It sometimes shows up in games in the form of penalties
and confusion, as was the case several times during last week's win
over Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   FSU is winning on talent and very little else, and the
responsibility for that falls on Bowden and his staff. You can win
while running a clean program. It takes a lot of work. In the case
of Florida State, it might take a change in recruiting philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bowden, at the end of his career as he approaches age
70, can do that is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rose-y for Cardinal
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is the front-runner to win the Pacific 10 title and
earn a berth in the Rose Bowl. Neither the Cardinal nor the Pac-10
as a whole has received much credit this season, which is being
viewed as a down year for the conference. Stanford's two losses
have come against Texas and San Jose State. When was the last time
a Pac-10 champion lost to San Jose State? It was 1971, when
Stanford lost to SJS, 13-12, but won the conference title and beat
Michigan in the Rose Bowl by the same score . . . The Southeastern
Conference is still the hottest league in the country in terms of
attendance, with stadiums being filled at an average of 97.6
percent of capacity. A year ago, SEC teams did even better, filling
99.9 percent of capacity . . . Nebraska coach Frank Solich has
backed off his criticism of officials following last week's loss to
Texas. Solich used the words ``ridiculous'' and ``horrendous'' in
his postgame descriptions of some calls in the Huskers' first loss
of the season (and third straight to Texas). By Tuesday, he had
kicked back into neutral. ``I would rather not comment on the
officiating,'' he said. ``It appears I've done quite a bit in the
last two days.'' . . . Virginia Tech may not be No. 1 in either the
writers or coaches poll, but the Hokies rank No. 1 in scoring
offense and No. 1 in scoring defense as they prepare for Saturday's
game at Pittsburgh . . . A Florida win over Georgia Saturday would
be the Gators' 100th of the decade (99-19-1). Among major college
programs, only Alabama, Brigham Young, Florida State, Nebraska, and
Oklahoma have won 100 games during a decade in the 20th century . .
. While Boston College's 31-28 loss to Miami last Saturday was
devastating for the Eagles, it should also be taken in this
context: If before the game someone had said that with three
minutes left the score would be 28-28, even the most casual BC fan
would have accepted it in a heartbeat. The fact that it was 28-0
until there were two minutes left in the third quarter shows you
how good Miami is when it wants to play. BC should have won the
game, without question. But if there is a positive, it is that the
Eagles know they can play at a high level. It is coach Tom
O'Brien's task to get them to do that long enough to win another
game or two . . . The Bowl Championship Series rankings, which have
Florida State and Penn State at 1-2, won't change significantly if
both teams win the rest of their games, which is bad news for
Virginia Tech, hurt by having a lesser schedule than either the
Seminoles or Nittany Lions. Tech is upgrading its schedule for
future years. Another twist is that Tennessee still can get to the
BCS championship game, the Sugar Bowl, even while not qualifying
for the SEC title game. Unless Florida loses to Georgia on Saturday
or loses another SEC game, the Gators (who beat Tennessee in
September) will be the SEC East champion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Velez, a medical riddle who inexplicably
scratched himself to the point of self-mutilation and who was the
center of one of the most ambitious attempts to attain an
independent life for a profoundly disabled individual, died on
Wednesday at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 25 and lived in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was infections of the blood and spine, his
parents said.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons no one understood, Velez felt as if a million bugs
crawled over him. To quiet his torment, he scratched himself so
tenaciously that he ripped open his skin, even though he fell
within the range of what is considered average intelligence and was
aware of the damage he was inflicting. Since the age of 7, he was
marooned in institutions, including a place that gave him electric
shocks as part of its behavioral therapy.
</P>
<P>
   As he grew older, he desperately longed for a commonplace life
like everyone else. As he once put it, ``I want to have my own
place where I can put posters on the wall and I can turn my music
up as loud as I want and I can have friends over.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a small Manhattan social service agency, Job Path,
began a tortuous effort to answer his wishes and thereby to test
the possibilities for the most shunned of the developmentally
disabled. In November 1996, the agency moved him into his own
apartment in Queens. The effort to gain his release and his first
year of independent living were chronicled in a series of articles
published in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Velez was a diminutive man, alternately sardonic and endearing,
heavily scarred from his assaults. He was born in Brooklyn in 1974.
His parents, Daisy and Julio Velez, found themselves depleted in
their struggle to care for him. He had a high tolerance for pain
and would break his bones and tear off his fingernails as well as
scratch himself. Exhausted as much as they were heartbroken, his
parents reluctantly put their son in an institution, always hopeful
that one day he would get out.
</P>
<P>
   Once he did, after 15 years of exclusion, Velez experienced
sharp mood swings, but he made pronounced progress. The first year
in his Queens apartment, he got a part-time job at a video store
and took driving lessons. He gained enough control of his impulse
to scratch that he went to movies and stores unaccompanied by any
of the aides assigned to him.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, however, a leg infection brought on by his
scratching sent him to the hospital and nearly killed him. But he
made a remarkable recovery and returned to his independent life.
</P>
<P>
   The infection persisted. It invaded his bones and spine. When he
was hospitalized in February, his legs became paralyzed. At the end
of July, in need of full-time nursing care, he moved into the
Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although Velez had periods when the bugs that he sensed
relented, his expanded life failed to halt his attacks on himself.
But the setbacks never crushed his spirit. Until about two months
ago, he frequently ate out and attended movies and parties. ``The
happiest thing is to have a place that's mine,'' he said earlier
this year. ``My room, my stuff, my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his parents and his younger sister, Lydia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though James' health did not ultimately improve, he had the
life he wanted,'' said Fredda Rosen, the executive director of Job
Path. ``Things turned out not to be as simple as we first thought.
For the last few years, though, I think that James had the best
life that he could have. If that's what this experiment proves,
that's a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning about Velez's improved life, dozens of families
asked Job Path for a similar experience for thedisabled
children. The work with Velez has led the agency to shift its focus
to finding apartments for other severely developmentally disabled
people living in institutions or with aging parents. It intends to
move three more people into their own places before the end of this
year. Within three years, it hopes to support as many as 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``James paved the way,'' Ms. Rosen said. ``What he did will
change other people's lives.''

PEACEKEEPERS CANNOT EXPLAIN FAILURE TO PROTECT SERB CONVOY

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Officials of NATO and the United Nations
struggled Thursday to explain how they failed to protect a convoy
of Serbian civilians from a sudden and ferocious Albanian attack on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo and
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which organized the
convoy, expressed relief that no one had been killed and said the
incident was under investigation to prevent a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 Serbian civilians, who were leaving Kosovo in a
long convoy of cars and buses, were nearly killed by a mob of
Albanians in the city of Pec after being separated from the convoy
and straying into the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   When they came under attack, the Serbs abandoned their cars and
ran for cover to a police station housing Italian peacekeepers.
Some 18 of the Serbs were treated for cuts and bruises. Several
were badly beaten. There were no injuries among peacekeepers or
U.N. personnel, who have been working to maintain order for four
months.
</P>
<P>
   All the victims of the attack were later evacuated in NATO
armored personnel carriers and driven to the border with the
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro. They left behind the burnt-out
shells of their cars, smoldering on the streets of Pec.
</P>
<P>
   The violence cast an unwelcome spotlight on lure of
peacekeepers and the United Nations to protect the Serbian minority
in Kosovo. The incident gave the Yugoslav authorities in Belgrade
another chance to criticize the international community's
performance in the territory, just as peacekeepers had been trying
to claim some success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will investigate the incident itself more closely,'' said
Maj. Ole Irgens, the peacekeepers' chief spokesman. ``Was anyone
responsible for this attack on the convoy, and what happened when
the convoy split?'' he said. Dutch and German troops were
accompanying the convoy, and 14 Dutch soldiers were with the Serbs
when they were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The incident will also cause the refugee commissioner's office
and the U.N. administration to rethink some of their policies. The
refugee office has helped some 500 Serbs to leave the province over
recent months, stressing that they are mostly elderly, sick and
isolated, and could not survive the winter in Kosovo. About 2,300
Serbs remain in an enclave in the town of Orahovac.
</P>
<P>
   The attack will probably encourage more to flee. In the meantime
the small successes the United Nations has claimed, for instance
the buses now running between Kosovo communities, were halted after
the attack. The buses, in which Albanians and Serbs have ridden
together, will resume their routes on Sunday, said Peter Kessler,
the spokesman for the refugee office.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's convoy consisted of about 155 people, mostly Serbian
families, traveling in four buses and 21 cars from Orahovac to
Montenegro, and accompanied by NATO armored vehicles and other
cars. A similar convoy had made the same journey some weeks before
without incident.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, a Serbian car broke down on the road near Pec
in western Kosovo, and the last third of the convoy stopped. When
they continued on their way, the lead car took a wrong turn and led
the remaining 14 cars into the center of Pec.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the peacekeepers acknowledged that the leaders
of the convoy should have spotted the breakdown and waited for the
stragglers. And when they moved off again on their own, he said, an
official vehicle should have been leading them. For the moment
those lapses remain unexplained, but the official said they were
being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts the angry reaction of the crowd was spontaneous,
and the violence flared extraordinarily quickly. ``It came as a
total surprise; it could not have been planned,'' Irgens said.
</P>
<P>
   As Kessler explained it: ``A Serb driver took a wrong turn, got
nervous and did not know what to do. It was an accident.'' He
described the anger of the Albanian crowd, which grew to over
1,000, as the shock of suddenly finding dozens of Serbs sitting in
cars in their midst. ``It was a spontaneous demonstration of people
suddenly made angry when they are hit in the face with these
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was indicative of the ethnic tensions that everybody is
facing. There are explosive situations all across the province.''
He compared the feelings of revenge in Kosovo to those of people in
postwar Holland and Belgium, where feelings against collaborators
led to many killings. ``The Balkans are not the only place were
primitive feelings of revenge and anger run high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians who quickly gathered around the stranded convoy
were apparently under the impression that the Serbs were being
brought back to Kosovo to resettle, Kessler said, citing a witness.
That issue is delicate in Kosovo, particularly in Pec, where many
homes were destroyed by Serbian forces during the war and where
shelter for Albanian families remains an acute problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that it was only when a former commander of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, now a member of the civilian Kosovo Protection
Corps, spoke to the crowd and promised to see that the Serbs left
the province, that the crowd dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian officials said the Serbs should not have blundered into
the center of the traffic-choked market town. Ramadan Avdiu,
secretary-general of the Albanian-run provisional government in
Kosovo, said the attack repaid the Serbs for the suffering caused
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albanians are revolted after all the massacres, rapes and
expulsions,'' he said, ``and they answered when provoked.''

KOSOVO COMPARISON BELIES RUSSIAN TACTICS IN CHECHNYA

   HAWK MOUNTAIN, Russia _ Russians keep comparing their military's
offensive in Chechnya to NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia _
but Kosovo was never like this.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Kortunov's unit nearly stumbled into an ambush when
they happened upon two Chechen tanks half-hidden in trenches on
this high ridge overlooking the Chechnya's capital, Grozny. Under
fire, the men called in jets and choppers and mortar from Russian
positions further down the ridge.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of the battle, Kortunov stuck a grenade inside one
of the trenches and earned himself a medal for valor. The Chechens
retreated and the firefight ended. Kortunov's unit emerged, their
faces black with soot and grime. One Chechen lay dead; three of
Kortunov's comrades writhed in pain in the grass.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of close fighting that Kortunov's commander,
General Alexander Belousov, is trying to avoid. Russian commanders
say they studied NATO's campaign against Yugoslavia before sending
troops into Chechnya. Like the alliance, Russia's military would
like to rely on airpower and missiles to limit its own losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We send work over enemy positions with aviation and artillery,
and if the enemy resists we work them over some more,'' Belousov
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kosovo comparison is a stretch. Even with such
precautions, in a month since ground troops entered Chechnya, the
Russians admit to losing nearly 200 men; hundreds more have been
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The battle gave the Russians control of Hawk Mountain, a
1,500-foot high hill 10 miles north of Grozny that provides a
spectacular view of Chechnya's capital. Down there Thursday,
Russian warplanes and artillery pounded Grozny hard for a second
straight day, flying 100 sorties in the heaviest bombardment since
federal troops entered Chechnya to crush the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of heavy civilian casualties, including an Oct. 21
rocket attack in a crowded Grozny market that killed as many as 300
people, have brought increasing concern from the US and its
European allies.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow has dismissed the criticism and pushed ahead with its
offensive. After all, Moscow says, NATO largely ignored its pleas
for restraint in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the lower house of parliament,
summed up Moscow's mood by saying NATO countries did not have ``the
moral right to tell Russians how to settle'' the conflict after
they bombed Yugoslavia during the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, thousands of Grozny residents fled the city for
rebel-occupied territory, but nowhere looked safe. West of Grozny,
Russian forces were shelling the highway heading out of the region
after blocking off the road, which 190,000 refugees had used to
flee since fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military said 250 militants were killed in
Thursday's raids, ``pin-point strikes'' against rebel units;
Chechen reports indicated heavy civilian casualties and
indiscriminate bombing of residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   Planes bombed the villages of Samashki and Shaami-Yurt along the
highway, and artillery hit the ruins of the city of Sernovodsk,
destroyed during Russia's last war in Chechnya. The Russians say no
one but rebels are left in these villages.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency reported bombs exploded near a cemetery
in Stariye Atagi, south of Grozny, and killed several people in a
funeral cortege. It quoted a spokesman for Chechen leader Aslan
Maskhadov as saying the mourners were burying those killed in
earlier bomb attacks on the Chechen capital. A Reuters reporter
quoted a woman from Samashki as saying her small children were
trapped in the village.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians say they are targeting Islamic militants whom they
blame for two raids on a neighboring Russian region last summer and
a wave of deadly bomb attacks in September. The rebels deny
involvement in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   What started for the Russians as an ``anti-terrorist campaign''
has begun to look like total war. Russian generals say their troops
will soon surround Grozny, allowing them to launch raids on
guerillas in the city and in the south.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens by all accounts have been unable or unwilling to
try to halt the Russian offensive. Rebel leaders say they are
preparing to defend Grozny; The Russians, predicting an easy
victory, say the separatists are divided and weak. But the Russians
said all that the last time they fought in Chechnya, up until the
day in 1996 their beaten troops were forced to withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a repeat of the 1994-96 Chechnya war that cost tens of
thousands of civilian lives, Western leaders have urged a halt in
the fighting and immediate negotiations. Some Russian commentators
find that ironic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no need to justify ourselves before the West,'' wrote
journalist Maxim Yusin in the usually liberal Izvestia newspaper.
``Russia is not doing anything today in Chechnya which the
Americans, British and French did not do in the recent past in Iraq
or in the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   When NATO planes mistakenly bombed civilians during the Kosovo
campaign, officials subsequently admitted errors. The Russians
insist they attack only military targets and dismiss claims of
civilian casualties, and Russian officials have made no statements
of remorse for civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO errors in Kosovo roused strong Western public
concern, there has been little negative public reaction in Russia
to federal troops' mistakes in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians blame Chechens for a rise in violent crime in
Moscow and the Caucasus, and the war has strong popular support.
And with December parliamentary elections approaching, few
politicians dare buck the popular wave of support for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do also use the Kosovo parallel, but in a different
way. Federal lawmaker and human rights activist Sergei Kovalyev
recently reflected on what he saw as similarities between Kosovo
and Chechnya: A brutal crackdown on a breakaway Muslim region,
indiscriminate violence and tens of thousands of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chechnya,'' Kovalyov concluded, ``Russia is using NATO's
methods to achieve Milosevic's ends.''
</P>
<P>
   (ov reported from Chechnya, Filipov reported from
Moscow.)

ABRAHAM POLONSKY, DIRECTOR DAMAGED BY BLACKLIST, DIES AT 88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif.)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abraham Polonsky, a director and screenwriter who was an early
Hollywood master of film noir and who worked under many disguises
after being blacklisted in the McCarthy era, died on Tuesday at his
home in Beverly Hills. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   His movies included ``Force of Evil,'' a 1948 film about
racketeering in which he directed the actor John Garfield. In 1996
Stephen Holden, the New York Times film critic, describing that
performance and others, wrote that ``you can still feel the
dangerous urban-realist kick'' although the work came from ``a time
when Hollywood films still aspired to a genteel, upper-middle-class
sense of values.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous year, Polonsky had won an Oscar nomination for
writing the screenplay for ``Body and Soul,'' in which Garfield
played a money-mad boxer.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, Polonsky refused to testify about his
Communist Party affiliations or name party members. His refusal
prompted 20th Century Fox to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   He was then unable to find work under his own name for nearly
two decades; he had only nine films to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you said you were sorry you were a radical and had seen the
errors of your ways, you were let off,'' Polonsky said in an
interview in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like saying you have no right to make political
experiments in your mind,'' he continued. ``That's the kind of
thing they do in communist countries, but we're supposed to be a
free country. We need to be a genuinely free country and not merely
pretend to be one.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was blacklisted, Polonsky never completely abandoned
Hollywood. His best known work as an outcast scribe was the 1959
crime thriller ``Odds Against Tomorrow,'' which he co-wrote under
the name John O. Killens. In 1996, the Writers Guild of America
restored his real name to the credits.
</P>
<P>
   Polonsky also used other writers' names as disguises to write
for television shows like ``You Are There,'' a history series. With
such jobs, he reported, his income while he was on the blacklist

   It was not until 1969 that he would direct his second film,
``Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here,'' a film about a murder and a

   Earlier this year, Polonsky became a leader of the protest
against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences when it
announced that it would present an honorary Oscar to the director
Elia Kazan. In 1952, testifying before the House Un-American
Activities Committee, Kazan had named eight old friends, along with
himself, as having once belonged to the Communist Party.

   For a while, he taught English at City College, but he once told
a longtime friend, Mike Kaplan, that he was lured into the
entertainment business by the actress Gertrude Berg, who needed a

<P>
   In World War II, Polonsky was assigned to the Office of

 &HT;    Braves will be remembered for their resilience
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that the 1999 season is over, it's still hard to
figure how the Atlanta Braves surprised us more _ by winning 110
games without Andres Galarraga, Javy Lopez, Kerry Ligtenberg and
Odalis Perez, or losing four World Series games in a row to the
Yankees without much of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they got back to their clubhouse at Turner Field
late Thursday afternoon to clean out their lockers and say a few
goodbyes before heading off in 25 different directions, the Braves
didn't have a lot of answers. And maybe they didn't need them.
</P>
<P>
   For all the disappointment they felt after losing the fourth of
five World Series this decade and their claim on the ``Team of the
'90s'' label, the Braves felt few regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of pride in going 0-4, getting your butt
kicked,'' said John Smoltz, whose career postseason record fell to
12-4 in Wednesday night's 4-1 loss. ``But we played with every
ounce of energy we could, physically and mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz was the prime example. Faced with the unenviable task of
throwing himself in front of Roger Clemens and the Yankees after
they had gone up 3-0 in the series, Smoltz went back to pitching
from over the top, something he hadn't done since July when a
troublesome elbow nearly cost him his season.
</P>
<P>
   Bailing on the three-quarters delivery he had employed since
August, Smoltz was willing to take whatever pain the old mechanics
might have caused him. His fastball was back up around 95 mph and
his slider returned to its usual nastiness. He dominated Yankees
hitters like the usual October Smoltz, but lost on a three-run
lapse in the third inning when the Yankees took advantage of a
couple defensive misplays on the Braves infield.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Braves have long since learned out of necessity and
perfected to an art, Smoltz was looking ahead not even 24 hours
after the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I'll take into the offseason is I'm going to do
whatever I can to get back to that level,'' Smoltz said. ``I had
absolutely nothing to lose. I was going to give it everything I
had...(The arm) was great during the whole game. It was fun to do
that again. The outcome wasn't as fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves felt like the series played out much closer than it
seemed and have proof in leads heading into the eighth innings of
Games 1 and 3. But the Game 3 loss just proved too devastating,
after a 5-1 Braves advantage eroded on four Yankee home runs, the
two-run game-timing shot by Chuck Knoblauch and the game-winner in
the 10th inning by Chad Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loss is a loss,'' Greg Maddux said. ``I know during the
season it's easier to lose 10-0 than 2-1 because you know you're
going to lose. We didn't know we were losing (the series), right
until the end of last night. That doesn't make it any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that's happened to the Braves in the last nine months -
from learning of Galarraga's cancer the first day of spring
training to watching another World Series celebration from their
dugout on Wednesday night, the 1999 version of the Atlanta Braves
will be remembered for their resilience. But then again, maybe
that's what makes them like the rest of the Braves teams of this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood of this team doesn't change a whole lot,'' Walt Weiss
said. ``Pretty stable, pretty resilient. My attitude is you take
your best shot and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Smoltz: ``We're all a little hurt with the fact that we
haven't won more than one World Series championship, but all in
all, when you think about it, it's been an awesome run, one we're
not ready to end.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Armenian prosecutors brought terrorism charges Thursday
against three of five gunmen who seized the Parliament on
Wednesday, killing eight people, most of them government officials,
and holding 40 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen gave up the last of their hostages and turned in
their Kalashnikov rifles at about 10 a.m. Thursday after nightlong
negotiations that included a meeting with Armenia's president,
Robert Kocharian.
</P>
<P>
   All five were under criminal investigation, and the three
charged so far could receive the death penalty. Among the officials
killed in the attack were Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian and the
Parliament's speaker, Karen Demirchian.
</P>
<P>
   The government has declared Friday a day of mourning. A Russian
antiterrorist squad that had secretly flown overnight to the
capital, Yerevan, in preparation for an assault on the building,
will remain for the time being, Russian officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charged three men with terrorism aimed at
undermining authority: the man identified as the leader of the
assault, Nairi Unanian; his brother Karen, and their uncle, Vram
Galstian. Nairi Unanian was variously identified earlier as a
journalist, a recent resident of the Crimean region of Ukraine and
a member some years ago of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, a
radical nationalist party.
</P>
<P>
   The party has denied any connection with the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the two remaining gunmen were not immediately
known.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the attack, it still was not completely clear why
the men had chosen to assault the Parliament, which was conducting
a question-and-answer session with top members of Kocharian's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Kocharian bowed to the gunmen's demands Thursday and broadcast a
statement in which they demanded a guarantee of personal security
and a complete inquiry into the assault on Parliament. They also
demanded that officials who had ``plundered the nation'' be charged
and tried.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not explain the motive behind the attack, which
some have theorized was spurred by progress in negotiations to
settle a decade-old territorial dispute between Armenia and
Azerbaijan. Armenian nationalists are dead set against ceding any
of the territory at issue, which is a section of Azerbaijan called
Nagorno-Karabakh, now controlled mainly by ethnic Armenians.
</P>
<P>
   In their broadcast statement, the gunmen said they had entered
the Parliament, their weapons concealed under trench coats, with
the aim of killing the prime minister and no one else. Their plan,
according to the statement, was to frighten members of Parliament
by firing their weapons into the air.
</P>
<P>
   By their account, the attack widened after government guards
opened fire and forced them to fire back. ``All other casualties,''
the statement read, ``were accidental.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how well that explanation accorded with
videotape of the incident, which showed gunmen racing into the
Parliament, emptying a magazine of bullets into the prime
minister's body and then turning their weapons on senior officials
in the front row of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   It was equally unclear how the attackers got into the building
in the first place. By one account, the organizer, Unanian, carried
press credentials that granted him entry, but the account was not
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The attack appears to have divided Kocharian's government.
According to Russian television, the leadership of Armenia's
Defense Ministry demanded Thursday that the interior and security
ministers and the prosecutor general be fired, saying they had
failed to solve a single major crime in recent times.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement, however, they added that the military still
supported Kocharian and would uphold the constitution.

SENATORS , WHO OPPOSED NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY , NOW AIM AT
MONITORING SYSTEM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Ind., Neb., Ky., Okla, Ga., N.C., Japan, France, Germany,
Britain, India Pakistan, Argentina, Italy)   By WILLIAM J. BROAD   and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eager to insure that a treaty banning nuclear testing is never
revived, some of the accord's most ardent foes in the Senate are
discussing a plan to gut a $300 million global monitoring system
that is half built and seen as essential to making the pact work.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the Senate's rejection of the treaty two weeks
ago, a small but powerful band of senior aides to Republican
senators is pushing to kill the U.S. share of the costs for an
agency created to put the treaty into force and set up the
worldwide surveillance system. Without Washington's aid, experts
say, the monitoring network is likely to collapse.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of senior Republican senators are aware of the
strategy, which still needs final approval from such top lawmakers
as the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and Sen. Mitch
McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who oversees foreign aid bills.
Other Republicans, including Paul D. Coverdell of Georgia and James
M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, have expressed interest in the proposal,
aides said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take a look at that and see if there's a need
for that money,'' Lott said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a decision is likely soon, mainly because any effort to kill
the financing hinges on deleting it from a rewrite of the foreign
aid bill, which should be wrapped up in the next few days.
President Clinton vetoed the first version of the bill for reasons
unrelated to the monitoring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For their plan to succeed, the senior aides are hoping to push
it through as part of a session-ending budget deal between the
White House and the Republican-controlled Congress. They are also
counting on the monitoring aid's price tag _ $16 million this year
_ to get lost in the reshuffling of billion-dollar programs. The
aides are all specialists in national security affairs and were
deeply involved in the Senate's rejection of the treaty.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much support the fund-cutters have, and
whether they are likely to prevail. Republican arms control
advocates like Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Sen. Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska, oppose gutting the agency, the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty Organization, and its monitoring tasks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in fact, we want to continue to lead the nonproliferation
effort, we have to do all we can to assist it,'' Hagel said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States pays one-quarter of the monitoring system's
development costs, with most of the other money coming from Japan,
France, Germany and Britain. To date, experts say, more than half
of the system's overall estimated cost of roughly $300 million has
been spent.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, Congress has met all administration requests for
building the system, which is meant to consist of 321 stations in
90 countries. Right now, fewer than 100 are built and producing
data. Advocates say the fledgling network proved valuable in
monitoring Indian and Pakistani nuclear blasts last year, but
conservatives want it killed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This treaty has been soundly rejected,'' said an aide to a
senator who opposes the treaty, ``and that includes any form of
financial support.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Critics are also infuriated by Clinton's vow to abide by the
spirit of the rejected pact. ``I have no intention of doing
anything else than honoring the obligations of the treaty imposed
on the United States,'' Clinton said on Oct. 14, the day after the
treaty failed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's rejection makes it more likely that nations with
developing nuclear arsenals might not sign or ratify the treaty.
But it is also possible that treaty accord could survive without
U.S. participation. Or a new Congress and president might back the
accord or a renegotiated version of it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They recognize that the treaty is not dead and are looking for
ways to undermine the whole regime,'' Daryl G. Kimball, executive
director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, a Washington
group that strongly supports the treaty, said of the conservative
Republicans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Treaty opponents say the global surveillance system would be
useless for verifying treaty compliance and ideal for creating jobs
for third-world scientists and diplomats.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Senate rejection, Sen. Jesse Helms, the North
Carolina Republican who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, said
the system ``will provide zero benefit to our nuclear test
monitoring'' and would ``make life more difficult for the United
States.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Critics say they would redirect the funds into improving U.S.
surveillance of nuclear explosions, which is rooted in a variety of
intelligence tools that have been used for decades.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The program's defenders say the international monitoring system,
when finished and if buttressed by thousands of private sensors,
will detect all but the smallest blasts. Backers and opponents
disagree on whether small explosions are significant militarily. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ralph W. Alewine III, a top official in the Defense Department's
nuclear treaty program office, said American spending on the
international network was worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is very valuable,'' he said. ``We're buying into
a big system at 25 cents on the dollar, and this provides us data
we couldn't get otherwise.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $16 million proposed by the State Department,
the Pentagon pays for some international monitoring costs. Its aid
this year is $5 million.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary work began in late 1996 after the treaty was opened
for signature and has been accelerating ever since. Scheduled for
completion around 2002, the surveillance system is to have 170
stations that detect underground shock waves, 80 that sniff the air
for tell-tale radioactivity, 60 that listen for revealing sounds
and 11 that track undersea booms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 90 states meant to host monitoring stations include
Argentina, China, Djibouti, Fiji, Italy, Madagascar, Nepal, Papua
New Guinea, Russia, Samoa and Zimbabwe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal experts say 95 of the system's 321 planned stations are
complete and sending data to the Prototype International Data
Center, which is based in Arlington, Va., and supported by the
Defense Department. By the end of next year, the total number is to
rise to 164. In late 2001, the full complement of 321 stations is
to be up and running.

HOUSE PASSES GOP SPENDING BILL AMID CHARGES OF `CREATIVE
ACCOUNTING'

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Thursday narrowly passed the last
spending bill of the year, an $85 billion measure for labor, health
and education programs, along with a 0.97 percent across-the-board
cut in federal spending. The cut creates on paper a budget that
does not tap into Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the budget preserves Social Security
funds only as the result of ``smoke and mirrors'' _ creative
accounting by Republican lawmakers _ that have ``totally
bumfuzzled'' American voters.
</P>
<P>
   He was supported in that argument by the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office, which said Thursday that the
Republicans are actually $17 billion over their spending limits and
into Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will veto the spending cut, setting the
stage for the final act in this year's budget battle: negotiations
between the White House and Congress that will go into high gear
next week.
</P>
<P>
   He offered to compromise with the Republicans. ``I'm prepared to
work with them,'' he said during a news conference with Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo. ``I don't want a partisan fight on
this. This is crazy for us to be having a big partisan blowout''
over the Social Security issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans remain wary, having been bested by Clinton in budget
battles before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our numbers are not that far apart,'' said Rep. Bill Young,
R-Fla., the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. ``We
are far apart on the political rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This was a rare understatement on a day marked by furious
speeches and duels fought with numbers on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Halloween and the Democrats are up to their old tricks,''
said the Majority Whip Tom DeLay, who argued that the Republicans
had ``just won the first battle of this war'' with Clinton by
crafting a budget that ``protects every penny of the Social
Security surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   A jazz quartet played ``Pennies From Heaven'' as the Republicans
gathered on the Capitol's lawn to celebrate Thursday's 218-211
vote, in which four fiscally conservative Democrats voted for the
bill and the spending cut, providing the margin of victory. The
four were Reps. Frank Lucas of Kentucky, Pat Danner of Missouri,
Virgil Goode of Virginia and Adam Smith of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we've stopped the raid on Social
Security,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans contend that their across-the-board cut in all
13 spending bills, totaling about $5.7 billion, will create a
budget that will not tap surplus Social Security revenues to
operate government agencies _ which would be the first time that
has happened in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the CBO said in a new analysis Thursday that this was not
true.
</P>
<P>
   It said the Republican-written spending bills exceed lawmakers'
self-imposed spending limits by about $17 billion and will drain
that much money from surplus Social Security revenues. It cited
$17.7 billion in spending outlays that the Republican leadership
has instructed the CBO to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   This technique, called a scorekeeping adjustment, allows the
Republicans to argue that their across-the-board cut will result in
a small surplus in general government revenues and leave the Social
Security funds untouched.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' spending bills also include $18.6 billion in
outlays that the leadership has designated as unanticipated
``emergency spending,'' which technically does not count against
the spending limits Congress imposed on itself. These include
programs like the census, which must be conducted every 10 years,
and a 25-year-old program to help poor people pay their heating
bills in winter.
</P>
<P>
   They also rely on about $2.3 billion in outlays taken from the
budget for fiscal 2001, and two payments that will be delayed until
that year _ $3.3 billion in research grants at the National
Institutes of Health and $1.3 billion due Pentagon contractors.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the appearance of a balanced budget relies on at least
$43 billion in creative accounting by the Republicans, according to
an analysis of the 13 spending bills and the CBO report. It would
require an across-the-board cut of 4.8 percent to bring the budget
into balance without using Social Security funds, the congressional
auditors say.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans adamantly deny that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've now proved that you can fund the government without
raiding Social Security,'' said Majority Leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are running ``a disinformation campaign'' by
emphasizing the Congressional Budget Office numbers, said Rep. John
Edward Porter, a moderate Republican from Illinois.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., said the CBO analysis proved that
``there are lies, darn lies, and statisticians.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said the CBO analysis
``repudiates the Republicans' false claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, John Spratt
of South Carolina, called the Republicans' accounting ``too clever
by half'' and compared their arguments to ``a medieval trial.''
</P>
<P>
   And the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, David
Obey of Wisconsin, called the ican spending claims ``a magic
show designed to put on a phony debate about Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   In this increasingly cranky Congress, with each party all but
calling members of the other liars, the bitterness spilled over to
the Senate, where Democrats are frustrated by Republican control of
the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the biggest legislative graveyard since I've
come to Congress,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. He
also said Senate Democrats would start running television ads
countering commercials made by House Republicans that ``will deal
with Social Security _ what the real facts are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will take up the bill financing the departments of
Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, along with the
across-the-board cut, as early as Friday. The spending bill
contains $314 billion, of which $85 billion is discretionary
spending and $229 billion is mandatory funds that are required by
law. It also includes 316 earmarks, pet projects backed by
individual Republican lawmakers, totaling at least $360 million.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate also passed the month's third continuing
resolution, which keeps government agencies running in the absence
of a real budget until Nov. 5. Although fiscal 2000 began Oct. 1,
the budget battle will continue.

DRUG MAKER'S SHUTDOWN CAUSES SHORTAGES OF PENICILLIN G

<P>
   A nationwide shortage of a powerful form of penicillin that
began quietly last spring, when a leading manufacturer shut down
operations, is now becoming critical, with hospital pharmacies
running out of the drug and new supplies harder and harder to
obtain.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is penicillin G, which is given intravenously to treat
serious infections like syphilis in newborn babies. A second drug
from the same manufacturer, cefazolin, one of the most commonly
used antibiotics to prevent and treat surgical infections, is also
in short supply in some areas. Both drugs have been in use for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of the two drugs does not represent a public health
emergency; newer antibiotics can usually treat patients
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors fear the long-term consequences of using newer,
stronger antibiotics to treat infections that can be treated with
older drugs because the overuse of powerful new drugs has been
linked to the recent explosion of antibiotic resistance among
bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria may go on to cause
infections that can be treated only with difficulty, or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   And newer drugs are often far more expensive than the older
ones. For example, cefazolin (pronounced seh-fa-ZOH-lin), costs
about $5 a dose; alternatives may cost $40 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Marsam Pharmaceuticals, based in Cherry Hill,
N.J., produced more than 60 percent of the penicillin G and about
40 percent of the cefazolin used in the United States. Marsam
stopped producing both drugs and issued a product recall in June in
response to a federal investigation into manufacturing
deficiencies. A spokeswoman for Marsam's owner, Schein
Pharmaceutical, said she could not predict when production would
resume.
</P>
<P>
   The other major supplier of penicillin G in the United States,
Pfizer, based in New York, has now exhausted its stock of the drug.
A letter from Pfizer to pharmacists earlier this month estimated
that new supplies would not be available until the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on how much is in inventory around the country,
penicillin G is now either in very, very limited distribution or
not available at all,'' said Joseph Deffenbaugh, a spokesman at the
American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists in Bethesda, Md.,
which represents pharmacists who practice in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has indicated that both Marsam
drugs were recalled at least in part because supplies were
contaminated with potentially dangerous microbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a balance in regard to weighing the safety issues that
were observed and trying to get more supplies of the drug as
rapidly as possible,'' said Dr. Gary Chikami, director of the
division of anti-infective drug products at the FDA. The agency has
begun to look for other domestic or foreign sources of penicillin
G, which it considers essential for treating some conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Because several drug companies other than Marsam manufacture and
distribute cefazolin, the FDA says there is no serious shortage of
that drug.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors across the country say both drugs are so hard to get
that they have unwillingly turned to other antibiotics. ``We have
had to be incredibly creative to keep up,'' said Dr. Joseph
Guglielmo, a professor of clinical pharmacy who oversees the
antibiotic control program at the Medical Center at the University
of California in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Guglielmo's hospital must now use the drug ampicillin
instead of penicillin, he said. The drugs are similarly priced, but
ampicillin causes a rash more often than penicillin and is also
active against a far wider variety of bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ampicillin is unnecessarily broad in its activity,'' said Dr.
James Rahal, director of infectious diseases at New York Hospital,
where ampicillin has also replaced penicillin on the wards. When a
drug kills a wide variety of bacteria in the gastrointestinal
tract, as ampicillin does, it encourages resistant bacteria
belonging to many different species to multiply. These may go on to
cause antibiotic-resistant infections.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, alternatives to cefazolin are active against many
more strains of bacteria than it is and may also cause infections
resistant to antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Although many strains of bacteria have become resistant to
penicillin since it was first used in the late 1940s, for certain
infections it remains the first choice. These infections include
some forms of syphilis, pneumonia and meningitis, and rare diseases
like anthrax, botulism and gangrene. For the life-threatening
muscle infections caused by the streptococcal bacteria nicknamed
flesh-eating bacteria, penicillin G remains the most effective
antibiotic known, Rahal said.
</P>
<P>
   Both penicillin and cefazolin have been in use for so long that
the patents on their production expired years ago. As a result, the
profits generated by the drugs is far less than for newer drugs
unless large quantities are sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that many of our tried and true antibiotics are
becoming orphan drugs,'' said Dr. Robert Muder, the hospital
epidemiologist at the Pittsburgh Veterans Affairs Hospital. ``They
sell for pennies, they're not advertised, yet they need the same
high-quality production as the newer drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   If these older drugs were to slowly disappear from the market,
``we would be forced to use broad-spectrum drugs for all the wrong
indications,'' Muder said. ``There's a real possibility that this
would exacerbate the problem of drug resistance in this country.''

U.N. COUNCIL SHELVES PROPOSAL ON UPGRADING IRAQ'S OIL INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A recommendation by Secretary-General Kofi
Annan that Iraq be allowed to double the amount it may spend on
upgrading its oil industry was shelved by the Security Council
Thursday, somewhat to the surprise of the United States and
Britain, which were prepared for a spirited debate with France and
Russia over the request.
</P>
<P>
   France's representative, Alain Dejammet, said in an interview
afterward that his government still considered it ``quite
reasonable'' to allow Iraq to spend an additional $300 million on
spare parts for its oil industry in the current six-month period of
the ``oil for food'' program. But he added that the French did not
want to provoke more controversy while the Security Council was
trying to devise a new arms monitoring system for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Other diplomats said the Russians had also agreed to put off
consideration of the proposal until next month, when the Security
Council will debate the next six-month phase of the program under
which Iraq is to sell limited amounts of oil to pay for urgent
civilian needs. Iraqis are earning record amounts because of the
high price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council was briefed on the program Thursday by
Benon Sevan, the overall director of civilian operations in Iraq,
and Carol Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF, the children's
fund, who has just returned from a visit to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Annan proposed to the Security Council this month that Iraq be
allowed to spend $600 million of the money gained in controlled oil
sales. He based his recommendation on advice from independent
experts who say Iraq's oil industry is fraught with worker safety
and environmental hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis made the same request.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. questions whether the extra money would upgrade
equipment strictly related to the permitted pumping programs, or
might go to other projects.
</P>
<P>
   Annan and his Iraqi experts have criticized holds that
Washington and London have placed on other contracts that Iraq
presented for buying goods for public utilities and other services
to the population.
</P>
<P>
   Sevan said Thursday that many of those holds occur because not
enough technical information accompanies applications to the
Security Council's Iraqi sanctions committee, or because some
companies have a track record of trying to help Iraq evade
restrictions in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, who has managed the Iraq issue for the United
States on the Security Council this week while Richard Holbrooke,
the chief U.S. representative, has been in Washington fighting for
congressional action on U.S. dues to the United Nations, told
reporters after the Security Council meeting Thursday that ``the
world knows that Iraq has a demonstrated commitment to both
sustaining and possibly rebuilding their weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into some detail about the reasons why the U.S. puts a
hold on various contracts,'' Burleigh said. ``There are a variety
of reasons, first and foremost concern about potential dual-use
items _ dual use in having both a civilian and a military potential
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go over every contract with that question in mind,'' he
added. U.S. diplomats have in effect made the contract review
process a partial replacement for monitoring the disposition of
certain flagged imports on the ground by weapons inspectors, who
have not worked in Iraq since December.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bellamy said that on her trip to Iraq, she saw great
hardships, ``but I didn't view a country about to collapse.''

 BRADLEY POKES FUN AT GORE, BUYS NEW SHOES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GORE) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ At a campaign rally Thursday morning, former Sen.
Bill Bradley did something he doesn't often do: He poked fun at
Vice President Al Gore, his rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had just been asked what he thought about the teaching
of creationism in public schools. He opposed it, he said, but added
that Gore would allow it in certain circumstances. (For example, in
religion classes, Gore's aides said.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was sort of a misstep,'' Bradley told 150
supporters, an impish grin on his face as he imitated a clumsy
person tripping over his own feet. ``And sometimes when you do
that, this is what you have to do,'' he added, suddenly pivoting in
the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   That was just one way in which Bradley added some punch Thursday
to his generally laid-back campaign style. The former New Jersey
senator told his jokes with more verve, gave more detailed answers
and generally seemed more energized than usual. ``Every day I do
this, I feel stronger, more focused,'' Bradley told the group.
</P>
<P>
   The rally here came the morning after his first side-by-side
appearance with Gore in a town-hall-like forum at Dartmouth College
in Hanover. Throughout the forum, Gore was the aggressor,
repeatedly criticizing Bradley's proposals as too expensive. He
even walked to center stage minutes before the event was scheduled
to start and invited questions from the audience. And at the end of
the event, after Bradley left the stage, Gore stayed for nearly 90
minutes to answer more questions from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Though they said they were not overly troubled by Gore's
aggressive tactics on Wednesday night, Bradley's aides acknowledged
that they had considered the possibility of responding more
assertively to Gore. But the aides said they decided to avoid
vigorously attacking the vice president for now, fearing that it
would undermine Bradley's efforts to portray himself as a different
kind of politician.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley reiterated that decision Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You save your strength for your positive vision,'' he said.
``You save your outrage for the conditions in America that need to
be improved, whether it is child poverty or a lack of insurance for
people. You save your ingenuity for figuring out ways to convince
Americans that this is the direction we should go. You don't waste
all that on simply making a negative attack against your
opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his aides said, Bradley is intent on pushing back _
gently, perhaps _ against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bradley was more direct than usual Thursday in
criticizing Gore for not providing what Bradley considers specific
details on the cost of the vice president's proposals. ``I think
it's very important when you propose a program to put out what it
costs, and that's what I have done,'' Bradley said. ``I would
observe the vice president has announced a number of programs and
has not put out the cost attached to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also seemed determined to regain an edge in
impetuousness. After the rally here, he visited a local store,
Alec's Shoes, whose owner, John Koutsos, has allowed workers to
take Mondays off to spend time with their families. Bradley has
made helping working families a central part of his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   As he toured the store, Bradley _ with some prodding from a
salesman who inquired whether his worn-looking shoes had holes in
their soles _ agreed to buy a new pair. After looking at several
styles, Bradley chose a pair of $75 oxfords, size 13D, black, that
looked very much like the ones he had on.
</P>
<P>
   Though his staff has often accused Gore of campaign gimmickry,
Bradley, who is renowned for his frugality, said his purchase was
completely unplanned. ``It was the least I could do for a guy who
gives his employees Mondays off,'' Bradley said. ``I had no idea
what I was going to do when I went in there. You've got to be
spontaneous.''

SQUABBLING PUTS U.S.-CANADA SALMON TREATY IN JEOPARDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pacific Salmon Treaty, a hard-fought pact that
was supposed to settle a long dispute between the United States and
Canada over fishing rights, is in danger of collapse,
administration officials warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The carefully assembled coalition of U.S. states and tribal
leaders has fractured as the governor of Alaska spars with the
governors of Washington and Oregon over which region is sacrificing
more to save salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is echoing in the Capitol, where Alaska's powerful
congressional delegation is trying to rewrite a portion of the
treaty, which was signed June 30. And a parsimonious congressional
majority is trying to avoid paying costs the United States had
pledged to research and restore fish runs throughout the region, to
buy out commercial fishermen in Washington state, and to enhance
chinook and coho runs in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about the impact the inadequate funding
levels, as well as the riders (legislative provisions) will have on
the viability of this treaty,'' Terry Garcia, assistant secretary
of Commerce for oceans and atmosphere, told a House subcommittee on
fisheries Thursday. ``It could impact it quite adversely.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute could have major ramifications for the Pacific
Northwest and ultimately increase pressure for the breaching of
four federal dams on the lower Snake River. Earlier this week
Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles described the Columbia and Snake rivers as
``killing fields'' for salmon and questioned why his state's
fishermen should cut back their catch while the Snake River dams
remain in place as major contributors to salmon mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia made it clear that dam removal would rise higher on the
list of possible methods to protect the 26 endangered salmon stocks
if fish harvest can not be controlled. He warned that failure of
the treaty ``will not be good for the stocks and it will not be
good for any of the states that are going to be impacted by the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ability to recover those stocks is dependent on how we
address a number of factors, and one of those factors is harvest,''
he said. ``If you remove one of our management tools, you're going
to have to rely on other management tools, which means you will
have to apply further restrictions on habitat, hatcheries, and
hydropower.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Salmon Treaty, negotiated in 1985, and then
renegotiated this year, is an effort to protect five diminishing
salmon stocks that live part of their life cycle in Canada and part
in the United States. Among its provisions is a requirement that
fewer salmon be taken in years when salmon runs are less abundant.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the failure of the two countries to resolve
fishing rules under the treaty caused major disputes. In 1994
Canada imposed a toll on U.S. fishing boats traveling from
Washington to Alaska. In 1997 angry Canadian fishermen blockaded an
Alaska state ferry, and several times British Columbia tried
unsuccessfully to eject the U.S. military from a torpedo testing
ground in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A budget bill passed this year by Congress, and vetoed on Monday
by President Clinton, included several provisions affecting the
Pacific Salmon Treaty, including one that would have exempted
Alaskan salmon from the Endangered Species Act and one that would
have changed the voting structure of a bi-national commission
without consulting Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also proposed to spend just $10 million on the
agreement, far less than the $60 million Clinton wants as a
downpayment on the expected $190 million tab for implementing the
treaty over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the provisions regarding the Pacific Salmon
Treaty ``would severely inhibit our ability to recover this
important species.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's warnings about the future of the treaty
must be seen in the context of the overall budget battle between
Congress and the White House, in which Clinton is pushing for more
money and less restrictive language on a number of fronts.
Congressional staffers said the administration may be able to find
a compromise with the Alaskans over protecting that state's
fishermen, but the administration is likely to have a much tougher
time wringing funds for the Northwest out of a Congress where some
members view salmon restoration as wasteful pork.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon debate has once again divided Alaska from Oregon and
Washington, whose leaders are now accusing one another of
misrepresenting what they agreed to four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about destroying the unity that exists within
those most affected by the treaty: the states of Washington, Oregon
and Alaska and the treaty tribes,'' said James Pipkin, the State
Department's Pacific salmon negotiator. ``They came together on a
package, but some of those interests have expressed enormous
reservations about the legislative package that now exists, and I
am concerned about losing the support of those interests, not only
now but in implementation of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever unity once existed was not on view this week, either in
Washington D.C. or in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Alaskans want an ironclad guarantee that if they agree to cut
back their fishing of salmon in accordance with the treaty, they
won't be subjected to further limits under the Endangered Species
Act. At yesterday's hearing, Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, shouted at
administration officials as he accused them of ``kowtowing to the
Canadians.'' He proclaimed that Canada is less protective of its
environment than Alaska, and complained that Alaskan fisherman
``have taken a cut every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, supported by Washington and Oregon
representatives, refuse to give Alaska the guarantee it wants. But,
in a step the administration hopes will answer the Alaskans
concerns, a federal agency is issuing a report declaring that the
fishing limits under the treaty would not harm endangered salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Alaska's leaders remain unsatisfied, leading Rep.
Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., to complain that the treaty is now
endangered by ``selfish or parochial concerns,'' and that
``immediately at risk are Oregon and Washington and the tribes of
Oregon and Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., said he was ``very disturbed'' by the
developments, which he blamed on a ``new wave of isolationism on
environmental issues.'' He urged the White House officials to
``stick to your guns'' against a wave of criticism from Alaskan
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm partially sickened that Congress is on the verge of
snatching defeat from the jaws of victory after so many years and
so much heartache,'' Inslee said.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of Alaska, Oregon and Washington have been
exchanging unfriendly letters in recent days accusing one another
of taking positions that could lead to a collapse of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke and Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber warned
in a letter to Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles that his actions ``put in
jeopardy all the hard fought success we gained in resolving the
major fisheries issues'' and that if Congress fails to fund the
treaty, there is a risk of ``return of the old harvest regimes that
put many American and Canadian stocks in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowles responded by suggesting that Locke and Kitzhaber look
for solutions to ``the lethal zone of freshwater streams and
surrounding habitat in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the federal government and the
states of Oregon and Washington have not come to terms with the
real problem facing wild Pacific salmon: restoring the great salmon
rivers of the Northwest,'' he said. ``I will not participate in any
approach that asks Alaska's fishermen and families to sacrifice any
more until the Northwest and the federal government have fully
addressed the threats and obstacles to salmon survival in the
rivers of the Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to all this back and forth in Congress and the
states, a U.S. diplomat warned that there may not be another chance
to reach a deal with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our differences with Canada on salmon (have been) about the
nastiest dispute we've had in a long time with them, and here we
have today in front of us a chance to settle this on a long-term
basis in a really workable way,'' said David Balton, director of
the State Department's Office of Marine Conservation. ``If we
cannot resolve the issues that are related to these riders, it will
be said of all of us ... that we lost our best chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians are watching the dispute closely; Canadian
diplomats attended Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleased that the U.S. spending bill was vetoed on
Monday because of the riders and the lack of funding, and we were
quite pleased with the statements made today ... by the
administration,'' said Rodney Moore, spokesman for the Canadian
Embassy in Washington. ``We're concerned that the treaty should not
be getting sideswiped by this squabble.''

GORE STEPS UP THE ATTACK AGAINST BRADLEY ON HEALTH CARE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore ripped apart Bill
Bradley's health-care proposal Thursday, saying it cost too much,
in part because it would provide insurance even for the wealthy,
and would swallow up the entire budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a big idea, but it's not a good idea,'' Gore
declared, offering a response to Bradley's assertion in their first
one-on-one appearance Wednesday night that health insurance was a
big problem that needed a big solution. ``Alchemy was a big idea,
but it wasn't a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was campaigning by bus across the expansive farmland of
eastern Iowa Thursday with a spring in his step just hours after
the joint event in New Hampshire. His advisers were confident that
Gore had bested the former senator, his only Democratic rival for
the presidential nomination, in both style and substance and that
Bradley's answers on health care made him vulnerable on an
important issue that they could exploit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were stunned that he didn't defend his numbers,'' a Gore
aide said of Bradley's performance Wednesday night. ``He didn't
say, `I guarantee I'll save Medicare.' In a campaign, when someone
gives you an opening like that on a core Democratic issue, we'll
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign disputed this central contention, saying
the Bradley plan, which guarantees health care for all children,
preserves and protects Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But at stop after stop Thursday, Gore pounded on this theme. At
a rally here at the widest point in the Mississippi River, Gore
called Bradley's plan ``ill-considered'' and said it would drive
the nation back into deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his plan, which would cost $50 billion to $65
billion a year, would be paid for through the budget surplus and
through what he called the ``enormous savings'' achieved by
shifting to electronic record-keeping for health care from paper.
Gore said that such a shift was not possible, could not be relied
upon and would not provide much savings anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Gore based much of his criticism of the Bradley plan on a new
study by Kenneth E. Thorpe, a professor of health policy at Emory
University, a former Clinton administration official and, as the
Bradley camp pointed out, one contributor to the failed Clinton
health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's study said that Bradley's plan, including coverage for
prescription drugs, would cost $1.2 trillion over 10 years. Gore's
plan, which would cover all children by January 2005 but is
otherwise based largely on Clinton administration proposals, would
cost $312 billion over 10 years and also includes coverage for
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that Gore's plan would cover about 12 million
people and that the Bradley plan would cover 18 million. There are
about 45 million Americans without insurance now.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the study, Gore told a group of elderly in Dubuque
Thursday morning that Bradley's plan cost so much ``because
two-thirds of all the money spent in this plan goes to people who
already have health insurance, many of them wealthy, many of them
well-to-do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley camp also claimed its own supporting academic
experts. These include David Cutler, a professor of economics at
the Kennedy School at Harvard, who has said that Bradley's critics
say the plan would cost more than it would because they wrongly
assumed he provides a more generous insurance policy than he
actually does.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short,'' the Bradley statement said, ``Gore is attacking
Bradley's plan simply because it is comprehensive and bold.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself has been criticized for offering so many generous
proposals in this campaign that he, too, has already spent the
surplus. But Thursday he said that he was keeping a running tally
of the costs of his various programs and that they all fit within a
balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was asked Thursday at a news conference in
Washington about comments Gore made during the joint encounter
Wednesday night, when he was asked about the cynicism that many
people felt about politicians. The vice president responded that he
understood the disappointment and anger that the country felt
toward Clinton and said, ``I felt it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Gore had not expressed that anger personally and
added that he believed the American people were inherently fair.
``You know, I think a lot of people who may not like me may hold it
against him, but I don't think you hold him responsible. I don't
think mature people hold one person responsible for another
person's conduct, do you?''

BOEING WANTS TO BE LANDLORD FOR THE SPACE STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ NASA is looking for a commercial landlord for the
International Space Station, and Boeing wants the job.
</P>
<P>
   If the concept flies, Boeing could end up building and owning an
inflatable habitation module, which once in orbit would be blown up
like a balloon and would serve as the living and recreational
accommodations for the station's seven-member crew.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wanted to spend time on the station doing research
would pay for their quarters, just as they might pay for a hotel
room on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is part of a new strategy by NASA to triple the size of
the station's crew quarters while at the same time encouraging
commercial opportunities for the floating space platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like you are going to build a hotel in space,''
said Daniel Tam, NASA's assistant to the administrator for
commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are trying to figure out what the hotel looks
like, and then we need to figure out what's the best way to build
it. Do we have someone else pay for the whole thing ... or do we
want to co-own it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is one of a number of companies working on preliminary
designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like very much, if NASA decides to go that way, to be
a part of it,'' said Steve Goo, Boeing's deputy space station
program director. ``We are working to help mature their concept.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA had hoped to pick its partner or partners for the project
by the end of October, but Tam said Thursday the selection process
will take more time.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is already NASA's prime contractor for the space station,
and built the major U.S. elements under a multi-billion-dollar
government contract awarded earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Those elements, one of which is already in orbit, included a
rigid habitation module made of aluminum. It will be used as
planned for the station's crew quarters if the inflatable module
doesn't pan out.
</P>
<P>
   The aluminum habitation module is now in Huntsville, Ala., where
it and the other key U.S. station elements were built by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The aluminum habitation module is just a shell. NASA issued a
stop-work order a couple years ago when the idea of an inflatable
module began to take root. The inflatable module was then called
TransHab, a reference to a plan to use it as a design prototype for
a manned Mars mission. The name has stuck, though it is now also
being called the inflatable habitation module.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the hardware that would have gone inside the aluminum
habitation module, such as air revitalization equipment, would also
be used in the inflatable module.
</P>
<P>
   Even though work stopped on the aluminum module, Boeing has
continued to develop the hardware that would go inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``What NASA wanted us to do is protect their options and to make
sure we have all the common equipment ready to go no matter which
way this turns out,'' said Goo, whose previous job with Boeing was
overseeing production of the aluminum habitation module and other
station elements in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we are participating in these studies for
TransHab to see if we can come up with something that makes good
sense,'' Goo said. ``Like any other opportunity it has to make
sense from a business standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The current station assembly timetable calls for the aluminum
habitation module to launch in November 2004. If NASA decides to
use the inflatable module instead, it would have to be ready by
that same date.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly of the International Space Station began last December
with the launch of a connecting node built by Boeing, which space
shuttle astronauts attached to a Russian-built module.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly schedule could slip because of repeated delays in
launching the Russian-built service module, which will be the
temporary home of a rotating crew of three hard-hat astronauts
until the habitation module is ready for the permanent station crew
of seven.
</P>
<P>
   The launch of the service module, now set for late December or
early 2000, is already a year and a half late.
</P>
<P>
   The habitation module would be one of the final elements
connected to the station.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has spent $2.5 million to develop a prototype of TransHab.
It is 36 feet long and 27 feet in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   The aluminum habitation module built by Boeing is 28 feet long
and 14.5 feet in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Because it has more than three times the volume of the aluminum
module, the inflatable module as envisioned by NASA would have four
different levels.
</P>
<P>
   Level one is the wardroom and galley. It is big enough so that
up to 12 people can dine together (More than 7 people will be on
the station when the shuttle is docked.) The wardroom includes a
20-inch window in the dining room for watching the earth 250 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Level two is the crew quarters. Each member of the crew would
have his or her own computer entertainment center for recreation
and personal work.
</P>
<P>
   Level 3 is an exercise area with a treadmill and stationary
bicycle. It also has a complete health care system, including a
space shower.
</P>
<P>
   Level four is a pressurized tunnel that serves as a passageway
between the habitation module and and the station element that it
is attached to.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.5-foot thick outer wall of the inflatable module has about
two dozen layers to protect the crew from space projectiles as big
as an inch and moving up to 15,000 miles per hour. Successive
layers of Nextel, a material commonly used as insulation under the
hoods of many cars, are spaced between layers of open cell foam,
similar to the foam used in chair cushions on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The layers are designed to break up small particles of space
debris or tiny meteorites that might hit the station with a speed
seven times as fast as a rifle bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Tam said NASA has fired projectiles into the TransHab mockup and
it held up well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that it is better than the aluminum module,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA Administrator Dan Goldin has said the space agency would
like to turn over operation of the space station to private
enterprise within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near term, we believe that the commercial habitation
module offers unbelievable opportunitie,'' Goldin said in a speech
last month.
</P>
<P>
   In August, NASA held a three-day conference near its Houston
headquarters to explore the commercial opportunities of TransHab.
More than 150 people from the aerospace industry were there. They
represented small companies as well as industry titans such as
Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Participants were urged to offer designs for an alternative to
the aluminum habitation module.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can come up with a design similar to TransHab or
something different,'' Tam said. ``But it has to satisfy what we
need, and what commercial users would want.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA would invest no more than $200 million, which is the cost
of completing the aluminum module. Tam doesn't know how much
something like TransHab would cost. It would be in the hundreds of
millions of dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not be a procurement like we usually do in
government,'' he said. ``We are not sending out requests for
proposals, getting a bunch in, choosing who we want and then paying
them to build it. We are looking for a business arrangement with a
commercial entity. They would pay for all or part of it and own all
or part of it ....
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA would only have to pay for what we use. Then we could
concentrate on cutting edge research and development as well as
far-frontier exploration, which is what I think we do best. And we
could leave the other stuff to the commercial people and let them
make money and benefit from it.''

TV SPORTS: COSELL'S BACK, AND HE'S STILL COSELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a once-upon-a-time quality to the life of Howard
Cosell. You almost have to educate younger viewers that a
television personality with his voice, erudition, bombast, ego,
arrogance, toupee, neuroses, sense of social justice and inner
anger towered over sportscasting for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you describe Howard Cosell on the air to someone who
has never heard him before?'' the comedian Billy Crystal asks
during ``Howard Cosell: Telling It Like It Is,'' a new HBO
documentary Monday at 8 p.m. ``Think of a very smart man scolding
you, with a bad sinus condition who had a great vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosell retired from ABC Sports in 1985 after a 20-year run. His
career switched between solid journalism and brilliant boxing calls
and hop-scotched from championing the rights of black athletes to
being the host for trash sports events. From his platform as the
catalytic converter of ``Monday Night Football,'' he became so big
that ABC gave him his own variety show, ``Saturday Night Live With
Howard Cosell,'' which faded quickly.
</P>
<P>
   From the late 1960s to the early 1980s, few TV stars were
bigger. He reveled in it and enjoyed informing others of his
magnitude. ``Let's put it on the table,'' he told Dinah Shore on
her talk show. ``I'm great.''
</P>
<P>
   His success came late in his career; by the time he was hired by
ABC Sports, he had withstood a six-year blackball of him by the
network's president, Tom Moore.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, he was voted by TV Guide viewers the most admired
AND hated sportscaster in America. Think of anyone in sports TV now
who generates such passion _ well, some players hope to hit the
billboarded face of Fox's Keith Olbermann on outfield fences
nationwide _ or a single one who would tell you, as Cosell did,
that he was more than capable of anchoring the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   His one-of-a-kind presence led Woody Allen to cast Cosell as
himself in the film ``Bananas'' to interview a South American
dictator as he lay dying from gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the broadcasting presence all the time,'' Allen says in
the documentary. ``If Howard said, `Pass the salt,' or `I'm going
to get a newspaper,' it sounded like an exciting event. One can
only speculate what it was like making love to him, because
everything he said had that sense of event, of crisis and
urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   His fame at ABC led Cosell to guest-star twice on ``The Odd
Couple.'' The television show's co-star, Tony Randall, cracks up at
the memory of Cosell's penchant for exaggerated facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed he knew how to act,'' Randall tells HBO. ``No one
told him not to because it was kind of funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cosell retired bitterly, filled with resentments that he
packed into his scabrous 1985 memoir, ``I Never Played the Game.''
He died of a heart embolism in 1995, but really, he had been
brokenhearted since the death of his wife, Emmy, in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   HBO succeeds in chronicling the scope of Cosell's career, and
the use of archival radio, video and film material is enriching.
There is a fascinating sequence about Cosell's 1976 call of the Joe
Frazier-George Foreman heavyweight championship bout, which is
renowned for Cosell's call of Foreman's first knockdown of Frazier:
``Down goes Frazier!'' which he repeated three times and which
would not have seemed memorable emanating from anyone else, lacking
his unusual vocal rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hear him patting himself on the back,'' Foreman recalls,
``saying: `I told you, I told you! Down goes Frazier!''' The
documentary cuts to Cosell in the ring after the fight, smugly
saying, ``Didn't I tell you?''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary successfully shows how Cosell's intelligence
drove him to great heights, but built a foundation of intolerance
toward the people who worked with him, the
athletes-turned-announcers whom he scorned as ``the jockocracy,''
and the newspaper reporters he excoriated as low-paid hacks.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Cosell's early life would have benefited from
college and law school contemporaries and colleagues from his years
as a practicing lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues like Frank Gifford, whom Cosell vilified in the
memoir after their 13-year union on ``Monday Night Football,''
clearly held back on their most withering comments. ``I never read
the book,'' Gifford says. ``I had enough agitation with him,
traveling with him for `Monday Night Football.'''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary turns emotional when it shows a Cosell you never
sensed existed. To hear the words of his daughters, Jill and
Hilary, you discover a man fiercely devoted to his family and
profoundly in love with Emmy, evidently the only person who could
tame him.
</P>
<P>
   Cosell's radio eulogy to Emmy will move you to tears. ``My heart
aches,'' he said, his familiar voice slowed and quavering. ``I
thank whatever gods may be, Emmy, for your unconquerable soul.'' So
will Gifford's recollection of his final visit to the dying Cosell,
who sang a lament to his dead wife: ``Where are you? Where have you
gone without me? How can I live without you?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There may also be a need to explain Wilt Chamberlain's impact on
basketball to those who never saw him. At 10:30 Friday night, ESPN
profiles Chamberlain, ranked 13th on its list of the century's
greatest North American athletes. The program looks skillfully at
the contradiction between his great strength and his unwillingness
to wield it in anger. It examines his battles with Bill Russell,
about which Bob Cousy says, ``If he had one-third of Russell's
intensity, God, he would have been more awesome than he was.''

RAMPAGE MAY IMPERIL PEACE PACT WITH AZERBAIJAN

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The killers who stormed Armenia's parliament may have
succeeded in stalling a planned peace pact with neighbor Azerbaijan
_ whether or not it was their intent.
</P>
<P>
   The brazen attack by five gunmen Wednesday, which ended with
their surrender early Thursday, has shocked this small former
Soviet republic to its core and left the country's powerful prime
minister, Vazgen Sarkisian, and seven other top officials dead.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Kocharian on Thursday declared three days of
mourning, and US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright ordered
her deputy, Strobe Talbott, to return to Armenia's capital,
Yerevan, to reassure the country's leadership and ``see what we can
do to lessen the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   In a televised statement before his surrender, the group's
leader, Nairi Unanian, an ardent nationalist and former journalist,
accused the government of corruption and allowing the country to
disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to save the Armenian people from perishing and
restore their rights,'' Unanian &UR;  &LR; said. ``Those responsible for
robbing the country must face trial along with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The five gunmen included Unanian's brother, Karen Unanian, and
uncle, Vram Galstyan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread speculation, there is no indication that the
action was designed to derail a US-brokered peace deal in the works
over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian
enclave in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Fallout from the attack, however, may overwhelm and distract the
government for some time, putting off any possible deal, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of a strong leader like Sarkisian, who was able to
consolidate society, could weaken Armenia domestically. To
compensate for this psychologically, Armenia will probably take a
harder position on Nagorno-Karabakh,'' said Emil Pain, a former
ethnic affairs adviser to Russia's President Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott left Yerevan on Wednesday just hours before the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen, who stormed the parliament during a televised speech
by the prime minister Wednesday evening, surrendered Thursday
morning after a 17-hour standoff. Kocharian guaranteed their safety
and pledged they would receive a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the gunmen surrendered, military leaders demanded
the resignation of top law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how the gunmen gained access to the parliament
chamber. Unanian reportedly held a journalist's accreditation and
news agencies reported that the five hid their weapons under long
trenchcoats.
</P>
<P>
   ``A treacherous and premeditated crime was committed. It was a
plot aimed at Armenia's statehood and against the future of the
Armenian nation,'' said a Defense Ministry statement continually
broadcast on national television. ``In such circumstances the
national army cannot stand idly by.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement reiterated, however that the military remained
loyal to the president and the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia's prosecutor announced a criminal case against the
gunmen on charges of terrorism and undermining the state. If
convicted, the five could face prison sentences of 10 to 15 years
or the death penalty, although Armenia has observed a moratorium on
executions since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Thursday, parliament denounced the
attack, saying it ``interrupts notable, positive trends in
Armenia's transition to democracy and free markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarkisian, who formerly led a group supporting veterans of the
war in Nagorno-Karabakh, was considered a moderate nationalist. His
party, called Unity, helped bring down Armenia's previous
president, Levon Ter-Petrosian, accusing him of being weak and
``defeatist'' on Karabakh. Nevertheless, Sarkisian has been
actively seeking a solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ter-Petrosian Thursday called on the nation to rally around
Kocharian, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not doubt that the Armenian authorities will do their
utmost to maintain discipline and public order,'' he said.

flooding for areas of North Carolina. Although several billion
dollars worth of new satellites, computers, ocean buoys and
software have dramatically enhanced the Weather Service's

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton met Thursday with Nigeria's
recently elected president and pledged a tripling of aid to the
country, his administration's biggest initiative for Africa _ a
bill that could boost Africa's access to the U.S. market _ seemed
imperiled in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's afternoon meetings with President Olusegun Obasanjo
was an effort to show new U.S. political support for a country
plagued for decades by corruption, military dictatorship and
violence. But when Obasanjo arrived here, he joined the parade of
new democratic leaders who wanted to talk tariff rates and debt
forgiveness. And during an afternoon news conference with Clinton,
he spoke about Nigeria's new commitment to ``a level playing
ground'' for investors, making sure that ``investment can be
secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's main goal was to reduce or reschedule more than $30
billion in debt. Paying down the interest and the principal takes
up a huge part of Nigeria's gross national product. At the news
conference, Clinton said ``it is neither morally right nor
economically sound to say that young democracies like Nigeria, as
they overcome the painful legacy of dictatorship or misrule, must
choose between making interest payments on their debt and investing
in the health and education of their children.''
</P>
<P>
   But under the debt-forgiveness plan for the world's poorest
nations that Clinton announced last month, Nigeria would be only a
partial beneficiary. The country has such large oil reserves that
little of its debt would be forgiven outright. Instead, payments to
the world's major powers and to the World Bank would largely be
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he was meeting with Obasanjo Thursday, Clinton was
trying to save the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which would
reduce or eliminate duties on a range of products produced in
sub-Saharan Africa, mostly those made with American-produced
fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, the bill appeared to be sailing toward easy
passage. But late Thursday afternoon, aides to the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, said the bill could be pulled from the Senate
agenda on Friday because of a dispute with Democrats over
amendments. This also threatened a similar trade bill for Caribbean
nations, which is attached to the African bill.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, bipartisan support for the trade bill _ which would
mean a great amount to sub-Saharan countries but would have a
barely measurable effect on the U.S. economy _ appeared extremely
strong. The Senate voted 90-8 to cut off a filibuster led by Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who fears the effects of African imports
on his state's politically powerful textile makers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, Lott said he feared that Democrats would
try to attach a raft of unrelated amendments to the bill. So he
invoked a parliamentary maneuver to block Democrats from offering
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   That infuriated Democrats who had hoped to offer amendments on
raising the minimum wage, a patients' bill of rights and a Medicare
prescription drug bill _ all initiatives that Clinton has
supported, and which Democrats hope to turn into campaign issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been calling around on Capitol Hill _ including to
Lott _ to save the bill. White House officials are clearly
concerned that he not be accused of doing too little, the charge
that Republicans leveled after the defeat of the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, who supports the
bill, Thursday angrily denounced the Republican procedural tactics.
He said the debate now revolved around any senator's fundamental
right to offer an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Daschle said that barring a last-minute compromise, all
45 Democrats would probably vote against a second motion to cut off
debate on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 Republicans are expected to vote to end the filibuster,
but a spokesman for Lott, John Czwartacki, said that if the
majority could not muster the 60 votes necessary to cut off debate,
the majority leader would pull the bill from the Senate floor
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki signaled that Republicans were ready to turn
Clinton's own accusations of isolationism against Democrats if the
procedural vote failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no cloture, the Democrats will have succeeded in
bowing to the worst elements of isolationism in their own party,''
Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they were willing to pay that price to stand up
for the larger procedural principles of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sham,'' Daschle said on the floor. ``There is
nothing deliberative about the Senate today. They want to make this
a legislative assembly line. You take something up, you vote it up
or down, and you move it along.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Lott and Daschle met to discuss a compromise,
but it was unclear whether they would reach agreement before
Friday's vote.

A CHURCH'S HAUNTED HOUSE DESIGNED TO TEACH MORALS DRAWS FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Colo.)   (bl)  
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR HILL, Texas _ The sign _ ``Hell House'' _ suggests any
Halloween haunted house, but this one is very different.
Blood-spattered teen-agers die in a drunken-driving wreck. A young
girl who has been raped by her father commits suicide. A gay man
dies of AIDS. And a young woman dies of a botched abortion and
descends to hell.
</P>
<P>
   Each scene is intended to shock, but it is the opening scene
that is most shockingly familiar: Two teen-agers dressed in black
trench coats burst into a high school library and begin shooting.
The gunmen murder a student after she proclaims her faith in God,
and then kill themselves. The scene is a re-enactment of the
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., where the
depiction has given rise to accusations of insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Hell House, staged by a conservative evangelical church in this
suburb south of Dallas, is a fire-and-brimstone sermon tailored to
an MTV generation grown accustomed to graphic media portrayals of
sex and violence. It presents itself as a message about right and
wrong, and about hell as an actual place that is a consequence of
the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary,'' said Jessica Rhodes, 14, who was chaperoned by
her mother the other night through a maze-like collection of
portable buildings that serve as the Hell House set.
</P>
<P>
   The production here in Cedar Hill is among more than 400 with
such themes presented by church groups around the country this
year. But this one, run by Trinity Church of Assemblies of God, is
one of a very few to stage a Columbine scene, a decision that has
brought condemnation on the grounds of poor taste and particularly
poor timing. Only last week, the mother of a girl wounded in the
Columbine attack committed suicide and a student was arrested on
charges of plotting a further assault on the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've been through enough,'' said Connie Michalik,
whose son, Richard Castaldo, was another of the 23 people wounded,
in addition to the 13 killed, by the two young Columbine gunmen.
``We've had a terrible, terrible week.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the addition of the Columbine scene, Hell Houses had
drawn a measure of controversy in recent years, for portraying
homosexuality as a sin and abortion as akin to murder. But the Rev.
Tim Ferguson, the Trinity youth pastor, said his church, which has
presented a Hell House since 1990, had never anticipated anything
like the current reaction.
</P>
<P>
   In his book-lined office Wednesday afternoon, Ferguson, 38, had
bags under his eyes after a relentless succession of interviews
with the talk radio programs, television shows and newspapers that
have been calling from around the country since local news
organizations began carrying accounts of his Hell House a week or
so ago. From the general public, he said, he has received about two
dozen telephone calls, most of them complimentary, although the 20
or 30 e-mail messages, all from strangers, have been ``pretty
nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as hypocritical that we're getting attacked when
every TV station in the country wants to talk to us, and show it,
too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Columbine scene, the girl who is shot after refusing to
renounce God is then led to heaven by Jesus, while demons drag the
two gunmen to hell. The scene's message, Ferguson said, is that
``if you don't accept Christ, there are consequences to that in a
real place called hell.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a proliferation of Hell Houses around the country
since 1995, when the Rev. Keenan Roberts of the Abundant Life
Christian Center in Arvada, Colo., began marketing a Hell House
how-to kit: a 270-page instruction manual that costs $199 and
includes scripts involving abortion, homosexuality, gang violence,
drugs and school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said 435 churches in 46 states and eight foreign
countries ordered the kit this year. But, he said, his own church
decided against a school shooting scene this fall because Columbine
is less than an hour away. ``We felt it would be the compassionate
decision for what this community has gone through to not include
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent night here, more than 150 people paid $7 each and
waited in line as groups of 30 were led through a dark maze of
rooms with varying themes acted out by some 300 students affiliated
with Trinity Church or its Christian school. Afterward, each group
was invited to meet with spiritual counselors to renounce sin and
embrace Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said the graphic scenes were necessary to grab the
attention of teen-agers conditioned to violence and sex on
television. He also said he believed that the controversy over the
Columbine scene had scared away some church groups that usually
attend Hell House. But it was hard to find a negative reaction the
other night from the people who had just walked through.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Jones, 15, said a scene of a girl dying of a drug
overdose had reminded her of an uncle who had overdosed twice. And
Williestyne Miller cried outside in telling of the fatal shooting
of her 29-year-old son three weeks earlier. ``I didn't know if I
could come,'' she said, ``but the Lord gave me the strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said he regretted any pain that his production had
caused people connected to Columbine. But, he said, he thinks his
message may prevent other killings.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Michalik, the Columbine parent, who first heard of
Ferguson's Hell House through news reports in Denver, said in a
telephone interview that she supported a message about good and
evil. But, she said, mimicking the events at Columbine makes
matters too close, too painful, particularly at Halloween, which
``is a druid holiday to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They just hit too close to home,'' she said.

EARLIEST DIVORCE CASE: X AND Y CHROMOSOMES SPLIT 320 MILLION YEARS
AGO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Mass.)   By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like archeologists exploring a succession of levels at a dig
site, two Boston scientists have discovered four distinct layers of
evolution in the structure of the human X chromosome. From the
chronology of the layers, the scientists have inferred some of the
landmark events in the evolution of sex chromosomes _ an epic
battle of the sexes that stretches back to the dawn of mammalian
time.
</P>
<P>
   The layers correspond to increasing levels of evolutionary
divorce between the X chromosome and its partner, the Y chromosome,
which determines whether a person will be male.
</P>
<P>
   The findings underline the importance of the Y chromosome as a
unique piece of genetic real estate for genes that favor males but
would be detrimental to females. Despite this privileged source of
power, however, males may be at risk from the unavoidable
obsolescence of the Y chromosome, a process that has driven down
its number of genes from equality to one-hundredth of those on the
X chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, David C. Page of the Whitehead Institute and his
colleague Bruce T. Lahn, now of the University of Chicago, report
in Friday's issue of the journal Science that they stumbled on the
layers while studying the differences between the 19 genes of which
copies are found on both the X and the Y chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   The two members of each pair had diverged from each other
genetically because the X and Y chromosome do not exchange genetic
material every generation, as do the other 22 pairs of human
chromosomes, known as autosomes.
</P>
<P>
   This intergenerational exchange of material, a grand reshuffling
of the genetic deck, gives each gene slightly different properties
and is one reason children differ from their parents. Genes that
cannot participate in the reshuffling eventually fail to contribute
to an individual's survival and disappear from the genome.
</P>
<P>
   But human sex chromosomes must be excluded from the reshuffling
process, at least in the region of the male-determining gene, to
prevent this gene from sneaking into the X chromosome and fomenting
the disaster of making everyone male.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, reshuffling is prevented not just at the male gene site
but along the whole length of the two sex chromosomes. Only at
their very tips do the two chromosomes join during the reshuffle
waltz, the bare minimum of contact to keep them engaged as a pair.
</P>
<P>
   Page and Lahn have discovered that the no-shuffle region did not
appear all at once but opened up in four separate stages during
evolutionary history. The stages can be dated by the number of
genetic differences between the 19 pairs of genes found on both the
X and Y chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   The first no-shuffle region appeared as long as 320 million
years ago, according to their calculations, shortly after mammals
evolved from reptiles. Sex in reptiles is decided not by having
different sex chromosomes but, bizarrely enough, by environmental
cues. In turtles and crocodiles, for example, the sex of the embryo
is determined by the temperature at which it is incubated.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably a sex-determining gene activated by temperature or
some other external influence became genetically dominant in some
early mammalian ancestor, and at the same time the first no-shuffle
zone arose around it. No-shuffle zones can be created by the
genetic accident known as an inversion, in which a stretch of DNA
springs loose from a chromosome and gets reinserted the wrong way
around. The inverted DNA no longer corresponds to the DNA on its
counterpart chromosome and cannot exchange genetic material with
it.
</P>
<P>
   Three more of these inversions occurred as long as 170 million
years ago, 130 million years ago and 50 million years ago, with
each event expanding the region of the no-shuffle zone.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Huntington F. Willard, a medical geneticist at Case Western
Reserve University, said it was fascinating that the traces of such
distant evolutionary events could be recovered from the human
genome, especially ones that shed light on the logic of its
construction. ``One of the biggest questions for understanding the
human genome is whether it matters how it was put together,'' he
said. ``This is a glimpse that there is in fact substantial method
to the madness.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the lack of reshuffling makes it hard for the Y
chromosome to keep its genes fit, it also creates a haven for any
genes that may evolve to benefit males but harm females. Male
guppies, for example, are brightly colored so as to attract
females, but the colors also make the fish dangerously visible to
predators. The color genes confer a net benefit to the males but
would harm female fish. Almost all these gaudy genes, Page said,
are on the guppy's Y chromosome, where they cannot get into the
female's genome.
</P>
<P>
   The human Y chromosome, sad to say, seems to contain no gaudy
color-producing genes. Anyone expecting to find genes conferring
special prowess in war, baseball or math will be disappointed: so
far, at least, the Y chromosome seems to contain a very dull
collection of genes. One category, with counterparts on the X,
performs routine housekeeping tasks in the cell; the other, the
genes special to the Y, seem to be involved mostly in sperm
production and male fertility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been speculation that the cognitive differences
between males and females are hard-wired into the Y chromosome, but
there is no evidence of that at present,'' Page said.
</P>
<P>
   But genes sometimes turn out to have unexpected second
functions, and it could be that one of the boring sperm-related
genes on the Y chromosome can also turn on a suite of more
interesting genes located on the other chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Y can play a special role in the battle of the sexes, ''
said Dr. William R. Rice of the University of California at Santa
Barbara, a biologist who studies the evolution of X and Y
chromosomes. In fruit flies, he noted, ``the Y chromosome is a
powerhouse in determining male fitness.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the decay of the Y's original complement of genes ``created
problems for males that the species has had to come to grips
with,'' Page said. The problem is that a gene's product must be
delivered at just the right levels. With loss of a Y gene, its
counterpart on the X had to work twice as hard. That meant that in
females, with two X chromosomes, each gene now needed to work half
as hard as before, a problem that is solved in humans by randomly
switching off one X chromosome in each cell.
</P>
<P>
   Although the X chromosome cannot reshuffle its genes when in
males, it escapes the Y's obsolescence because, when transmitted to
a man's daughters, it can exchange genetic material with the other
X chromosome in a cell.
</P>
<P>
   Page and Lahn calculated the dates at which the 19 pairs of
genes started to diverge from each other by counting the number of
different DNA units between each pair. The dated genes fell into
four distinct clusters. The genes occurred in an apparently random
order along the Y chromosome, presumably because of the several
inversions that occurred there. But their counterpart genes on the
X chromosome turned out to be nearly arranged in chronological
order stretching from one end of the chromosome to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was if we were looking at geology in an undisturbed
sedimentary formation and these were the strata,'' Page said.

US TO HELP BELL ATLANTIC FILL 2,000 OPENINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with the tightest labor market in decades, Bell Atlantic
Corp. and the US Labor Department announced an unprecedented
partnership Thursday. The arrangement is designed to help the
telecommunications giant hire 2,000 employees by tapping into the
large number of unskilled workers who flock to state unemployment
offices for jobless benefits and leads to potential jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been looking for innovative models and approaches to
dealing with the skills shortage,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman
said Thursday. And ``one of our biggest challenges is making sure
workers have the skills to connect with jobs and employers have a
way to connect with skilled workers.''
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Bell Atlantic, which said the partnership may be
the beginning of a long-term relationship, is seeking to bolster
its ranks by adding a variety of positions, from telemarketers and
operators to cable splicers and network technicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our industry, telecommunications, is one of the
fastest-growing segments of the economy,'' said Ivan Seidenberg,
Bell Atlantic chairman and chief executive. ``We need all the
skilled people we can find, but tens of thousands of
telecommunications jobs are going unfilled in New York, Washington,
and Boston. This will provide a pipeline and help assure a more
diverse work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the partnership, jobless workers will be tested and
screened in states, including Massachusetts, that the firm serves.
Openings will be available to anyone who walks into a state
unemployment office, from laid-off workers to former welfare
recipients and recent high school graduates. State intake workers
will determine an applicant's skill level, and then offer state or
federally-supported training.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic estimated that between 300 and 400 of the 2,000
jobs will be in Massachusetts. The company's employment needs are
expanding as it grows from a Northeastern local telephone company
to a national force in wireless and high-speed Internet
communication. It is pursuing a $55 billion takeover of GTE, which
it expects to close next year, and is forming a coast-to-coast
wireless joint venture with Vodafone AirTouch PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is seeking to become the first of the Baby
Bells to offer long-distance service, a line of business the
regional phone companies have been forbidden to enter since they
were broken off from AT&AMP;T in 1984. In Massachusetts alone,
long-distance calling is a $3 billion market.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department had offered a $300,000 grant to the company
to help defray the cost of training state workers to use Bell
Atlantic's criteria for screening applicants, Herman said, but the
company turned the offer down.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Delgado, a Bell Atlantic senior specialist in charge of
implementing the partnership with the Labor Department, said
government workers have already completed a two-month training
program to help them identify the skills needed to complete the
company's various tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, people will be screened for basic skills, such as
math and spelling, at the unemployment offices,'' said Delgado.
``For technical jobs such as cable splicer, we will do a second
screening of basic electronics skills. If someone cannot spell or
needs help with math, the Labor Department will train them and
improve their skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting wages for the jobs, which are entry level, will
range from $319 to $414 weekly. The positions will be full time,
with such benefits as a savings plan and medical, dental, and
vision coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, jobs vacancies listed with Bell Atlantic will be
posted on America's Job Bank, a Web site developed by the Labor
Department and the state employment system. Applicants can visit
the site, http://www.ajb.dni.us, to find out more about job
openings.
</P>
<P>
   More than four years ago, Bell Atlantic slashed its payroll in
an effort to reduce costs, offering a buyout package that added
five years of service to workers' pension eligibility. In all, an
estimated 8,000 workers took the buyout, according to Jeff Miller,
communications director for the CWA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skilled workers were flying out the door, and suddenly, (the
company) was in a bind,'' said Miller. ``More people took the
buyout than they expected and then the economy boomed. So they are
now trying to get staffing back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in this economy it is not that easy to get people who are
up to speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America,
which represents 72,000 Bell Atlantic employees, said the union
expects to refer job inquiries to the program and will help train
new hires. During a telephone news conference Thursday, Bahr urged
more companies to develop similar partnerships with the Labor
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next four years, we may have a shortage of 1.8
million skilled workers,'' he said. ``Rather than get into a debate
over how many foreign workers we will allow to come here, we should
consider what Bell Atlantic and the Labor Department are doing
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The partnership is the first such project to be developed under
a system of public-private collaboration envisioned under the
Workforce Investment Act of 1998. The law condenses 60 federal job
programs into three federal block grants to various states, giving
financial responsibility and decision-making authority to state and
local communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will let us leverage and gain access to places we would
not normally happen to be,'' Seidenberg said. ``It is actually more
efficient for us and can help us reach more people.''

REGION IS HEADED FOR A SOFT LANDING, ECONOMISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Corrects headline)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight boisterous years of economic expansion that has brought
prosperity even to remote corners of northern New England now
appears headed for a soft landing. But the question remains when.
</P>
<P>
   Economists who are members of the New England Economic Project
on Thursday hedged their forecasts of a downturn, saying the
surprising strength of the current expansion has caused them to be
wrong in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major question for the Maine economy is when the slowdown
will come,'' said Charles Colgan, a University of Southern Maine
professor who took part in a project meeting in Needham.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by the success of financial companies such as MBNA Corp.,
Maine is experiencing stronger job growth this year than in 1998,
so strong, Colgan said, that a logging company has been unable to
fill positions in rural northern Aroostook County, where such a
problem is rarely seen.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Delay, economist for the Public Service Co. of New
Hampshire, characterized his state's economy as ``one of the
strongest in the country,'' with about 10,000 jobs added this year
alone.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, the boom has reached into the usually depressed
corner known as the Northeast Kingdom, and economic growth
statewide is more than 1.5 percent. ``It's tough to complain,''
said Jeffrey Carr of Economic and Policy Resources Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But the best may be over, the economists said. Job growth across
New England this year is expected to be 1.6 percent, down from 2.3
percent last year. Job creation next year is expected to slow to
less than 1 percent. Their projections for Massachusetts were
similar.
</P>
<P>
   As employers have made clear for several years, the downside of
the expansion is that much of New England is experiencing a labor
shortage that is driving up wages in the Massachusetts high-tech
sector.
</P>
<P>
   The economists said this labor shortfall is spreading to the
other states. Wages in New England rose more than 6 percent in the
first quarter, compared to the same period last year, while
national wages went up 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the economists said they are beginning to see
signs of a slowdown caused by increases in interest rates by the
Federal Reserve and the labor shortage. Consumer confidence has
also dropped this year in New England, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no recession in sight, they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Fed will be successful in engineering a soft
landing,'' said Alan Clayton-Matthews, a professor of political
economy at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But they warned that if the stock market should crash and
consumer demand plunge, the blow would be worst in Massachusetts,
which has become reliant on its booming financial industry and a
high-tech sector funded by initial public offerings and venture
capital.

BUCHANAN'S REFORM TOUR IS SNUBBED BY VENTURA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., S.C., Ill.)  (rk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ It is a different world for Pat Buchanan as he
works the political fringe, going forth as a makeover candidate
stumping somewhere between Republican pariah and Reform Party
swain.
</P>
<P>
   He had joked that retailoring his failed Republican presidential
candidacy for the Reform Party might occasion at least a body slam,
if not a blessing, from Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, the
wrestler-turned-Reform Party power broker. Instead, Buchanan's
requested courtesy call was snubbed Thursday as he passed by on his
new mission to storm the Reform ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thinks for one minute that he's going to step into my
party and automatically be crowned the candidate, he's sadly
mistaken,'' Ventura gruffly noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchfork brigade'' loyalists have been in evidence this week
as Buchanan has taken his venture on a five-state tour. More than
500 cheered him at a rally in a Detroit suburb on Tuesday night.
Two hundred fifty more ate barbecue in Piggie Park on Wednesday
night in West Columbia, S.C., delighted to hear the candidate
defend the Confederate flag, attack China as a persecutor of
Christians and rail against the two major parties with their
``Doublemint twin'' candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free at last!'' Buchanan exulted after finding out what it was
like to campaign as a non-Republican at a factory line in Gaffney,
S.C. But his initial stabs at third-party politicking have hardly
been free of baggage.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after he scrapped his lifelong calling to the
Republican Party, Buchanan was offered precious television time on
two networks. It was this sound biter's dream, the chance to boost
his Reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But the interviewers continued to focus on his controversial
attitude toward Hitler, not the North American Free Trade
Agreement. And they asked about his willingness to debate not
George W. Bush or Al Gore but Donald Trump, the profoundly
inexperienced but garrulous political outsider. Trump has been
denouncing Buchanan as an anti-Semitic ``wacko'' and has been
threatening to challenge him for the Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Buchanan, while hoping for a fresh stake as a mainline
presidential contender, finds himself having to fight off a descent
into a tabloid culture that has endlessly nurtured Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan would prefer to be grilled about his America First
presidential agenda. Instead he had to tell one interviewer about a
past call, carefully culled from the record, that Christianity must
be recognized as the moral foundation for American society. ``I
believe that Christianity is the true faith,'' Buchanan declared,
exasperated and defensive. ``I would like all folks to come to it,
but I believe America's Constitution forbids a religious test.''
</P>
<P>
   This may not be the stuff of vision, but it is an unavoidable
part of early sparring. ``We ought to be talking about where
America goes in the world,'' Buchanan complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fading lion,'' said Rich Williamson, the state
Republican chairman in Illinois who worked with Buchanan in the
Reagan White House. ``His problem is that after winning the New
Hampshire primary in '96 he actually thought he had a chance to be
president. Pat's never recovered; he doesn't know his time has come
and gone.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Buchanan, the intoxication of politics is in the crowd that
delighted him on Tuesday night in Warren, Mich. Afterward, he
recalled ``the fire'' of his cheering loyalists in New Hampshire in
1996 when he defeated the Republican front-runner, Bob Dole. ``I
thought, `This thing is on fire again,''' he enthused.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan stump speech featured signature red-meat lines
against government ``elites,'' heavily laced with dashes of
isolationism. ``Why don't we bring our soldiers home and protect
the borders of Texas?'' he asked, rousing the crowd at Piggie Park
in combining his call for a freeze on immigration and his
opposition to global commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat's a great American,'' said Maurice Bessinger, who arranged
the tangy fund-raiser in his West Columbia barbecue restaurant,
where the Christian pamphlets are next to the toothpicks. ``Pat's
fighting against giving up our sovereignty to one-world
government,'' Bessinger said in a typical comment on the Buchanan
trail.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate is avidly knocking the rust off his battle armor.
He is speech writing to a different drummer for his old Republican
pitchfork brigades, insisting they will penetrate the Reform
Party's arcane nominating process and secure him the nomination.
Talk of having to fight Trump or Ventura leaves Buchanan
complementing them in a generous tone as ``colorful gentlemen.''
But he flatly pronounces himself the instant front-runner for his
new political Grail.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of his party-switching, Buchanan visualizes not so
much winning the presidency as forcing his way into the debates of
the major party candidates. He plans to attract attention by
merrily storming the Reform line with his insurgents. The risk is
that he will become merely a leitmotif for the two major nominees
in moments of media boredom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I'll be at about 15 percent in the polls by July,''
insisted Buchanan, who had faded to single digits in the Republican
polls. ``Then there's no way to keep me out of the television
debates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, if I get in the debate, why then it's up to me and the
free media skills I have,'' he said with a cocky smile before being
interrupted by a tiny gray-haired woman who curtsied before him at
the Carolina barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My candidate!'' said the woman, Sarah Steagall,
secretary-treasurer of the Reform Party in South Carolina. She
offered a dumpling smile of endorsement, but a minute later
confided that the third-party field was not exactly closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on Donald Trump's mailing list, too,'' she noted, watching
Buchanan seek out the local television reporters. They were
recording his America First riffs but asking more about rivals
named Ventura and Trump, not Bush and Gore. ``Trump is sending me
pictures of himself,'' Ms. Steagall beamed on the fringe of things.
``Very expensive pictures. In color.''

SMALL FIRMS HIT HARDEST BY RISING COSTS OF HEALTH INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The rising cost of health insurance is hitting
small employers particularly hard, with premiums for the smallest
companies rising 9.2 percent last year, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said that this was only one of several ominous
trends in employer-based health insurance. ``The fact that we
really haven't seen any change in the percentage of employers
offering coverage during an all-time boom economy is cause for
worry,'' said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family
Foundation, the health research group that co-sponsored the survey
of 1,939 companies. ``This is as good as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of all small firms offered their employees health
insurance in 1999, a percentage that was statistically unchanged
from 1996, the survey found. Virtually all big employers _ defined
as those with 200 employees and more _ offered health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released at a news conference Thursday in Washington,
provides an annual snapshot of health insurance provided through
the workplace, which is how most Americans get their health
benefits. It showed that the managed care revolution has all but
overwhelmed conventional, fee-for-service coverage: Only 9 percent
of Americans with job-based coverage are enrolled in a traditional
plan, down from 73 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, 28 percent were enrolled in health maintenance
organizations and 38 percent were in preferred provider
organizations, the most popular type of health plan last year. In
contrast to HMOs, preferred provider organizations allow patients
to go beyond the plan's list of participating doctors, if they are
willing to pay more, and do not require patients to go through a
primary care gatekeeper to see a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to managed care is widely credited for having helped
control health care costs for several years, but the survey
confirmed that premium prices are beginning to rise again. Overall,
in the year ending in the spring of 1999, premiums for
employer-sponsored health coverage increased 4.8 percent, the
biggest jump since 1994. Researchers said that this was relatively
modest compared with the double-digit increases of a decade ago,
but still more than double the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Larry Levitt, a Kaiser analyst, ``The most
fragile part of the health care system is getting hardest hit.''
Companies employing three to nine workers reported the highest
increase in premiums: 9.2 percent. By comparison, companies with
more than 200 employees reported a 4.1 percent increase in premium
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Altman said, ``These increases will make it even harder for
small businesses to provide health insurance for their employees in
the future.'' Several researchers said that such strains in the
employer-based system help explain why policy-makers in Washington
are searching for alternative means of helping the uninsured. The
Census Bureau reported last month that 44.3 million people are
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also found that companies that fund their own health
insurance reported substantially lower premium increases than the
firms that bought it from insurance companies. Jon Gabel, one of
the researchers, traced this to ``catch-up pricing,'' with insurers
trying to restore their profitability after several years of
``underpricing'' to get a bigger share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Thursday was based on telephone interviews
with human resource and benefit administrators at a random sample
of companies and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3
percentage points. For several years the survey was conducted by
KPMG Peat Marwick, but it was turned over last year to the Health
Research and Educational Trust, a nonprofit research group, which
now conducts the survey with Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also asked employers about the ``patients' rights''
proposals being debated in Congress this year, and found that a
majority supported such measures as the right to external review,
when a health plan denies care, and even the right to sue. But
support was generally higher among small employers, particularly on
the right to sue, which was backed by 61 percent of small
employers, while more than half of the biggest firms opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-fourths of all employers said they were worried
that health care costs would rise faster than they could afford,
and 65 percent said they were ``somewhat'' or ``very'' worried that
they would have to switch health plans because of costs. By
contrast, only 26 percent said they were ``somewhat'' or ``very''
worried that they would have to switch because of concerns about
the quality of care.

   ELDORADO DOS CARAJAS, Brazil _ Three years ago, 19 landless farm
workers were killed in a confrontation with police at this bend in
a highway in the southeastern Amazon. More than 1,500 people
witnessed the Para state military police open fire, and the
incident was filmed and shown on Brazilian television hundreds of
times.
</P>
<P>
   But bringing those responsible for the deaths to justice is no
simple matter.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the trial ended with the acquittal of the
three commanders of the 147 police officers charged with the
murders of the peasants. That set off a furor that still
reverberates across Brazil and to human rights groups abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be that nobody was responsible,'' said Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, clearly puzzled and
frustrated, after the verdict was announced in August. ``Somebody
had to be.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the investigation has been hampered by the
evident defiance of local authorities. One police unit said it had
no idea which officers had which guns on the day of the killings,
another handed over a gun registry that had been tampered with, and
complete autopsies of the victims were conducted only as a result
of federal government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument of the police has been that they didn't shoot at
anyone, did not see anyone die, don't know how the victims were
killed and only gathered up the bodies,'' said Marcelo Freitas,
director of the Para Society for Human Rights and a lawyer who was
part of the prosecution team. ``They even claimed the landless
killed each other in order to be able to blame the police.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, autopsies indicate, the majority of the victims died
not in an exchange of gunfire, as police originally maintained, but
after they were taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Several were shot in the head or neck at close range, leaving
powder burns, while others were hacked to death with their own
machetes and sickles. One had no gunshot or knife wounds at all;
his head was smashed by a rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real massacre did not occur in the initial skirmish,''
said James Cavallaro, the Brazil representative of the
Washington-based group Human Rights Watch. ``It occurred later,
after the police had knocked people to the ground or handcuffed
them and dragged them away and summarily executed them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with foreign reporters, Brazil's minister
of agrarian reform, Raul Jungmann, acknowledged that state police
officers are often at the service of large landowners, ``who may
even kill in certain places where they are strong.'' Lawyers
representing the victims said that appears to be what happened
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have witnesses who heard the police asking `Where is so and
so,' so that they could take him away,'' said Carlos Guedes do
Amaral, a lawyer for the landless families here. ``To us, the fact
that the police had been ordered to remove the name tags from their
uniforms indicates that they went there with a clear intention to
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to prevent powerful local landowners from
interfering, the case was transferred to the state capital, Belem,
350 miles upriver, and a special prosecutor was appointed after a
local judge said she ``prayed every night that the policemen will
be absolved.'' But the seven-member jury included an accountant who
is now under investigation on charges that he offered $1,500 bribes
to other jurors if they would vote to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have filed an appeal and announced a postponement of
the trials of the remaining 147 officers until early next year,
after the commanders' situation is resolved. They have also
requested the suspension of the judge, citing irregularities in his
behavior during the trial and public remarks favorable to the
defendants made afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge's behavior was tendentious,'' Amaral said. ``He did
not ask pertinent questions that should have been asked, that under
our legal system only the judge, and not the prosecution, can ask,
and he phrased his charge to the jury improperly, in such a way to
induce an acquittal.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict has provoked fears of more intense outbursts of
violence in this Amazon frontier region. Farm workers have for
months been occupying other ranches in the area, including one
called Cabeceiras that is owned by the region's most powerful
family. The 600 families squatting there say they have been
threatened several times by gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is a license to kill the landless,'' said Jose
Batista Goncalves Afonso, local representative of the Pastoral Land
Commission, a Roman Catholic group that monitors rural property
conflicts. ``It says you cannot put a brake on the ability of
police and hired guns to take the law into their own hands, and it
gives judicial support to the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the massacre at Eldorado, on April 17, 1996, at least 38
other people have been killed in land conflicts in this area, the
church body calculates. Afonso said there had been nearly 700
tenancy-related killings committed in Para since the Amazon land
rush began in the 1960's, and of those, he said, only two cases
ever went to trial and only one resulted in a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   For the survivors of the Eldorado massacre, there has been some
restitution. To acknowledge its moral responsibility, the federal
government has compensated the survivors by giving them title to
the ranch that was the focal point of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   After the massacre, an investigation found that the owner of the
ranch had not paid his taxes for more than a decade, an omission
that allowed the government to seize the 42,000-acre property. Now,
690 formerly landless peasant families live and farm there on a
settlement called 17th of April.
</P>
<P>
   At the curve in the highway where the killings took place, a
museum and monument, in the form of 19 charred trunks of Brazil nut
trees, have been erected to honor the dead. But Francinete dos
Santos, the widow of Robson Vito Sobrinho, one victim, finds the
very sight distressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I pass by, I realize we could all be here, working
together,'' she said in an interview at her simple wooden house at
the settlement. ``But what can you do? You can only hope that
justice will still be done.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, Celso Feitosa, a neighbor, shook his head and chided
her. ``You know that in Brazil, there is justice only for those who
have money,'' he said. ``We want bread, but they give us nothing
but lead.''

EX-TEAMSTERS OFFICIAL IS ACCUSED OF GRAFT  
(DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   A board of federal monitors Thursday charged a top lieutenant of
Ron Carey, the former Teamsters Union president, with embezzling
more than $12,500 and with breaching his fiduciary duty to union
members.
</P>
<P>
   The board, called the Independent Review Board, asked the
union's president, James P. Hoffa, to pursue disciplinary
proceedings that could lead to a fine against the official, Joseph
A. Padellaro. Padellaro resigned from the union in May, so he
cannot be suspended or expelled.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Carey relied heavily on Padellaro to clean up locals
that had been placed into trusteeship because of corrupt
leadership. Padellaro was often called Carey's ``super-trustee,''
because he was trustee over nine different Teamsters locals.
</P>
<P>
   The review board accused Padellaro of repeated double-dipping,
specifically of having purchased airplane tickets that were paid
for by the parent union and then asking various locals to reimburse
him for the trips.
</P>
<P>
   Padellaro's attorney, James Roth, denied all the accusations. He
said he was waiting to see the board's exhibits, detailing the
reimbursements to Padellaro, before he commented further.

TOO MANY SURVEYS NETTLE HEAD OF DEPARTMENT

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I am trying to run my department, but I keep
getting questionnaires, surveys, and other interruptions from our
human resources department. I know they have a job to do, but they
do not seem to realize how busy we are. I have spoken to HR people
and to my own manager, but the interruptions continue. Any
suggestions? F.G. &QL; 
A. The irony in this situation is that your human resources
department is using surveys in part to measure satisfaction, and
one of the key sources of dissatisfaction is the quantity of
surveys in the first place. If you and your associates mentioned
this dissatisfaction in any of the surveys, and HR failed to
provide an adequate response, then it appears that your H.R.
department has clearly put forms over substance.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like your HR department is quite effective at
gathering data, but the real objective is to take that data and
implement some changes and improvements as a result. If that were
going on, the interruptions would more likely be viewed as
interventions that help improve the effectiveness of your
department and the organization itself.
</P>
<P>
   If there are other department managers who feel as you do, all
of you should meet with the HR leadership to discuss the situation.
Perhaps by increased communication, batching some of the surveys,
timing them more suitably for your departments, and providing you
with more feedback on the survey findings and follow-up actions,
there can be an understanding through which each department,
including human resources, will be better able to meet its
objectives. &QL; 
Q. After a very upsetting meeting with my boss, I walked out of his
office and muttered an expletive about him that no one was supposed
to hear. He heard it, wrote me up, and warned me that if I don't
change my ways, I'm out. I don't think it was fair to be punished
for something he was not supposed to hear. What do you think? R.E. &QL; 
A. Whether you muttered or uttered a nasty comment about your boss
makes no difference. The fact is that an audible expletive came
from your mouth and landed in his ears, and the rest is history.
There is no way for your boss to discern what he is and is not
supposed to hear from you. That is your responsibility. If you say
it and he hears it, you own it.
</P>
<P>
   Have you considered the possibility that, on a deeper level, you
may have unconsciously wanted him to hear your picturesque comment?
You were angry and frustrated, and this was a way to lash back at
him. It is even possible that you were so upset that you wanted him
to fire you.
</P>
<P>
   Your next step is actually to take a step back and look at the
extent to which you are satisfied with your overall work situation.
When a person becomes this upset at work, there typically is more
than a meeting involved. Your behavior may be a sign of significant
dissatisfaction, and perhaps you should think about whether this is
the right job, the right company, and even the right career path
for you.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, you should talk things over with your boss,
apologize for the comment, and try to put the relationship back on
speaking terms. &QL; 
Q. What should we do about managers who go to meetings and do not
bring complete information for the employees? The only way we get
information is through other people in the company. This seems
unethical and unprofessional to us. M.A. &QL; 
A. These types of meetings can certainly be described as unethical
and unprofessional, but they can also be described as unworkable,
unproductive, and ultimately unsuccessful. Although there can
occasionally be situations in which business or legal concerns can
limit the information provided in a meeting, that is the exception.
In fact, one of the true objectives of business meetings is to have
thorough and open communication.
</P>
<P>
   When employees are expected to somehow learn about plans,
changes, and developments from their co-workers, the good news is
that they will indeed gather vast amounts of information; however,
the bad news is that most of it will be inaccurate, incomplete, and
generally useless.
</P>
<P>
   Since management is not bringing complete information to the
employees in these meetings, it is time for the employees to bring
complete information to management. You and your associates should
advise management of the specific and measurable problems in
coordination, performance, and productivity that are being caused
by this lack of communication.
</P>
<P>
   If management continues to operate on the theory that half a
loaf is better than no loaf at all, it is safe to assume that many
aspects of management in this company are half-baked as well.

<P>
   Look at the people in front of you at the grocery check-out or
at the gas pump. Odds are they are swiping plastic through a
card-reading machine, cards that often are debit cards, not credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, banks are replacing simple ATM cards with debit
cards bearing the Visa or Mastercard logos, good not only for
getting cash, but for shopping wherever those cards are accepted,
with the money debited from the card holder's account.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, soon more people may carry debit cards than credit
cards, according to The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers show that consumers are embracing debit cards. Visa
reports an eightfold increase in cards issued, to 73.8 million last
year from 9.2 million in 1991, and a seventeenfold increase in
sales volume, to $134.7 billion from $7.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier Cassegrain, who recently moved to New York from Paris
and opened a branch of his family's leather goods store, Longchamp,
on Madison Avenue, used his debit card from Chase Manhattan for
everything he bought to set up the new store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfect,'' he said. The card provides the records a
business person needs. Unlike checks, it is readily accepted. And _
befitting a man who sells fine wallets _ ``it does not bulge in the
wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Gerri Detweiler, education adviser to Debt
Counselors of America and co-author of ``Slash Your Debt, Save
Money and Secure Your Future'' (The Financial Literacy Center,
1999), said she carries her debit card only when she goes to the
bank for cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing a debit card and having someone use it can be a real
hassle,'' she said. A thief could wipe out everything in your
checking account, leaving you without funds until the matter is
resolved. ``If you toss receipts at the register and don't read
your bank statements, don't use it,'' Ms. Detweiler advised.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, credit card holders are guaranteed much
stronger protection in case of loss, fraud or billing errors, she
noted, with damages limited to $50 if a loss is reported promptly.
</P>
<P>
   Debit card liability could also be $50 if the bank is notified
within two days of the loss or fraud being discovered. If
notification is later, however, the liability could be $500, and,
after 60 days, unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Visa and Mastercard pledge consumers stronger
protection on debit cards than the law requires _ Visa even pledges
zero liability _ so check a card issuer's policy.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, people who pay credit card bills on time enjoy an
interest-free loan until payment is due. Debit card charges are
taken from an account promptly.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, card holders who pay their entire bills on time will
be better off charging to their credit cards, while those who run
balances or miss payments, or simply like the ease of not having to
pay the bill, might be better off using debit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Say a card holder pays an annual fee of $85 for a credit card
that provides American Airlines frequent-flier miles and charges
$1,000 a month, always paying on time _ transferring money from a
savings account. In two years, the card holder earns enough miles
for a round-trip ticket worth perhaps $500 and has earned $25 to
$50 a year in interest _ a net gain of perhaps $400.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose the card holder pays the same $85 fee, charges only
$300 a month and misses three payment dates, incurring interest
charges at a 17.15 percent annual rate and a $29 late fee each
time. In two years that card holder has spent over $300 and has
fewer than one-third the miles needed for an plane ticket.
</P>
<P>
   This card holder would be better off with a no-fee,
lower-interest credit card and _ most of all _ the discipline to
pay on time, or a debit card.
</P>
<P>
   Either card is more secure than cash or checks, Ms. Detweiler
added. And a debit card may be the only one available to a person
with damaged credit or too new to the job market to have a credit
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Parents may also want to provide a debit card for a student away
in college, with the stipulation that it be used only in an
emergency. Similarly, some compulsive shoppers limit themselves to
debit cards.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Anthony N. McEwen, an executive vice
president at Visa USA, said people should carry both. ``We don't
see them as one versus the other,'' he said, ``but as complementary
products.''
</P>
<P>
   The one instance in which a customer may need a credit card, he
noted, is reserving a rental car. Only one debit card offers
frequent-flier miles: Chase has a Mastercard linked to Continental
Airlines. Beth Hirschhorn, a Chase senior vice president, reported
that people were opening Chase accounts just to get the card and
miles.

<P>
   DETROIT _ Judging by the models arriving in dealer showrooms
this fall, one might think that small car sales are booming and
profits from them are soaring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the opposite is true. The small car market has been in a
slump for nearly three years as cheap gasoline and stable car
prices have drawn buyers to larger vehicles, including sport
utilities. Profits from small cars are negligible to nonexistent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, auto manufacturers must churn out small, fuel-efficient
automobiles to help bring down their federally mandated corporate
fuel economy averages, which are being pulled higher by brisk sales
of big, gas-guzzling vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, small cars are aimed largely at young, often
first-time buyers, a group expected to grow to as much as a third
of the market by 2005, according to J.D. Power &AMP; Associates, the
market research company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the doldrums in the small-car market, the auto maker's
latest efforts to lure buyers to their much improved products have
been valiant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, DaimlerChrysler revamped its Neon for the 2000
model year, giving it a more grown-up look but maintaining its
fun-to-drive character. This fall Toyota introduced the Echo, an
unusual-looking small car with a price that starts around $10,000.
Saturn has spruced up its dated S-Series, and Nissan in the spring
will bring out a new Sentra, which is expected to be certified in
California as the world's first gasoline-powered ``super ultra low
emission'' vehicle. And Honda will revise the segment's
best-seller, the Civic, next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the most impressive small cars of recent years, however,
is a new entry from the Ford Motor Co., the Ford Focus. The Focus
melds edgy styling with a spacious interior and superb driving
dynamics, and the entire package is reasonably priced.
</P>
<P>
   After a month with four versions of the Focus _ the base and
mid-level sedans, the station wagon and the sporty, top-line sedan
_ I concluded that the car is well suited to buyers who want more
than basic transportation, but still want an entry-level price. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Focus, which began arriving in dealer showrooms on Oct. 1,
is intended to replace the Escort eventually, but for now that car
will stay around; the Focus is priced and sized between the Escort
and the compact Contour. It comes as a ZX3 hatchback, a wagon and a
sedan in three versions _ the base LX, the big-volume SE and the
sporty ZTS.
</P>
<P>
   The car sold in the United States is virtually identical to the
one introduced in Europe a year ago, which auto writers have
already voted European Car of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Mercury Cougar, the Focus is cloaked in a rather
extreme example of Ford's New Edge styling, which features crisp
lines and taut surfaces. The Focus won't be mistaken for anything
else on the roads. I found more people liked its look than hated
it, but few fell in between.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is unusually spacious for a small car, with a high
roofline that comfortably accommodates 6-footers. Rear legroom is
among the best in class. The very supportive seats are raised
higher than in most small cars, and entry and exit is easy through
tall, wide doors. If nearly 13 cubic feet of trunk space isn't
enough, one simply folds the split rear seats to add capacity.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone accustomed to the clean, generic interiors of small
Japanese cars, the Focus seems awfully busy, a puzzle of assorted
geometrical shapes. Still, the pieces fit snugly, and the interior
materials seemed to be of good quality. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The controls are large and easy to operate; the gauges use large
numbers, making them easy to read. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ford says it used human and electronic testers to insure a
pleasant new-car smell in the Focus, but I still detected the acrid
odor that comes from plastic parts that haven't cured long enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Focus has many conveniences, including a
tilting-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable
driver's seat, useful cup holders and a console with storage and a
pen holder.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its standard safety features include seatbelts with
pre-tensioners and load-limiting retractors to keep occupants in
position in a crash, child safety seat anchoring system and an
emergency release inside the trunk. Side air bags are optional at
$350; and anti-lock brakes, standard on the ZTS, cost $400 on other
models. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After their purchase, Focus buyers receive a welcome package in
the mail from Ford, part of a youth-oriented marketing campaign
that includes live television ads and Webcasts. The welcome items
include a watch, a picture frame that attaches to the dashboard, an
expandable mega-sized cup holder and a sunglass case.
</P>
<P>
   To further personalize the car, as young buyers often do, Ford
plans to sell several accessory packages: one for pet owners has a
color-coordinated water bowl, among other things; a Friends Package
has seat covers, a candy dispenser and an ice cooler. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I could do without the candy or the dog bowl, but the car's
driving dynamics would seal the deal.
</P>
<P>
   This tiny car is darn fun to drive. It reminded me of Ford's
sporty Puma, a wonderful little coupe sold overseas. In fact, it is
built from the same basic architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The Focus is available with two 2-liter four-cylinder engines,
either a 110-horsepower single-cam version or a 130-horsepower
dual-cam Zetec, which is standard on the GTS and ZX3. Transmission
choices are a five-speed manual or a new electronically controlled
four-speed automatic.
</P>
<P>
   The dual-cam engine puts the Focus in the league with the peppy
Dodge Neon and versions of the Civic that have a zippy Honda engine
with variable valve timing. It handily accelerated onto the freeway
even when carrying five adults.
</P>
<P>
   The base engine did not measure up so well, however, and it felt
especially sluggish in the heavier station wagon, where it is the
only engine available. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the engine or trim level, the Focus handles
crisply and responsively. The steering is precise and the brakes
feel sturdy. The ride is comfortable for a car of this size, though
road noise is excessive, especially in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   The Focus hatchback starts at $12,280, sedans at $12,540 and the
wagon at $15,795. The prices seemed attractive when they was
announced last spring, but Toyota upstaged Ford by putting a
sticker of $9,995 on the Echo hatchback.
</P>
<P>
   With its edgy styling, ample people and cargo space, great
handling and numerous features, the Focus makes a big impression.
It is a lot of small car for the money.

A CLEARER VIEW OF THE ECONOMY AS THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ANSWERS
ITS CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With millions of Americans enjoying today's prosperity, some
experts have complained that the government's methods for measuring
the economy have failed to capture its true strength and dynamism.
Now the Commerce Department has responded with confirmation that
the critics were at least partly right.
</P>
<P>
   But the revised numbers on the economy's performance in recent
decades, published Thursday, still fall short of the prosperity
achieved in earlier booms since World War II. The ``New Economy''
that many proclaim is still a vision rather than a reality.
</P>
<P>
   True, the economy has grown faster in the 1990s than federal
statistics had acknowledged. Spending is stronger, investment is
greater, productivity is higher, inflation is a little lower. It
all adds up to an economy that produced an estimated $8.76 trillion
worth of goods and services last year, according to the revised
statistics, or $248 billion more than under the old method of
calculating economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But it stopped short of recording the breakthrough to the
promised land of a new economy _ one in which high technology is
bringing about a transformation that makes the economy capable of
productivity advances reminiscent of the golden era of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth is a couple of tenths of a percentage point higher,
particularly in recent years, but there is no change in long-term
trends,'' said Steven Landefeld, director of the Commerce
Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, the bookkeeping agency
that published the revision of the statistics all the way back to
1959.
</P>
<P>
   It is not simply that pockets of overlooked production have been
belatedly discovered and incorporated into the gross domestic
product. There was some of that but, more importantly, the
government has provided a clearer view of the economy's performance
by giving much more credit than in the past to computer software
and banking improvements. Moreover, downward revisions in the
consumer price index _ already present in the unrevised data since
1995 _ have been applie back to 1959, a process that raised the
economy's inflation-adjusted ``real'' growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   And illogical bookkeeping has been fixed. The personal savings
rate, for example, has been raised to 3.7 percent of income in 1998
from nearly zero by listing federal contributions to the pensions
of government workers as savings rather than payments to social
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does not change the trend in savings, which has been
steadily downward,'' Landefeld said.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the revision has been to capture in the numbers
what the federal statisticians believe to be the true strengths and
characteristics of a modern economy. ``The economy is still the
same as it was before, but computer software and also banking are
playing much larger roles, and with this revision we are measuring
their contributions more accurately,'' said Brent Moulton, an
associate commissioner of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Economists on Wall Street found the revisions pleasing. ``They
show us that the economy has been growing somewhat faster than we
had thought and inflation is slightly lower, and that revised mix
is exactly what you like to see,'' said Richard D. Rippe, chief
economist for Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing jumps out of the bureau's sharper focus on the economy
with greater force than computer software, which accounted for
nearly two-thirds of all the revisions. Every expert sensed that
software and the computers in which software is installed had
enhanced the nation's productivity, making the sort of contribution
that the spread of the automobile did in the 1920s. But until
Thursday, the Bureau had not quantified that improvement or raised
the growth rate of the economy as a whole to account for software's
rising contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the crux of the ``New Economy'' argument. The rapidly
advancing electronic and information technologies, so dependent on
software, are viewed by this camp of economists and forecasters as
transforming the way Americans do business. As a result, they are
generating a breakthrough in economic growth that should be
sustainable for years.
</P>
<P>
   By this reasoning the stock market is not particularly
overvalued; the rising productivity of American workers helps to
justify high stock prices. And the inflation rate is lower than the
bureau has incorporated in its statistics. That would raise the
``real,'' inflation-adjusted value of all the goods and services
included in gross domestic product beyond the bureau's revisions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's fresh look failed to endorse this rosy perspective.
Even in the strongest period of the current expansion _ the last
four years through the third quarter of 1999 _ the GDP rose at an
average annual rate of 4.1 percent, up 0.4 of a percentage point
from the earlier figures. But there were similar spurts of even
stronger growth in the 1970s, 1980s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   And the comparison is flawed. Most economists gauge an economy
by comparing not just expansions but entire business cycles, with
each cycle including a recession as well as an expansion. By that
measure, the American economy in the 1990s has grown at an annual
rate of nearly 3 percent, up 0.5 of a percentage point after the
revision. But nearly 3 percent turns out to be no stronger than the
1970s and 1980s and significantly weaker than the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '60s were unprecedented and they still are,'' said David
Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a data gathering
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But the revisions do suggest that the long expansion of the
1990s, with its combination of healthy growth and low inflation,
could continue for a while. And while the overall growth rates for
the last three decades are similar, the latest data show that more
of the economy's growth in the 1990s was generated by improvements
in output per person rather than simply by putting more people to
work, while the reverse was the case in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the Federal Reserve and most economists believed
that the economy could grow over the long term at no more than 2.5
percent without suffering from shortages and inflation. Now the
upper limit appears to be 3 percent or a bit higher, says Robert M.
Solow, the Nobel laureate in economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   That is roughly the rate of growth since 1990. Implicit in this
new higher growth rate is an upward adjustment in the productivity
growth rate. Productivity measures the value of what a worker
produces in goods or services during an hour on the job.
</P>
<P>
   When that output rises, partly because of advances in
technology, so does the productivity growth rate. That rate had
advanced at a robust annual average of 2.8 percent from 1947 until
1973. And then for reasons never fully understood, the average
plunged to 1 percent or so for nearly 25 years. There has been a
partial rebound since 1995, and the revisions suggest that the
average has lately been roughly 2 percent, or even a bit more.
Complete productivity data, however, will not be available until
the Labor Department incorporates the higher output in its own
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The productivity slowdown remains in place, it is just less
than it was, as these revisions suggest, for which we should be
grateful,'' said Jeffrey Madrick, an author who has written
extensively on productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Solow agrees. ``When productivity grows at 1 percent a year it
takes 72 years for the standard of living to double,'' he said.
``At 2 percent, it takes just 36 years. It is possible that we are
at that level now, although I will not take that to the bank until
the 2 percent survives the next recession.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Commerce Department's new approach, software purchased by
business, previously listed as an expense, becomes an investment,
retroactive to 1959. The difference is considerable. A $100
software purchase counted the old way as an expense was included in
the value of the final product sold by the company, like the steel
that goes into a car. But that same $100 worth of software,
properly counted, should be added directly to GDP, the bureau
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Software is now classified like computers _ as a long-lasting
investment capable of generating revenue for a company. And indeed
software helps to generate such things as greater revenue from
telephone tolls and improved results from an automated, more
efficient assembly line. The $100 value, once added to GDP, is
subtracted or depreciated only gradually, over the three to five
years considered to be the life of a piece of software.
</P>
<P>
   Banking is the other big change. Its contribution to GDP had
been measured indirectly, by computing the number of hours worked
by the nation's bank employees and inferring a dollar amount. But
as new technology has spread through banking and hours have
declined, banking activity and revenue have risen. The new
yardstick is transactions: the number of checks cleared, the number
of ATM transactions, the number of loans made.
</P>
<P>
   The conceptual changes also coincided with various revisions
that pop up every few years when more complete data on such things
as wages, retail sales, consumption, profits and investment becomes
available as a supplement to the surveys used to determine the
quarterly growth numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing here, apart from conceptual changes,'' said
Martin Baily, chairman of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers, ``is a stronger economy than we had thought because of
improved data collection.''

FORMER SURGEON GENERAL CRITICIZED FOR FINANCIAL TIES TO LATEX
MANUFACTURER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Md., Ga.)   By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1997, Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon
general, made a telephone call to Dr. Linda Rosenstock, director of
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The
agency was about to warn health workers that latex gloves widely
used in hospitals could cause serious, even life-threatening
allergic reactions. Koop told her that the language of the warning
was ``way overstated'' and could cause health workers to abandon
gloves that could protect them against infection, Rosenstock said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose again this year when Koop testified in the House
on March 25 before the oversight and investigations subcommittee of
the Committee on Education and the Work Force. Koop told the panel
that the hazards being linked to the gloves by scientists and other
health authorities were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borderline hysteria,'' he called them.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a spokeswoman for Koop, Mary Beth Zupa, acknowledges
that Koop had received substantial sums of money under a four-year,
$1 million contract he signed in 1994 with a leading manufacturer
of the latex gloves, a relationship he did not disclose to
Rosenstock or the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Koop was not required to have registered as a paid lobbyist for
the company since he was not under contract with the glove
manufacturer when he made the call to Rosenstock at NIOSH or
testified before the subcommittee, which is headed by Rep. Charlie
Norwood, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   When told of Koop's contract with the glove manufacturer, John
Stone, the press secretary for Norwood, said, ``This is the kind of
thing he is adamant about at hearings on all issues. He always
wants to know if there have been financial arrangements with
parties interested in matters under discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop repeatedly declined to discuss the matter, but Ms. Zupa
said he had done nothing improper. His contract with the glove
maker, WRP Corp., did not last the full four years and had nothing
to do with its latex division, she said, adding that it never
occurred to Koop to make such disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   NIOSH issued its warning anyway. But ethicists and public
interest groups say that although he was not required to do so by
law, Koop had an obligation to disclose his financial ties to
NIOSH, to the Congress and to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this long admired and respected man has done in taking
money from a glove manufacturer and then speaking out on its behalf
is wrong,'' said Susan Wilburn, senior specialist in occupational
safety and health for the American Nurses Association. ``But worse,
he has given very powerful help to an industry whose product is
harming health workers and patients.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``People harmed through use of the gloves, and their
loved ones, wouldn't call the concern `hysterical.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilburn said an estimated 200,000 nurses had developed
allergies, and NIOSH studies show that 10 percent of health-care
workers regularly exposed to the gloves and 17 percent with heavy
exposure have developed allergies. Nearly 10 million Americans are
employed as health workers but little data exists on their rates of
exposure to the gloves. More than 300 lawsuits have been filed by
health workers and patients who say they have been harmed. Also,
some of the nation's leading hospitals, including the Mayo Clinic
and Johns Hopkins, have begun replacing powdered latex gloves with
alternatives. Hospital officials say these gloves work as well as
the powdered latex gloves and are well accepted by hospital
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Koop has long been one of the nation's most trusted health
experts, a reputation he gained as surgeon general in the 1980s in
battling the tobacco industry and focusing a reluctant nation on
the seriousness of AIDS, among other efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But critics have found fault with steps that Koop and his
business associates took to profit from his name and reputation,
including establishing financial ties to companies whose products
and services were described on a Web site he established,
dr.koop.com, which is designed to present objective health
information. (Modifications were subsequently made on the site in
response to the criticism.)
</P>
<P>
   The critics say the glove contract is more troubling because it
involves public policy and public health.
</P>
<P>
   According to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the glove company contract called for Koop to deliver
four speeches a year on health and nutrition. He gave the company
the right to use his ``name, picture, speeches and biographical
information'' and agreed to serve as a company adviser. He also
agreed not to endorse products of competitors, and to submit his
speeches for editing as long as the company did ``not change the
substance'' of the text. The contract also entitled Koop to a
five-year option to buy 500,000 shares of company stock at a 1994
price, and a percentage of the net sales of nutrition products, a
new line the company was entering.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zupa, said that Koop did not receive the full $1 million
called for in the contract, but she would not say how much he did
receive. However, a footnote to a WRP corporate filing with the SEC
refers to an unnamed ``individual'' who served as a ``spokesman for
the company'' and received $656,250 in consulting fees, through
February 1997. A representative of the company confirmed that the
individual was Koop.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Lewis, a lawyer for a group called Healthcare Without
Harm, formed, Lewis said, to monitor health and safety in the
medical field, said that Koop's activity on the glove issue, and
particularly his testimony in Congress, had been influential.
``Would even Dr. Koop have sounded so convincing,'' Lewis asked,
``if he had disclosed his financial deal with the glove company?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Koop's testimony in March was still being cited in
state legislatures as reasons to delay action on the gloves, even
though ``it was based on a study that was never done.'' Koop had
told Congress that he based his conclusions _ that concern about
the gloves was unwarranted _ on a study by the Centers for Disease
Control. But the agency said later that it had not made such a
study.
</P>
<P>
   The report Koop referred to was paid for, it turned out, by
another glove maker, Allegiance Healthcare Corp., the author of the
study said in a court deposition. Koop said in an interview last
month that he had been misled about the report's origin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zupa said Koop became involved with WRP because of an
interest ``in increasing the efficacy of vitamins for health care
for some time.'' She said he never received any royalties on net
nutrition sales because there were none, something confirmed in the
company's 1997 10K filings with the SEC. As a result, the company
declared it was concentrating on latex gloves.
</P>
<P>
   According to SEC documents, the company's board had already
decided that the company should get out of the nutrition business.
``That means,'' Lewis said, ``that for a year and a half after the
company lost any interest in promoting its nutrition products, Koop
was still its consultant _ and it would be hard for him not to know
what business they were in.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstock of NIOSH said that Koop telephoned her as her agency
was preparing its bulletin on the potential dangers of exposure to
rubber latex gloves containing protein and powdered corn starch.
The powder is meant to make it easier to get the gloves on and off,
but allergists say that when it mixes with the protein in the
gloves it can cause severe allergic reactions leading on rare
occasions to anaphylactic shock and, in five known cases, death,
Rosenstock said. If the powder from the gloves is dispersed in the
air, it can even affect people who have not worn the gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstock, whose agency is a research division of the CDC, said
Koop told her he had seen a draft of the NIOSH bulletin. She said
his view was that it would ``cause more harm than good'' because it
might frighten hospital workers out of using gloves that protect
them in handling infectious materials, Rosenstock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assured him that we had sent the bulletin out for peer
review and I was confident that it was well based scientifically,''
she said, and in the end, the agency issued the bulletin, including
language in the final version that Koop objected to.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin suggested that health workers use nonlatex gloves
for activities not involving infectious materials and that if they
chose latex gloves for handling infectious materials, they use
``the powder-free kind with reduced protein content.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration and a number of scientists,
including members of the American Academy of Allergies, Asthma and
Immunology, all have taken the same basic position.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Krimsky, a professor in urban and environmental policy
at Tufts University who has written extensively in science journals
on disclosure issues, said of Koop's role in the glove issue,
``anyone who attempts in a public forum to influence public policy
has an absolute obligation to disclose any financial interests he
has or has had within a time frame that could be perceived to
represent a bias _ and it certainly did in the Koop cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, a physician and director of Public
Citizen's Health Research Group, which sought unsuccessfully in
1988 to have the powdered-gloves banned from all hospitals, said,
``The whole issue with these gloves is a no brainer: Powdered
gloves are causing serious problems. They're causing hospitals to
lose workers who become disabled and there are perfectly good
alternatives to that type of glove _ and Koop has absolutely no
scientific basis for the position he has taken.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism, an OSHA spokeswoman said that the
current warnings seemed to be sufficient but that the agency was
considering whether to take active enforcement action.

   Greenspan upneat about U.S. economy
</P>
<P>
   By Jeff Ostrowski
</P>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
market-driven rising interest rates are likely to keep the economy
on a sustainable, non-inflationary path, and that U.S. productivity
gains are genuine and lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments Thursday night to an audience of business
executives at the Boca Raton Resort &AMP; Club _ hours after the
government reported the economy expanded in the third quarter at
the fastest pace this year without triggering higher inflation _
suggest the central bank chief isn't itching to raise the overnight
bank lending rate a third time this year when the Fed meets Nov.
16.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of containment may already be significantly
advanced,'' Greenspan said in a speech to the Business Council,
made up of the chief executives of the nation's top companies.
</P>
<P>
   A rise in real, or inflation-adjusted borrowing costs for
businesses, home buyers and consumers should slow growth and keep
the economy from overheating, Greenspan suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy has benefited in recent years from a
significant upturn in the growth of productivity, which has helped
keep inflation under control, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan warned the Fed must be particularly alert to any
signs that productivity gains are faltering and be ready to contain
inflationary forces that could derail America's long period of
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan did not directly address whether the central bank is
preparing to raise interest rates. But he left no doubt that Fed
officials are on heightened alert.
</P>
<P>
   He said the extra vigilance is needed in part because the U.S.
economy is in uncharted waters with productivity _ the amount of
output for each hour of work _ accelerating in recent years after
two decades of lagging gains.
</P>
<P>
   HEADLINE HERE
</P>
<P>
   Private economists said Greenspan gave no clear signal in his
remarks about what the central bank might do next.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. prosperity has been produced by ``a major acceleration in
productivity'' spurred by technological developments such as the
Internet, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses can get more information faster and make decisions
more quickly, enabling companies ``to remove large swaths of
inventory safety stocks and worker redundancies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a ``virtuous cycle,'' Greenspan said, in which ``a
whole new set of profitable investments raises productivity, which
for a time raises profits _ spurring further investment and
consumption. At the same time, faster productivity growth keeps a
lid on costs and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Other than his seeming reluctance to tinker with interest rates
_ no guarantees, of course _ Greenspan was even more low-key than
usual during his speech.
</P>
<P>
   No mention of ``irrational exuberance,'' nor even of the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan stuck to his theme _ technology's effects on the
economy. He credited technology for creating what he called ``this
period of extraordinary innovation and progress in the American
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he warned, the boom likely will slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of growth of productivity cannot continue to increase
indefinitely,'' Greenspan said. ``At some point it must at least
plateau.''
</P>
<P>
   If productivity slows, and if low unemployment boosts wages,
inflation could be the result, he said. Greenspan's favorite
anti-inflation weapon: higher interest rates. But he didn't say the
hated word ``inflation,'' instead couching the concept in less
direct terms.
</P>
<P>
   HEADLINE HERE
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan read from an 11-page speech for a half-hour. He never
gesticulated and only occasionally glanced up from the lectern to
look at his audience.
</P>
<P>
   He earned one subdued chuckle with this comment to a crowd of
200 heavy with national media: ``I do not perceive the end of the
shopping mall, if for no other reason than I have been strongly
advised that shopping is not solely an economic phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Business Council's clout is illustrated by Greenspan's
decision to show up in person. In the past year, Greenspan has
talked to two other groups in Boca Raton _ the Securities Industry
Association last November and the Futures Industry Association in
March _ but both times he appeared by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan isn't paid for his speeches. The Fed pays for the
economy's most powerful man to fly coach to speaking engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Two more household names _ Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and
Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley _ are scheduled to
address the CEOs today in Boca Raton.

AETNA SAYS IT IS UNDER SEC REVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Inc., the nation's biggest health insurer, said Thursday
that the Securities and Exchange Commission had recently started a
review of the way the company accounted for its purchase in August
of the money-losing Prucare unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America. That deal made Aetna the industry leader with more than 20
million customers, including 1.2 million in New York and nearby
counties.
</P>
<P>
   The review was the latest in a barrage of actions that have
jolted investors, battering Aetna and other big managed-care
companies. They include at least four class-action lawsuits, a new
law in California and a similar measure passed by the House of
Representatives that would open HMOs to malpractice lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the eventual outcome in Congress and the courts,
the suits, including a class-action suit brought Thursday against
Aetna in San Diego, are creating ``a cloud over these companies,''
said James Lane, a health care analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna shares dropped $2.6875 Thursday, or 5 percent, to $48.50
on the New York Stock Exchange, less than half their value a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Huber, the chief executive of Aetna, which is based in
Hartford, Conn., said that he was ``upset, puzzled, frustrated'' by
the reaction to the class-action suits against Aetna and other
managed-care companies. ``The bark of the wolf was sufficient to
vaporize $10 billion'' in managed-care stock values, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in operating
earnings'' for Aetna, Huber said. ``We wish the stock reflected
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arun Kumar, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said that as
``the largest company in managed care, Aetna tends to attract the
most controversy and attention. It is hard to tell if it is
justified,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the SEC review raised the possibility, by no
means certain, that Aetna would have to restate earnings. It could
affect 28 cents a share of after-tax income from Prudential
Insurance Co. in the three months ended Sept. 30, which Aetna
booked as service fees and ``reinsurance'' to make up for
continuing Prucare losses.
</P>
<P>
   Such a change could erase almost all of the gain in earnings
before nonrecurring items for the quarter that Aetna reported
Thursday. Some analysts said that Aetna should have subtracted the
projected payments by Prudential from the purchase price, which
Aetna announced as $1 billion, instead of booking the payments as
income.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said its accounting was ``appropriate'' and had been
``thoroughly reviewed and supported'' by its outside auditors,
KPMG.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Weber, Aetna's chief financial officer, said the SEC was
conducting an accounting review of Aetna's public filings for the
last three years, a time when the company made a spectacular series
of deals. Aetna sold its property and casualty and life insurance
units and bought U.S. Healthcare; NYLcare, from New York Life
Insurance Co., and Prucare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a review, not an investigation,'' he said. ``We generally
get reviewed every three years. We haven't been reviewed since
1996.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goelzer, a lawyer with Baker &AMP; McKenzie in Washington who is
a former SEC general counsel, said that as a general rule, if the
agency ``determined that a company's financial statements or
results had been materially off, then that company would have to
restate'' earnings results for those periods.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Oberdorf, an Aetna spokeswoman, said the company ``did not
wish to speculate'' on the outcome of the SEC review.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be wait and see,'' said Roberta Goodman, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph France, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said
investors should not be concerned because ``all of this accounting
has been known about for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has examined dozens of mergers and acquisitions this
year, taking up a variety of accounting concerns. Complaints were
issued last month against 15 public companies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday about Aetna, an SEC official said: ``The
commission is unable to discuss whether it is looking at any
particular company.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna told analysts it had improved its results by raising
premiums more than 10 percent for next year and closing
unprofitable Medicare health maintenance organizations in six
states earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that net income in the third quarter was $165.3
million, or $1.09 a diluted share, down from $212.4 million, or
$1.36 a share, in the period a year earlier, reflecting capital
losses, primarily on the sale of its Canadian business.
</P>
<P>
   Operating earnings were $193.1 million, or $1.27 a diluted
share, compared with operating earnings of $152.2 million, or 96
cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts had expected
Aetna to earn $1.16 a share for the quarter, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Health care operating earnings were $140 million, up from $100
million in 1998, but margins for Aetna U.S. Healthcare, excluding
Prudential, were down slightly on both Medicare HMOs and commercial
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   In other units, operating earnings overseas were $44 million, up
from $39 million, reflecting favorable tax rulings in Malaysia.
Operating earnings for financial services declined to $56 million,
from $65 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Huber said the company had bought back more than 4 million Aetna
shares this year.

 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Thursday narrowly passed the last
spending bill of the year, an $85 billion measure for labor, health
and education programs, containing an 0.97 percent across-the-board
cut in federal spending. The cut would create on paper a budget
that did not tap into Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he will veto the bill, setting the
stage for the final act in this year's budget battle: negotiations
between the White House and Congress that will go into high gear
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the budget plan preserved Social Security money
only as the result of ``smoke and mirrors'' _ creative accounting
by Republican lawmakers _ that had ``totally bumfuzzled'' American
voters.
</P>
<P>
   He was supported in that argument by the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office, which said Thursday that the
Republicans were $17 billion over their spending limits and into
Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered to compromise with the Republicans. ``I'm
prepared to work with them,'' he said at a news conference with
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. ``I don't want a partisan
fight on this. This is crazy for us to be having a big partisan
blowout'' over the Social Security issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans remain wary, having been bested by Clinton in budget
battles before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our numbers are not that far apart,'' said Rep. C.W. Bill
Young, R-Fla., the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.
``We are far apart on the political rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This was a rare understatement on a day marked by furious
speeches and duels fought with numbers on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Halloween and the Democrats are up to their old tricks,''
said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, who argued that the Republicans
had ``just won the first battle of this war'' with Clinton by
writing a budget that ``protects every penny of the Social Security
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   A jazz quartet played ``Pennies From Heaven'' as the Republicans
gathered on the Capitol's lawn to celebrate passage of the bill, by
a vote of 218-211, in which four fiscally conservative Democrats
voted for the bill. The four were Reps. Frank Lucas of Kentucky,
Pat Danner of Missouri, Virgil Goode of Virginia and Adam Smith of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Republicans defected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we've stopped the raid on Social
Security,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will take up the bill financing the departments of
Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, along with the
across-the-board cut, as early as Friday. The spending bill
contains $314 billion, of which $85 billion is discretionary
spending and $229 billion is mandatory funds that are required by
law. It also includes 316 earmarks, pet projects backed by
individual Republican lawmakers, totaling at least $360 million.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans contend that their across-the-board cut in all
13 spending bills that finance the operations of all federal
agencies but not mandatory programs like Medicaid and welfare will
save about $5.7 billion. That, they say, will create a budget that
will not tap surplus Social Security revenues to operate government
agencies _ which would be the first time that has happened in four
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the CBO said in a new analysis Thursday that this was not
true.
</P>
<P>
   It said the Republican-written spending bills exceed lawmakers'
self-imposed spending limits by about $17 billion and will drain
that much money from surplus Social Security revenues. It cited
$17.7 billion in spending outlays that the Republican leadership
has instructed the CBO to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   This technique, called directed scorekeeping, allows the
Republicans to argue that their across-the-board cut will result in
a small surplus in general government revenues and leave the Social
Security funds untouched.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative to the across-the-board cuts, Clinton has
proposed either raising revenue with a tobacco tax, finding
spending cuts in government programs or realizing savings from
unspent government funds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Republicans' spending bills also include $18.6 billion in
outlays that the leadership has designated as unanticipated
``emergency spending,'' which technically does not count against
the spending limits that Congress imposed on itself. These include
programs like the 2000 census, which by law must be conducted ever
10 years, and a 25-year-old program to help poor people pay their
heating bills in winter.
</P>
<P>
   They also rely on about $2.3 billion in outlays taken from the
budget for fiscal 2001, and two payments that will be delayed until
that year _ $3.3 billion in research grants at the National
Institutes of Health and $1.3 billion due Pentagon contractors.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the appearance of a balanced budget relies on at least
$43 billion in creative accounting by the Republicans, according to
an analysis of the 13 spending bills and the CBO report. It would
require an across-the-board cut of 4.8 percent to bring the budget
into balance without using Social Security funds, the congressional
auditors say.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans adamantly deny that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've now proved that you can fund the government without
raiding Social Security,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are running ``a disinformation campaign'' by
emphasizing the CBO numbers, said Rep. John Edward Porter, a
moderate Republican from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., said the CBO analysis proved that
``there are lies, darn lies, and statisticians.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said the CBO analysis
``repudiates the Republicans' false claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, John Spratt
of South Carolina, called the Republicans' accounting ``too clever
by half'' and compared their arguments to ``a medieval trial.''
</P>
<P>
   And the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, David
Obey of Wisconsin, called the Republican spending claims ``a magic
show designed to put on a phony debate about Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security issue has been used by both parties as a
lightning rod, with both sides claiming that their spending
strategies will protect retirees in years to come. But independent
budget analysts say the spending of surplus Social Security
revenues has no effect on the solvency of the retirement fund. But
the surplus funds can be used to pay down the federal debt, which
now stands at $3.6 trillion, a strategy increasingly favored across
the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   In this increasingly cranky Congress, with each party all but
calling the other liars, the bitterness spilled over to the Senate,
where Democrats are frustrated by Republican control of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the biggest legislative graveyard since I've
come to Congress,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. He
also said Senate Democrats would start running television ads
countering commercials made by House Republicans that ``will deal
with Social Security _ what the real facts are.''
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate also passed the month's third continuing
resolution, which keeps government agencies running in the absence
of a real budget until Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Although fiscal 2000 began Oct. 1, the budget battle will
continue.

ANDREYCHUK POWERS BRUINS PAST LIGHTNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Bruins went winless in their first nine games
(0-5-4) to tie for the longest winless start in franchise history,
the tension around the club was so thick you could cut it with a
knife. But coach Pat Burns remained upbeat through all the
hand-wringing and predicted his club's fortunes would turn around.
</P>
<P>
   In its last four contests, starting with a tie in Los Angeles in
the last game of that winless stretch, Boston is 3-0-1, including a
wild 7-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning at the FleetCenter
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Andreychuk had four goals as Boston generated more than
twice the offense of any other game this season and continued to
creep back toward .500 (3-5-4).
</P>
<P>
   In the first 11:31 of the first period, the Bruins jumped out to
a 4-0 lead. Boston took full advantage of Tampa Bay's penalty
trouble, scoring three goals on the power play, with Andreychuk
picking up his sixth and seventh of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk's first came at 4:16 after defenseman Ben Clymer,
originally a Bruins draft pick, was whistled for tripping.
Defenseman Ray Bourque, at the right point, backhanded a pass to
defenseman Darren Van Impe at the left. Van Impe teed up a shot
that was blocked by Tampa defenseman Ian Herbers, but the puck
squirted right to Andreychuk in the slot, and the left wing rifled
a shot past goalie Daren Puppa.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Clymer was nailed again on another tripping
call, leading to the Bruins' second goal. Jason Allison, positioned
along the left-wing boards, dished a pass to Van Impe at the left
point. Van Impe set up Bourque for the one-timer, and the puck
appeared to glance off a Tampa defender and high into the net for
the 2-0 lead at 9:54. It was Bourque's third goal of the year, and
Allison extended his assist streak to six games.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's next two goals came only 22 seconds apart. During the
power play, Allison skated around behind the net and came out near
the left post, trying to bury the puck through Puppa's pads. It
bounced off one of them and right to Andreychuk, who beat Puppa top
shelf with a backhander at 11:09.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning coach Steve Ludzig had seen enough and pulled Puppa
(eight shots, three goals) in favor of Kevin Hodson. But he didn't
fare well in the early going, surendering a goal on the first shot
he faced.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:31, with the teams back at even strength, Joe Thornton
drove down the right side, beating defenseman Andrei Zyuzin, and
flung the puck at the net. The puck went through the crease,
bounced off a Tampa player, and went into the net for the 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning rallied for the next three goals. During a
three-on-two rush, left wing Andreas Johansson took a pass from
Robert Petrovicky and beat goalie Rob Tallas to the glove side at
17:44.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:43 of the second, center Vincent Lecavalier beat Tallas
with a backhand shovel shot, pulling the Lightning to within 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa made it even tighter at 13:52 when right wing Stan Drulia
scored. Center Chris Gratton had centered pass that travelled
through the crease and pinballed around. Tallas appeared to have
corralled it, but Drulia jabbed it free and into the cage.
</P>
<P>
   Only 21 seconds later, though, Andreychuk completed his 11th
career hat trick to give Boston some breathing room. Allison beat
defenseman Bill Houlder down low in the left corner and relayed the
puck right to Andreychuk in front. He buried his shot, and the
Bruins were up, 5-3, at 14:13.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, Ludzik opted to put Puppa back into the game
for the third period. The Bruins took advantage of that and scored
a pair of goals 1:18 apart to surge ahead, 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk potted his fourth of the game and ninth of the season
at 6:19, giving him his third career four-goal contest. He also has
a five-goal game, coincidentally against the Bruins, in an 8-6 win
by the Buffalo Sabres Feb. 6, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Heinze completed the scoring with his third goal of the
year, scoring at 7:37 when his slapper from the right point hit a
Lightning stick and changed direction, fooling Puppa.

`PUNITIVE DAMAGE': IF THE KILLING IS OVER WITH, IT'S TOO LATE FOR
ONE STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   East Timor won its independence from Indonesia a couple of
months ago. You probably heard. President Suharto had already been
gone for more than a year. Indonesia's new president has now
appointed a ``national unity Cabinet,'' and the security council
has just created a United Nations mission to govern East Timor for
now. The killing and the destruction that began when Indonesia
annexed East Timor in 1975 may finally be over.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't be better _ or worse _ for ``Punitive
Damage,'' Annie Goldson's worthy documentary about a Malaysian
college student who died in East Timor for his cause.
</P>
<P>
   You see a lot of Helen Todd in ``Punitive Damage.'' A New
Zealander who has lived in Malaysia since the 1960s, Ms. Todd is
the mother of the film's subject, Kamal Bamadhaj. ``My worst
nightmare,'' she says early in the film, remembering his departure
for that final trip, ``was that he would end up in jail.'' He was
``the most cool and calm'' and logical young man, she recalls, and
she believed he could handle anything he encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Kamal (everyone in the film seems to call him, affectionately,
by his first name) was 20 and a student at New South Wales
University in Australia when he went to East Timor in 1991. It was
his second visit, and he was there on a political errand.
</P>
<P>
   He became one of the 270 unarmed demonstrators killed by the
Indonesian military that day in a massacre in Dili, East Timor's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Punitive Damage,'' which opens Friday in New York City , is
the story of Kamal's political activism and Ms. Todd's unusual
search for justice. In 1994 she traveled to the United States
(world capital of litigation) and sued the Indonesian general who
had authorized the massacre for the wrongful death of her son.
</P>
<P>
   The story is illustrated by old photographs of Kamal, film of
the actual massacre, re-creations of courtroom testimony and a
variety of talking heads. The most effective interview subject is
Allan Nairn, a journalist who has long covered East Timor and
witnessed the Dili massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, some of the other subjects and the recreations are quite
stiff. But Ms. Todd has a particularly gripping scene, one in
which, having talked to many people who saw Kamal the day he died,
she reconstructs and recounts the events of her son's last hours.
</P>
<P>
   His youthful political fervor now stands for that of all those
who died alongside him, and Ms. Goldson has given him a respectful,
meaningful memorial.
</P>

SENATE IS SET TO EXPAND POWERS OF ANTI-NAZI UNIT 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Senate is poised to pass legislation that would
greatly expand the powers of the Justice Department's anti-Nazi
unit, giving it responsibility for pursuing all modern-day war
criminals who have taken refuge in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was prompted by an investigation by The Boston Globe in
May that revealed how scores of suspected human rights criminals
have exploited the government refugee program, antiquated
immigration laws and, in some cases, political connections to gain
residency and avoid prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will become law, and it will say that the United States is
not a safe haven for war criminals,'' said Senator Patrick J.
Leahy, the Vermont Democrat, who introduced the bill after the
Globe reported that a member of a ruthless Bosnian Serb
paramilitary unit involved in ethnic cleansing had settled with his
family outside Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inconceivable to have a situation where people who have
committed crimes that virtually every American would find abhorrent
are able to flee to America to hide,'' Leahy said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An identical bill introduced in the House of Representatives
this month is also said to have broad bipartisan support but has
not reached the floor. The Clinton administration has taken no
public position on either bill. But a Justice Department official
said the administration supports the reform efforts, despite
reservations about shifting responsibility for war crimes cases
from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the anti-Nazi
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of those reservations, the administration is unlikely
to fight the Senate bill, the official, who asked not to be
identified, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Leahy bill contains two key provisions. The first would give
funding and authority to the Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations to probe all suspected war criminals in the United
States. Since its founding in 1979, the Office of Special
Investigations has been limited to hunting down hundreds of former
Nazis and their allies who slipped into the United States after
World War II. The unit has gained a reputation as the most
effective Nazi-fighting organization in the world, but is
threatened with obsolescence as aging Nazis continue to die.
</P>
<P>
   The second provision would amend the Immigration and Nationality
Act so that immigrants who committed torture abroad can be excluded
from the United States or expelled. Under current law, immigrants
can be held accountable for atrocities only if they are found to
have participated in Nazi persecutions or committed genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill unanimously
last week, a critical hurdle toward passage. Leahy won the
committee approval by combining his original bill with several
international crime measures also supported by Senator Orrin Hatch,
the Republican from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy's aides said they are optimistic the Senate will approve
the bill by ``unanimous consent'' before the end of the
Congressional session next month. Under that procedure,
non-controversial bills are passed with neither a floor debate nor
a roll-call vote, but any senator can stall the legislation by
raising an objection.
</P>
<P>
   The bill so far has encountered little resistance. But the
senator's aides cautioned that during the legislative scramble
before the end of the session, objections sometimes arise as
lawmakers seek to gain leverage for their own legislation, even if
the objections are unrelated to the bill itself.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate bill passes before the end of the session, the
House is expected to take up the issue when Congress reconvenes in
January.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Mark Foley, a Republican from Florida, said he
decided to introduce the House bill after the Globe reported that
Carl Dorelien, a former colonel in the Haitian regime ousted by the
1994 US invasion, has been living quietly in his district.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman predicted that Dorelien would become ``the
poster child'' for new laws designed to ``send him packing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation has always prided itself in giving refuge to the
poor and huddled masses; I hope that hasn't changed to where we're
giving refuge to the poor and huddled masses and those who oppress
them,'' Foley said. Recognition of the need for a centralized
authority to handle modern-day war crimes cases is nearly
universal. However, differences remain inside and outside the
government over how it should be organized, and whether the new
legislation is the best way to attack the growing problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, for example, has set off a turf war between the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Office of Special
Investigations over who should be given the new funding and
authority. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said
shifting the authority to the Office of Special Investigations
would be the equivalent of setting up a parallel version of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has been
widely criticized for its handling of cases involving suspected
human rights abusers. In comparison with the Office of Special
Investigations, which has stripped 61 former Nazis of US
citizenship, deported 48, and compiled a ``watchlist'' of 60,000
suspected war criminals for exclusion from the United States, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service has no records of having
deported an immigrant on evidence of involvement in human rights
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting that reform is needed, the agency announced last month
it was creating a separate legal division to prosecute modern-day
war criminals and other immigration matters of national security.
Immigration and Naturalization Service and Justice Department
officials had hoped the new division would form the framework for a
new war crimes unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that when the bill is pending on the House side that
we'll begin to take account of what the administration has to
say,'' said a Leahy aide who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several human rights observers have questioned
whether the Senate bill goes far enough. Although the new law would
add torture to the criminal criteria for excluding or deporting an
immigrant, it says nothing about other crimes against humanity,
such as summary execution or kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Roberts, general counsel for the Center for Justice and
Accountability, a San Francisco-based group funded by Amnesty
International, said the group supports Leahy's efforts but is
concerned that the bill is too narrow. ``We'd like them to take a
hard look at the definitions,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which oversees both the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and the Office of Special Investigations,
also is skeptical of how an expanded version of the Office of
Special Investigations would be funded. No figures have been given
for how the new division would be paid for. The Senate bill
stipulates only that the agency is to be allotted ``such sums as
may be necessary to carry out the additional duties. . .''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the expansion could cost considerably more than
the Office of Special Investigations' current $3.7 million budget.
The division is expected to require additional staffing, including
trained investigators, translators, lawyers, and paralegals.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, which created its own Modern War Crime Unit in 1996 in
response to press reports similar to the Globe investigation,
budgeted $46.8 million over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said the funding is a matter of setting priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can find $47 million for Ken Starr to carry out a fruitless
investigation of a $20,000 land deal and a tawdry affair on the
part of the president,'' he said. ``Well, if we spent $47 million
for that, we can find that much money to investigate people
involved in murder, arson, rape, torture, and other heinous
crimes.''

5 GOP CANDIDATES GATHER FOR TALK BUT LITTLE SPARRING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE with MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Five Republican candidates for president sat
side-by-side on a stage here Thursday night but paid little heed to
one another as they offered views on issues ranging from military
spending to campaign finance to overhauling the tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Until the closing minutes of the 60-minute gathering at
Dartmouth College, the candidates also resisted turning their fire
on the candidate who was not there, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the front runner. Finally, Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher who
is financing his own campaign, attacked the governor for being
obsessed with amassing a war chest and not subjecting himself to
debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps in the future in a forum like this, if we call it a
fund-raiser, he might show up,'' Forbes said, adding, ``They want a
coronation and not a real contest _ that's fundamentally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The format of Thursday's forum did not lend itself to give and
take among the hopefuls. Randomly selected people from New
Hampshire posed questions, and there was no opportunity for the
candidates to directly quiz one another.
</P>
<P>
   There was far more sparring when these five candidates gathered
in a debate last week. On Thursday, the candidates put forth
largely self-contained speeches, turning each question to make
their own case.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is in second place behind Bush
in polls here, repeatedly discussed his passion for reforming the
campaign finance system. He also described the tax system as ``a
nightmare, a chamber of horrors for ordinary citizens'' because
``special interests rule in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also took the opportunity to raise _ and defuse _ the
issue of his temper. It drew attention this week when Gov. Jane Dee
Hull of Arizona, a Republican who is backing Bush, publicly
described instances where he has raised his voice at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say that perhaps I'm angry,'' McCain said. He explained
that he was disturbed by such decisions like ``when you spend $350
million on a carrier the Navy doesn't want or need.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senator in the race, Orrin Hatch of Utah, spoke
repeatedly of his experience in Congress as his biggest asset. ``I
want to be president because I have more experience than anybody
running,'' he said, ``including the two Democrats.'' He also
emphasized his experience in the justice field; he said the next
president could pick 50 percent of the next Supreme Court, and that
he was best equipped to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a leader of conservatives, put himself forward as
the candidate of grassroots conservatives. He also sought to
establish his leadership credentials, saying he had presided over
17,000 bureaucrats when he was an official at the Education
Department. ``America's a great nation militarily,'' he said. ``But
it also has a terrible virtue deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   And Alan Keyes, a former State Department official who is also
fighting for the mantle of spokesman for conservatives, spoke
forcefully about decaying American values. ``This nation is in the
worst moral crisis it's ever faced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup to this event has been more about the candidate who
did not show up than those who did. In an unusual move, WMUR-TV,
the largest television station in New Hampshire and a sponsor of
the debate, invited Bush for an interview at the opening of its 6
p.m. news program to explain why he was not here.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beside his wife, Laura, in Dallas for the live
interview, Bush said he regretted missing the debate. But he said
that months ago he committed to an event Thursday at Southern
Methodist University, where Mrs. Bush received a distinguished
alumni award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry I'm not there,'' Bush said. ``I look forward to the
debates. I have a lot to say. But I hope the people understand I
love my wife and I want to honor Laura.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush invoked his wife Thursday to explain his failure
to attend, only a few weeks ago his campaign said it had no
intention of taking part in debates before next year. But mindful
of the early primary schedule _ and perhaps of inroads in polls
here by McCain _ Bush seems more sensitive to criticism that he was
neglecting the state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the forum got underway, it was disrupted briefly by a woman
in the audience who began shouting about the dangers of nuclear
proliferation, but she was shouted down and then ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Several people expressed frustration with the health care
system.
</P>
<P>
   One questioner asked Forbes about Americans who travel to Canada
and Mexico to buy less expensive prescription drugs. He answered
that medical savings accounts would expand options for spending on
health care. ``Then if you want an HMO, you can. If you want
fee-for-service, you can.''
</P>
<P>
   To a young man who asked about drug abuse and legalizing
marijuana for medicinal purposes, McCain said: ``There was a time
when we weren't losing the war on drugs. It was when Nancy Reagan
had a very simple program called, ``Just Say No.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about gun control, Hatch said: ``Parents are afraid to let
their kids go to school because they don't know if they're going to
be safe. They're worried to death.'' He said he would favor
mandatory sentencing for crimes involving the use of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   On tolerance, Keyes said, ``Homosexuality is an abomination,''
and called the comparison between racism and discrimination against
homosexuals ``absurd.'' Bauer added that ``marriage is between a
man and a woman, not between two men, two women or any other
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain took a different view: ``We're the party of Abe
Lincoln,'' he said, and ``will not tolerate discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would hire openly gay people in his
administration, Forbes said: ``If a person wants a job to make a
statement, they're not going to get it. If they want to do a job,
they'll be strongly considered.'' Forbes summed up his position as
``Equal rights for all, special rights for none.''
</P>
<P>
   All candidates said that they more or less approved some version
of a flat tax, which appeared to thrill Forbes, who began
advocating such a system during his 1996 campaign. ``When I ran
four years ago, virtually every Republican denounced the flat
tax,'' he said, ``so education works.''
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, several candidates appeared in the press
filing center to ask for questions, but as several hundred
reporters scrambled to file their stories, there weren't many.
Keyes took that as an affront, and accused reporters of racism.

REPORT RAISES ALARM ON TUBERCULOSIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A major Harvard University report that raises the
specter of a global tuberculosis epidemic has become the
battleground on how best to fight the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are huge: the outcome determining whether some will
be treated and others not, and whether enough new money will be
found to combat drug-resistant strains of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released Thursday, Harvard Medical School authors
challenged the conventional means of tuberculosis control, saying
drug-resistant TB cases flourish even in areas with well-run
TB-control programs. They documented the spread of drug-resistant
TB to 104 countries and territories.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the authors predict, no country will be immune to
the disease, and major outbreaks could occur anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   To date, drug-resistant tuberculosis has made only sporadic
inroads into the United States, most prominently the 400 cases in
New York earlier this decade that cost $1 billion to control. But
with more outbreaks around the world, the authors believe it could
happen again and again in America, especially with 47 million
visitors a year arriving here.
</P>
<P>
   Americans traveling abroad also could be soon affected, the
authors said. ``People could soon think twice where they travel
to,'' said Dr. Jim Yong Kim, who wrote parts of the report. ``In a
few years, it may be judged by some too big a risk to go to the
Dominican Republic, or even visit Machu Picchu in Peru.'' Both
countries have reported drug-resistant TB outbreaks in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the World Health Organization warned that if
drug-resistant tuberculosis ``is unleashed, we may never be able to
stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's study said multidrug-resistant TB ``has already, in
fact, been unleashed. The questions before us are no longer when?
but rather how? and to what extent?''
</P>
<P>
   Policymakers are at odds on how to answer those questions. The
World Health Organization has established a low-cost program called
DOTS, which stands for directly observed treatment, but coverage is
spotty. It still has not reached 84 percent of people worldwide
with active TB.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance develops when people forget to take their medication
or the pills run out, and someone with drug-resistant TB can then
pass it on to others, transmitting the infected bacteria by
coughing or sneezing.
</P>
<P>
   Mycobaterium tuberculosis already is the world's most deadly
infectious disease, killing about 2 million people a year. Fully
one-third of the world's population is infected with TB, but only
10 percent of those will ever develop active cases in their
lifetime. Once someone develops an active case, they infect 10
people every year.
</P>
<P>
   WHO officials argue that the most effective way of fighting TB
is through their basic programs, which can cost as little as $10 a
patient in the Third World. By comparison, drug-resistant cases can
cost between $300 to $4,000 a patient.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard authors argued for both fights: WHO programs with
singular efforts to cure each drug-resistant TB patient. Otherwise,
they argue, the deadly strains of drug-resistant TB will spread
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give a Russian prisoner, for example, the regular
WHO-recommended treatment when he has multidrug-resistant TB is the
equivalent of rubbing spinach on their head,'' said Paul Farmer,
the principal author of the Harvard study, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   After the release of the report, funded by George Soros' Open
Society Institute, the Harvard authors, WHO leaders and other
TB-control experts met Thursday night to discuss strategies on
where to put funds and how to raise more money. The meeting was
closed, at the request of the WHO officials.
</P>
<P>
   One key participant, Arata Kochi, director of WHO's global
tuberculosis program, has great doubts about a rapid expansion of
the fight against drug-resistant TB.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Geneva this week, Kochi said the
success in Peru does not mean the Harvard team could stop the huge
outbreak in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no comparison,'' Kochi said. ``We have to do
something about drug-resistant TB, but it costs a tremendous amount
of money. How do you do it? We don't have a solution yet. It costs
$3,000 to treat one Russian prisoner, but only $10 to treat a
person in India with easily treatable TB. The choice has to be
made: the $3,000 prisoner or the $10 cost to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer disputed arguments that fighting drug-resistant TB should
take a back seat to expansion of the DOTS program.
</P>
<P>
   The battle now, he believed, should be over finding funds, not a
fight among TB-control experts. In Russia, where drug-resistant
cases account for as much as 9 percent of all TB cases in some
areas, the only way to treat each infected person is to learn which
drugs will work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank is considering a $100 million loan to fight TB in
Russian prisons. While that may help, Farmer estimated that $1
billion may be needed for Russia alone.

SAN FRANCISCO'S HIGH-FLYING MAYOR MAY CRASH ON ELECTION DAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For an hour, it was 1995 again, when Willie
Lewis Brown Jr. was the newly minted mayor and San Francisco was
dazzled by his possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Brown played the crowd at City Hall like Mozart on the piano,
vowing to right what's wrong and to better what's right, and
tempering the high notes with quiet moments and meaningful pauses.
And when he was finished Monday with what he called this ``last
state of the city address to be given by any mayor in this
century,'' the chamber, so packed a person could faint, erupted in
the loud, long applause usually reserved for a Broadway hit.
</P>
<P>
   Then 1999, one week before the mayoral election, came rushing
back.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallway outside the chamber, someone held a newspaper
with the latest San Francisco Chronicle poll. It showed Brown with
33 percent of the vote, far short of the 50 percent plus one vote
needed to win the election Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby stood former Mayor Frank Jordan, who is one of Brown's
three main opponents, drawing a crowd as he wondered aloud where
the $1 billion increase in the city's budget over the last four
years had gone.
</P>
<P>
   Near him lingered Tom Ammiano, the president of the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors, who entered the race less than two
weeks ago as a write-in candidate. Ammiano was exulting over the
newspaper poll, which put him in a statistical tie for second place
without even being listed as one of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Given the polls, a run-off election in December seems likely.
And while the prevailing thought is that Brown, who entered office
as Mr. San Francisco, would win that race, no one is taking his
victory for granted. The fact is, San Francisco's mayor, a master
of the political universe who spent three decades in the California
Legislature (15 years as the speaker of the Assembly before a new
two-term-limit law forced him from office in 1995), is no longer
Prince of the City.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a booming economy, low unemployment and plunging crime
rates that mirror the trend across the nation, voters in
politically obsessed San Francisco are not happy. And while this is
not as surprising as it sounds _ San Franciscans are notoriously
hard to please, not having re-elected a mayor in 16 years _ Brown,
as colorful and irrepressible as the city considers itself, has
disappointed voters on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   To his more liberal constituents, he is too cozy with developers
and other big business interests. To more conservative voters (a
conservative here is a moderate Democrat anywhere else in the
country), he does not pay enough attention to quality-of-life
issues like traffic and is too close to the fringe groups that give
San Francisco its reputation as a hotbed of radical chic.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Trying to cater to competing constituencies is a tricky
business. Earlier this month, the mayor ordered the confiscation of
supermarket shopping carts that homeless people use to haul their
possessions, on the grounds that they were stolen property. The
move was seen as a response to merchants' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But even with public compassion toward homeless people at a
seemingly all-time low, publicity about the operation brought
outrage and sympathy. Brown stopped the operation before it began,
both denying he had ordered it and claiming it was misunderstood.
That, in turn, caused the more conservative pundits and business
people in the city to label the mayor a waffler.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The hard truth for Brown is that many San Franciscans believe
the city is not better off than it was four years ago. Half the
voters in the latest poll said that homelessness, considered the
city's No. 1 problem, has gotten worse during the mayor's term. A
third of the voters said the city's trouble-plagued public transit
system has deteriorated, while only 23 percent said it had
improved. And 43 percent of those polled say that a major problem,
the lack of affordable housing, has worsened, while only 14 percent
said the condition had improved. The mayor's administration has
also been plagued with accusations of cronyism and corruption in
several city agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, at least, Brown had the edge among liberals.
Both of his leading opponents up until then _ Jordan and Clint
Reilly, a political consultant and Jordan's former campaign
manager, who has spent more than $3 million of his own money on his
campaign _ are considered more conservative. So Brown concentrated
his heaviest campaigning in the more traditionally conservative
Asian neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But the write-in candidacy of Ammiano, a former
special-education teacher who is gay, has thrown that liberal vote
into question.
</P>
<P>
   The Ammiano campaign, as it exists, has galvanized disenchanted
voters who had planned to sit out the election, his supporters
contend.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I know was sitting around saying, `Gosh, who am I
going to vote for for mayor?''' said Tim Redmond, executive editor
of The Bay Guardian, a liberal weekly newspaper that repeatedly
urged Ammiano to run.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond estimated that several thousand voters who had planned
to stay home or vote for one of the fringe candidates, will write
in Ammiano as their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this pent-up frustration has been released because all
of a sudden people have a place to go with it,'' he said. ``I
haven't seen this kind of excitement in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Brown campaign seems resigned to losing some support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that we're disappointed that Tom Ammiano has
entered the race and will probably help the more conservative
candidates by doing so,'' said P.J. Johnston, a spokesman for the
mayor's re-election team.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the threat, Brown's campaign brought no less a
liberal heavy-hitter than the Rev. Jesse Jackson to town Tuesday.
The mayor and Jackson made a series of stops in neighborhoods like
the Castro, a largely gay district, to remind voters of Brown's
long civil rights credentials. Jackson's presence certainly
attracted attention, though he tried to deflect it to the mayor.

   ``Willie Brown is the real thing,'' Jackson would say, as
passers-by vied to shake his hand.

 _ SF CHRON   Levi Strauss Will Halt Sales On Its Web Sites 
 &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Taking a 180-degree turn from the rest of retailing, Levi Strauss &AMP;
Co. will halt sales from its Levi's and Dockers Web sites after
Christmas. Instead, J.C. Penney and Macy's, two big Levi's
merchants, will begin selling the merchandise on their sites.
<P>
   Like most of its attempts to sell clothes through its own
brick-and-mortar stores, Levi's e-commerce effort was not
implemented effectively. Sales at www.levi.com and www.dockers.com
have been dismal and costs have been extremely high, industry
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled Levi's, whose sales have been sliding for three years,
launched its e-commerce effort last November, saying it wanted to
learn more about its consumers through direct interactions with
them.
</P>
<P>
   The move angered its retail partners, who had been barred from
selling Levi's and Dockers over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Under Phillip Marineau, the chief executive who started last
month, Levi's is attempting ``to focus back on their core
business,'' said one source. ``Online is not something they're
specialized in.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat is on: Levi's faces its third year of declining sales
this year and is expected to suffer its first net loss in more than
a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Beckman, a Levi's spokesman, said the company was happy
with sales from the sites. But ``during the past year, it became
clear to us that the cost of running a truly world-class e-commerce
business is unaffordable right now as we look at other competing
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that consumers have to send returns through the
mail instead of being able to take them to stores, Beckman said.
The sites will continue to offer information such as store
locators, he said. E-commerce partners may be expanded beyond
Macy's and Penney's in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Penney's will begin selling Levi's and Dockers merchandise at
www.jcpenney.com in time for Christmas, said spokeswoman Stephanie
Brown. ``We are expecting great things, but of course, it's too
early to tell,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Macys.com will begin selling Levi's and Dockers products after
Christmas, Beckman said. ``The online customer has told us
repeatedly that powerful national brands, which I consider Levi's
and Dockers to be, are very desirable merchandise on the Web.''
said Kent Anderson, CEO of Macys.com.
</P>
<P>
   USWeb/CKS, a San Francisco consulting firm, has been managing
Levi Strauss' e-commerce business. An executive there declined to
comment. Levi's spokesman Danny Kraus said there will be no change
in the relationship with USWeb/ CKS.

 Class-Action Suit Filed Against Aetna  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A San Francisco law firm filed a class-action suit yesterday in
state court in Martinez charging Aetna U.S. Healthcare with
misleading customers by not disclosing that doctors may have a
financial incentive to withhold care.
<P>
   The suit was filed by San Francisco attorney Fred Furth, who is
part of a national legal syndicate that won millions of dollars in
tobacco-suit settlements and who now has targeted health insurers.
</P>
<P>
   These attorneys already have filed similar suits against Aetna
and other HMOs in the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, these suits claim that health insurers are
misleading customers by not disclosing the common practice of
capitation. HMOs commonly pay doctors a fixed monthly fee of about
$40 per patient. That fee must cover most of a patient's care,
including visits to primary-care doctors, specialists and tests. It
usually does not cover hospitalization. The doctor gets the same
fee from the HMO if the patients uses a lot of services or none.
</P>
<P>
   The suit argues that patients aren't aware that these capitation
agreements could give doctors an incentive to withhold care because
the doctors get to keep any money left over after all of their
patients have been treated and must pay for services that exceed
capitation fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These capitation agreements have been guarded secrets,'' Furth
said at a press conference. ``They may have been known to some, but
they were not known to all.''
</P>
<P>
   Atena spokesman Bobby Pena denied that Aetna had misled members
or violated the law or standard industry practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an instance of trial lawyers targeting health insurers
in the name of profit,'' Pena said.
</P>
<P>
   HMO critic Harvey Rosenfield, founder of Consumer's for Quality
Care in Santa Monica, also questioned Furth's motives. ``There's
plenty of injustice that needs to be remedied,'' Rosenfield said.
``But these guys are just in it for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Furth disputed that assessment, saying that if he wins his suit,
filed on behalf of a San Diego woman who was denied care to treat
cancer, he would seek to force Aetna to explain the poorly
understood capitation system and to refund millions of dollars in
premiums to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   He said his firm is working on similar cases against other HMOs.
He predicted that eventually, ``all of the other HMOs will be
involved in this litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna had other legal headaches yesterday. It said the
Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing its accounting
practices in relation to some recent acquisitions, including the
company's $1 billion purchase of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America's health care unit.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't dampen Aetna's finances. The company reported a
27 percent rise in earnings despite problems it has been having
integrating the money-losing Prudential business into its own.
Aetna's stock dipped 7.7 percent late last month when officials
told analysts that losses at the Pru unit were running at $200
million a year.

 Gap Division Boss Robert Fisher Resigns
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service Clients) &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Robert Fisher, son of Gap Inc. founder Donald Fisher, resigned
yesterday as president of the sagging Gap division, ceding control
of the unit to chief executive Mickey Drexler.
</P>
<P>
   With Fisher's resignation, effective November 15, no members of
the Fisher family will be involved in day-to-day operations at Gap
Inc., which also runs the Old Navy and Banana Republic chains.
Donald Fisher remains chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fisher also will resign from his position as executive
vice president of the parent company, Gap Inc., but will remain on
the board.
</P>
<P>
   Performance at domestic Gap, babyGap and Gapkids stores began
sliding this year after impressive growth last year. ``They've
squeezed themselves on the top end with Banana Republic and on the
bottom end with Old Navy, so what do you do?'' said one retail
watcher, explaining Gap's dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Gap Inc. stock rose $3.13, or 10 percent, yesterday to $34.75,
but it is down from a 52-week high of $52.69, largely because of
softness in the Gap division.
</P>
<P>
   Gap Inc. sales are projected to total $11.6 billion this year,
with adult U.S. Gap stores, the largest single  &LR; division,
accounting for $3.9 billion, according to Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler, who reportedly has focused more attention on the Gap
division in recent months, will run it for the foreseeable future,
said company spokesman Alan Marks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marks said Robert Fisher's resignation was ``an entirely
personal decision'' that has ``no connection with the business.''
Robert Fisher, who has three children, ``has no specific plans
other than to spend time with his family,'' Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fisher, 44, who became president of the Gap division in
1997, is one of Gap Inc.'s biggest stockholders, with a 5.7 percent
stake, according to a public filing. He joined the company as a
store manager in 1980 after earning an MBA at Stanford University,
and he rose through the ranks to serve as chief operating officer
and chief financial officer, among other positions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was not seen as an heir apparent to Drexler as CEO.
Fisher earned a salary of $950,000 last year, according to a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, William Fisher, a former head of Gap Inc.'s
international operations, resigned from the company last year and
is no longer connected with the company, Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Fisher, Donald Fisher's wife, is a board member.
</P>
<P>
   Another family member with close ties to Gap Inc., Donald's
brother William, owns and operates Fisher Development Inc., a
privately held company that is the general contractor for most Gap
stores. Fisher Development is not formally related to Gap Inc.

STUDY TRACES ORIGIN OF GENDER GENES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 300 million years ago, an ordinary chromosome mutated,
creating what would become the male and female chromosomes as
nature began a grand experiment in using genes to determine gender.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, gender was probably determined not by
differing chromosomes, but by some environmental factor, like the
temperature of the water in which the egg incubated, which still
happens in such reptiles crocodiles and sea turtles: these
creatures preceded mammals in evolution history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers say they have reconstructed the history of the
gender genes by tracing back the mutations that make the X
chromosome different from the Y chromosome. Their work suggests
that the chromosomes were last identical between 240 million and
320 million years ago, shortly after the divergence of the
evolutionary lines leading to mammals and birds.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it was believed that the first changes were around
170 million years ago, said Dr. David Page, of the Whitehead
Institute in Cambridge, Mass., who worked with Bruce Lahn of the
University of Chicago on the study.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 46 human chromosomes, 44 are identical pairs. Over the
years, a pair of regular chromosomes differentiated into two
distinct ones, the X and the Y, which determine whether a baby is
boy or girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think today's X chromosome retains the gene content'' of
the non-sex chromosome, Page said.
</P>
<P>
   Using genetic sequence information obtained from a variety of
sources, Page said that he and colleagues found 19 genes that are
the same on both chromosomes, and all of these genes are
concentrated on the tip of the short arm of the X, whereas they are
scattered across the length of the Y.
</P>
<P>
   A mutation somehow created a gene called SRY, for
sex-determining region Y, and it became the master switch for
creating a male, Page said. Over millions of years, the
male-determining Y chromosome lost more and more genes, and Page
said that it hasn't finished evolving and losing genes. The X
chromosome has three times more DNA than the puny Y, and has 100
times as many genes.
</P>
<P>
   Page and Lahn were able to rough out four major genetic
shuffling events that were responsible for the evolution of the
distinct chromosomes. After the first, others occured 130 to 170
million years ago, 80 to 130 million years ago, and, the most
recent, 30 to 50 million years ago. This was after monkeys diverged
from the lower prosimian primates. The first Homo sapiens did not
appear until less than 1 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   James Bull, a professor of integrative biology at the University
of Texas in Austin and a specialist in evolutionary biology, said
that Page's work provides the first evidence to prove what
evolutionary biologists have long theorized: that the Y was
originally like the X chromosome and then lost many of its gene
functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fair to say that this is the best evidence to show''
that the theories are correct, Bull said. ``I think genetics
textbooks will have this study in them.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 New Wells Fargo CEO Now Winning With Sales Pitches  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Richard Kovacevich was one of the top hurlers on the Stanford
baseball team in the 1960s, a big league prospect until a rotator
cuff injury ended his career.
<P>
   Three decades later, Kovacevich is still pitching, except now
he's serving up mortgages and checking accounts instead of
baseballs. The chief executive of San Francisco's Wells Fargo may
well be the industry's top salesman _ a leader who has defied the
conventional wisdom that banking is a slow-growth industry and
turned his institution into a marketing machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a retailer at heart and most bank CEOs are not,'' said
Terri Dial, the group executive vice president who runs Wells
Fargo's California network.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacevich, a former toy company executive who will turn 56 in a
few days, brought his brand of banking to California a year ago
next Tuesday when his Minnesota bank, Norwest, bought the old Wells
Fargo, took its name and moved its headquarters to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The new Wells Fargo, the nation's seventh-largest bank, has
branches in 21 Western and Midwestern states. It also owns a
mortgage company and a consumer finance company with nationwide
operations.
</P>
<P>
   As CEO of the combined bank, Kovacevich moved quickly to instill
Norwest's sales spirit in the old Wells Fargo territory. In
California, employees at the branches, known as ``stores'' under
the Norwest system, started getting big doses of the Minnesota
bank's old-time religion _ sell more products to existing
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-selling is our mantra,'' said Kovacevich.
</P>
<P>
   Inside branches, new sales incentives were adopted and links
were set up with the bank's mortgage and consumer finance units.
Additional salespeople were added in some branches, which something
that  &LR; would have been anathema under the penny-pinching philosophy
of the old Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Sales surged as a result. During the first half of 1999,
California mortgage originations more than tripled and total
product sales per employee jumped 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the bank's revenue rose to $12.3 billion during the
first nine months of 1999, up 6.5 percent from the year before, a
strong figure in the banking industry, where revenue growth is
typically in the low single digits.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Making Merger Work
</P>
<P>
   Snappy top-line growth has made the new Wells Fargo one of the
few financial success stories among the crop of bank mergers
unveiled in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Of 11 major banks and thrifts that took over rivals in 1997 and
1998, only Wells Fargo and Wisconsin's Firstar met Wall Street's
profit projections, according to the New York brokerage Keefe,
Bruyette &AMP; Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo's stock has risen by a third in the past last &LR; 
 &LR; year, closing yesterday at $49.06, up $2.56. That beat the KBW
Bank Stock Index, which rose 24 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to meet its profit targets, Wells Fargo isn't axing
as many jobs as some rivals. The bank said it expects to eliminate
about 5 percent of total jobs through next year, about 4,600
positions.
</P>
<P>
   That's fewer less  &LR; than the 18,000 jobs, or 10 percent of total
positions, disappearing at Bank of America, created last year when
North Carolina's NationsBank bought San Francisco's BofA and took
its name.
</P>
<P>
   At Wells Fargo, ``management seems to be more involved with
their employees,'' said Scott Edgar, director of research at Sife
Trust, a Walnut Creek mutual fund that invests in banks. ``They
don't go in and fire a lot of people all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   The good reviews Kovacevich has gotten doesn't mean that
combining the old Wells Fargo and Norwest has been a walk in the
park. slam dunk. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The two banks were studies in contrast. Wells Fargo was a
hard-boiled institution that focused on efficiency and used
technology _ ATMs, telephone banking and computers _ to keep costs
down.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest was warmer and fuzzier, a people-oriented place that
regularly held rallies for '`team members'' and specialized in
one-on-one service at the branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the bank has got huge potential,'' said Thomas
McCandless, an analyst with the investment bank CIBC World Markets
in New York. ``But coming up with one playbook has not been easy.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to build a single institution, Kovacevich said he has
been careful to select the best the two banks had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   When banks combine, ``some people want to demonstrate that they
were right and you were wrong, and that they're in control,''
Kovacevich said. `'That's the kiss of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovacevich has been scrupulous about picking executives from
both banks. Paul Hazen, the CEO of the old Wells Fargo, Fargo's &LR; 
CEO,  &LR; remains as chairman and supervises corporate banking
operations. Rod Jacobs, the chief financial officer of the old
Wells Fargo, has the same job at the new bank, as do many other
senior managers of the former San Francisco bank.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kovacevich has gone with the old Wells Fargo's
popular Internet banking program, which recently signed up its
millionth customer. But he has stayed with Norwest's mortgage
operation, a unit that ranks as the nation's No.2 mortgagemaker.
mortgage maker. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  In some cases though, analysts worry that Kovacevich may be
postponing tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Take commercial real estate lending and corporate banking. The
old Wells Fargo took calculated risks, lending corporations and
developers big sums after carefully evaluating their
creditworthiness. Norwest considered big commercial loans too
risky, focusing instead on selling companies an array of financial
services, such as managing their cash receipts.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Kovacevich hasn't settled on a single model. Instead, he
is letting the two sides of the bank continue business as usual in
the corporate arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taking them a lot of time for them to figure out how to
put together the corporate side of the bank,'' said analyst
McCandless.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo officials counter that they have moved slowly to
combine the two banks to avoid the kind of breakdowns and snafus
that plagued bank integrations that were rushed. Such mishaps
prompted tens of thousands of customers to flee after the old Wells
Fargo took over First Interstate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While Kovacevich insists on calling his transaction a ``merger
of equals,'' there's no doubt who is in charge. ``As a practical
matter, I know who the CEO is,`` said Hazen, chief of the old Wells
Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacevich, the son of a lumber mill worker, grew up in
Enumclaw, Wash., in the shadow of Mount Rainier. He honed his
salesmanship three decades ago hawking Play-Doh and Snoopy
toothbrushes while serving as manager of Kenner Products, then the
toy division of cerealmaker General Mills.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint as an entrepreneur, Kovacevich jumped to Citibank,
where he managed the bank's New York retail branch network. He
moved to Norwest in 1986, after a Citibank rival was tapped to run
consumer banking operations, and became the Minnesota bank's CEO in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Kovacevich has been a banker since 1975, he
certainly doesn't fit the buttoned-down stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, at an Orlando, Fla., Florida,  &LR; meeting of
hundreds of Wells Fargo staff members, Kovacevich brought the house
down by climbing onto a stage and launching into a rendition of the
Rolling Stones' ``Satisfaction.'' (I still get some satisfaction,
when I see that finance action. ...'')
</P>

GAP PRESIDENT IS LEAVING AMID LAGGING REVENUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Fisher, the son of Gap Inc.'s founders, announced
Thursday that he would step down as president of the flagship
division, The Gap, whose sales have been lackluster in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   His duties will be assumed by Millard Drexler, the chief
executive of Gap Inc. and the dynamic executive credited with the
vision that helped propel the company's extraordinary rise. Even as
The Gap store sales have stalled, the company's newer Banana
Republic and Old Navy chains have posted strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said disappointing sales at his unit were irrelevant to
his decision. ``When you spend 19 years in this business, you have
a lot of up and down cycles,'' he said in an interview. ``If I let
every fluctuation on business bother me, I would have been on leave
a long time ago.'' Fisher, 44, described his departure as a leave
of absence effective Nov. 15 and said he would remain on the board
of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts heralded the management change. ``It is a sign
that the corporation has put a major agenda on fixing Gap stores,''
said Janet Kloppenburg, a retail analyst with Robertson Stephens.
``Mickey to date has never taken over anything and not been
successful.'' The stock rose $3.125 on the news, to $34.75, as the
broad market averages lept higher.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher took over as president of The Gap division in May 1997.
Soon after, he began a television ad campaign showing lithe young
people boogieing in khaki pants, an effort that ushered in several
months of double-digit growth for the chain. But The Gap, which
still accounts for roughly 35 percent of Gap Inc.'s revenue, has
been in a slump since the spring. For September, sales declined
nearly 4 percent at stores open at least a year, the sixth
consecutive month of flat or declining sales.
</P>
<P>
   Gap Inc., powered by the Banana Republic and Old Navy divisions,
continued to post solid sales and earnings growth during this
period. But the share price, which is down 34 percent from its July
peak, still looks rich to some analysts unless the company can
return to double-digit sales growth, for which it needs better
numbers at the 1,021 Gap stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Gap has been criticized for reacting slowly to increasing
demand for items that are of-the-moment trendy instead of
tried-and-true basics. While The Gap has had fashionable items like
leather jackets and embroidered jeans in its inventory, it readily
admits that it did not stock enough of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gap has been missing with key trend items, like cable rib
sweaters, paratrooper pants and distressed embroidered denim,''
John Morris, a stock analyst at Gerard Kleiner and Mattison, said
of the fall lineup. ``Or when they have some of these items, they
have not been featuring them in their advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The miscue has been particularly painful because more and more
competitors have gotten the formula right. The Limited Inc., which
runs stores like Express and Lane Bryant, has been dead-on with the
urban sophisticate look this season. Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch and
American Eagle Outfitters have similarly been enjoying double-digit
growth as they connect with hip, college students at The Gap's
expense. Old Navy, Gap Inc.'s spinoff with lower-cost merchandise,
has been taking a chunk of The Gap's cool as well.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fisher came to the company by way of his founder
parents, his role as an executive has hardly been cosmetic. He
started as a store manager in 1980 and in 1985 was named executive
vice president for merchandising at Banana Republic, then an
11-store division of Gap Inc., and eventually become that
division's president. Over the years, he also served stints as Gap
Inc.'s chief operating officer and chief financial officer.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Lobbyists Want States to Pay Workers on Family, Medical Leave  &HT;     By Sam McManis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Lobbyists who gave birth in 1993 to the Family and Medical Leave
Act now want states to pay workers when they take time off to care
for a new child or ill family member.
<P>
   Donna Lenhoff, general counsel for the National Partnership for
Women and Families and the author of the FMLA, said her
organization is campaigning for all states to pay workers _ either
through disability or unemployment benefits _ when they take family
or medical leave. The FMLA requires companies with 50 or more
employees to offer workers up to 12 weeks off each year to care for
a new child, a sick family member or if they become ill.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents, Lenhoff said, do not take advantage of the FMLA
because they fear lost income. A recent survey conducted by the
bipartisan Family Leave Commission reported that nearly 1 worker in
10 who takes family or medical leave is forced into public
assistance during that span. The commission also reported that 64
percent of employees who did not take family leave said they could
not afford to be without a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paid leave will make the promise of family leave so much more
workable for almost all workers,'' said Lenhoff, who is in San
Francisco today to speak at the Family Caregivers' Alliance
Convention at the Holiday Inn in the Financial District.
</P>
<P>
   She sees California's program as a model for other states.
California allows for a maximum of one year of temporary disability
insurance for pregnancy and recovery from childbirth _ depending on
complications and pending a doctor's approval. For normal pregnancy
and childbirth, women are entitled to six weeks of paid leave.
</P>
<P>
   Four other states _ Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode
Island _ provide some kind of pay for family and medical leave.
</P>
<P>
   As controversial as the original family leave act was _
President George Bush vetoed legislation twice before President
Clinton signed it in 1993 _ the idea of dipping into unemployment
and disability funds for family leave has drawn loud protest from
employers' groups.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of Independent Businesses opposes
government regulation of employee benefits. The U.S. Chamber of
Commerce wrote to the Department of Labor that using unemployment
funds would open a ``Pandora's box.'' And Deanna Gelak, director of
governmental affairs for the Society for Human Resources
Management, seeks to curtail or even abolish the FMLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that raiding the unemployment fund or disability
will jeopardize the future of unemployment benefits,'' Gelak said.
``We've always felt the best arrangement is to have employers set
up leave policies. The FMLA hurts co-workers and customers when
it's misapplied.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenhoff said she expected opposition for state-financed family
leave income from the same groups that originally objected to the
FMLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing the same thing (now) that they said about the FMLA
and, in historical perspective, about the minimum wage and overtime
regulations in the '30s,'' Lenhoff said. ``I understand that
there's a lot of emotion and knee-jerk fear, but that same
`the-sky-is-falling' predictions didn't happen with family leave,
and it won't happen now.''
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan Commission on Leave, founded by Congress as part
of the 1993 legislation, reported in 1998 that 86 percent of
companies said the FMLA had no noticeable effect on productivity,
and 92.5 percent reported no impact on profits.
</P>
<P>
   Lenhoff said her group is not lobbying for a federal law, as it
did in the original family leave act, because paid leave is too new
a concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Income leave was in the front of our minds when we were
lobbying for the FMLA, but it was too much to ask for then,''
Lenhoff said. ``Before you can get something to the federal level,
it needs to have a track record in the states, like the FMLA did.
It needs exposure. We have only five states that finance leave
(through disability).''
</P>
<P>
   Starting January 1, the weekly disability benefit in California
will rise to $490 from $336 per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``California's plan is great, but it's limited to the
(pregnancy/childbirth) portion of the FMLA,'' Lenhoff said. ``We
need broader family leave (income) for workers who need time off
for elder care or if they have a child in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill that enables employees to
use their own paid sick leave to care for ill family members, which
is not covered by disability insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Netsy Firestein, director of the Labor Project for Working
Families in Berkeley, said many lower-income workers cannot afford
to take leave beyond the disability allowance afforded for
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear that a lot from the unions I deal with but also from
professional people,'' Firestein said. ``I just talked to an
attorney who took six paid weeks off after a normal birth. She
could have taken an additional 12 weeks without pay, but even she
couldn't afford that. Six weeks of paid leave is almost nothing.
Parents still are faced with hard choices.''

 &HT;    Bush's no-show dominates GOP debate
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ He wasn't on stage, but the presence of George
W. Bush was felt during an hour-long candidate forum Thursday where
the Texas governor was pelted for his absence and the $60 million
he has raised for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It began seconds into the nationally televised event when
Arizona Sen. John McCain told the audience that ``what the people
of New Hampshire expect and demand, (is) to see us, to talk to us
and hear what we have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final minutes, publisher Steve Forbes criticized Bush for
not showing up, saying that Bush skipped one other joint appearance
to raise money for his campaign and that ``perhaps in the future,
if we call it a fund-raiser he'll show up.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bush absent, attention was focused on his two most serious
rivals: McCain, who has been steadily gaining in statewide polls
here, and Forbes, who has vowed to ``spend whatever it takes'' of
his personal fortune to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Staying in Texas was a calculated risk for Bush, who risks
alienating New Hampshire voters who delight in spoiling frontrunner
campaigns. At the urging of his New Hampshire campaign staff, Bush
made a five-minute appearance on a statewide television station
and, somewhat defensively, apologized for attending an award
presentation for his wife, Laura, at Southern Methodist University
in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important night in New Hampshire,'' he said. ``But
it's a more important night in Dallas as far as my family is
concerned. I really don't regret this opportunity to honor my
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the forum was spent answering serious questions about
issues including gay rights, legalization of marijuana, abortion,
campaign finance reform and education. Sharing the stage with
Forbes and McCain were Sen. Orin Hatch of Utah, former United
Nations Ambassador Alan Keyes and Gary Baur, who worked in the
Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he is proud of being a ``pro life person,'' McCain said,
the Republican Party should not discourage people who support
abortion rights from joining the GOP. `` We want you in our
party,'' he said. ``We can have respectful disagreements about
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who has been criticized for not disclosing exactly where
the money he is spending for his campaign is coming from, said that
unlike ``the lobbyists who have rallied around Bush'' who ``want a
coronation,'' his candidacy is being opposed by them ``because I'm
independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who got into the campaign late and has had a difficult
time making any progress said that he wants to prove that big money
isn't necessary to win the nomination. ``If I get a million people
to give me $36, I'll have as much money as George Bush,'' and it
would change politics forever, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point the forum was interrupted by a woman shouting in
the audience who ignored efforts to get her to be quiet. She was
removed from the hall.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, got some laughs when he was asked about legalizing
marijuana at least for medical use. ``That's is an excellent
question,'' he said then waiting a beat, ``to duck.'' He then said
he does not support legalization and added, ''My friends we're
losing the war on drugs. ...There was a time when we weren't losing
and that's when Nancy Reagan had a very simple program 'just say
no.' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexuality is an abomination,'' said Keyes in response to a
question concerning discrimination against homosexuals. Any
comparison of discrimination against blacks and homosexuals ``is
absurd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes congratulated his opponents for their support of a flat
tax. He said that when he ran four years ago, he was the only
candidate favoring a flat tax. He said it shows that ``education
can work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has only spent nine days here insisted that he is not
taking the Granite State for granted. He promised to attend a
televised debate on Dec. 2, his first with the the other
candidates.

U.S. GIVEN LOW MARKS FOR HONESTY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31) 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it the Ugly American all over again?
</P>
<P>
   Transparency International, the organization based in Berlin
that annually ranks countries based on how corrupt their officials
are perceived to be, added a new wrinkle this year by rating the
bribe payers, not just the bribe takers.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise in the results was how badly the United
States fared, despite its long history of inveighing against
international commercial bribery.
</P>
<P>
   For decades it stood alone in making payments by its companies
to overseas officials a crime, and Washington pressed hard for the
adoption of an antibribery convention in late 1997 by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD; the
agreement took effect in February.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all that, the United States was rated down in the middle
of the pack in the Transparency survey, tied with Germany, a
country seen by anticorruption campaigners as recalcitrant on the
issue and reluctant even to stop companies from taking tax
deductions for ``commissions'' and ``finder's fees'' paid to
overseas officials, let alone outlaw the payments, known
colloquially in German as Schmiergeld, or grease money.
</P>
<P>
   Transparency officials said the explanation for the United
States's relatively poor showing might lie at least in part in the
nature of the survey. On the group's behalf, Gallup International
asked executives, bankers, accountants, lawyers and chambers of
commerce in 14 large developing countries to assess how likely
companies from the leading export nations were to pay bribes to
obtain contracts. So the resulting index measures reputation _ not
necessarily behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Being the only superpower probably did not help the United
States, according to Jeremy Pope, executive director of
Transparency International. ``It is a fair bet that U.S.
heavy-handedness builds resentment and may well have driven down
the U.S. rating,'' he said, even though the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, the 1977 law outlawing bribery of overseas
officials, ``undoubtedly has major impacts on the conduct of many
large U.S. corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Fritz Heimann, chairman of the group's American chapter, saw
some irony in the law's effects. ``Because U.S. companies have
comparative success in countries known for endemic corruption,
locals assume they must be paying bribes,'' he said, when in fact,
American companies use the 1977 law ``effectively as a bribe
solicitation conversation-stopper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Hershman, a co-founder of Transparency International
and the chairman of DSFX, an international investigative firm, said
deep-seated suspicions of American practices among some foreign
executives may not be groundless. ``They believe U.S. companies
have honed sophisticated methods to circumvent the FCPA, such as
setting up ventures unconnected to the contract they seek in which
public officials or family members are silent equity partners,''
Hershman said.
</P>
<P>
   In his eyes, though, that is not unique. ``When foreign
businessmen tell me they are looking for ways to comply'' with the
new OECD convention, Hershman said, ``I know many really mean they
are looking for loopholes, like the ability to give campaign
contributions to public officials, a defect the treaty should
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershman said it was unclear how energetically the new
antibribery convention would be enforced by the 34 nations that
have signed it. Only 18 of the 34 have ratified the agreement so
far, including the United States; several major countries that drew
poor ratings in the survey, including France and Italy, have not
yet ratified the agreement, according to Transparency.
</P>
<P>
   Though pressure will still be needed from advocacy groups like
his, Hershman said, ``a coordinated, multilateral approach, such as
the OECD convention, is the only way forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States fared better in Transparency International's
annual corruption index, ranking 18th-best among 99 nations based
on the perceived level of corruption among public officials;
Denmark did best and Cameroon worst.
</P>
<P>
   Information about both surveys is available on
www.transparency.de, Transparency International's Web site.

KEEPING MERRILL STOCK FUNDS ON TARGET

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31)

 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to turn around a big, struggling mutual fund business
sounds like a full-time job. But for Robert C. Doll Jr., chief
investment officer for Merrill Lynch's stock funds, it will be just
part of a day's work.
</P>
<P>
   Doll, who joined Merrill from Oppenheimer Funds in June, is
taking on the additional duty of running three large-cap stock
funds the brokerage firm plans to open by year-end. In the
meantime, he is overseeing the rollout of a litter of funds, run by
newly hired managers, that are aimed at filling some gaping holes
in Merrill's fund lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the market has changed, we haven't introduced enough
products to keep up with those changes,'' Doll said. To appeal to
investors who carefully choose funds by the size and type of stocks
they buy, the funds managed by Doll will be strictly defined and
will not stray from their declared styles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Merrill funds have not shown such discipline. For
example, its main technology fund, Merrill Lynch Technology Fund,
made contrarian bets that caused it to perform very differently
than most technology stock funds before it was merged last month
into the Merrill Lynch Global Technology Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Merrill Lynch Growth Fund looked and acted more
like a value fund before a new manager overhauled it early this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've had your assets exclusively at Merrill, essentially
what you've ended up with are funds that have been heavy on the
value side, that have chased beaten-down stocks and out-of-favor
sectors,'' said Kunal Kapoor, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., the
Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been pulling cash out of Merrill's funds for a
couple of years and moving it in many cases to the funds of other
firms with better-performing funds, mostly those that invest in the
biggest and fastest-growing stocks. That outflow went from a
trickle to a torrent last year and has not stopped yet.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of 1997, sales of Merrill funds have exceeded
purchases by about $15 billion, according to the Financial Research
Corp. in Boston. This year, through Sept. 30, assets in Merrill's
long-term mutual funds _ excluding money market offerings _ had
dropped by about $7 billion, or 9 percent, to $69.8 billion,
according to Financial Research. That decline followed an outflow
of $5 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of faith among Merrill fund shareholders, most of whom
are clients of Merrill's brokerage business, has been widespread.
Even Merrill funds that have performed well lately, like its Global
Allocation Fund, which is up about 25 percent over the last 12
months, have had more money flow out than in, Kapoor says.
</P>
<P>
   Doll says that almost half of Merrill's funds have posted
returns this year that rank them in the top 25 percent in their
respective categories. Investors may slowly be taking notice: the
third quarter was the first in a year in which the firm had net
outflows of less than $3 billion, according to Financial Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty bleak for them for the past three to five
years,'' Kapoor said. ``You have to translate good performance into
a string of good years. I think they still have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   To get there, Merrill plans to roll out at least six funds by
early next year, including the three that Doll will manage with a
team of stock pickers and quantitative analysts. One of Doll's
funds will be a pure growth fund, another will be a value fund and
the third will be a blend of the two styles.
</P>
<P>
   Another, which Merrill brokers will start selling this week,
will be a global financial services fund managed by James Ellman,
who joined Merrill from the AIM Management Group this year. The
most eagerly anticipated of the bunch will be two funds managed by
James McCall, who arrived at Merrill this fall after settling a
legal battle with his former employer, Pilgrim Baxter &AMP; Associates.
Pilgrim had sued to stop McCall, who ran four funds for that
company, from going to work for a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill hopes to begin selling McCall's funds early next year.
</P>
<P>
   As new funds are created, others probably will disappear. Doll
said he and other Merrill managers were considering which funds no
longer fit into the firm's plans, a process Doll described as
``making sense of the product line.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to identify funds that may be scrapped, giving only
this hint, ``In some cases, we have sliced the bologna a little too
thinly.''

   KARAKOL, Kyrgyzstan _ The place is remote, romantic and
implausibly gorgeous. Deep in Central Asia and thinly populated,
Kyrgyzstan boasts some of the world's most spectacular Alpine
scenery, ideal for trekking, climbing, camping, horseback riding,
white-water rafting, canoeing, sailing, scuba diving and almost
everything else one might want to do in the great outdoors. In
short, it is a tourist's heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it is also a tourist's hell. There are few good
roads and, outside Bishkek, the capital, not a single modern hotel.
Travel agencies are disorganized and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Unrest and lawlessness in neighboring Tajikistan occasionally
spills over the border. The government gives lip service to the
importance of attracting visitors, but officials seem more
interested in lining their pockets than in promoting an industry
with immense potential here.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of entrepreneurs have been trying, with decidedly
mixed results, to close the gap. One of the most intriguing is
Valentin Derevyanko, a man who knows Kyrgyzstan's wild places as
well as anyone, but whose understanding of the tourism business is
developing very slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Derevyanko reflects both the huge opportunities and the huge
obstacles facing tour operators in the former Soviet Union. They
sense that tourism can not only make them rich, but also contribute
to developing their newly independent nations. But they are hobbled
by indifferent governments and, just as seriously, their own lack
of experience.
</P>
<P>
   By background and inclination Derevyanko is an adventurer, not a
businessman. He is a former motorcycle racing champion, and for
years he coached a motorcycle team, which fell apart when the
Soviet Union did in 1991. In need of a new livelihood at 48,
Derevyanko set out to capitalize on his beloved wilderness by
establishing Yak Tours.
</P>
<P>
   The company is a family enterprise. Derevyanko plans trips and
accompanies travelers if they want him. His wife, Galina, handles
administrative chores. His mother is the cook, and his adult
children serve as guides when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Headquarters is a ramshackle lodge here in Karakol, a town of
75,000 that is the jumping-off point for travel through the vast
meadows around Lake Issyk-Kul and the regal Tien Shan mountain
range.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, one room serves as a dining hall and office. Maps
and thick mountain-climbing ropes cover the walls. Upstairs are a
few modest, unheated bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge, though, is not what Yak Tours is all about. Its real
product is nature, and Derevyanko never seems at ease until he is
outdoors, hiking or climbing or setting up camp, or steering his
Russian-made jeep over icy mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very flexible,'' he said. ``Most of the people who call
us only want information and suggestions. Some want us to make
arrangements for their trips. And then there are people who want us
to do all the work, to set up everything. Whatever they want, we
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer tourist season, Derevyanko had a total of about
250 customers. A sample week's patrons reflected the variety of
what he has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   One young Western couple wanted to take an easy trek through
unspoiled country. They had brought their own sleeping bags, and
asked Derevyanko to suggest a scenic route, lend them a tent, drive
them to their starting point and then pick them up three days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Another group, however, was frighteningly hungry for adventure:
eight highly trained Russians who travel the world in search of the
wildest and most dangerous rivers. They were eagerly embarking on a
monthlong raft trip on the roughest rivers in Kyrgyzstan, including
a 10-day portage over rugged mountains. It would be the third time
they had made this trip. On both previous occasions, one of their
number had been killed.

 KARAKOL, Kyrgyzstan: been killed.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the spectrum are the groups of children
with cerebral palsy and other chronic diseases that Derevyanko
brings to Karakol, largely at his own expense. He takes them to a
small zoo he has built so they can touch and learn about animals.
The stronger children also go on gentle camping trips _ for many,
their first glimpse of Kyrgyzstan's natural wonders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear from all kinds of people who want all kinds of
different things,'' Derevyanko said. ``Some weird groups come only
to watch birds. They go absolutely wild when they see what we have
here. Then there are the flower people, especially the orchid
lovers. They also go crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too long ago I had a group of these orchid people from
England. I took them up to some fields that were full of orchids,
and when we got there they started screaming out loud. Apparently
some of these flowers are very rare and valuable in England. A cow
was eating them, and one guy in the group ran over and started
shouting at the cow to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Derevyanko knows there is big money to be made from tourism in
Kyrgyzstan, but he is unsure how to make it. His Soviet upbringing
left him almost wholly ignorant of promotion, marketing or the
demands of Western tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Few people know what Kyrgyzstan has to offer, and Derevyanko
isn't doing much to get the word out. His modest brochure isn't
widely distributed. He has no Web site, because he thinks having
one ``takes a lot of time and is very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been mentioned in a couple of travel guides,'' he
shrugged. ``People come, and then they tell other people what's out
here. A company in Belgium that specializes in extreme trekking
sends us a few groups every year, and we're starting a partnership
with a company in Holland. Naturally I'd like more business, but
I'm not really sure how to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's another problem,'' he added. ``I don't have room
for too many people. What if they show up and don't like what we
have? They'll tell other people not to come.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not an idle worry. The accommodations in Derevyanko's
lodge are primitive, and there is nothing more comfortable anywhere
nearby. He spends the winter months trying to modernize his place,
but has made limited progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways I think he represents the past rather than the
future,'' said Max Haberstroh, a German aid worker who has been
given the daunting task of shaping a modern tourist industry in
Kyrgyzstan. ``He knows everything about nature and the region where
he lives, and he's very keen on eco-tourism, which is exactly what
Kyrgyzstan needs to promote. But he hasn't grasped anything about
how to make his business succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has a huge tourist potential, but it has a long
way to go,'' Haberstroh continued. ``Obviously they need roads and
nice inns and decent restaurants. But they also need a change in
mentality. Somehow they have to make the jump into the competitive
world of international tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortcomings and all, though, Derevyanko is trying. ``Naturally
I wasn't prepared for life as a businessman,'' he said. ``I started
out knowing nothing about business, and I haven't learned much
since then. But in another sense I was prepared, because I'm an
adventurer. I can survive in all conditions. I know how to depend
on myself, either in the wilderness or in business. I know that
whether you get what you want depends mostly on how much you want
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For a man who has climbed so many mountains, literal and
figurative, can there be any fantasies left?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Derevyanko replied with a smile. ``Every day I
dream about how much fun it would be to go forget all this and go
back to motorcycle racing.''

GREENSPAN SAYS ECONOMY'S RECENT GROWTH RATE CAN'T GO ON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RIC STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
called the economy's recent growth rate unsustainable Thursday, but
said the rise in long-term interest rates appeared to be containing
the risks of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   With less than three weeks to go before the central bank next
meets to consider monetary policy, Greenspan gave no clear signal
that he planned to raise interest rates for a third time this year,
but expressed enough concern about the pitfalls facing the economy
to leave open the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to business executives in Boca Raton, Fla.,
Greenspan said there was a compelling case that huge investments in
technology were driving a lasting increase in productivity growth,
dampening inflationary pressures even as demand for goods and
services grows at a robust pace.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan warned that the growth rate of productivity would
inevitably level off, leaving the economy vulnerable to a
resurgence in inflation. He repeated his long-standing warning that
the economy was running out of workers so fast that continued
strong growth could lead to a surge in wages and then in prices. He
suggested that the growing trade deficit might crimp the flow of
cheap capital into the United States from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have enough experience with technology-driven gains
in productivity growth to have a useful sense of the time frame in
which market pressures contain demand,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover it is not clear as yet how much cumulative impact the
rise in real long-term interest rates over the past two years will
have on demand,'' he said. ``Going forward, the Federal Reserve
must monitor not only this response, but also the evolving capacity
of our economy to meet higher levels of demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Greenspan's speech to the corporate executives was given
over to the topic that has preoccupied him for the last several
years: the degree to which technology is reshaping the way business
operates, making the economy more efficient and allowing higher
growth rates with less inflation risk.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said there remained a debate among economists about
whether growth in productivity _ or output per worker for every
hour worked _ was truly improving over the rather sluggish trend
that began around 1970. But he said he was increasingly convinced
that the improvement was for real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it is still possible to argue that the evident
increase in productivity growth is ephemeral, I find such arguments
hard to believe, and I suspect most in this audience would agree,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Greenspan said, is that no one knows whether
technological advances will continue at their current breathtaking
pace, or whether businesses will be able to capitalize on them to
offset increased costs. So far so good, Greenspan said _ there was
no sign of trouble in the economic data released by the government
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the same, the rate of growth of productivity cannot
continue to increase indefinitely,'' Greenspan said. ``At some
point it must, at least, plateau. Should, at that point, labor
market tightness result in faster growth of nominal wage rates,
there would be no offset from accelerating productivity. As a
consequence, unit costs would likely rise, pressuring profit
margins and prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan left no doubt that he was particularly concerned about
the shrinking pool of available workers. The number of people
seeking jobs has declined over the last two years and is heading
lower as the economy hums along, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, reining in the economy, Greenspan said, ``may already be
significantly advanced'' because of ``upward pressure on real
long-term market interest rates, especially as economies abroad
strengthen.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Fed, Greenspan said, is that it can no
longer assume that it knows when the economy is at risk of
overheating. The Fed must not only make judgments about when demand
is entering a danger zone, he suggested; it must now also gauge
whether productivity improvements are increasing the economy's
capacity to handle greater demand, and the degree to which
improving productivity stimulates demand.

   EDS: Adds pilots' IDs.
</P>
<P>
   Two die when jet plunges near Valdosta
</P>
<P>
   By Alan Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Mark Bixler
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two members of the Navy's elite Blue Angels flying
team were killed Thursday when their F/A-18 Hornet crashed on a
farm near Moody Air Force Base in South Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The jet crashed into pine trees at 12:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. Patrick Driscoll, flight leader of the Blue Angels,
identified the dead pilots as Lt. Cmdr. Kieron O'Connor, 35, of
Burtonsville, Md., and Lt. Kevin Colling, 32, of Castle Rock, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the privilege of flying with both these pilots,''
Driscoll said. ``They are two of the best naval aviators I know.
This is a tragic loss to the families, to the Blue Angels and the
U.S. Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Angels have canceled their participation in an air show
at Moody this weekend, Driscoll said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first fatal crash involving the Blue Angels since
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Peters of Douglas said she saw the Blue Angels fly over
the grocery store where she was shopping just before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came over in a beautiful formation. I think there were
six of them,'' she said. ``It was probably a half an hour later
that we saw the smoke. I didn't hear a crash or anything. Someone
said they must be burning garbage. Then a little while later the
fire trucks came by. It was just a big, black billowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilots in the Blue Angels dazzled 15 million people with their
aerial acrobatics last year. They typically fly in 60-70 air shows
a year and had 68 shows in 36 sites in the United States and Canada
on this year's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. Jack Papp, a spokesman at the Pensacola Naval Air Station,
said the Blue Angels had just arrived in Valdosta when the crash
occurred. The team was flying over the site of the air show _ a
routine task before any performance. The idea, he said, is to
``become familiar with the terrain'' and to note the location of
power lines or other obstructions.
</P>
<P>
   Four jets were flying at the time of the crash. Papp said the
planes were circling the air field and preparing to land. He said
there were no civilian casualties or damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``With crashes, we can't confirm anything,'' he said, ``because
it's under investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet that crashed is the only two-seater in the team; it's
often used to take reporters on flights
</P>
<P>
   Members of Blue Angels are chosen through a ``rigorous selective
process,'' Papp said. They are considered among the best fliers in
the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The maintenance is top notch. You also have top-notch naval
aviators.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor had been with the Blue Angels since last November,
Driscoll said. Colling had joined recently and was being trained.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington D.C., Ken Bacon, a Pentagon spokesman, said the
Navy is eager to learn from the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if any sort of procedural or maintenance problems
are revealed by the investigation they will be addressed
aggressively by the Navy,'' he said. ``This is its premier flying
team ... and you can be sure the Navy will do whatever it can to
make sure that this team is at the very top of its ability to
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   The group was formed in 1946. The deaths Thursday brought to 25
the number of Blue Angels killed in air shows or training.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was devastating news at Pensacola Naval Air Station,
home of the 14-member Blue Angel crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks your heart,'' Papp said.
</P>
<P>
   He said other members of the Blue Angels stayed in Valdosta
after the crash. He did not know when they would return to
Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're feeling it right now,'' Papp said. ``Any time you lose
shipmates like this, it's a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   At American Legion Post 240, about two miles from the naval
station's main entrance, a group of military retirees and their
wives had just finished their weekly bingo game when they learned
of the crash on television.
</P>
<P>
   Several gathered at the post's bar, sipping drinks and watching
a wide-screen television set for updates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely terrible,'' said Libby Lee, a military spouse, as
she sipped a Busch beer mixed with Sprite. ``Oh, my God, it's
terrible. Those Blue Angels, they do a beautiful job. Scares the
holy hell out of me, but it's a beautiful job.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the bar, a retired Navy aviator sat alone, dressed
in his old uniform. In a barely discernible whisper, he said he
couldn't talk about the crash. He stared straight ahead and drank
his beer.

RIVAL REPUBLICANS AGREE: GEORGE W. BUSH SHOULD JOIN THE FRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 News Analysis   
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush's rivals for the Republican
presidential nomination gave the absent GOP front-runner a harder
time Thursday night than they gave either President Clinton or the
Democrats who hope to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Bush's five remaining GOP challengers faulted the
governor for failing to join the second candidates' forum in six
days in the state with the nation's first presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was mentioned only once and the Democratic hopefuls,
Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,
were not mentioned at all.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, magazine publisher Steve Forbes, Utah
Sen. Orrin Hatch, and former Reagan administration official Gary
Bauer criticized Bush's decision to skip the question-and-answer
session in Hanover, N.H. Only former State Department official Alan
Keyes did not mention Bush or his absence.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the point: The only Republican president
repeatedly mentioned by one or more of the candidates was Ronald
Reagan. George Bush, father of the Texas governor, was not
mentioned at all.
</P>
<P>
   The cautionary message to the younger Bush: The privileged son
of the last Republican president had better join the struggle for
the GOP nomination or he will become the lightning rod for
criticism by all of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the former Navy aviator and Vietnam prisoner of war,
targeted Bush without naming him. McCain thanked the moderators
``for being here.''
</P>
<P>
   And he thanked New Hampshire's WMUR-TV and Cable News Network
for ``sponsoring what the people of New Hampshire expect and demand
_ and that's to see us, to talk to us and hear what we have to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, the multimillionaire publishing heir who is financing
much of his second presidential campaign, said he shared the
disappointment voiced by at least one member of the audience that
Bush was not taking part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps in the future at a forum like this, if we call it a
fund-raiser, he might show up,'' Forbes said in a not-so-subtle
reference to Bush's fund-raising muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes later urged New Hampshire Republicans to say: ``No, this
is not going to be a coronation. ... If you don't participate in
forums like this, if you don't put specific proposals out, you are
not going to get your support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer seized upon a question read by CNN moderator Judy Woodruff
to quip: ``Judy, I think you need to be honest with us. That
questioner that couldn't be here tonight, that wasn't Governor Bush
that asked this question? Because that would not be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he had entered the race on July 1 ``two years late
and $36 million short'' _ a thinly veiled reference to Bush's
staggering campaign treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get a million people to give me $36 dollars, I'll have as
much money as George W. Bush, and I'll win this doggone presidency
for you and you'll have somebody that's beholden only to the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, anticipating that his absence could become the unifying
theme for his rivals, staged damage control from afar with a
hurriedly scheduled pre-debate television interview on WMUR in
Manchester, beamed into the Granite State via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Bush explained that he was forgoing the second New Hampshire
forum to attend a ``once-in-a-lifetime'' award ceremony where his
wife, Laura, was receiving the Distinguished Alumni Award from her
alma mater, Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is important to me,'' Bush said, adding: ``I think
the people of New Hampshire will recognize that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who has been on the road for 80 days so far this year
waging a nationwide campaign, said that he was ``looking forward''
to taking part in the next scheduled GOP debate in Manchester on
Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Bush emphasized that he would be available to the voters of New
Hampshire during a campaign swing next week where he could answer
voters' questions. Bush said he's ``got a lot of work to do'' to
cement support in a state that has a reputation for punching
front-runners in the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would ``take nothing for granted,'' yet he still
believed that ``the people of New Hampshire accept my vision and
want me to be the nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush left New Hampshire for neighboring Vermont just
a few hours before Republican aspirants faced each other at their
first side-by-side forum in Durham. Bush explained that the GOP
session conflicted with his scheduled appearance at a fund-raiser
in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has visited New Hampshire five times this year, vowed
to return to the state next week to deliver an address on
discipline in public schools.

   The debate at Dartmouth College in Hanover was the first
side-by-side appearance of five of the six remaining Republican
presidential candidates since commentator Pat Buchanan bolted to
the Reform Party on Monday and former Red Cross President Elizabeth
Dole withdrew from the race. on Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also touched on tax reform, health care and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates' comments on Bush underscored the stakes in a
volatile state where the latest public opinion poll shows McCain
gaining on Bush, who has visited the state only five times in the
last ten months.
</P>
<P>
   A Research 2000 survey released last weekend showed McCain's
progress in a state where he hopes to dent Bush's front-running
stature in the first in the nation primary on Feb. 1. The latest
survey showed McCain cutting Bush's lead over him in New Hampshire
from 35 percentage points in August to just 12 percentage points
last week. Bush now leads McCain 39 percent to 27 percent compared
to leading McCain 45 percent to 10 percent two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Bush continues to enjoy wider margin over McCain and
other rivals. A CNN/USA Today survey completed on Oct. 10 showed
Bush enjoying the support of 60 percent of the 413 likely GOP
primary voters, compared to 8 percent who supported McCain and 4
percent who favored Forbes.

CHANEL'S U.S.-UNIT PUTS SEVERAL MARKETING EGGS IN YOUNG &AMP; RUBICAM'S
BASKET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American arm of the French couture house Chanel is
fashioning a new relationship with Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc., hiring the
agency company for a wide range of branding, marketing and media
tasks involving its cosmetics and fragrance products.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, to be formally announced Friday, is indicative of
efforts by Madison Avenue to forge closer ties with large blue-chip
marketers that extend beyond traditional advertising into areas
like strategic consulting. Y&AMP;R _ the world's No. 4 agency company
in billings, at $14.7 billion, and No. 5 in revenue, at $1.7
billion _ already works for big advertisers including Cadbury
Schweppes, Citigroup, Colgate-Palmolive and Sears, Roebuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y&AMP;R will be a marketing partner, which is a very exciting
opportunity for us that could grow in a number of different
directions down the road,'' said Arie L. Kopelman, president and
chief operating officer at Chanel Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll coin a phrase, `marketing oversight,' to describe what
Y&AMP;R will do for us,'' he added, ``making sure we move in the right
directions at the right rates of speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetics and fragrance industry ``has never been more
competitive than now,'' Kopelman said. ``There's enormous
consolidation, like all the brands Estee Lauder is buying, and new
channels of distribution like the Sephora stores.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace is so intense, we don't often have the time to stop
and think at some level of depth about making sharp, sure-footed
moves for the future,'' he added. ``Y&AMP;R brings an objective,
third-party way of thinking that we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Effective Jan. 1, Chanel Inc. is awarding the responsibilities
for media planning and buying on its account to the Media Edge, the
media services unit of Y&AMP;R; billings are estimated at $25 million
to $30 million. Those duties had been handled by Optimum Media in
New York, part of the DDB Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   Other units of Y&AMP;R will serve as consultants to Chanel Inc. on
branding and what the company described as ``select new marketing
initiatives.'' Kopelman declined to elaborate, but cited as an
example a recent campaign created in-house for Precision, a line of
cosmetics being marketed with ``a very scientific approach''
compared with the glamour and glitz traditionally associated with
Chanel products.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a project like that, Y&AMP;R can bring a lot to the party,''
Kopelman said, ``an extra dimension of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopelman traced the relationship with Y&AMP;R to what he described
as a chance meeting about a year ago with Ted Bell, vice chairman
and worldwide creative director at Y&AMP;R Advertising; the two had
once worked together at DDB.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mentioned, in a very casual way, this research Y&AMP;R does on
brand assets,'' Kopelman said, referring to the agency's Brand
Asset Valuator, which assesses the strengths and weaknesses of
major brands based on research among consumers around the world,
weighing attributes like relevance, popularity, esteem and
differentiation.
</P>
<P>
   After Y&AMP;R executives presented a valuation of the Chanel brand
assets, ``there were some dimensions we hadn't thought about in our
own research,'' he added. ``Relevance, for example: You can have
all the right images, but how relevant is a brand to a consumer's
life? Can the consumer identify with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Peter A. Georgescu, chairman and chief executive at Y&AMP;R, said
the brand research exemplified the ``new focus on the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this world of excess supply rather than excess demand, the
consumer is more than ever the driving force,'' he added.
Discussing the affluent, style-conscious women who buy Chanel
products, he said: ``For instance, for Chanel, not every woman is
their customer; the Chanel customer's needs are different.
Understanding her special nature is crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Kugelman, chairwoman and chief executive at the New
York office of Y&AMP;R Advertising, will also work on the marketing
tasks for Chanel Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The creative responsibilities for the Chanel Inc. account
continue in-house. The company also collaborates with creative
executives who work for the French parent, like Jacques Helleu,
artistic director at the Chanel couture house, and the directors
Luc Besson and Jean-Paul Goude. Chanel Inc. has also occasionally
used outside agencies like AG Worldwide in New York, formerly
Arnell Group Brand Consulting, as creative resources.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the role Y&AMP;R is playing will expand someday to
encompass tasks like creative or media services outside the United
States, Kopelman replied: ``This is a business where it's all a
moving target. What Y&AMP;R does down the road for us, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Kopelman said, laughing, if all the Y&AMP;R services are
``the whole egg'' _ a phrase the agency company used years ago to
describe the breadth of its offerings _ ``we're the egg-white
omelette.''

   ECONOMY EXPANDS BRISKLY, WITH LABOR COSTS BENIGN
</P>
<P>
   The American economy turned in its best quarterly performance of
the year this summer, expanding at a brisk 4.8 percent annual rate.
That virtually guaranteed enough momentum to carry the nation to
its longest economic expansion in history early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Much to Wall Street's delight, inflation was mild, with the cost
to employers of wages and benefits up only modestly.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, called the economy's recent
growth rate unsustainable but said the rise in long-term interest
rates appeared to be containing the risks of inflation. Addressing
business executives on the pitfalls facing the economy, he gave no
clear signal on whether he planned to raise interest rates for a
third time this year.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS AND BONDS RALLY
</P>
<P>
   Investors eagerly bought stocks in response to the benign labor
report. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 227.64 points, to
10,622.53, The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index surged 45.73
points, to 1,342.44, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 72.70
points, to 2,875.22. The bond market also rallied, with the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbing a full point to a price of
981032.

<P>
   IN LOS ANGELES, A CONTRITE PUBLISHER
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a rebellion by distraught and angry newsroom staff
members, the publisher of The Los Angeles Times, Kathryn M.
Downing, said her own fundamental misunderstanding of editorial
principles led her to sign an agreement sharing the profits of the
Oct. 10 issue of The Times' Sunday magazine with the Staples
Center, which it covered.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS RISE
</P>
<P>
   The rising cost of health insurance is hitting small employers
particularly hard. Premiums for the smallest companies rose 9.2
percent last year, a new survey found.

   CBS EARNINGS TOP EXPECTATIONS
</P>
<P>
   CBS said it earned a better-than-expected $47 million, or 7
cents a share. It cited strong television, radio and outdoor
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   AIG'S PROFIT IS UP 17.6 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   American International Group said it earned $1.27 billion in the
third quarter, a 17.6 percent increase from the same 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WORLDCOM SHOWS STRONG GAINS
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom said that its third-quarter profit more than
tripled as demand for data services surged. The company, which is
acquiring Sprint in what will be the largest corporate takeover
ever, said net income rose to $1.1 billion, or 55 cents a share,
exceeding analysts' forecast of 54 cents. MCI Worldcom shares
surged $6.0625, to $83.625.

 MINUS BUSH, McCAIN STEPS OUT FROM GOP PACK  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Seeking to separate himself from the rest of the
Republican presidential field, Arizona Senator John McCain
repeatedly told an audience of Upper Valley voters Thursday night
that before any of society's problems can be addressed, the special
interests that control the political process must be broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The special interests rule in Washington,'' said McCain, a
staunch proponent of overhauling the way campaigns are funded.
``The big money, the huge six- and seven-figure contributions come
in and we add another loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   From problems with the military, to rewriting the tax code, to
solving America's health-care problems, McCain turned almost every
question back to money in politics during an hourlong town-hall
forum broadcast on WMUR-TV in New Hampshire and on CNN nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the six Republican candidates for president attended the
session at Dartmouth College: Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Utah
Senator Orrin Hatch, Alan Keyes, and McCain. In an evening of
polite discourse, each candidate tried to stress his key point _
Forbes on economic freedom and opportunity, Bauer and Keyes on
improving morality, Hatch on his government experience, and McCain
on reforming government.
</P>
<P>
   The missing candidate was the front-runner, Texas Governor
George W. Bush, who was attending an event in Texas honoring his
wife. It was the second New Hampshire Republican forum he has
skipped in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for the candidates to distinguish
themselves,'' said Steve Duprey, the New Hampshire Republican
chairman. ``A lot of voters haven't met some of the candidates.
This is fabulous for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's forum was also a chance for McCain _ who in
recent weeks has emerged as the chief threat to Bush in New
Hampshire _ to stand out without the presence of the front-runner.
McCain's poll numbers have been rising steadily, and he is drawing
large crowds during his frequent trips to the first-in-the-nation
primary state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great opportunity we're giving them,'' said
Thomas D. Rath, a longtime GOP activist and a top Bush supporter.
``They should thank us.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bush suffered a few more slings Thursday night than he
did last week during a Republican roundtable at the University of
New Hampshire. When a woman told Forbes that she wished she could
ask Bush her question about buying nominations, he agreed with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like you, I share the frustration that Governor Bush is not
here tonight,'' Forbes said, noting that Bush had skipped last
week's get-together in favor of a fund-raiser. He pointed out also
that Bush skipped a visit to a Rhode Island elementary school not
long ago in order to go to a fund-raiser when his plane was
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps in the future if we call this a fund-raiser, he might
show up,'' Forbes said, in one of the toughest barbs of the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who is largely funding his campaign through his vast
private fortune, accused the Republican establishment in Washington
of seeking ``a coronation, rather than a contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night was also notable for the fact that President
Clinton received gentler criticism than he did from his own vice
president during the Democratic town hall meeting the night before.
Hatch commended Clinton for the strong economy, pointing to the
balanced budget and the appointments of Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Vice President Al Gore, responding to a question
about restoring trust in government, said he understood ``the
disappointment and anger that you feel toward President Clinton. I
feel it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also differed from Gore and his challenger Bill
Bradley, who used their time to talk about programs and policies,
by focusing mainly on morals, values, and trying to stand out from
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, for example, pointedly said he has the most experience to
run the country of any candidate running for president _ including
the two Democrats. He said he is worried about the appointment of
judges to the federal bench in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer repeatedly talked about his working class, Kentucky roots,
and his service in the administration of Ronald Reagan. ``America
is a great nation militarily,'' Bauer said. ``It also has a virtue
deficit. If we are going to be a shining city on a hill again, we
need to balance virtue and liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes appeared to agree with Bauer, but presented his concerns
in a sharper, more pessimistic tone. ``This nation is in the worst
moral crisis it has ever faced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the evening, Keyes drew laughs from the audience. He
called for the end of the ``socialist income tax,'' and became so
worked up during a denunciation of the United Nations that he
concluded by saying, ``Sorry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, an African-American, accused reporters of being racist.
He said he wins most of his debates, but the news media's response
``is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I frankly think you all should be ashamed of yourselves,''
Keyes said, before stalking off.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes took credit Thursday night for the popularity of the flat
tax, an idea he championed during the 1996 presidential campaign.
Noting that the idea has gained currency among his fellow
Republicans over the years, he said wryly, ``So, education does
work.''
</P>
<P>
   While the forum provided no real opportunity for the candidates
to engage one another, Bauer took a shot at Forbes over the flat
tax, saying the plan would allow corporations to escape without
paying their fair share. Bauer has been battling Forbes for the
conservative mantle. But Forbes largely ignored Bauer, setting his
sights, instead, on Bush's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was also asked if he would hire qualified men and women
to work in his administration if they are openly gay, or if he
would fire them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will hire people who are qualified for the job, who can do
the work at hand, who are there to get something done, not to make
a statement about a lifestyle,'' Forbes said. ``If they are there
to make a statement, they're not going to get the job.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was McCain who seemed to dominate the hour, sticking to
his message of cleaning up government and reducing the power of
special interests. The only time he got thrown slightly off-stride
occurred when a Hanover man asked him how he reconciles society's
tolerance for alcohol with the problems of legalizing medical
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an excellent question, which I'd prefer to duck,''
McCain joked.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that while there are clearly problems with alcohol,
the nation is losing the war on drugs. ``There was a time when we
were not losing the war, when Nancy Reagan had a very simple
program called `just say no,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But then McCain said he wanted to answer the previous question
about people who travel to Canada and Mexico to buy perscription
drugs. ``I want to say why we can't come up with a decent patient
bill of rights,'' he said. ``Until we reform this campaign-finance
system, we're not going to reach a conclusion.''

 James M. Clash covers mutual funds and adventure travel at
Forbes.  
 By JAMES M. CLASH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The top of the world, the bottom of the ocean, the edges of
space _ all were virgin territory at the beginning of this century.
Now all of them are visited regularly by people who have a sense of
adventure _ not to mention a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on a collective midlife crisis of baby boomers, the
near-tripling of the stock market in five years or other reasons,
but well-heeled adventurers are lining up to see who can take the
most extreme journeys. Many of these travelers want nothing less
than an excursion to the North or South Pole, or the world's
highest mountains. A walk on the Great Wall of China or a glimpse
of the sunrise over Machu Picchu won't do.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence S. Huntington, chairman of Fiduciary Trust
International, a global fund manager, has been on Mount Everest
three times. Max C. Chapman, former chief executive of Nomura
International, has climbed the Matterhorn, and Neil A. Armstrong,
the first man to walk on the moon, flew to the North Pole with Sir
Edmund Hillary, the conqueror of Everest.
</P>
<P>
   For the intrepid, at least in spirit, here are 10 of the most
extreme trips and their costs, excluding round-trip airfare to the
departure points.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Off to Space &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986, killing a
teacher and the six other crew members, so did most people's dreams
of going into space. After the accident, NASA banned civilian
passengers. But because of a handful of entrepreneurs, the dream
may not be lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, Space Adventures of Arlington, Va. (703 524-7172)
and Zegrahm Expeditions of Seattle (206 285-4000), are taking
deposits toward suborbital rides into space (defined as 62 miles
up) for $90,000 and $98,000, respectively. The rides, probably
lasting from 30 minutes to two and a half hours, are scheduled to
begin as early as 2002.
</P>
<P>
   To carry the tourists into space, more than a dozen private
rocket builders, including Rotary Rocket of Mojave, Calif., Kelly
Space and Technology of San Bernardino, Calif., and Vela Technology
Development of Vienna, Va., are scrambling to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the farthest up you can go is 16 miles _ in a
Russian MIG-25 fighter jet _ as long as you have $11,900 and a
plane ticket to Moscow. At that altitude, above 99 percent of
Earth's atmosphere, you can see the blackness of space and Earth's
curvature. You also break the sound barrier, twice over. When I
went on this 35-minute ride in April, we hit Mach 2.6 _ a mile
every two seconds _ on our way to 83,700 feet (Space Adventures and
Incredible Adventures of Sarasota, Fla., 800 644-7382). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To the Top of the Globe &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert Peary, the American explorer, risked his life to become
the first to reach the North Pole in 1909. Now anyone can go in
relative style. In 1992, Quark Expeditions in Darien, Conn. (800
356-5699), began running nuclear-powered icebreakers to the pole;
the price for the two-week cruise from Helsinki, Finland, in a
standard cabin, is $15,950.
</P>
<P>
   For the more adventurous, Northwest Passage (800 732-7328) of
Wilmette, Ill., offers two-week dog sled trips for $25,500,
departing from Resolute Bay, Canada, initially by air, then by
sled. If you're pressed for time, Northwest Passage offers a
``champagne flight'' from Resolute Bay for $10,000, over six days.
</P>
<P>
   I flew to the pole in 1995, but because the ice pack floating
above the pole moves constantly, I had to walk a few yards each
minute just to stay there. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because It's There &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Sir Edmund Hillary climbed Everest with Tenzing Norgay in
1953, he figured that the world's highest peak (29,028 feet) would
finally rest in peace. ``We thought that since we'd climbed it,
people would lose interest,'' said Sir Edmund, now 80.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. More than 700 people have climbed Everest and more than
150 have died trying. The 1996 disasters, in which eight climbers
from different groups perished, became the subject of Jon
Krakauer's best-selling book ``Into Thin Air'' (Villard Books,
1997). And a film, called ``Everest,'' is on its way to becoming
the highest-grossing Imax movie.
</P>
<P>
   Alpine Ascents International in Seattle (206 378-1927) is among
the best for Everest expeditions, and charges $65,000. Needless to
say, the trip is only for experienced mountaineers. And even they
might want to read the sobering Krakauer book first. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conquering the Continents &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first to climb the ``seven summits,'' the highest on each
continent, was Dick Bass, owner of the Snowbird Ski and Summer
Resort near Salt Lake City. When Bass and the late Frank Wells,
president of the Walt Disney Co., went in 1985 (Wells climbed six;
he didn't get up Everest), the experience was novel. ``There wasn't
much of an industry,'' said Bass, now 69. ``We paid the guides'
way, and they were thrilled to go to those remote mountains. It
evolved from there into an industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a package deal is offered: all seven peaks for $97,000
(Mountain Madness, Seattle, 800 328-5925). The same rules about
Everest apply, though, as it is one of the seven. The others:
Aconcagua, 22,834 feet, in South America; McKinley, 20,320 feet,
North America; Kilimanjaro, 19,340 feet, Africa; Elbrus, 18,510
feet, Europe; Vinson, 16,864 feet, Antarctica; Kosciuszko, 7,316
feet, Australia. &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Penguins &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For most of this century, Antarctica was a domain of scientists
and explorers. Now no fewer than a half-dozen outfitters offer
cruises from South America to the world's coldest continent, where
penguins and blue, yellow and white icebergs fascinate tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The truly adventurous go all the way to the South Pole, first
reached in 1911 by Roald Amundsen, a Norwegian. The South Pole is
stable ice over land, and scientists work year-round at its frigid
Amundsen-Scott station.
</P>
<P>
   Adventure Networks International of Beaconsfield, England
(44-149-467-1808) operates flights only from November to January,
warmer months in the Southern Hemisphere ($25,000 to $30,000).
Two-month cross-country ski trips ($45,000) are also available.
</P>
<P>
   During the South Pole's winter, when temperatures plummet to 100
degrees below zero, aircraft cannot fly in or out because metal
landing gears become so brittle that they can snap. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Titanic, the 3-D Version &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the movie wasn't enough, and if you have $35,500 and aren't
too claustrophobic, you can visit the real Titanic, 12,460 feet
below the surface of the North Atlantic. Trips depart from St.
John's, Newfoundland. Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the
moon, went down for a few hours in a submersible in 1997. ``It was
crusty, like gingerbread cake,'' Aldrin, 69, said of the wreckage
(Zegrahm Deep Sea Voyages, 206 285-3743). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meet Me at the Matterhorn &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like a giant shard of glass, beautiful but dangerous, the
Matterhorn juts out of the Italian-Swiss border. The 14,687-foot
peak was not reached until 1865 when Edward Whymper, an Englishman,
led his party to the summit. But of the seven who got there, four
fell to their deaths on the descent.
</P>
<P>
   The Matterhorn is still dangerous; more than 500 climbers have
died there. But the popular Hornli ridge route is surmountable by
fit climbers with intermediate skills. In the summer season, be
prepared to be jostled and delayed by swarms of climbers.
</P>
<P>
   When I climbed it last year, my guide, hearing my complaints,
said: ``You're lucky. On my last Matterhorn trip, I saw one climber
punch another in an argument over a fixed rope.'' The International
School of Mountaineering in North Wales (44-176-689-0441) offers a
weeklong course, lodging and the climb for $2,000.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seclusion, and Then Some &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, only 6,000 tourists visited the tiny kingdom of
Bhutan, bordered by Nepal, China and India. To visit is rare
enough, but only a few Westerners have made the 25-day trek to the
base camps of Masa Gang and Chomolhari, two sacred mountains, and
through the remote town of Laya ($5,395; Geographic Expeditions,
800 777-8183). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Powder Summitry &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you are tired of waiting in the lift lines at Vail or Jackson
Hole, helicopters can drop you at the top of some remote mountains.
Once there, you blaze your own trail down. For a private group of
10, Canadian Mountain Holidays (Calgary, Alberta, 800 661-0252)
charges a total of $105,000 for a week of heli-skiing in British
Columbia's remote Cariboo range.
</P>
<P>
   The big danger on ungroomed trails is avalanche. Kristen Ulmer,
one of the world's best extreme skiers, advised: ``If you're buried
under one, spit. Then dig in the opposite direction that the spit
falls.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meandering on the Slambezi &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zambezi River, which winds its way through Zimbabwe,
Botswana and Zambia, is nicknamed the Slambezi for its Class 4 and
5 rapids. A screaming bargain as adventure trips go ($2,690,
excluding air fare to Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe), a two-week
excursion also includes a three-day canoe safari for viewing
elephants, lions and kadu (Mountain Travel-Sobek, El Cerrito,
Calif., 800 227-2384).

TWENTYSOMETHINGS' LAMENT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The (star) word should be replaced with the symbol)  
 (af)  
 Amy Wu, 23, is a freelance writer based in New York.  
 By AMY WU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The almost overnight success of the Jerry Yangs of America has
made them the symbol of my age group, replacing the goofy Adam
Sandler image that once defined Generation X.
</P>
<P>
   But Silicon Valley success stories like that of Yang, 30, the
co-founder of Yahoo, have given my parents' generation the wrong
impression that all young people are _ or even want to be _ wealthy
owners of the Internet companies commonly called dot-coms,
investors in dot-coms or Wall Streeters who arrange stock offerings
for dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   The reality for most of us, of course, is not all that different
from what the older generation faced: most of my friends and I _
just a few years younger than Yang _ remain mired in college loan
debts and struggle to make ends meet as we try to figure out what
we will do with our lives.
</P>
<P>
   A few of my friends who are analysts or traders or Internet
entrepreneurs live in Manhattan penthouses and dine daily at
restaurants where they are seated back-to-back with celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, after three years spent traveling and working
for news organizations and as a freelance writer in Hong Kong, I
recently returned to my parents' home in suburban New York and
commuted to my job in the city. Usually, I dined out of a brown bag
at lunch time.
</P>
<P>
   And while other twentysomethings may be chauffeured to the
office or arrive in their Porsches, I drove my two-door Toyota to
the train station each dawn, where I was likely to run into a
classmate from high school who had also returned to the nest. They,
too, arrived at the parking lot in second-hand cars and with brown
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, we commiserated about life at the entry level: the
hours spent monitoring fax machines and fixing cappuccino makers.
Most of us studied liberal arts in college or were aspiring actors
or writers; Java, margin calls and E(star)Trade were foreign
territory _ not because they were out of our reach but because we
had chosen not to take that path.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's hard to stay grounded when high-tech nerds are
becoming poster boys for our generation and making it onto the
most-wealthy lists. It's even worse when people who are old enough
to know better look at us as if something has gone awry because
we're not making six figures.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, a middle-aged man I met at a party was stunned
when I told him I was a writer. ``That's weird. Isn't everyone your
age starting their own dot-com,'' he asked, implying that I was
either incredibly ignorant or hopelessly idealistic.
</P>
<P>
   And at a family gathering, soon after I began working as a
producer at a dot-com, the hefty dinner bill was sent my way.
Everyone assumed I was well-fixed because of my job, and too proud
to disappoint them, I clenched my teeth and handed over my credit
card.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most young people live ordinary lives. Many of my
friends have chosen lower-paying jobs like research assistants,
teachers, social workers and even extras in films because they love
what they do and understand that for most of us the ladder of
success must still be climbed rung by rung.
</P>
<P>
   Even those of us making our livings from the Internet mostly
live ordinary lives. At the dot-com where I worked until recently,
there were plenty of younger workers who ate stale pizza and hunted
for roommates.
</P>
<P>
   My stint in HTML-land came to an end as soon as I realized that
money, titles, successful initial public offerings, corner offices
and Porsches were important things, but not important enough to
sustain me beyond my 40s if that wasn't where I wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'm already planning a trip to Asia in a few weeks, and
I'm planning to continue to make my living as a writer _ even if it
only pays me peanuts. At least my relatives won't expect me to pick
up the tab again.

   A Rare Opportunity To Reverse Losses &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service, granting another extension, is
giving taxpayers who last year converted regular individual
retirement arrangements to Roth IRAs a chance to reconsider. Until
Dec. 31, they may switch their accounts back to regular IRAs _
should they wish to do so _ opening up an opportunity for those
whose portfolios have lost value in the recent rocky market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like getting to bet on a horse after the race,''
said Edward A. Slott, a CPA in Rockville Centre, N.Y., and
publisher of Ed Slott's I.R.A. Advisor. There is a drawback,
though, he cautions: the time and expense of filing an amended
return to reclaim the taxes that were paid for tax year 1998 make
the tactic worthwhile only if the loss is substantial.
</P>
<P>
   With a regular IRA, whether the $2,000-a-year kind or a rollover
of a company pension plan that could be hundreds of thousands of
dollars or more, the money is contributed before taxes and
retirement distributions are taxable.
</P>
<P>
   A Roth is the reverse; after-tax money goes in and normally
withdrawals will be tax-free, meaning that the interest, dividends
and capital gains earned in the account escape taxes. But if the
account has a loss, its tax benefit is lost.
</P>
<P>
   In extending the deadline for what it calls recharacterizations,
the IRS said it was acting ``in light of the newness of the Roth
IRA and problems that taxpayers have had applying its rules.'' It
said it was sending notices to 20,000 taxpayers who reported Roth
conversions on 1998 tax returns but who did not meet the
eligibility requirement, most often because adjusted gross income
exceeded $100,000 but in some cases because married couples filed
separate returns.
</P>
<P>
   Slott noted, however, that the extension to recharacterize
applies to anyone who converted to a Roth, not just to those who
did so in error.

   The top 1 percent of Americans are making more and paying a

   The 1.2 million singles and couples who made more than $250,736
in 1997 earned 17.4 percent of all income and paid one-third of
federal income taxes, the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit research
group in Washington, calculated from tax return data.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the top 1 percent made 12.3 percent of all income and
paid 24.8 percent of income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The top tax rate now is 39.6 percent, up from 28 percent in
1987. &QL;

L.A. TIMES PUBLISHER ADDRESSES EDITORIAL CONCERNS ON COMMERCIAL
INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Faced with a rebellion by distraught and angry
staff members, the publisher of The Los Angeles Times described at
a meeting with them Thursday the steps that she intended to take to
keep the news content of the paper free from any appearance of
commercial influence.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in Thursday's paper, its publisher, Kathryn M.
Downing, said that her own ``fundamental misunderstanding'' of
editorial principles led her to sign an agreement sharing the
profits of the Oct. 10 issue of The Times' Sunday magazine with the
Staples Center, the focus of all the articles in that issue.
</P>
<P>
   That acknowledgment and an apology were carried in a news
article in Thursday's business section of The Times on a day when
news and editorial staff members were preparing to question Ms.
Downing and Michael Parks, the newspaper's editor, about any other
financial arrangements that might cast doubt on the newspaper's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked here 21 years, and I've never seen anything so
horrendous, anything that galvanized such a reaction from the
staff,'' said Times reporter Henry Weinstein in an interview.
Referring to a petition that circulated Wednesday protesting the
profit-sharing arrangement, he said, ``The people who signed
believed that executives had crossed a journalistic Rubicon and had
to be brought back from the other side of the river.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff outrage built quickly after the profit-sharing
arrangement was reported in The New York Times on Tuesday and The
Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Mark H. Willes, the chief executive of Times Mirror Co.,
the newspaper's parent, worked 18 months as the newspaper's
publisher, he led an onslaught on the old newspaper practice of
maintaining a figurative wall to insulate news and editorial
employees from its business operations. Ms. Downing, who was
Willes' handpicked successor when he stepped down as publisher last
spring, was quoted in the article as saying that she was trying to
abide by the old practices when she decided not to tell Parks about
the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The 164-page issue of the magazine, built around the opening of
the Staples Center, a $400 million sports and entertainment arena
that civic leaders have heralded as the cornerstone of a downtown
revival, brought in more than $2 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   While newspapers have for years run special sections devoted to
a theme, from fashion and culture to technology or philanthropy, it
is highly unusual for a newspaper to share the profit from such
sections with the subjects of continuing news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 newsroom employees signed a petition earlier this week
saying, among other things, ``As journalists at the L.A. Times, we
are appalled by the paper entering into hidden financial
partnerships on editorial products with the subjects we're writing
about.''
</P>
<P>
   In the article in Thursday's issue of The Times, Parks is quoted
as saying that he found out about the profit-sharing arrangement
after the magazine was printed but before it was distributed.
During the sometimes-tense two-hour meeting with the staff
Thursday, a meeting that virtually emptied out the newsroom, Ms.
Downing and Parks repeatedly apologized, according to three people
who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Ms. Downing's apologies _ characterized by one person
as ``abject'' _ that set the tenor of the gathering. She said it
was ``unacceptable'' to have the newspaper's editorial integrity
questioned and added, ``I am responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them said that a betrayal had occurred and they had
allowed it to occur and they were sorry,'' said one editor who was
there and spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``They said they
understood now that we were operating under a cloud, out from under
which we would have to move ourselves. And they were determined to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The person added, ``What happened here was the business side
deceived the editorial side into betraying its integrity.'' At the
meeting, one staffer wondered out loud why The Times had publishers
without newspaper backgrounds. Ms. Downing replied that she
understood the intent of the question and responded, ``I am not
resigning.''
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Ms. Downing discussed steps to repair the
paper's reputation. Among them, according to another person who
attended the meeting but spoke on the condition of not being
identified, was a commitment not to honor the provisions of the
newspaper's contract with the Staples Center that called for future
revenue-sharing ventures.
</P>
<P>
   She also said business-side employees would be trained in
journalistic principles, and she wanted to spend more time in the
newsroom to acquaint herself with journalistic culture and values,
according to two people who were present.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Downing came to Times Mirror as president and chief
executive of a legal publishing division, Mosby Matthew Bender,
which has since been sold. She became the newspaper's president in
the summer of 1998 and publisher a year later.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's meeting, Ms. Downing also confirmed that she had
discussed a possible special issue of the Sunday magazine, focused
on next summer's Democratic Convention, with members of the civic
group LA Convention 2000. It is unclear if those discussions raised
the possibility of a similar profit-sharing arrangement. Parks told
the group that the project was shelved when he objected to it.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Hubler, a columnist for the Metro section, provoked one of
the meeting's few moments of laughter when she said, ``Why don't we
just say the wall is back?''

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CAUSING BIG SHIFT IN HEALTH CARE COSTS

 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Health insurance companies are starting to pay as much for
prescription drugs as they pay for care of hospitalized patients, a
stunning change in direction for the New York region's health care
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of these rising drug costs are felt at every point,
from the manufacturers battling with Congress and the White House
to the doctor pressured to prescribe a drug preferred by a health
maintenance organization to the shopper at the pharmacy counter who
learns that her asthma medication will cost twice as much as it did
last month.
</P>
<P>
   For the insurance industry, the shift in health care costs is
prompting health maintenance organizations to change the ways
patients pay for drugs, in some cases passing on the increases
directly to consumers, or trying to persuade hospitals to absorb
some of the new burden.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers, faced with rising premiums, are requiring
workers to pay 20 percent of each prescription, rather than
continuing the practice of a fixed co-payment, like $10, every time
they go to the pharmacy. Other businesses have resorted to plans in
which generic drugs cost a certain amount, name-brand drugs
identified by the health plan cost more and some drugs not on a
plan's preferred list are more expensive still. Health maintenance
groups have designed this three-tiered pricing system along the
same model as the HMO alternative in which patients pay more to go
to doctors who do not belong to their network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next generation of drug programs is here in our region,''
said Edward Kaplan, a vice president at Segal Co., a
benefits-consulting firm in New York. ``Employers are being forced
to make changes, because no matter how you slice it, drug prices
are going up and someone has to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   At Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, drugs will represent 15.5
percent of premiums this year, and the cost of hospital care will
be just below 15 percent, said Michael Fedyna, the chief actuary
for Empire. He estimated that three years ago, drugs took 12
percent of premiums and 22 percent went for in-patient care. He
would not translate the increases into a dollar amount. ``Drug
trends have been outstripping any other component of the medical
cost dollars,'' Fedyna said.
</P>
<P>
   The story in New York has been similar to those in other parts
of the country, just later to arrive. Prescription drug prices,
fueled by research and development efforts and Madison Avenue's
attempt to sell the latest and hottest products, have been rising
rapidly in the last few years. At the same time, the increase in
the cost of caring for hospital patients has slowed, as the length
of stays has decreased or outpatient care has become more common.
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturers and many health care experts point to the use
of drugs as a cost-saving measure, saying prescribed drugs have
replaced some expensive medical procedures or reduced bills for
others. For example, high-blood-pressure medications now keep some
patients from having heart bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those advances in medicine, who pays for what
prescriptions is a hot topic for debate.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over drug costs, which in Washington centers on
President Clinton's proposal to offer drug benefits for Medicare
recipients, has several aspects. One discussion is over the drugs
like Viagra and Botox that enhance lives but do not save them:
Should they be included in plans, who ought to pay for what, and
who should regulate the industry to keep price increases in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug issue, if you step back, is the classic
health-care-cost conundrum in miniature,'' said Keith Korenchuk, a
partner and a co-chairman of the health law section at Davis Wright
Tremaine, a Washington law firm. ``There are increasing costs,
technological advances, biotech creations that are life-style
enhancing, and the demand from the consumer,'' he said. ``And then,
you have the providers and payers in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies and legislators, who have been focused on
the costs of doctors' fees and hospitals' charges, are now
directing more of their attention to drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prescription prices are a very large concern,'' said Leslie
Moran, senior vice president for the New York Health Plan
Association, a trade group for managed care plans. ``Plans are
looking at ways to offset some of these cost increases, which may
get pushed back on consumers, whether it is a health plan not
covering Claritin anymore in favor of another drug, or plans that
go to a multitiered payment structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxford Health Plans, which provides insurance for subscribers in
New York and New Jersey, has been offering three three-tiered
systems to its small employers since the beginning of the year.
Under the plan, employees pay three different prices for each drug
they buy: from $5 to $7 for generics, $15 to $20 for a drug that
the insurance company has negotiated a good rate with, and $35 to
$50 for drugs in neither basket.
</P>
<P>
   Larger employers have said that they, too, would like this plan,
but Oxford is awaiting approval from New York state to offer it, a
spokeswoman for the company said. Plans that require consumers to
pay a percentage of prescription costs rather than a flat rate are
also gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are also starting to feel the increase in drug costs.
The Greater New York Hospital Association said drug costs had risen
14 percent this year, compared with five years ago, when the
increases were closer to 7 percent. Drug price increases account
for part of the rise, but increased drug use accounts for far more,
said Bill Larkin, vice president of pharmacy service for the
association.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more drug therapies now for illnesses that just a
few years ago gave doctors limited options. ``Drugs used to be 5
percent of a total hospital budget five years ago,'' Larkin said.
``Now, it is approaching 10 percent, and I don't see this trend
reversing itself.''
</P>
<P>
   To try to contain the rising costs, insurance companies and
hospitals are exploring whether to limit the amount of money spent
per patient on drugs administered during their stays. To do that,
some insurers want hospitals to absorb the losses when the cost of
a patient's drugs exceeds the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been timid about doing it,'' said Ruth Levin, vice
president in charge of managed care for Continuum Health Partners,
which runs Beth Israel and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.
``We have not yet come up with a price that gives us that comfort
level. Typically, the margin they give us is too small to take the
risk, knowing that the cost in pharmaceuticals is rising.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, where doctors and hospitals accepted caps on drug
costs and assumed the risks in the early 1990s, losses were so
great that some doctor groups went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The sticky issue of access has arisen in the debate over the
costs of new drugs. With the huge growth in advertising for
prescription drugs, consumers have come to clamor for specialty
drugs as if they were designer jeans. They are luxuries they cannot
live without, like wrinkle-removing injections; or else they are
seen as a way to fix seemingly intractable medical problems, even
when not needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I warn medical departments that it is not the price side that
will get them,'' but overuse of drugs, said Larkin. He described a
new anti-inflammatory drug that does not severely irritate the
stomach, a common but not universal side effect of such drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be derelict to say they will replace all old
therapies with this one,'' he said. ``They do have their place, but
in what indications and what populations? Those with ulcers. Those
over 65. You have to start setting criteria.''

AMA AND 6 OTHERS SET UP MEDICAL INTERNET COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Medical Association and six other medical societies
said Thursday that they had created an Internet company that,
starting next year, will publish consumer information on health
care and help doctors set up their own medical Web sites to
communicate with patients by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Medem.com, a for-profit company, enters a crowded field of
Internet medical information companies that includes DrKoop.com,
Healtheon and Medscape, as well as 17,000 other World Wide Web
sites devoted to health care information.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Fotsch, a former emergency-room physician from
Sausalito, Calif., who is Medem's chief executive, said doctors
need a reliable source of information for patients, and by bringing
together seven medical societies, the company would provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical Web sites provide information that ``is great, some
is so-so and some of it will probably kill you if you follow it,''
Fotsch remarked. Doctors, he said, ``certainly don't have the time
to read every page of information from an Internet start-up
company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to refer patients,'' he continued, ``you have
to have confidence in that information, sight unseen.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Healtheon and Medscape said their medical
information was developed under the same standard that Medem
proposes to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of who trusts what, our track record shows we are
trusted,'' said Dr. George Lundberg, editor in chief of Medscape,
which he said had 300,000 doctors and 1.2 million other users.
Lundberg, a former editor of the Journal of the American Medical
Association, noted that he was instrumental in formulating those
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon said it was ``the pre-eminent source of trusted
content for physicians and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Upah, chief operating officer of DrKoop.com, said his
site had become the leading medical information Web site by posting
medical content reviewed by other doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Medem will get its editorial content through a separate,
nonprofit organization called called Medem E, a separation intended
to insure its integrity, said Dr. William Mahood of Abington, Pa.,
an AMA trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Five percent of Medem is owned by a charity, called the Medem
Trust, that will use its profits to provide health care to the
poor, Fotsch said.
</P>
<P>
   While Medem is owned by the seven medical societies, Fotsch said
he expected other professional societies to join, with groups
representing osteopaths and chiropractors to apply to be owners.
``The board wants to be inclusive,'' he said, adding that the
company's charter banned only tobacco companies from involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he said, ownership stakes may be sold to investors
or even to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The imprimatur of major medical societies, representing more
than 400,000 of the nation's 650,000 doctors, is likely to help
Medem attract both advertisers and providers of health care
services.
</P>
<P>
   It may also have links to other sites like Healtheon, which
wants to digitize the paperwork now required of doctors and
patients to collect insurance payments, issue and renew
prescriptions, and store treatment records. Until last week, Fotsch
was a vice president of Healtheon, which was hired by the medical
societies to draw up the Medem business plan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the AMA, the other Medem owners are the American
College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; the American Academy of

UMPIRES TO VOTE ON PHILLIPS' FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fight over Richie Phillips, who has represented
major league umpires for 20 years, will end Nov. 30. The
pro-Phillips faction among the umpires and the insurgent group that
bolted from his mass resignation strategy reached agreement
Thursday for the National Labor Relations Board to conduct a mail
ballot on the umpires' labor representative.
</P>
<P>
   The board's New York office will mail ballots to 93 umpires Nov.
5 and count the returned ballots on Nov. 30. The umpires will have
three choices on the ballot: the existing union, a new union or no
union. The choice that receives a majority of the votes cast will
win.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgent group, a person close to some of its members said,
is confident it has enough votes to prevail. Going into the
election, the group would need at least 47 votes to ensure victory.
If some umpires were to vote for no union, it would be conceivable
that neither the existing union, the Major League Umpires
Association, nor the new group would receive a majority. A second
ballot then would have to be sent to the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   The Major League Umpires Independent Organizing Committee
petitioned the labor relations board to hold the election as a way
of ousting Phillips as the umpires' lawyer and labor negotiator. He
has three years remaining on a contract the umpires awarded him
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The election will be critical because the umpires' labor
agreement with baseball expires Dec. 31. As sharply divided as they
are, the umpires would face a near impossible task to negotiate a
new contract with Major League Baseball. The independent group has
acknowledged the gains Phillips has made for umpires but feels his
methods are no longer appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two umpires lost their jobs after they signed letters of
resignation last July 14 and Phillips submitted them to the league
office the next day. More than 50 umpires signed the letters, but
many quickly rescinded their resignations. The leagues hired 25 new
umpires, prompting the American League to accept the resignations
of nine umpires and the National League 13.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the two sides in the intraunion fight agreed that
all of the umpires would be permitted to vote without challenge,
including the 22 who lost their jobs and the 25 who were hired.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called independent umpires have invited all umpires to a
meeting in Baltimore next Tuesday. They chose Baltimore as the site
because it is the home of Ron Shapiro, the lawyer who has been
advising them, and Joel Smith, another lawyer, who has represented
them for the labor relations board election.

BAGS SITTING AT AIRPORT POINT WAY TO FINDING 200,000 TABLETS OF
ECSTASY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three hard-sided suitcases sitting unclaimed at
Newark International Airport after a flight from Amsterdam last
Friday attracted the curiosity of customs inspectors. Searching the
suitcases, they found 200,000 tablets of MDMA, a mind-altering
stimulant popularly known as Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   The record seizure of the tablets _ 106 pounds _ illustrated how
the party drug, made in the Netherlands, is flooding the New York
area, where it fetches high prices on the Manhattan club circuit.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the U.S. Customs Service has reported seizing
more than 1.7 million doses of Ecstasy in the New York area,
including the shipment caught at Newark. By comparison, customs
inspectors and agents intercepted 233,000 Ecstasy doses locally in
1997 and only 94,400 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's predominately coming to New York,'' said John C. Varrone,
director of investigative operations for customs on the East Coast.
``New York and Miami are clearly arrival points, but we're seeing
distribution networks going to California.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Rice Jr., the special agent in charge of the Drug
Enforcement Administration's operation in New York, described the
local growth in the smuggling and abuse of Ecstasy as significant.
The traffickers, Rice said, ``are multinational, multilingual and
extremely mobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs agents who tracked the unclaimed suitcases at Newark
Airport arrested three Dutch visitors from Amsterdam. They were
identified as Hendrikus Van-Zyp, 54; his wife, Maria Van-Zyp Landa,
46, and Willem Van Derkraan, 51.
</P>
<P>
   The flight carrying their luggage was overbooked, so they were
bumped to later flights. Thomas Manifase, the assistant special
agent in charge of customs investigations in Newark, said that when
the Van-Zyps arrived at their hotel in Queens, they asked the
airline to deliver their suitcases. Customs agents obliged, and
arrested them on Friday night. Van Derkraan was arrested on Sunday
when he claimed his suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   For smuggling the drugs, Manifase said, the three suspects were
promised $10,000 each and a free trip to Aruba. The suspects face
up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Mrs. Van-Zyp Landa told
investigators that she had terminal cancer and expected to live
only a few more months.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Ecstasy tablets reaching New York have been traced
to the Netherlands, where Dutch police officers have closed more
than 35 clandestine laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   In July, American and Dutch law enforcement officials arrested
two other Dutch nationals and broke up a ring that hired young
Hasidic men to smuggle Ecstasy tablets into New York from
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli organized crime dominates the trafficking in Ecstasy,
investigators say. Earlier this month, the Israeli authorities
working with the Dutch police arrested nearly 50 trafficking
suspects and seized a million doses of Ecstasy. An Israeli agent
went undercover in the Netherlands to infiltrate the network.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy appeals to traffickers because it is so lucrative.
Varrone said each tablet cost only a penny or two to make but
brought $25 or $30 at retail. ``The markup in dollars makes it more
profitable than heroin,'' Varrone said. Rice said the wholesale
price for Ecstasy in the New York area was $2 a tablet.
</P>
<P>
   MDMA stands for the chemical compound
methylenedioxymethamphetamine and was first synthesized in Germany
as a potential appetite suppressant. Ecstasy promotes euphoria,
breaks down inhibitions and delivers mellow hallucinations,
prompting users to consider it harmless. But The Lancet, a British
medical journal, reported last week that babies born to women who
took Ecstasy early in pregnancy had a higher rate of birth defects.

BUSH'S ABSENCE A BOOST FOR MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ As the five Republican presidential candidates
appeared at a nationally televised forum here Thursday night, they
didn't just advocate contrasting views. They offered an outline of
the way the missing man, Texas Governor George W. Bush, could run
into serious political trouble in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Like marksmen aiming at a limited number of targets, each of the
five GOP candidates appealed directly to a sizable slice of the
electorate in the first-primary state, from the antitax
conservatives, to the antiabortion movement, to Independents who
can choose to vote in the GOP primary. If even some of those
appeals are successful, the Bush vote may be squeezed from several
sides, and his front-runner standing could fade.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has risen steadily to second
place in the polls, may have gained the most from the opportunity
the town-meeting format offered to make just that sort of focused
appeal. The first question of the night was whether those favoring
abortion rights should be welcomed into the Republican Party, and
it played into McCain's hands as he appealed to voters in this
state where a majority of people back such rights.
</P>
<P>
   McCain responded in a way clearly designed to resonate with
moderate Republicans as well as Independents who favor abortion
rights. While assuring conservatives that he is opposed to
abortion, McCain said, ``I worry a great deal about the unintended
consequences about sending a message that we are not an
inclusionary party.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also benefited because none of the other White House
prospects aimed their criticism at him, leaving him unscarred as
the second-place candidate. Instead, the only direct clash of the
night came between former Reagan aide Gary Bauer and publisher
Steve Forbes. Bauer said that his plan for a 16 percent flat tax
would help working people better than Forbes' 17 percent plan,
prompting Forbes to respond: ``Gary, you are wrong.'' Both Bauer
and Forbes are seeking votes from a similar slice of the
electorate, antiabortion conservatives who favor a flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the candidates benefited from being on the same stage
without Bush and before a nationally televised audience, with more
than 300 members of the news media on hand to report the event.
Particularly for the candidates who now barely register in the
polls, such as Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, it was the best chance
yet to publicize their views.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, whose game plan in the session was to go after Bush, got
a break when a questioner regretted that she was being forced to
address Forbes instead of Bush on the question of campaign
financing. Forbes said he shared the frustration that Bush didn't
appear, adding acidly that the Texas governor might have come if
the forum had been cast as a chance to raise more campaign
cash.``Perhaps in the future if we call this a fund-raiser, he
might show up,'' Forbes jibed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who chose to attend a Dallas award ceremony for his wife,
Laura, clearly had the most to lose. Bush's absence played into the
hands of those who say the governor is a fragile front-runner, who
looks strong now but could easily start to tumble.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-minute forum at Dartmouth College also underscored that
there are several races going on within the Republican field. There
is the race to be an alternative to Bush, the race to be the
leading social conservative candidate, and the race to be the
leading moderate alternative.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps most important, there is the race for the
Independent vote, which could determine the winner of both the GOP
and Democratic primaries. Some analysts say McCain and Democrat
Bill Bradley are likely to compete most heavily for the Independent
vote. In the GOP race, that means that McCain could add thousands
of votes to his total, while Bush is expected to draw his support
mostly from Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has been low in the in New Hampshire polls all year
despite campaigning here nonstop since his failed 1996 effort. He
delivered a pitch that theoretically should resonate with New
Hampshirites, highlighting his 17 percent flat-tax plan. Just hours
before the forum, the state Legislature rejected a proposal for an
income tax to pay for education programs, hewing to New Hampshire's
tradition as an antitax bastion.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes's biggest impact in the race is likely to come in a
few weeks, when he is expected to launch a series of advertisements
accusing Bush of raising taxes in Texas. Forbes hopes that such
attacks help his own campaign, but the effort may mostly serve to
soften up Bush. That is similar to what happened in 1996, when
Forbes unleashed a broadcast broadside against Bob Dole, which hurt
the Kansas senator and helped Patrick Buchanan win the primary.

MAIN ISSUE AT GOP DEBATE: NO BUSH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Capitalizing on his surge in the polls,
Republican presidential candidate John McCain used a televised town
hall meeting Thursday to stress his political independence and
underscore his belief that political change must be preceded by
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The special interests rule in Washington, D.C.,'' the U.S.
senator from Arizona said at the end of an hourlong debate
sponsored by CNN and WMUR-TV of Manchester, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer, Orrin Hatch and Alan Keyes
fielded questions from a Dartmouth College audience that ranged
from legalization of marijuana to funding of the space program.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of Texas Gov. George W. Bush itself was a
participant in the forum. WMUR gave Bush a statewide platform to
explain his decision to skip the event: His wife, Laura, received a
Distinguished Alumnus Award from her alma mater, Southern Methodist
University in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his rivals took pointed shots at Bush, but the most
direct criticism came from an audience member who said she wished
she could direct a question about prodigious fund-raising to the
one candidate who was not there. Bush has raised far more money
than any of his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, a magazine publisher, pounced on the question, telling
the woman that ``I share your frustration that Governor Bush is not
here tonight.'' He noted that Bush missed a debate last week
because he had to attend a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we called this a fund-raiser he might show up tonight,''
said Forbes, who his financing his own campaign primarily from his
own substantial wealth. Bush, whose campaign has raised $60
million, has been blamed for forcing several other candidates,
including Elizabeth Dole, out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush requested the televised interview to explain his absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I regret missing the debate and getting a chance to
talk about what I believe in New Hampshire, I really don't regret
missing the opportunity to honor my wife,'' he said. Bush was
seated next to his wife Laura, who acknowledged that the couple
would have been able to ``work it out'' if the governor wanted to
go to New Hampshire to participate in the forum.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had been well received in the state whenever he
visited and had agreed to participate in a Dec. 2 debate in
Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   But Dartmouth political science Professor Constantine Spilliotes
said he didn't believe Bush had been severely hurt by not attending
the town meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a wait-and-see attitude,'' Spilliotes said,
noting that McCain ``might get a little bit of a bump but I don't
think he stood out as much as some thought he might.``
</P>
<P>
   McCain clearly had the most to gain or lose. Polls in the state
show up him inching up on Bush with his maverick stands on issues
such campaign finance reform appealing to many independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain played to those voters, stressing that contributions from
special interests had made it impossible for the major parties to
reach consensus on such important issues as health care, tax and
defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican forum did not produce any high moments of drama
or elements of surprise as the candidates remained largely civil.
There was even a surprising lack of criticism toward the Democrats
and the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative activists Gary Bauer actually chided his own party
for not cooperating with the Democrats in approving a strong bill
aimed at regulating managing care companies. Bauer said he agreed
with Democrats' contention that consumers should have a right to
sue their HMOs, a proposal opposed by many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And Hatch, a U.S. senator from Utah, credited former Clinton
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin for improving the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even conservative firebrand Alan Keyes said that he didn't
believe the federal government should halt funding of the space
program saying that such exploration was akin to the westward
expansion of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On the divisive social issues such as abortion, McCain said that
although he opposed the procedure he believed ``there must be a
dialogue and discussion on the issue.'' But McCain also told one
questioner that he opposed legalization of marijuana for medicinal
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of hiring openly gay workers, Forbes said he would
``hire people who are qualified for the job, people who are there
to get something done not to make a political statement.``
</P>
<P>
   McCain also tried to diffuse recent reports that he has an
uncontrollable temper saying ``people say McCain gets angry.'' But
McCain said he gets upset at congressional approval of expensive
military projects that the armed services don't want, while
military personnel don't earn enough to feed their families.
</P>
<P>
   McCain advisors have blamed the reports about his temper on the
Bush campaign. They say Bush is trying to dampen his rise in the
polls, particularly in New Hampshire where the Arizona senator
poses a threat to the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   A Research 2000 poll published last week by the Concord Monitor
had Bush leading with 39 percent, followed by McCain with 27
percent in New Hampshire. In August the same poll had Bush with 42
percent and McCain at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To build on that momentum, the McCain campaign announced they
would begin airing their first television commercials in the state,
spots that recount the former Navy pilot's ordeal being shot down
over Vietnam and held as a prisoner of war for more than five
years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain advisors refused to say whether the spots were intended
to draw a contrast with Bush's military experience during the
Vietnam War. Bush served in the Texas Air National Guard at
Ellington Air Base. Lt. Gov. Ben Barnes may have been asked by a
family friend to help Bush get into the unit that included other
sons of high-profile Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Before the town hall meeting began, Forbes attacked Bush and
said the governor's excuses for ducking appearances with the other
candidates ``won't wash, '' with the state's voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just underscores that one candidate thinks he can play by
his own rules,'' said Forbes. Campaigning in Claremont in the
morning Forbes mocked the governor's response for not showing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to say his wife had a commitment and he made a
commitment to her. Blah. Blah, Blah,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apparently made no effort to have the SMU event changed
when he found out about the New Hampshire debates.
</P>
<P>
   SMU spokeswoman Janet Ragland said the event honoring four
prominent Texans had been scheduled ``months and months ago'' and
that none of the honorees had indicated that the date was
inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will be in New Hampshire next week, where among
other things he will stress his support for charter schools.

ON A SAD AND MISTY MORNING, FOND RECOLLECTIONS OF STEWART
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was a day of golf and another day of grieving.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of the Tour Championship began with a moving
memorial service for Payne Stewart that was brief, yet powerful. As
most of the 29 players in the field sat silently behind the first
tee at 7:45, a bagpiper appeared through the morning mist, walked
up the first fairway and played a Scottish hymn entitled ``Going
Home.''
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, Tom Lehman, one of Stewart's teammates at
the Ryder Cup a month ago, gave an eloquent speech that summed up
how much his 42-year-old golfing buddy would be missed following
his death Monday in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne was an emotional guy,'' Lehman said in part, pausing
several times to compose himself. ``He wasn't ashamed to cry, so
I'm not going to be ashamed of my tears this morning. When he died
Monday, a big part of us died too.''
</P>
<P>
   During Lehman's remarks, many others cried. Then the bagpiper
played ``Amazing Grace'' before walking down the fairway, ending a
service that set the tone for a day of wide-ranging emotions.
</P>
<P>
   When the day ended, 27 holes had been completed, and Davis Love
3rd was the leader at 7-under par, one stroke ahead of Tiger Woods
and two strokes ahead of Carlos Franco, Fred Funk and Steve Pate.
</P>
<P>
   The only troublesome news from the golf course involved Woods,
who injured his left arm on No. 15 when he struck a rock with his
club as he tried to hit a ball that was wedged against the base of
a tree. He finished his round and insisted he would be fine, but
played the final three holes grimacing whenever he took a full
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday will be remembered not for the competition, but for the
tragic circumstances surrounding it. Even Love, who played well
enough to lead, had trouble remembering his round, thinking more
about Stewart and the funeral that will be held Friday morning in
Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament will be suspended Friday as Stewart's family,
friends and fellow players say goodbye in Florida. It will resume
with 27 more holes on Saturday and the final 18 on Sunday. Under
the circumstances, being in first place hardly mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a tough time gathering up enough emotion to play,'' said
Love, who lost his father in a 1988 plane crash. ``You shouldn't be
out there playing golf with tears in your eyes. Some guys might not
want to do it again after today. But I think being together might
be more important than packing it in and going home.''
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible, however, to escape the memories. Players wore
black ribbons on their hats, and in the most unusual gesture of
tribute, Bob Estes used a putter on his first tee shot, hitting the
ball 16 feet off the tee, which led to a double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The putt was somewhat symbolic of the putt that Payne made to
win the U.S. Open,'' said Estes, who dressed in black from head to
toe. ``Payne and I had become much better friends in the last six
or seven months. Maybe he got a little chuckle out of it.'
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price could not resist poking just a little fun at Estes'
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously felt like he was doing something that made him
feel good for doing it,'' Price said. ``I often think, if Payne was
around, what would he have wanted? If something happened to me, I'd
want all of the guys to go out and birdie the first hole, say,
`This one's for you, Bud,' then have 20 beers in the locker room
afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Love managed to smile a few times on the course, but the good
feelings didn't last.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of chastise yourself every time you'd have fun
today,'' Love said. ``Part of me says we shouldn't be playing, but
then the other part says we need to be out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Love also sustained an injury Thursday, to his left shoulder,
but he did not think it was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started losing some shots and hitting it shorter,'' said
Love, who had nine birdies and two bogeys in his 27 holes.
``Sometimes I play better when I've got something on my mind, or
I'm hurt. I was just trying to get through. Don't get me wrong,
this is a big golf tournament. But it just doesn't have the same
excitement to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Funk was visibly moved by the morning service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave a strange start to the tournament, with emotions
flying so high, or really so low,'' he said. ``I concentrated, but
I could never get Payne out of my mind when I was playing. I know
that he would have wanted us to play. There is no question. It was
the best thing. As a group, we needed to play and go through this
together.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, the players attending Stewart's funeral will face
another difficult day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are thinking about tomorrow,'' Price said. ``I
know I am. It wasn't an easy day. We are all still missing him.''

OFFER FOR AIR CANADA TO EXCLUDE AMERICAN STAKE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Faced with virtually certain defeat of its plan to buy
Canada's two major airlines and merge them, Onex Corp. raised its
offer Thursday for Air Canada by more than half and took steps to
ensure that a new, merged carrier is Canadian-controlled by
removing American Airlines as an important partner.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Schwartz, chairman and chief executive of Onex, said his
efforts to promote a plan announced in August to consolidate Air
Cath Canadian Airlines had encountered two formidable
obstacles _ insufficient support from Air Canada shareholders and
opposition to part-ownership by a U.S. carrier. Schwartz said
public and political opinion would only support a merged airline
that ``was unquestionably owned, managed and controlled in
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, American's parent, AMR Corp., which was to have
owned 15 percent of the merged airline, will have no interest under
the revised offer. It has agreed to withdraw financial backing to
Onex and, if the merger plan succeeds, sell its current 33 percent
equity interest in Canadian Airlines. American would continue to
have a relationship with the new carrier through the One World
global alliance, which coordinates schedules, sales and ticketing.
</P>
<P>
   By offering its revised proposal Thursday, Onex has provided
just enough time under securities regulations for the offer to be
voted on by Air Canada shareholders at a meeting to be held on Nov.
8. Shareholders were to vote on the original plan, one that
industry analysts think would have been defeated mainly because Air
Canada countered with a more attractive initiative nine days ago.
Under that deal, it would have taken over Canadian Airlines and run
it as a separate carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Onex's proposal requires approval by two-thirds of the holders
of Air Canada's voting and nonvoting shares.

IBM TO ANNOUNCE NEW, FLEXIBLE TRANSISTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heralding an era in which computers, and especially computer
displays, can blend into the fabric of everyday life, IBM
researchers will report Friday that they have developed flexible
transistors that can be embedded in curved surfaces or even in
thin, foldable materials.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough promises products ranging from electronic
newspapers and magazines that could be folded and tucked into a
briefcase or shirt pocket to big computer screens that could unfold
from cellular phones or other hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   The advance, made by a group of scientists at the company's T.J.
Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., will be reported
in Friday's issue of the journal Science. It is considered
significant because by combining organic and inorganic materials
for the first time, IBM scientists think that they will be able to
achieve both low manufacturing costs and high performance.
</P>
<P>
   Transistors, the fundamental ingredient in computer circuits,
are generally etched in silicon, a rigid, inorganic material. And
although researchers have found ways to fabricate transistors from
organic materials in the past, the complexity and high cost of the
processes involved made mass production impractical.
</P>
<P>
   IBM officials said Thursday that their researchers had, for the
first time, managed to combine inorganic and organic materials.
This approach could quickly lead to a new generation of inexpensive
computer displays that are either flexible or embedded within
curved plastic, glass or other materials.
</P>
<P>
   Like today's semiconductor chips, wholly inorganic
semiconductors require processing at high temperatures, making it
impossible to embed circuits in plastic or other heat-sensitive
materials. But IBM's new hybrid materials ``self-assemble,''
crystallizing from a liquid solution at low temperatures to form
alternating organic and inorganic layers of material with the
correct semiconducting properties.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to computers and flat-panel displays, the
researchers suggested that the technology might have applications
in solar cells, making such devices easier to transport.

KNOBLAUCH, WEAK LINK, HAS STRONG ROLE
</HEADLINE>

 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chuck Knoblauch had to sit down to keep talking. He
was too drained to stand any longer. It was evident Wednesday night
in the way he methodically unlaced his cleats, the way he slowly
pulled off his uniform and the way he barely budged when Clay
Bellinger swooped in and kissed him on the forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks,'' said Knoblauch, a response that was more rote than
reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   There was relief mixed into Knoblauch's world, too, after the
New York Yankees had completed their World Series sweep of the
Atlanta Braves. More than any other Yankee, Knoblauch had been
pinpointed as the player who could make a defensive mistake in the
postseason to damage the team's potentially splendid sprint. More
than any other Yankee, Knoblauch was a target.
</P>
<P>
   The bull's eye belonged on Knoblauch because he had turned the
routine act of throwing a baseball from second base to first base
into a daily rendition of show and tell. Except that it was throw
and yell: Knoblauch threw and fans yelled for him to please throw
it accurately. He did not always oblige.
</P>
<P>
   But there sat Knoblauch, with matted hair, with red blotches
across his face from too many champagne dousings, with a hoarse
voice, with a fatigued body and with another finger waiting for a
World Series ring. Knoblauch is still a terrific and patient
leadoff hitter, and he was a tremendous catalyst in the four-game
conquest of the Braves, contributing two game-altering at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Knoblauch if he felt courageous for overcoming the
throwing problem that could have sabotaged the Yankees' season. The
barrel-chested second baseman, who conquered his woes when it
counted most, shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever is going on in my life, whether it's struggling
offensively or struggling with the throws, I just got to do the
best I can do,'' Knoblauch said. ``If that's courage, if getting
knocked down and then being able to get back up and hold your head
high, if that's courage, then I guess that's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was uncomfortable praising himself or gloating as he
sat in a victorious clubhouse, but the evidence was undeniable.
While Knoblauch committed 28 errors in the regular and postseason _
while he gave manager Joe Torre headaches and made first baseman
Tino Martinez feel like Dominik Hasek _ the Yankees did not suffer
from them. They won 11 of 12 postseason games, and Knoblauch hit
.283 with four runs batted in, nine runs scored and two errors. As
Torre often said, he gave more than he gave back.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Knoblauch was rescued by two controversial umpiring
decisions in the American League Championship Series against the
Red Sox, neither had to do with his spotty throwing. One came on a
dropped ball at second and the other on a missed tag. Both calls
were somehow ruled in the Yankees' favor. Knoblauch did make
several erratic throws, causing Torre to finally bench him in the
later innings starting with Game 5 of the ALCS. Knoblauch accepted
the decision, even suggesting that he might see a hypnotist in the
off-season to address his throwing problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great feeling this year because it was a little
tougher road,'' Knoblauch said, speaking personally and
collectively. ``Sometimes when the road is a little bit rocky, it
makes it sweeter in the end. This is almost like a dream. To be
able to do the things we did, especially against a team like the
Braves, is really unheard of. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was instrumental in that, with two of the most
important at-bats of the Series, one a bunt and one a homer. With
the Yankees trailing, 1-0, and runners on first and second in the
eighth inning of Game 1, Knoblauch pushed a bunt between Greg
Maddux and first baseman Brian Hunter to fill the bases. The
Yankees scored four runs in the inning and took quick control of
the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Three nights later, Tom Glavine was clinging to a 5-3 lead in
the eighth inning of Game 3 at Yankee Stadium. The Braves
desperately needed a victory to have any chance of coming back in
the Series, but Knoblauch ripped a fly ball to right field that
tipped off the glove of a leaping Brian Jordan for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball went 315 feet,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox lamented.
``That was a Yankee Stadium home run.''
</P>
<P>
   What was Knoblauch's reaction to Cox's slight?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I hit it at Yankee Stadium,'' he said cheerily.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees returned to the Stadium for Game 4 on Wednesday, and
Knoblauch described how the players talked about ``closing it out''
and ``holding that trophy tonight,'' which they did. Knoblauch's
infield single initiated a three-run rally against John Smoltz,
Roger Clemens started and soared, Mariano Rivera closed and
Knoblauch finally and gallantly eliminated a nagging bull's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to judge yourself and to have an opinion on
yourself,'' Knoblauch said. ``People can say things about you or
have an opinion about you, but the only thing that I can do is work
as hard as I can. If someone called this courageous, that's fine.''

FAA PROPOSES NEW RULES FOR SAFER FUEL TANKS ON PLANES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to the explosion of a TWA jetliner that
killed 230 people off Long Island in 1996, the federal government
proposed rules on Thursday that would tighten design and
maintenance standards for fuel tanks on aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The rules proposed by the Federal Aviation Administration are
intended to prevent a disaster like the one that destroyed Trans
World Airlines Flight 800 on July 17, 1996, the agency said. The
fiery end of the Boeing 747 was initially thought to be the result
of a bomb, but many investigators later attributed the explosion to
an accidental ignition in the center fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, the FAA would basically call on aircraft
manufacturers to review how they design and make fuel tanks, and on
the airlines to develop regular maintenance programs for tanks,
assuming they do not already have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action represents a fundamental change in how fuel tanks
are designed, maintained and operated,'' the FAA administrator,
Jane F. Garvey, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's own estimate of the cost of the program, $170
million throughout the industry over a decade, suggested something
less than revolutionary, and a spokesman for the Boeing Co. said
there would be no need to ground planes flying now.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules do not contain any of the radical changes
that some airline safety experts have discussed since Flight 800
blew up. These include using less flammable fuel and pumping inert
gases into fuel tanks to minimize vapors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to study that,'' an FAA spokeswoman, Kathryn
B. Creedy, said on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, which are subject to a 90-day comment period and a
year of review before taking effect, would cover some 6,000
aircraft with 30 or more seats _ in other words, many of the
aircraft most familiar to frequent commercial travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Creedy said the proposed rules were the fruit of ``thousands
of man-hours of research and development since Flight 800.''
</P>
<P>
   The standards would require manufacturers to review the designs
of their fuel-tank systems to insure that failures could not create
ignition sources within the tanks. Tougher standards for new
aircraft would be required, intended to minimize the chance of
fuel-tank vapors, and aircraft companies would be called on to help
airlines develop maintenance programs for fuel systems.
</P>
<P>
   And the standards would require aircraft makers to ``provide a
means to prevent catastrophic damage if ignition does occur.''
</P>
<P>
   That language seemed to be a reference to the last moments of
Flight 800, which many investigators said was doomed the instant a
spark set off the vapors in its center tank.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations after July 17, 1996, highlighted not only the
hazards of fuel-tank vapors but also uncovered ways that sparks
could be created by chafed wires and various tiny parts housed
within the center fuel tanks of a jumbo jetliner. The center tank
on the Boeing 747 that was designated Flight 800 contained
relatively little fuel, and thus had more room for vapors to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   John Dern, a Boeing spokesman, said his company welcomed the
proposals in principle and would be filing comments. ``In some
cases,'' Dern said, ``these are systems that have been in service
for 30 or 40 years, so we're confident they're safe. But we've also
learned some things in the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was confident that the rules, whatever their final
form, would not result in wholesale grounding. He based his
confidence, he said, on changes that Boeing and other manufacturers
have put in place since the Flight 800 tragedy, including changes
in fuel-tank components.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of work has been done across the industry,'' Dern said.
Still, he said, ``we'll go back and look at the design of each
airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Dern said he could not speculate on whether any of the Boeing
aircraft in production would have to be revamped. The FAA proposal
contains language intended to improve the safety margin around fuel
tanks, and the 747's air-conditioning equipment, which produces
heat, is not far from the center fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dern said Boeing had been diligent in making
improvements since the Long Island accident, and the FAA conceded
that some manufacturers had ``aggressively completed'' safety
reviews, it said others had not been, and that their slowness had
``delayed the adoption of corrective action.''  &QL;

NEW YORK OFFICIAL FEARS THAT NEW RULES MAY WRONGLY DEPRIVE HOMELESS
OF SHELTER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Acknowledging that strict new welfare rules have
mistakenly cut some people from the rolls, the city official in
charge of homeless services expressed concern Thursday that work
requirements and other new rules for homeless people could risk
wrongly depriving some families of shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Martin Oesterreich, commissioner of the Department
of Homeless Services, made the remarks in a tense meeting with
executives of many of the private, nonprofit agencies that are
contracted to operate the city's homeless family shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably are decisions that were wrong on their face and
should never have been made,'' he said when members of the group
spoke of shelter residents who had been mistakenly denied welfare
benefits or judged fit to work when they were actually disabled.
``I don't know how to cure that system.''
</P>
<P>
   The work requirement is only one of a list of rules that those
seeking shelter will have to obey to keep their beds under the
city's plan, which makes the city's homeless shelters subject to
the same system of eligibility screenings, job searches, work
assignments and sanctions that city welfare offices have used since
1995 to move more than 400,000 people off public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting Thursday, shelter operators said they feared that
under the new rules, bureaucratic problems that have improperly cut
some families from the welfare rolls would result in families'
being wrongly evicted from homeless shelters and left with nowhere
to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I share your concerns,'' Oesterreich said.
</P>
<P>
   Many problems with the plan are still unresolved and might have
to be worked out after it takes effect, Oesterreich said, since
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani wants ``a full-blown program in place'' by
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any way you look at it, for some families there will be some
pain,'' he said. ``The problem is how to make sure that pain is
justifiable and not the result of a bad decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources
Administration, said in an interview that homeless people were not
fundamentally different from the general welfare population, and
that existing mechanisms gave recipients a chance to contest
mistakes. ``We think it's the right policy direction to take,'' she
said, ``and that it's important for all people, especially people
in a homeless shelter, to get a job and become self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials have said that children in homeless families who
are expelled from the shelter system could be taken into foster
care. But a 1989 court decision bars the city from removing
children from their families solely for lack of housing, and state
social services law requires the Administration for Children's
Services to try to keep families together.
</P>
<P>
   Oesterreich indicated that while the city had been legally free
to impose the rules on families since last year, one reason for
delay was concern by Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner of the
Administration for Children's Services, about the impact on the
city's system of child protection and foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mission is not to run a juvenile shelter system,''
Oesterreich said.
</P>
<P>
   Oesterreich added that public disclosure of the mayor's plan for
putting the new rules in effect surprised him, Scoppetta and Jason
A. Turner, the commissioner of Human Resources, while they were
still meeting to try to resolve these conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The city has promised to give five days notice to Steven Banks,
a Legal Aid lawyer who is counsel to the Coalition to the Homeless,
before putting the rules into effect for families.
</P>
<P>
   The city agreed in court Thursday that it would not put the
rules into effect for homeless single adults until the legal issues
had been aired at a hearing set for Jan. 7 before Justice Stanley
L. Sklar of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Thomas Crane, a
lawyer for the city, said the city would submit its legal papers on
Nov. 12.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Thursday narrowly passed the last
spending bill of the year, an $85 billion measure for labor, health
and education programs, containing an 0.97 percent across-the-board
cut in federal spending. The cut would create on paper a budget
that did not tap into Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he will veto the bill, setting the
stage for the final act in this year's budget battle: negotiations
between the White House and Congress that will go into high gear
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the budget plan preserved Social Security money
only as the result of ``smoke and mirrors'' _ creative accounting
by Republican lawmakers _ that had ``totally bumfuzzled'' American
voters.
</P>
<P>
   He was supported in that argument by the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office, which said Thursday that the
Republicans were $17 billion over their spending limits and into
Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered to compromise with the Republicans. ``I'm
prepared to work with them,'' he said at a news conference with
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. ``I don't want a partisan
fight on this. This is crazy for us to be having a big partisan
blowout'' over the Social Security issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans remain wary, having been bested by Clinton in budget
battles before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our numbers are not that far apart,'' said Rep. C.W. Bill
Young, R-Fla., the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.
``We are far apart on the political rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a rare understatement on a day marked by furious
speeches and duels fought with numbers on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Halloween and the Democrats are up to their old tricks,''
said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, who argued that the Republicans
had ``just won the first battle of this war'' with Clinton by
writing a budget that ``protects every penny of the Social Security
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   A jazz quartet played ``Pennies From Heaven'' as the Republicans
gathered on the Capitol's lawn to celebrate passage of the bill, by
a vote of 218-211, in which four fiscally conservative Democrats
voted for the bill. The four were Reps. Frank Lucas of Kentucky,
Pat Danner of Missouri, Virgil Goode of Virginia and Adam Smith of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Republicans defected. They were Helen Chenoweth of Idaho,
Joel Hefley of Colorado, Walter Jones of North Carolina, Ron Paul
of Texas, Mark Sanford of South Carolina, Bob Schaffer of Colorado
and Floyd Spence of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we've stopped the raid on Social
Security,'' said Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will take up the bill financing the departments of
Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, along with the
across-the-board cut, as early as Friday. The spending bill
contains $314 billion, of which $85 billion is discretionary
spending and $229 billion is mandatory funds that are required by
law. It also includes 316 earmarks, pet projects backed by
individual Republican lawmakers, totaling at least $360 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 spending bills, eight have been signed into law and
the other five, including the one passed Thursday, have been vetoed
or will be soon.
</P>
<P>
   Under the limits imposed in 1997, the most Congress is allowed
to spend in the fiscal year 2000 is $580 billion, plus $14 billion
in a projected surplus of government revenue. But according to the
Congressional Budget Office, the Republican spending bills add up
to nearly $611 billion, or $17 billion above the limit.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans contend that their across-the-board cut in all
13 spending bills that finance the operations of all federal
agencies but not mandatory programs like Medicaid and welfare will
save about $5.7 billion. That, they say, will create a budget that
will not tap surplus Social Security revenues to operate government
agencies _ which would be the first time that has happened in four
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the CBO said in a new analysis Thursday that this was not
true.
</P>
<P>
   It said the Republican-written spending bills exceed lawmakers'
self-imposed spending limits by about $17 billion and will drain
that much money from surplus Social Security revenues. It cited
$17.7 billion in spending outlays that the Republican leadership
has instructed the CBO to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   This technique, called directed scorekeeping, allows the
Republicans to argue that their across-the-board cut will result in
a small surplus in general government revenues and leave the Social
Security funds untouched.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative to the across-the-board cuts, Clinton has
proposed either raising revenue with a tobacco tax, finding
spending cuts in government programs or realizing savings from
unspent government funds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Republicans' spending bills also include $18.6 billion in
outlays that the leadership has designated as unanticipated
``emergency spending,'' which technically does not count against
the spending limits that Congress imposed on itself. These include
programs like the 2000 census, which by law must be conducted ever
10 years, and a 25-year-old program to help poor people pay their
heating bills in winter.
</P>
<P>
   They also rely on about $2.3 billion in outlays taken from the
budget for fiscal 2001, and two payments that will be delayed until
that year _ $3.3 billion in research grants at the National
Institutes of Health and $1.3 billion due Pentagon contractors.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the appearance of a balanced budget relies on at least
$43 billion in creative accounting by the Republicans, according to
an analysis of the 13 spending bills and the CBO report. It would
require an across-the-board cut of 4.8 percent to bring the budget
into balance without using Social Security funds, the congressional
auditors say.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans adamantly deny that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've now proved that you can fund the government without
raiding Social Security,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are running ``a disinformation campaign'' by
emphasizing the CBO numbers, said Rep. John Edward Porter, a
moderate Republican from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., said the CBO analysis proved that
``there are lies, darn lies, and statisticians.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said the CBO analysis
``repudiates the Republicans' false claims.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, John Spratt
of South Carolina, called the Republicans' accounting ``too clever
by half'' and compared their arguments to ``a medieval trial.''
</P>
<P>
   And the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, David
Obey of Wisconsin, called the Republican spending claims ``a magic
show designed to put on a phony debate about Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security issue has been used by both parties as a
lightning rod, with both sides claiming that their spending
strategies will protect retirees in years to come. But independent
budget analysts say the spending of surplus Social Security
revenues has no effect on the solvency of the retirement fund. But
the surplus funds can be used to pay down the federal debt, which
now stands at $3.6 trillion, a strategy increasingly favored across
the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   In this increasingly cranky Congress, with each party all but
calling the other liars, the bitterness spilled over to the Senate,
where Democrats are frustrated by Republican control of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the biggest legislative graveyard since I've
come to Congress,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. He
also said Senate Democrats would start running television ads
countering commercials made by House Republicans that ``will deal
with Social Security _ what the real facts are.''
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate also passed the month's third continuing
resolution, which keeps government agencies running in the absence
of a real budget until Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Although fiscal 2000 began Oct. 1, the budget battle will
continue.

RAFAEL ALBERTI, WIDELY READ SPANISH POET, DEAD AT 96
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain)  (rk) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID _ Rafael Alberti, one of Spain's most popular poets and
the last member of the ``Generation of 1927,'' a group of artists
whose ranks included poet Federico Garcia Lorca and film director
Luis Bunuel, died Thursday at his home in El Puerto de Santa Maria,
in southern Spain. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Alberti wrote more than a dozen books of poetry and in 1983 was
the recipient of the Spanish government's Miguel de Cervantes
Literature Prize.
</P>
<P>
   King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia and Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar wired their condolences to the Alberti family Thursday,
state-run television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Alberti spent 38 years in exile after Gen. Francisco Franco's
troops won the Spanish Civil War in 1939. He returned to Spain in
1977 and was elected that year as a Communist Party member of
Parliament, representing Cadiz. He later resigned his seat to give
poetry readings, which attracted large crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Alberti was born Dec. 16, 1902, in El Puerto de Santa Maria,
near Cadiz, to a family of prosperous wine merchants. Cadiz and its
shimmering bay were constant reference points in his work. His
first book of poems, ``Marinero en Tierra'' (``Sailor on Dry
Land''), written when he was 23, won him Spain's national
literature prize in 1925 and lasting fame. In it, he called on
readers to be:
</P>
<P>
   On alert, for in these eyes of the South, and in this song, I
bring you all of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Look at me, the sea is passing by.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later he published what many critics consider his
masterpiece, ``Sobre los angeles'' (``Concerning the Angels'').
Lorca had that same year produced ``Romancero Gitano'' (``Gypsy
Ballads''), and for many critics the two books marked the high
point of modern Spanish lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   With his friend Lorca, Alberti shared a passion for the
Andalusia region in southern Spain, and their poetry drew upon its
colors, sights and sounds.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1920s, Alberti met Lorca, Salvador Dali and other
artists connected to Madrid's famed student residence. Together,
their artistic movement became known as the Generation of 1927. The
group produced poetry unparalleled since the golden age of Spanish
literature. Among its members, in addition to Lorca and Alberti,
were Damaso Alonso, Pedro Salinas, Jorge Guillen, Luis Cernuda and
Nobeate Vicente Aleixandre.
</P>
<P>
   Alberti became a strong supporter of the Spanish Republic when
it was formed in 1931 and a staunch anti-fascist when the civil war
broke out in 1936. He fought in the air force against Franco. He
also toured the Republican lines giving poetry readings and became
a major propagandist for the Loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Alberti's interest in theater was strong even in the 1930s, when
he created the ``Guerrillas del Teatro'' to entertain troops
fighting Franco. As a playwright, his work included ``Noche de
guerra en el Museo del Prado'' (``Night of War in the Prado
Museum''), which had its premiere in Italy in 1973. He won Spain's
national theater prize in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Lorca was executed by fascist troops in 1936 in Granada. After
the Loyalists were defeated, Alberti and his first wife, writer
Maria Teresa Leon, began a life in exile in 1939 that took them to
Paris, Buenos Aires and elsewhere in Latin America, and to Rome.
Their home in Rome became a rendezvous for Spaniards opposed to or
stifled by the Franco dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Alberti's work includes ``Vida bilingue de un exiliado espanol
en Francia'' (``Bilingual Life of a Spanish Refugee in France''),
``La Amante'' (``The Lover'') and ``Trece barras y 48 estrellas''
(``Thirteen Bands and 48 Stars''), the latter written in the 1930s
to criticize American imperialism. But he also wrote poems of
passion, as in the book ``Entre el Clavel y la espada'' (``Between
Sword and Carnation''):
</P>
<P>
   A carnation goes on a trip
</P>
<P>
   A carnation goes traveling
</P>
<P>
   From the legs, the sea is above
</P>
<P>
   From the breasts, the sea is below
</P>
<P>
   Alberti and his first wife had one daughter, Aitana, born in
1941 in Argentina. Ms. Teresa Leon died in 1988, and in 1990
Alberti married Maria Asuncion Mateo, a writer about 40 years
younger who had studied his work extensively.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by a
stepdaughter, a stepson and two grandchildren.

MEMORIES OF STEWART LOOM LIKE A MISTY TUNE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EDDIE SEFKO 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was 30 minutes before the first tee time Thursday
and there wasn't a soul on the practice range at Champions Golf
Club except for Payne Stewart's.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who doesn't think Stewart was everywhere during the
first round of the Tour Championship wasn't paying attention. He
was there. In every musical sob coming from the bagpiper, he was
there. In the poetic words delivered by so many friends and fellow
golfers, he was there.
</P>
<P>
   In the still, foggy air that hung like a curtain that might have
dropped on a life but was rising on an afterlife, he was there.
</P>
<P>
   And in every heart, Stewart was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne Stewart was a very emotional guy,'' said Tom Lehman in
his eulogy of Stewart during the pre-tournament memorial ceremony.
``He loved to laugh. And he wasn't afraid to cry. So I'm not going
to be ashamed of my tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the current U.S. Open champion, was one of six people
killed Monday aboard a Learjet that crashed into a pasture near
Mina, S.D., four hours after leaving Orlando, Fla., en route to
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday, six people got on that airplane,'' Lehman said.
``Today, there are wives without husbands and kids without fathers.
All of us were a part of Payne. And Payne was a part of all of us.
When he died Monday, a big part of us died, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But life goes on. Memories go on. And on a bizarre day that will
go down as one of the most un-golf-like days in the sport's
history, the game wasn't so much played as it was tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered not playing this tournament because I didn't feel
like playing it,'' Lehman said. ``But I thought it was important
that we be here for Payne. And then I was asked to be part of the
ceremony and I was up all night worrying about it. I didn't want to
completely collapse and not be able to blubber a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's appropriate that we had that service. As a Christian,
you know this is not the end. I know one day I'll see Payne Stewart
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's friends and colleagues paid personal homage to him in
many ways.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III, the leader through Thursday's 27 holes, Justin
Leonard and other players inscribed a ``P.S.'' on the back of their
golf caps. Duffy Waldorf wrote tributes to Stewart as identifying
marks on his golf balls. Swatches of a plaid, kilt-like material
were pinned to players' hats or golf bags.
</P>
<P>
   The most bewildering tribute came from Bob Estes, a former Texas
Longhorn who approached the 10th tee for his first shot of the
tournament and pulled out his putter, tapping the ball about 15
feet from the back of the tee box to the front of it. He then
swatted a 3-wood down the fairway for his second shot, but went on
to make double bogey to start his tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was symbolic of the last putt he made to win the (U.S.)
Open,'' Estes said. ``But maybe more importantly, it had to do with
the way Payne had changed. The way faith, family and friends were
his top priority. It symbolized that also. It meant I wasn't
worried about the first hole or the score I would shoot or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, golf was way down the list of priorities Thursday. And
it no doubt will be again Saturday, when the tournament resumes.
Today's play has been canceled to allow players the option of
attending Stewart's memorial service in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The revised schedule called for 27 holes Thursday and 27
Saturday before Sunday's 18-hole finale. But the tournament is
running a distant second in everybody's thoughts. Fans are
respectful, but the momentous roars of good shots were missing. The
players played well at times Thursday. But it was with hollow
feelings they made those strokes of genius.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with a poignant gathering on the first tee.
</P>
<P>
   A lone bagpiper, Steve Agan of the Houston Pipe Group, strolled
out of the foggy morning air onto the No. 1 tee, playing ``Going
Home,'' a slow Scottish hymn.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman addressed a crowd of approximately 50 PGA Tour players
and officials and several hundred fans, talking through his tears
about Stewart's legacy and reading a passage from a funeral service
handbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``In such a time, there is but One who can bring light out of
darkness, who can heal the heart that is broken by grief, who can
bring peace of soul and strength of spirit,'' he said. ``That One
is the One whom Paul called `The God of all comfort.' He did not
fail Job. He did not fail Paul. He did not fail Christ. He will not
fail you.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lehman said a brief prayer and called for a moment of
silence, the bagpiper played a verse of ``Amazing Grace,`` then
returned into the fog slowly, playing ``Going Home`` again.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, a plane hauled a banner above the course that
had a red heart and a message that read: ``We will remember you
Payne.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point today, it really hit home,'' Love said. ``When
that little airplane flew over with that banner, I couldn't putt. I
had a four-footer straight in for birdie, and it took me 10 minutes
to get ready to putt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't be out there playing golf with tears in your
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was the way it was Thursday. And Stewart was right
there, watching every step of the way.
</P>

INMAN CAN BE TALK OF TOWN AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Given Joe Inman's gift of gab and his upbeat
disposition, it's hard to imagine how unrecognizable he was with
the golfing public before winning last year's Pacific Bell Senior
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   But that's professional golf, where _ apart from fellow touring
players _ the impression of who you are is often stitched to what
you have won.
</P>
<P>
   And Inman, the 1998 Senior PGA Tour Rookie of the Year who opens
defense of his Pacific Bell title today at Wilshire Country Club,
hadn't won much before last November.
</P>
<P>
   When he did _ with birdies on three of the final five holes at
Wilshire to hold off Lee Trevino by one stroke _ Inman also won
over the attending media with his unabashed enthusiasm and
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   He nearly wept after the breakthrough victory, his first as a
senior and first anywhere as a pro since the 1976 Kemper Open _ his
only PGA Tour win.
</P>
<P>
   But if Inman was misty-eyed, he was hardly choked up. He turned
his post-match interview into an entertaining filibuster on courage
and character, the value of family and work ethic, the difficulty
of tour access, the satisfaction of delayed success and his belief
that winning is its own reward.
</P>
<P>
   The former Wake Forest teammate of Lanny Wadkins and Leonard
Thompson talked and talked and talked, and his vitality was
infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm overwhelmed,'' he said, finally. And from somewhere wafted
a response: ``But not speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Inman still talks about the impact of that '98
Pacific Bell victory, which earned him a last-chance berth in the
'98 Senior Tour Championship and full exemption this year.
</P>
<P>
   His three rounds at Wilshire have led to $1,070,447 in winnings
with the potential for more in this week's $1.2 million Pacific
Bell event and next week's $2 million Senior Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed I would have this chance to play again,'' said
Inman, 51, who left the PGA Tour in 1986 and worked as a golf club
sales representative and PGA radio broadcaster before joining the
Senior Tour last year.
</P>
<P>
   He earned his Senior Tour card with a fifth-place finish in the
'97 tour qualifying tournament but was in danger of losing
exemption for '99 entering last year's Pacific Bell. Then, thanks
to an 11-under showing capped by a four-foot par putt on the final
hole, life got dramatically better.
</P>
<P>
   Inman earned a career-best $165,000, then followed with a
sixth-place finish worth $87,500 at the Tour Championship. He has
seven top-10s and $817,947 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed that my game would come back like it had by
that time, like it has continued this year,'' he said. ``I didn't
know a golfer was still in me.''
</P>
<P>
   That golfer will likely have to be at its best to defend against
perhaps the strongest field in the Pacific Bell's 10-year history,
which was formerly played at Rancho Park.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the tour's top-10 money winners are on hand, including
1-2 players Bruce Fleisher and Hale Irwin, both contending for
Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, with six wins, including his fifth senior major, is
bidding for an unprecedented third consecutive POY title. Fleisher,
a lock to follow Inman as Rookie of the Year, has seven victories.
