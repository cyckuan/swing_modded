<HEADLINE> UNICEF Says Situation of Iraqi Children Disastrous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) Friday voiced concern over the situation of the 10 million
children in Iraq, urging financial support for its work to assist the
children who are suffering from hunger and disease.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is disastrous for children. Many are living on the
very margin of survival", Philippe Heffinck, UNICEF Representative
for Iraq was quoted as saying in a news release.
</P>
<P>
"Around 4,500 children under the age of five are dying here every
month from hunger and disease," he added.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Iraqi government showed remarkable growth
in cases of severe malnutrition. The percentage of underweight
children in capital Baghdad alone hit 29 percent in 1995, up from 7
percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The situation came as a result of "extreme shortages of food and
grossly depleted health services as well as a breakdown in the
provision of clean drinking water and treatment/disposal of sewage",
said the news release.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said due to war and ensuing economic hardship, Iraq's annual
health budget reduced by 90 to 95 percent between 1987 and 1995. The
budget of 450 million U.S. dollars per year for purchasing medicines
fell to mere 22 million dollars and the price of wheat flour in 1995
was 11,667 times more than in 1989.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF called for funds to support its assistance work, saying it
has received only 3.1 million dollars out of a total of 39 million in
an appeal issued in last April and May.
</P>
<P>
Last week it requested for an additional 10.5 million dollars in
response to the impact of the recent fightings between Kurdish
factions in Northern Iraq, and of the postponement of implementation
of the UN decision to allow Iraq to sell oil in return for food and
humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Accoridng to UNICEF, since the end of the Gulf war in 1991, it has
spent 167 million dollars in assisting Iraq's children.
</P>
<P>
Heffinck said: "It is essential that we find donors willing to
support our work. Otherwise, Iraq's children will continue to suffer
and this we cannot accept."

<HEADLINE> Obstacles imposed on Cross-Straight Trade Criticised (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today
released a signed article by Guo Taiwen, criticising the Taiwan
authorities for imposing obstacles on economic and trade exchanges
across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The article says that by imposing the obstacles, the Taiwan
authorities are aiming at hindering reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
It notes that in August this year the Ministry of
Communications promulgated a set of rules on the administration of
shipping across the Taiwan Straits and the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) issued a set of rules on
the administration of cargo transportation services across the
Taiwan Straits, which formed a significant step in the promotion
of the "three direct links" of mail, trade, shipping and air
services between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
But in the same month the leader of the Taiwan authorities, in
a speech, went against the commitment he made to promote
cross-strait economic cooperation and the "three direct links"
when taking office, and even set a requirement for restrictions
for Taiwan investors, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that people highly praised the two sets of
rules, stipulated by the Ministry of Communications and MOFTEC, as
"positive measures in promoting direct shipping links across the
Taiwan Straits", and "quite practical moves", while they believed
that speech by the leader of Taiwan authorities is a signal that
the Taiwan authorities' policy is turning around and "a brake is
being applied".
</P>
<P>
Therefore the stock market in Taiwan fell by 89 points, and air
and shipping transportation dealers were stunned, it says.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese businessmen held that if they leave the investment
opportunities and potential markets in the mainland to others,
Taiwan's economy will suffer.
</P>
<P>
It also says the various restrictions imposed by the Taiwan
authorities in the past years have already brought huge extra
social and economic costs to economic and trade exchanges between
the two sides of the straits.
</P>
<P>
These restrictions, however, will only delay the process of
regionalization of the economies on both sides of the straits, but
will not stop its development, the article says.

<HEADLINE> Juppe Dives to Lowest Point in Support Rate: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
has dived to his record low in support rate, free-dropping to 27
percent, said a poll by the SOFRES-Figaro Magazine published
today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the support rate of President Jacques Chirac dropped
by three percentage points to 37 percent, while 61 percent said
they hold a negative view about the president and 2 percent did
not give their opinions.
</P>
<P>
Only one in four French people believe in the capability of
Juppe to "solve the problem which France has now," against 34
percent in August. People who hold a negative view of him have
increased by eight percentage points to attain 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the worst result of the poll for the prime minister
since he came to power in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted on September 25-27 on 1,000 people above
18, in a quotas method to represent the views of various social
groups.

<HEADLINE> Tougher Law on Child Abuse Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Police Commissioner
Augustine Chihuri today called for an amendment to Zimbabwean
laws to curb increasing child sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a one-day seminar on child abuse, Chihuri said
there was need for tougher laws to protect children from being
sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
Separate trials must be conducted in child abuse cases to
avoid trauma of waiting by the victims, the commissioner
proposed.
</P>
<P>
He said the rate at which child sexual abuse was increasing
called for full participation of the community, by ensuring that
children were decently educated and given proper security.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 1,445 cases of child sexual abuse were reported with
506 convictions, an increase of 16 percent over 1994 figures.
</P>
<P>
Between January and June this year, 717 cases were recorded
compared to 659 cases for the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> French Doctors' Strike Described as a "Failure" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The strike Thursday night by
doctors and nurses who answer night calls of patients was a total
"failure," says MG-France, France's biggest doctors' trade union
which opposed the strike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Union of French General Practitioners
(UNOF), which organized the strike, described the doctors
participation rate in the strike as "very high."
</P>
<P>
The UNOF was protesting a government proposal to cut by two
hours their night shifts.Three other unions of private doctors
Thursday called for a strike on October 17 to protest against
planned social security reform by the government of Prime Minister
Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
The three unions of private doctors, CSMF, SML and FMF, accused
the government of accusative "finger-pointing" which reflected
badly on them in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro newspaper said today the health sector had become a
highly volatile field in social security reform, particularly
after the National Fund of Illness recently proposed to Health
Minister Jacques Barrot an austerity budget.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Thursday's strike, both MG-France and UNOF
expressed relief that there had been no incidents involving
patients during the night.
</P>
<P>
All emergency calls by patients were transferred to the
Emergency Medical Aid Service, which runs a 24-hour service around
the country.

The article says there is a great potential for economic
cooperation among China's mainland provinces and Taiwan Province,
Hong Kong and Macao, emerging as an important economic region in
the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) for the first time considered China including Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Macao as a whole region in their analysis reports.
</P>
<P>
The WB and IMF also predicted that this region would grow into
a big economic power to confront the United States, Japan and
Germany within a decade.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that economic cooperation between two
sides of the Taiwan Straits is inexorable because of
complementarity of economy of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The mainland is superior in market, scientific research, and
natural and labor resources, while funds, technology, management
expertise and marketing operations are advantages of Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Macao.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Up Slightly in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in the
United States edged up to 5.2 percent in September from a
seven-year low of 5.1 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department said today that payroll employment
fell by 40,000 last month, the first fall since a drop of 66,000
in February. Payroll jobs had risen by 240,000 in August.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. unemployment rate has been below six percent for
almost two years.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said that much of the weakness in August
occurred in manufacturing which cut 57,000 jobs, followed by 12,000
layoffs in the auto sector. Factories making industrial machinery
laid off 11,000 workers and employment in printing and publishing
dropped by 5,000.
</P>
<P>
Growth was weak in construction, which managed a modest gain of
11,000 jobs, resulting partly from the effects of Hurricane Fran.
Government employment dropped by 81,000, led by falls of 67,000 in
local school employment.
</P>
<P>
Overall, employment growth in the service industries, where
most Americans are employed, continued to slow down in September,
rising by just 54,000. That was less than half the monthly
increase during the first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The employment report was seen by some analysts as more
evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing, after it soared by 4.7
percent in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve passed up the chance to boost interest
rates at the end of last month. Economic analysts said the central
bank was obviously convinced that the economy would slow
significantly in the second half of the year and did not want to
increase rates so close to the presidential election without more
evidence of inflation.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Calls on Africa to Resolve Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- African countries should play a
major role in resolving the conflicts afflicting the continent so
as to ensure global peace, Zimbabwean Defence Minister Moven
Mahachi said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the Zimbabwe Staff College in Harare
while receiving a donation from the Danish government. The
donation is to assist Zimbabwe in hosting the second Southern
African Development Community peace keeping course which will
begin this month.
</P>
<P>
"We should, therefore, move with a clear sense of purpose and
direction knowing full well that we, in Africa, have to play a
major role in overcoming our own problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the African countries, after dislodging the colonial
regime, were faced with internal strife and war as tribal groups
fought one another for power. The result is underdevelopment,
hunger and increasing poverty, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the problems facing humanity today are no longer
confined to individual states as they have become transnational
and so complex that no one nation can claim to have the
capability to solve all its problems and realize its aspirations
in isolation," he said.

Combining the superiorities of both sides, and making full,
reasonable and effective use of them, will be bound to push
economic development in this region. And the Chinese nation's
economic strength and competitiveness will certainly be
strengthened, the article says.
</P>
<P>
As two sides share common and immediate interests in economy,
it will inevitably contribute to promoting political
reunification, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
Cross-strait economic co-operation will not only lay a firm
economic foundation for China's reunification, but also boost
economic development in the Asian and Pacific area, even in the
whole world.
</P>
<P>
The article also stresses another superiority of economic
exchanges and co-operation between the mainland and the regions of
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, namely they take place within the
same country and nation, unlike other economic regions composed of
different countries.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China and the Chinese Government have
made unremitting efforts to promote growth of two-side trade and
economic cooperation under the guideline of "Peaceful
Reunification and One Country, Two Systems".
</P>
<P>
On August 20 and 21, the Ministry of Communications and the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation promulgated
two sets of rules on the administration of shipping and cargo
transportation services between the Taiwan Straits, making an
important step in promoting the "three direct links".

<P>
At the same time, the international community should and

The grand total volume of trade across the straits has

The volume of trade across the straits has risen from five
billion US dollars in 1990 to 21 billion dollars last year, with

It is expected that trade volume across the straits will

The island province's total volume of exports to the mainland
rose from 4.4 billion dollars in 1990 to 17.9 billion dollars in

<P>
HARARE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government is
committed to the enhancement of the status of teachers so that
they can contribute meaningfully to national development, a
Ministry of Education official said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of teachers who gathered to celebrate the

and hardships, recognised the need to motivate teachers to
improve their commitment and resourcefulness in the dexecution of
their duties.

include perceived flaws in the job evaluation exercise,

scales and the remaining areas of concern to teachers will
continue to receive the government's attention,'' he said.

To date, economic and trade activities across the straits are
still in an indirect status as a result of various restrictions
imposed by Taiwan authorities, the article said.
</P>
<P>
"When economic and trade relations across the Taiwan Straits
saw a breakthrough in 1985, Taiwan authorities announced 'three
principles for entrepot trade' to forbid direct trade and contact
with the mainland," it recalled.
</P>
<P>
When residents from Taiwan finally obtained the freedom to
travel to the mainland to visit relatives in April 1988, the
Taiwan authorities again mapped out "three 'no' principles" to
hinder the growth of economic and trade relations across the
Straits, it added.
</P>
<P>
The three principles include "no direct voyage departure from
any open ports on the mainland", "no direct currency exchange",
and "no direct contact by any Taiwan company".
</P>
<P>
Under increasing pressure from the industrial and commercial
circles on the island, Taiwan authorities were compelled to
gradually ease its strict control over the investment policy.
</P>
<P>
Overall, they still stick to the policy of hindering and
preventing Taiwan businessmen from investing in the motherland. In
the past two years, they have attempted to change the direction of
Taiwan investment by "going southward."
</P>
<P>
The article also accused the Taiwan authorities of laying
obstacles for the key issue in the economic and trade relations
across the straits -- the realization of "Three Direct Links".

<HEADLINE> Human Error Causes Train Crash in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Failure to properly secure a
chain of unmanned rail cars caused their collision with an
oncoming freight train near Edmonton, a report by the Canadian
National Railway Corporation confirms.
</P>
<P>
The accident caused three deaths and left a tangled mass of
cars, on August 12, near Edson, 180 kilometers west of Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
The company's investigation showed that hand brakes, supposed
to keep a string of 20 cars in the rail yards from rolling, were
not adequately tightened by workers, said an senior official of
the company.
</P>
<P>
The accident could have been prevented if a mechanism known as
a derail had been in place to guide the runaway cars off the track
before they reached the main line.
</P>
<P>
The company has since installed 250 such devices across the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, a union spokesman said the railway's report jumped the
gun on another investigation still to be completed by the federal
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EU, Japan Lodge WTO Complaints Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Both the European Union and Japan
have filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO)
against Indonesia's "national car" policy on Friday, WTO sources
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Both of the complaint said that the policy breaches
multilateral trade rules and discriminates against foreign car
makers.
</P>
<P>
Under Jakarta's car policy, domestically owned car makers can
enjoy tariff and luxury sales tax breaks if they boost the local
content ratio to 60 percent in three years.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a joint venture between Indonesia's PT Timor Putra
Nasional, and South Korea's Kia Motors Corp. is the only company
that enjoys the privilege. It is allowed to assemble its Timor
cars at Kia plants and export them to Indonesia duty-free as
national cars until March next year when its local plants are
ready.
</P>
<P>
A senior Japanese trade official in Geneva, Jun Yokota, said
that Jakarta's policy violates the WTO's most favored nation
status and national treatment principles. Moreover, by linking tax
privileges to local content requirements, it also run counter to
the Trade-Related Investment Measures accord of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Under WTO dispute settlement procedures, Japan and the EU will
first hold consultations with Indonesia. If the talks fail to
resolve the dispute within 60 days, an independent WTO panel will
be set up to investigate the cases.
</P>
<P>
Yokota said it is to be decided yet whether Japan and the EU
hold the consultations with Jakarta separately or jointly, or
perhaps along with the United States which also said it would file
a WTO complaint against Indonesia on the issue.

"Because of Taiwan authorities' hindrance, the 'Three Direct
Links' proposal could not come into reality till today, though it
was raised by the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress as early as 17 years ago," it said.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement of the "Two Methods" by the Ministry
of Communications, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, in August this year, Taiwan compatriots, especially
those from the industrial and commercial circles, are all eager to
realize the "Three Direct Links" across the straits.
</P>
<P>
However, the leaders of Taiwan authorities remain untouched,
and continue to prevent the "Three Direct Links" under the pretext
of seeking so called "security benefits" and "strategic benefits".
</P>
<P>
"Why are they bent on going against the public wishes and
trying again and again, to hinder the development of economic and
trade relations across the straits?" asked the article.
</P>
<P>
"The reason can only be found in their consistent stance to
prevent the reunification of the motherland," the article noted.
</P>
<P>
However, it added, the erroneous policy of the Taiwan
authorities is not only unacceptable to general public but futile,
because both economic regionalization and China's reunification
are irreversible historical trends in today's world.
</P>
<P>
"Those who go against the basic law that guides economic growth
and stand in the way of the historical trends toward economic
regionalization will hurt no one but themselves," the article
warned.

<HEADLINE> Xu Bailun of China Won UNESCO Comenius Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- For his pioneer work in teaching
the blind Chinese children, Xu Bailun Friday became the first
Chinese receiving the Comenius Medal from the UN Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Xu, 64, was awarded the medal at the current 45th session of
the International Conference on Education (ICE) here, along with 8
other laureates for their personal or collective contributions to
teaching, and the originality or effectiveness of their
pedagogical methods.
</P>
<P>
Xu worked as an architect before losing his sight in 1971. In
1985, he initiated the Golden Key Project, trying to help blind
Chinese children get a normal education in ordinary schools. Xu
has also prepared and published materials for training Braille
teachers, and runs the first Chinese magazine devoted to blind
children.
</P>
<P>
He is now planning to bring to schools by the year 2005 a total
of 20,000 visually impaired children who spread on the 5.7 million
square km land in the less developed West China.
</P>
<P>
Such a giant project needs support. Xu is still concerned over
the shortage of funds, saying he does not mind devoting all his
own fortune as long as more blind children can go to school, which
is the only wish in his remaining years.
</P>
<P>
"We have made the first step in an area of 240,000 square km.
We plan to help 3,000 visually impaired pupils to go to school in
3 years", Xu said while addressing the medal awarding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Comenius Medal was created in 1992 by the government of the
Czech Republic and UNESCO, and awarded biennially during the ICE.
It bears the name of the 17th century Czech humanist Jan Amos
Comenius and is intended to reward outstanding achievements in the
fields of educational research and innovation.

<HEADLINE> PNA Official: No Changes to Oslo Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) official said today that the Palestinians do not
accept any changes in the Oslo peace accords regarding the
Israeli army's redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Israel Radio, Nabil Shaath,
PNA's Planning and International Cooperation Minister, said that
"anything that will change the agreement will be acceptable."
</P>
<P>
"If we change the agreement by one comma, we would have
opened up all the previous agreement to renegotiation, which
would destroy any further negotiations," said Shaath.
</P>
<P>
However, Shaath said that there are possibilities for
additional security factors to be introduced within the
agreement signed by Israel's previous government and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Hebron redeployment will be the first
issue to be addressed in the talks between Israel and the
Palestinians, starting Sunday at the Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
During the Washington summit that was called earlier this week
to revive the peace process following last week's violent
clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel and the
Palestinians agreed to hold continuous talks at the Erez
checkpoint to solve their problems, including the Hebron issue.
</P>
<P>
The PNA minister told Israel Radio that he thought the Israeli
forces need to redeploy from the disputed West Bank town "within
a period not more than six weeks" after all negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On the current situations in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip, Shaath said the PNA will do its best to maintain
calmness. But added that "it is difficult to forecast how
people will behave following the continued failure from the
Israeli side to do anything positive on the ground."
</P>
<P>
Shaath pointed out that the meeting between Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat at the
Washington summit has created "better climate and better air" as
regards further talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed his belief that it is more important
for the Palestinians to see positive actions on the ground
from the Israeli side in implementing the Oslo peace accords.

<HEADLINE> EU Producers Must Respect Animal Welfare: EC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- On the occasion of the
International Day for animal welfare, EU Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler called for producers' recognition and respect for
society's views regarding animal welfare.
</P>
<P>
It is quite clear, he said in a statement, that consumers are
becoming more and more sensitive as to the production methods used
by producers in particular regarding livestock and livestock
products.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers can ignore this trend at their peril or take advantage
of it by providing consumers with high quality products produced
in a way which respects animal welfare requirements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr Fischler went on to say that farmers in general are often
presented as people who have no respect for the welfare of their
animals.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, is far from the truth as the vast majority of
farmers threat their animals properly and indeed apply production
methods which respect animal welfare as normal animal husbandry
practices.
</P>
<P>
Concluding, Mr Fischler remarked that while animal welfare is
most important, human welfare is also important.
</P>
<P>
In this context he cautioned that the demands of the animal
welfare lobby "should be realistic" especially given that EU farmers
have to operate in an ever increasing competitive environment and
often with products from countries where animal welfare legislation
is almost non-existent.

<HEADLINE> France Confirms Report of U.S. Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- France confirmed today that the
United States has proposed to it the establishment of an
pan-African peace-keeping force of 10,000 men to respond to any
crisis on the African continent such as those in Burundi and
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"Such a new proposal in the field of diplomatic preventive
action should be dealt with through numerous reflections...
especially at the United Nations and the Organization of African
Unity," said French foreign ministry spokesman Jacques
Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Liberation reported today that 10 days ago,
a U.S. envoy met with French officials in Paris to discuss the
proposal by Washington, but France rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Rummelhardt said today, however, that the American proposal
"will contribute to the reflections" by the European Union and
its military organ, the Western European Union, on the ways to
carry out peace keeping missions in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Liberation said that the U.S. proposal would cut the grass
under the feet of France, which is considering to organize a
census of the contingents and equipments in West Africa, in order
to coordinate it with Europe for possible future peace-keeping
tasks.
</P>
<P>
The United States has reportedly selected six Africans to form
such a force -- Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Ghana and
Senegal and has promised "generous donations" of armaments to be
transported from U.S. military bases in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The United States has also reportedly agreed to provide half of
the cost for setting up the force, and will provide air transport
means for it once it is dispatched to a crisis-stricken African
country.
</P>
<P>
Liberation said that the U.S. proposal will surely be welcomed
by most African countries, which are having difficulty covering
their defense spendings.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Calls for Measures to Address Debt Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Leonardo Santos Simao,
the foreign minister of Mozambique, on Friday called upon the
international community to seek measures to help relieve debt
burden of this country.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the 51st General Assembly, the foreign minister
said Mozambique will have to start meeting next year its debt
servicing obligations to multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation of Mozambique's indebtedness is a
critical one, for instance, debt servicing in 1994 alone absorbed
about 93% of the country's total export earnings and about 28.6%
of Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
"Unless measures are taken to address this situation, it will
be very difficult for the country to sustain envisaged political,
economic and social targets required to uplifting the living
standards of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Mozambique supports the view that a
comprehensive effort should be made to effectively address the
external indebtedness of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said in order to address official bilateral debt problem,
the Naples Terms, adopted by the Paris Club, in favor of the
poorest and most indebted countries should be expeditiously
implemented.
</P>
<P>
He also called upon Non Paris Club creditors, which have not
done so, to consider appropriate relief measures to alleviate the
suffering of debtor nations.

<HEADLINE> Somali Refugees Complain of Cut of Daily Ration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Somali refugees at Kebri
Beyah camp near Ethiopia's eastern town of Jijiga have complained
of cut in ration and dropping out of school of their children.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Jijiga today, representatives of
the refugees said the daily provision of 500 grams of wheat a
refugee has now been reduced to 375 grams.
</P>
<P>
They said education service has been interrupted at the camp
while their plastic sheetings and blankets are now going out of
use.
</P>
<P>
The Jijiga office of the World Food Program said the cut in
food ration was the result of the reduction in the aid secured
from donor organizations.
</P>
<P>
The food ration would totally be stopped if the aid is not
secured from the donors, the office added.
</P>
<P>
According to the office of the camp, the refugees are given
each 375 grams of wheat, 30 grams of cooking oil and 22 grams of
salt and sugar in line with the directives of the WFP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1,541 children and 531 mothers at the camp are
supplied with nutritious food in addition to their regular
rations.
</P>
<P>
About 290,000 Somali refugees are sheltered in the eastern
border areas of Ethiopia, according to statistics from the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. enditem

<HEADLINE> Christopher to Tour Mideast to Push Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher will make a new round trip to Middle East this
weekend to push the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks due to begin
Sunday, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns announced
today.
</P>
<P>
"Its clear the situation in the Middle East remains dangerous
and requires intensive and productive efforts," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher will leave here on Saturday and meet Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday. He will also go to Gaza to
meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday talks were agreed at the Washington Summit between
Arafat and Netanyahu on last Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-sponsored summit failed to resolve major differences
between the two sides. But both sides agreed to continue their
talks starting Sunday with the American mediation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced after the summit that he would send a senior
U.S. mediator for the Middle East, Dennis Ross, to help arrange
the talks and Christopher also had said he would be glad to
provide assistance whenever it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast summit was called by Clinton after the tension was
increased in the region following bloody violence last week
sparked by Israel's opening of a second entrance to a tunnel that
winds along the Temple Mount, the site of Jewish and Muslim
shrines. More than 70 people were killed in the riot.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also hoped the summit would keep both Israelis and the
Palestinians from derailing of the track of Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli side nether agreed to close the entrance
of the tunnel nor promised a date for the long-delayed Israeli
redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The talks starting Sunday are expect to focus on the issue of
redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges New South-North Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Nations, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin William Mkapa said here today that the world needs a
mutually beneficial creative partnership between the developed
North and the developing South.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the current session of the
U.N. General Assembly, he said that sustainable economic recovery
and growth in the South is beneficial to the North as well.
</P>
<P>
"We shall then be able to buy more from the North and free the
conscience of the developed world from the unending obligation to
extend charity, and control illegal immigration," he said.
</P>
<P>
This creative partnership must also recognize the
interdependent nature of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To help the South recover is not an act of simple charity but
of building the foundations for a more secure and stable world,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the South's capacity to access, and benefit from, the
global markets -- the markets of the developed world -- is
constrained by its underdevelopment, the protectionist policies of
the industrialized countries and the ever deteriorating terms of
trade, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Unregulated market forces will not help the very weak, poor
and vulnerable countries whose special circumstances and needs
must be attended to," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the North to address the "unbearable external
debt" if the creative partnership against global poverty is to
bear fruit.

BRUSSELS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
today welcomed the WTO Panel ruling which confirmed the
discriminatory nature of Japanese liquor tax system following EU's
complaint to the organization.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO's Appellate Body has now ruled that Japan's tax regime
does discriminate against imports from abroad," a EC spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>

and for Japanese consumers alike," EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon
Brittan said in a statement, noting that Japan was a major
potential market for whisky, cognac, vodka and other European
spirits.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was confident that Japan would want to change
its tax system to conform with the ruling "as soon as possible".

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- India is calling for the
United Nations and international community to give more support to
boost the economic progress of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Development assistance is at the lowest level for decades," I.
K. Gujral, Minister of External Affairs of India, said at the
General Debate of the current U.N. General Assembly here Friday.
</P>
<P>
International cooperation is necessary to meet the vast
development needs of the developing countries, to eliminate
weapons of mass destruction and to fight terrorism and crime, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian foreign minister attributed the financial crisis of
the United Nations to the "unwillingness on the part of certain
countries to pay their dues in full and on time," which he said
represents the most acute threat to multilateral cooperation and
can do long-term damage.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said that India attaches great
importance to developing relations with its neighbors, "with a
view to promoting peace, stability, mutual confidence in the
region."

UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Kassymjomart K. Tokaev,
foreign minister of Kazakstan, said the current world order
should rest on the principles of sovereignty and territorial
integrity of states.
</P>
<P>
He said if member states really care about the stability of the
current world order, they must all firmly reject any
manifestations of secessionism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 51st General Assembly, he drew people's
attention to the destructive consequences of an aggressive
secessionism, stressing that this phenomenon has become one of the
major causes of crisis situations in the world and particularly in
the post-Soviet space.
</P>
<P>
"Time has come to put an end to the absolutization of the right
of nations to self-determination," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Further continuation of this process will create new trouble
spots and will lead to more bloodshed," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Diplomat: Washington Summit Returns Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon
Richard Jones said here today that the Washington summit has
helped return the Middle East peace process back to the "right
track."
</P>
<P>
Jones made the statement during a meeting with acting Lebanese
Foreign Minister Taher Hassan, the state-run Lebanese National
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Jones as saying that he briefed Hassan on the
U.S. government's views about the results of the four-way summit
and its significance for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held intensive and
difficult meetings in Washington in the presence of U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Jordan's King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The meetings ended without agreement on the key issues that
caused the latest violence between Israelis and the Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza strip.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu and Arafat agreed to resume negotiations on
the Israeli-Gaza border on Sunday on Israeli redeployment in the
West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his meeting with the Lebanese acting foreign
minister, the U.S. ambassador rejected that the summit was a
failure, saying that "a large number of positive points have come
out of the summit and they are positive indications for the peace
future in the region."
</P>
<P>
He said that the basic achievement of the summit was a halt to
"confrontations and violence" by which "we created a chance for
the two leaders (Natanyahu and Arafat) to know each other and on
their concerns in a better way," the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Another achievement was the "defined date" for the Israelis
and Palestinians to activate their negotiations on important and
suspended issues in order to reach final settlements and "these
negotiations will start on Sunday," the U.S. diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the negotiations would "continue until reaching
an agreement between the two sides" and the United States
would "play a direct role in the talks."
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the difficulties facing the peace process, the
U.S. envoy emphasized that the peace in the region would only be
realized through negotiations.

<HEADLINE> WTO Appellate Panel Urges Japan to Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- An appellate panel of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) announced a ruling on Friday affirming
that Japan's Liquor Tax Law is in violation of multilateral trade
rules and urged Japan to rectify it.
</P>
<P>
WTO has been investigating the case since last year, following
complaints from the European Union, the United States, Canada that
Japan's liquor tax was unfairly higher on whiskey and other
imported spirits, and favored domestic product "shochu".
</P>
<P>
At present taxes on whiskey are up to six times higher than
those on "shochu".
</P>
<P>
In July a WTO dispute panel made an initial ruling in favor of
the complaints. But Japan immediately filed an appeal, arguing
that "shochu" and whiskey were unlike products and it was
basically a beverage for poorer people.
</P>
<P>
The appellate panel ruled in its final report made available
Friday to all WTO members that "shochu" and other distilled
spirits like whiskey are "directly competitive or substitutable
products", and that Japan, in the application of the Liquor Tax
Law, does not similarly tax imported products and affords
protection to domestic production in violation of WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
It requested Japan to bring the law into conformity with its
obligations under the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Under WTO rules, the decision made by the appellate panel,
which will be automatically adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement
Body in 30 days, must be complied with, otherwise Japan could face
WTO-authorized retaliations.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Japanese government officials had already
indicated that Tokyo would probably discuss a tax revision in the
next fiscal year and the tax rate gap is likely to be narrowed by
raising tax on "shochu" and lowering those on imported spirits.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Reopen Trade Center in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will soon reopen its trade
center in Iraq, according to the Middle East News Agency Agency
(MENA).
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Arab Company for Foreign Trade, which owes the
center, has already taken a decision to this effect, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The center's new manager is expected to arrive in Baghdad this
month to assume his duty to reactivate Egypt's exports of
foodstuffs and medicines to Iraq in the coming period in line with
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian trade center, which has been closed since the
U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
was established in 1964.
</P>
<P>
MENA said Iraqi sources welcomed the decision, saying that it
would be an important step toward revitalizing commercial ties
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> PNA Police Officer Refutes Israeli Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior police officer of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) today refuted an Israeli
claim that the Palestinian police went beyond its authority.
</P>
<P>
Nasr Youssef, commander of the Palestinian Police in Gaza, said
that the Israeli claim is not true, and that arming the
Palestinian police is not an issue for discussion between the PNA
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that disarming the Palestinian police reflects
irresponsibility on the Israeli side, he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police were trying to prevent Palestinians from
reaching areas of friction with Israelis, but they came under fire
while carrying out their duties, he complained.
</P>
<P>
The recent incidents against Israel was a popular revolt that
arose out of frustration due to economic and political pressures
imposed on the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a Palestinian-Israeli meeting was
held today at Karni checkpoint east of Gaza to discuss means of
facilitating the movement of trucks between Gaza and Israel to
transfer goods so as to ease the siege imposed on the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side reportedly requested to have the Palestinian
soldiers supervise the movement of trucks unarmed, but the
Palestinian side said it could not accept such a request. However,
the Palestinian delegation said it will refer the Israeli request
to officials of the Palestinian Liaison Committee.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cable-TV Industry Standardizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The cable-TV industry and its
largest suppliers unveiled an agreement to standardize new digital
set-top boxes and cable modems, according to the Wall Street
Journal today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows new cable boxes and high-speed data modems
that are built by different manufacturers to work together on the
same cable system. The cable service giants, such as
Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner Inc., have been working
for five years on achieving the agreement.
</P>
<P>
New digital set-top boxes, which are capable of receiving
hundreds of channels, and new cable modems, which allow high-speed
access to the Internet, are critical elements of the cable
industry's plan to offer a package of services in the information
era.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement, which essentially covers the speed,
modulation and frequency of digital traffic over cable, as well as
sound and video, is expected to open up the market to
nontraditional cable suppliers.
</P>
<P>
If the new standards catch on, the cable industry could break a
decades-long cycle of relying on a few suppliers who use closed,
proprietary systems, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Setting Up of Think-Tank Urged in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The federal government of Nigeria
has been urged to set up a think-tank in the presidency to
appropriately advise it on issues affecting Nigeria and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the joint national committee of traditional
rulers and leaders of thought, Lt.-Gen. Jeremiah Useni, said
today the think-tank is also expected to advise the foreign
ministry on ways of handling thorny international issues.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the committee's fifth meeting in Abuja, capital
of Nigeria, Useni said the committee recommended that the
appointment of ambassadors should be based on maturity,
experience and exposure rather than on political consideration
alone.
</P>
<P>
This would enable the diplomats to handle issues effectively,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria, Useni,
who is also Minister of Federal Capital Territory, said the
committee also recommended the federal government should properly
fund its media organizations so that they would be able to
effectively respond to foreign media propaganda against the
country and also inform the people about government activities.
</P>
<P>
According to Useni, other recommendations made at the four-day
meeting include the definition of Nigeria's national interest
within the context of the country's foreign policy as well as
enhancing the smooth operation of the judicial system and
ensuring that justice is brought to all.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said the committee also urged the federal
government to seek ways to strengthen the national currency and
curb inflation, and identify means of developing a bouyant
private sector as well as other strategic sectors of the national
economy.

whatever the circumstances, that we would make concessions on the
legitimate Palestinian rights," said Arafat following a meeting
with Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
</P>
<P>
France today also indirectly criticized the United States for
arranging the Washington summit between Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu without inviting Europe to attend.
</P>
<P>
"We understand perfectly the attitude of Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, who considered that a meeting prepared in other
circumstances could have brought about concrete results," said
French foreign ministry spokesman Jacquew Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chirac and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi today
announced that their two countries would call on the European
Union to adopt a common declaration on the Middle East peace

the negotiations for the relaunching of the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has planned to repatriate
10,000 Somali refugees in Ethiopia this month at voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000 Somalis would be transported to Awdal and Galbeed
regions in northwest Somalia, according to a UNHCR report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
They came from the Teferiber, Darwanaji and Hartisheik camps
close to the border with the self-declared Somaliland Republic
and had lived in the camps since the fall of former Somali
President Siad Barre in 1991, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Some 30,000 people were killed in clan fighting that erupted
after Barre's fall and around 300,000 more died in an ensuing
famine. Hundreds of thousands fled into exile in neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report said the repatriation was part of a UNHCR
program to send home some 46,000 Somali refugees, including 1,000
from Djibouti and 35,000 from Kenya before the end of the year.

<P>
Speaking to reporters in Belgrade upon his return from a
two-day official visit to Bratislava, Kontic said he was satisfied
because a number of agreements had been signed in the areas of
agriculture, air and river traffic, the protocol on cooperation
between the interior ministries had been signed, and solid
foundation had been laid for the long-term program of cultural
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said he had urged the Slovak leaders to upgrade diplomatic
relations between the two countries to the ambassadorial level as
soon as possible, and that the regime of visas between the two
countries should be fully liberalized.
</P>
<P>
"The Slovak side welcomed the definite lifting of the sanctions
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, assessing that it
presented a new possibility for raising bilateral cooperation to a
higher level," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting in Bratislava, the Slovak leaders also
expressed general support to Yugoslavia in joining international
political, financial and trade organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Bratislava, Kontic held talks with Slovak
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and Republican President Michal
Kovac.
</P>
<P>
Kontic said the Yugoslav economic delegation which accompanied
him on this visit had "very significant contacts and achieved even
more than they had expected."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned some contracted deals, such as an arrangement by
the Prva Iskra company of Baric with a Slovak partner which is
worth 5 million U.S. dollars this year and 10 million more in
1997.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the trade volume between the two countries
next year could reach 400 million U.S. dollars, which was the
trade value of the two countries before sanctions were imposed on
Yugoslavia in 1992, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kontic added that regular bus traffic between Belgrade and
Bratislava would be established this month.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Asks Republican House Candidates to Put </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Speaker Newt Gingrich of the
U.S. House of Representatives said he would advise Republicans in
close congressional races to do what is necessary to get
re-elected even if it meant distancing themselves from Republican
presidential nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich was asked in an interview with The New York Times
editorial board whether he would encourage House members to focus
on retaining Republican control of Congress as a check to a
possible second Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
"Well the entire margin of this race is probably 40 to 50
seats," Gingrich said in the interview published today. For as
many as 190 House members with relatively easy races, he said his
advice would be, "Ignore the polls, campaign for Dole exclusively
and turn out your vote."
</P>
<P>
"For the marginal members, being speaker of the House, I'd say
to them, `Talk to your pollsters, do what gets you elected and
call home afterward.'"
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said he thought Dole would rally to win the
presidential election. But he said voters probably would be more
inclined to vote for Republicans for Congress if they assumed
Clinton would be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
The best thing to tell Republican members is, "You do in your
district what you need to do to get re-elected," Gingrich told the
Times in the interview Thursday. "It's better to have a majority
that's slightly confused than a minority that's thoroughly solid."

<HEADLINE> London, Frankfurt Stocks Set New Records on US Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Leading European Stock markets
surged strongly today, with London and Frankfurt closed at record
highs, propelled by weaker-than-expected U.S. employment data and
a strong Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE 100 index had climbed to a new all-time
high of 4,025.1 points before dipping slightly and finishing at a
record close of 4,024.8, 24.8 points higher on the day and 60.7 up
on last week.
</P>
<P>
Traders took comfort from the surprisingly weak U.S. employment
figures which dented chances of a near-term U.S. interest rate
hike.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt market in Germany finished the session slightly
higher, 6.78 points up at 2,683.28, but still a new record high,
on the DAX-30 share index, 37.18 points up on Friday a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The market was also strengthened by the U.S. employment data
and a firm dollar which boosts export prospects.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse made solid gains and closed 16.6 points higher
at 2,152.69 on the CAC-40 index, 73.23 up from last week.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed up 24.8 points at 4,024.8. The Frankfurt
DAX-30 share index ended 6.78 points higher at 2,683.28. In Paris,
the CAC-40 index finished up 16.6 points at 2,152.69.

<HEADLINE> Irish, British PMs to Discuss Ulster Peace at EU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUBLIN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
and his British counterpart, John Major, are planning to hold a
bilateral meeting during the one-day special European Union (EU)
summit Saturday in a bid to give a fresh impetus to the Northern
Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to exchange views on how to inject
new life into the two-year old peace process, which is likely to
head to nowhere after the Irish Republican Army (IRA) restored its
bombing campaign, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which has been fighting against British rule in
Northern Ireland, ended a 17-month-old cease-fire in February by
staging bombing attacks upon the London Docklands and a major
shopping center in Manchester city.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said earlier today that Bruton and Major are
very much likely to announce fresh appeals for a new IRA
cease-fire agreement after their talks Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Pessimistic Over Future of Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today expressed pessimism
over the future of the Middle East peace process in view of the
failure of the recently-held Washington summit in forging an
agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Television, in a broadcast today, said that the
failure of the four-way Washington summit did not yield positive
results due to the Israeli intransigence and lack of response to
Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
"Under all these murky atmospheres, observers are unanimous
that the Middle East peace process is dying after (Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu pushed it into a dark tunnel," the
television said in a comment.
</P>
<P>
"Nor has the summit been able to break the Israeli hard line
vis-a-vis the tunnel dug under al-Aqsa mosque and the redeployment
of Israeli forces in the West Bank city of Hebron," it added.
</P>
<P>
It said that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, by rejecting an
invitation from U.S. President Bill Clinton to attend the summit,
has maintained the credibility of the Arab world and its role as a
main peace process catalyst.
</P>
<P>
The television, citing diplomatic sources, said Mubarak was in
favor of holding the summit in Cairo so that discussions would go
much deeper so as to get the peace process out of the current
stalemate.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi has hailed the recent creation of six new administrative
states in the country as part of the military hand-over program.
</P>
<P>
"The political transition program is now irreversible," Ikimi
told the United Nations General Assembly meeting held in New York
on Thursday, quoted by a report from the News Agency of Nigeria
today.
</P>
<P>
That was proved by the creation of new states, the
registration of political parties and the resumption of full
political activities nationwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
"And the overall macro-economic performance of Nigeria's
economy has improved with the implementation of deflationary
fiscal and monetary measures," Ikimi told the assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian foreign minister was trying to seek support from
the international community for the military government's
recently announced "Vision 2010" program which was aimed at
helping the Africa's most populous country achieve economic
prosperity, political stability and social harmony.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia: 52 Unregistered Serbs Still in Croatian Prisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-two Serbs unregistered as
missing were still held in Croatian prisons, an official of the
Yugoslav government commission for humanitarian issues and missing
persons said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Belgrade, the commission's secretary
Maksim Korac said these Serbs' names were given to a Yugoslav
delegation in the Croatian capital of Zagreb Thursday at a meeting
of the two state commissions.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian commission presented, at the end of the two-day
talks, a list with these 52 names, saying the persons were "in
Croatian prisons under charges of alleged espionage and other
acts."
</P>
<P>
According to figures available so far, there are 202 persons in
Croatian prisons, including five Yugoslav citizens and 145 Krajina
Serbs captured in 1995, while the remaining 52 persons are listed
only by name and surname with no other data.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian army launched massive offensives in the summer of
1995 against Serb-held areas in Croatia, forcing tens of thousands
of Croatian Serbs to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
Korac said the Yugoslav delegation expressed displeasure and
protest at the end of the meeting Thursday as the Croatian side
were still not ready to release these persons,
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that a legal procedure should be opened for their
release, because Croatia is obliged to do this under the Dayton
accords and, in particular, the protocol on cooperation of the two
commissions which was signed in Zagreb on April 16 and 17," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav commission appealed to the public and all
international humanitarian organizations to contribute to the
release of these persons, Korac said, adding the commission will
insist that these 52 persons be released pending the establishment
of their possible guilt through legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
During the talks in Zagreb, the Yugoslav commission presented
to the Croatian side a list of 199 identified persons killed in
Vukovar, a town in Eastern Slavonia in northeastern Croatia, in
1991 and gave the names of two persons who had not been registered
and are currently held by the Yugoslav authorities, Korac added.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Announces Dates for Bosnian Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 4 (Xinhua) - A U.S. diplomat involved in
Bosnia's peace process said today that the country's local
elections will be held between November 22 and 24 despite
concerns from his European colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Robert Frowick, who heads the mission of the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is given the
final say on election issues by the Dayton peace accords, said
that he made "a very controversial decision" to go ahead with the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian local elections, originally scheduled for September
14, had to be postponed due to a controversy on the voter
registration.
</P>
<P>
Both Carl Bildt, the international community's High
Representative to Bosnia, and Flavio Cotti, Swiss foreign minister
and OSCE chairman, have expressed concerns that the elections
might be fraught with difficulties if they were to be held in the
winter.
</P>
<P>
"My principal reason for staying on track with the municipal
elections before the end of the year was to take full advantage of
the strength" of the NATO-led peacekeeping forces in Bosnia,
Frowick said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led forces, comprising 15,000 soldiers, played the
key role in providing a security environment in Bosnia's national
elections held on September 14.
</P>
<P>
However, it is widely believed that Frowick has made the
decision to the tune of the Clinton administration, which fears
that the further delay of the local elections will complicate the
withdrawal of the American troops, which is a sensitive issue in
the U.S. presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Calls for More Official Development Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Fiji today urged the
industrialized nations to substantially increase their official
development assistance (ODA) to the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In a speech in the general debate at the 51st U.N. General
Assembly session, Poseci W. Bune, head of the Fiji delegation,
said that in recent years, donor countries had failed to comply
with the internationally-agreed targets of ODA and commitments for
new resources.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote world peace and development, he noted, the
rich nations should expand their ODA and improve the quality of
such assistance to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He criticized some developed nations which "seek to impose
alien norms on countries with a unique, traditional and customary
nature of society."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, for economic development, the developing
countries have the right to get more access to advanced
technologies and capital worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"International cooperation for development lies at the very
heart of improving the living conditions of the great majority of
people in our world who live in developing and least developed
countries," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 4 (Xinhua)-- Baghdad and Ankara have agreed on
a mechanism to transport to Iraq foodstuffs and medicines in line
with the oil-for-food deal signed between Iraq and United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Al-Thawra reported today that the agreement was
reached during talks between Iraq's Chairman of Land Transport
Authority Sami Abdullah, who is currently on a visit to Turkey,
and Chairman of the Turkish Carries Federation and representatives
of several Turkish land transport companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq can sell up to 2 billion
U.S. dollars of oil to buy humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
But the sales was delayed when the Iraqi military intervened in
Kurdish fighting in northern Iraq a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was Turkey's third largest trade partner before the
U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Turkey and Iraq in 1989 was reported at 3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
A joint Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline running from Iraq's Kirkuk
oil fields to Turkish Mediterranean oil port of Yumurtalik has
been idle since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Preparatory Committee Calls for Closer Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior official voiced his
hope today in Beijing that the British side will earnestly
co-operate with China, especially the Preparatory Committee of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), to ensure a smooth
transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
at a press conference held in the Great Hall of the People,
Chen Ziying, vice-chairman and deputy secretary general of the
Preparatory Committee, said China and Britain made further
progress on the Hong Kong issue recently, with agreements on
Container Terminal 9 and Hong Kong's transition ceremony reached
by both sides.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is a common target prescribed in the
Sino-British Joint Declaration for both sides to increase
cooperation, and it will also lay a foundation for the British
side to cooperate with China after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chen also gave a briefing on the work of the fifth plenary
session of the Preparatory Committee, and its major tasks in the
next stage, saying the Selection Committee will be produced at the
next plenary session to be held on November 1 and 2 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
On the principle to be adopted to decide candidates of the
Selection Committee members, he said the meeting of chairman and
vice-chairmen of the Preparatory Committee will not choose the
members subjectively.
</P>
<P>
The selection must be based on the application and the namelist
of the suggested candidates put forward by the Preparatory
Committee members, while taking into consideration the
representativeness of the Selection Committee, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee will be made up of representatives from
four sectors of Hong Kong. If its members are only chosen on a
voting basis, candidates from one sector may have more than 100
winners, he analyzed.
</P>
<P>
That would be unreasonable, and not accord with relevant
decisions of the National People's Congress stipulated on April 4,
1990, he stressed.

In referring to the nomination of the first Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong SAR, Chen said the Preparatory Committee has made a
requirement that those intending to seek the post should express
their intention to the meeting of the chairman and vice-chairmen
of the Preparatory Committee, while completing application forms,
before the establishment of the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the method for the formation of the
Provisional Legislative Council, he said the council is
completely a result of the British side's ssabotage of the
"through-train" arrangements by the British side.
</P>
<P>
He said during and after the formulating process of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong SAR, China and Britain reached an agreement
on the transition of the last Hong Kong legislature. If its
formation was in conformity with the relevant provisions of the
Basic Law, its members could become members of the first
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR if they upheld the Basic
Law and pledged allegiance to Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
As the British side overthrew this agreement, the Provisional
Legislative Council had to be established, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the term of Provisional Legislative Council
will not exceed one year, and issues that it examines and approves
will be related to timely and effective operation of the SAR
government.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the qualifications of the Provisional Legislative
Council members are open and reasonable, not favoring some people
in society, nor setting excessive demands on others.

</P>
<P>
The 17.8-million-US dollar contract for the Ertan Hydropower

About 200 million US dollars, part of a 930 million dollar
World Bank loan being used in the station project, has been put
into the purchase of equipment.
</P>
<P>
Ten companies of eight countries have attended the bid since
this February.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi is expected to adopt advanced technology to produce
the major transformer, which will be composed of 19 single

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Two methods for selecting
candidates of the first Chief Executive and the Provisional
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) were adopted at a two-day fifth plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, which closed here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A Press Communique was also approved at the meeting. Each
Preparatory Committee member has written down a total of more than
300 suggested candidates for the membership of the Selection
Committee, which will choose the first Chief Executive and
Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen, vice-premier of the State Council and chairman of
the Preparatory Committee, said the approval of the two methods
shows that several important documents concerning preparations for
forming the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will receive
support and involvement by Hong Kong people, in the same way as
the work for preparing the formation of the Selection Committee,
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, some British officials are still opposing
the establishment of the provisional legislature.
</P>
<P>
It was the British side which unilaterally implemented the
so-called political reform package, thus sabotaging the
"through-train" arrangement in the aspect of the legislature, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances. he added, the establishment of the
provisional legislature was reasonable from the viewpoint of
ensuring Hong Kong's stable transition, and normal operation of
the Hong Kong SAR upon its founding.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the Preparatory Committee's decision on the
establishment of the provisional legislature, and the methods for
the formation of the provisional legislature adopted by the
meeting, were based on fully soliciting opinions from Hong Kong
residents. Some relevant stipulations also reflect the common
aspiration of the Hong Kong people.

In order to implement the principles of "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong", and a high-degree of autonomy, he noted, the
most important thing for the candidate of the Chief Executive is
to understand the principle of "one country, two systems"
completely and correctly, and implement it resolutely, and
faithfully carry out the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The future Chief Executive should be a person acceptable to all
sides in Hong Kong, and a person who is capable of uniting a group
of leading members to guarantee that Hong Kong people and the
region have long-term prosperity and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that the candidates for the first Chief
Executive, members of the Selection Committee, and members of the
provisional legislature will be selected in accordance with the
relevant stipulations of the Basic Law and specific methods
defined by the Preparatory Committee, as well as the procedures.
</P>
<P>
He said: "the democracy that we advocate in Hong Kong and its

Western countries."

<HEADLINE> Feature: Is Water Still Safe and Adequate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- When first discovered, the
Boracay Island in the Philippines was simply an adventurer's
paradise.
</P>
<P>
The land was unspoiled; pristine, clear water flowed through
the island; and white, sandy beaches stretched for miles along the
coastline.
</P>
<P>
But now, the water in the world-class vacation spot has become
unsafe; potable water is no longer available; tourists and
residents have to turn to bottled mineral water to quench their
thirst; and the incidence of diseases caused by poor water
sanitation has been rising.
</P>
<P>
However, Boracay is not the only "lost paradise" in the
country, as the whole Philippines is facing a more and more
serious water crisis.
</P>
<P>
Heavy water pollution and severe water shortage have made the
Filipinos believe that their water is becoming neither safe nor
adequate.
</P>
<P>
Public Works Secretary Gregario Vigilar admitted that water
pollution in the country has been very serious due to the fact
that the wastes generated by the general public are either simply
allowed to flow or are discharged into various river systems.
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon is partially attributed to the insufficient
service of the waste disposal system. For example, in metro
Manila, only 13 percent of the population is served by a sewerage
system while improperly maintained septic tanks serve the rest.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that domestic sources contribute 60 percent of
the water pollution in the country's major urban areas while
various industries including chemical factories, paper mills,
tanneries, alcohol distilleries and food manufacturing plants
generate the remaining 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local scientists said that for the above reasons, almost all
rivers in the country are now considered biologically dead.
</P>
<P>
The Pasig River, which flows through Manila, is just one typical
example of these rivers.
</P>
<P>
The Pasig River was very famous in the history of the
Philippines and it has been widely cited since the 1500s by poets
for being the main artery of the country's economy and the
lifeblood of many generations. Just 50 years ago, the river was
clean and safe, fish was plentiful, and cruising in it was an
enjoyable experience.
</P>
<P>
But during the last two decades, squatter families mushroomed
in terrifying numbers along its banks, new industrial factories
sprang up to darken the landscape and maritime activities added
their refuse to the water.
</P>
<P>
Now, the river is famous for a different reason: It has become
one giant sewer where all the city's dirt is channeled through.
Besides the stink, its heavily polluted water is leaking into
underground water, therefore spoiling the source of drinking water
for neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
More important, water pollution has begun to threaten
people's life in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the country has had three major cholera epidemics
with dozens of deaths and more than 2,000 people affected. This
year, other water-borne diseases like red tide and dengue fever
also caused the death of at least 70 people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Water pollution is not only causing diseases but also
threatening the country's water supplies.
</P>
<P>
Vigilar said the country will experience a severe shortage of
industrial and drinking water within the next five years if the
pollution of water sources is not stopped.
</P>
<P>
"Our estimate is that by the year 2000, unless we stop pollution
of our water now, we will really be in a critical condition," he
said. "It is not that water will disappear and get scarce. It will
still be there, but in a contaminated condition that would
effectively withdraw it from normal use in industry, agriculture
and households."
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos was alarmed by the seriousness of the
water problem in his country. When he paid "a surprise visit" last
month in metro Manila, he was appalled by what he saw: piles of
uncollected garbage as well as dirty canals and esteros. In great
anger, Ramos ordered all mayors and various sectors of the society
to clean up the city.
</P>
<P>
After Vigilar revealed the water crisis the Philippines will
face, Ramos ordered a wide-ranging review of the government's
water policy to avert the bleak scenario outlined by Vigilar.
</P>
<P>
He also accepted a proposal of the House of Representatives for
appointing a "water czar" to give special emphasis on
water-related programs and projects.
</P>
<P>
In a further effort, the presidential palace also announced
that a second national summit on water would be held on October 15
to assess the status of the commitments made at the first summit
in 1994 and coordinate measures and actions of different
government agencies to ensure a steady supply of water in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The congress also took a positive step by agreeing to review
the extension of the National Water Crisis Act which gives the
president authority over water-related projects and contracts in
order to solve the water problem.
</P>
<P>
The act, which expired last July, has been pending in the
congress.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos raised the slogan of "the Philippines 2000" when
he took the oath of office four years ago.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said it is possible that Ramos' dream of building
the Philippines into a developed country by the year 2000 will be
jeopardized by the unexpected water crisis. They said that whether
his dream will come true hinges on how he will solve the water
problem in his country.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Peace Only Way to Realize Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
implicitly criticizing Israel's current policies, said here today
that the only way to realize security and stability in the Middle
East is a just and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
In a speech marking the 23rd anniversary of Egypt's initial
victory during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, Mubarak said that the
victory showed that strength alone could not ensure full security.
</P>
<P>
"The arrogance of power and false claims were shattered and
everyone saw that strength, no matter how great, cannot alone
achieve complete security," he said in the speech broadcast on the
Egyptian television.
</P>
<P>
On October 6, 1973, the Egyptian armed forces launched a
surprise assault across the Suez Canal on the Israeli troops
positioned along the much-bragged "impregnable Bar Lev Defense
Line" and retrieved part of the northern Sinai peninsula seized by
Israel in 1967, thereby gaining a partial victory over Israel in
the initial stage of the 4th Middle East war, or October War as
called by the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Though the Egyptian forces were later pushed back, the October
victory actually forced the Israelis to the negotiating table,
thereby sowing the seed to the launch of the Middle East peace
moves years later.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the two countries signed a peace treaty, under which
Israel returned to Egypt the Sinai peninsula it captured in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who was Egypt's airforce commander during the October
War, also said that a strong Egyptian army was a necessity if
peace and stability were to be maintained in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The president, apparently in reference to Israel's delay in
honoring its agreements already signed with the Palestinians,
renewed his call for commitment to all signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process will not be advanced "without
commitment to the signed agreements which the whole world has
witnessed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want a just and overall peace that realizes equal security
for all the parties and ends a conflict that has drained the
capacities and potentialities of the region for more than half a
century," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has acted as a mediator in Arab-Israeli peace
talks, has repeatedly urged the Israeli government led by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to honor the Palestinian-Israeli
agreements and resume peace talks with Syria, Lebanon as well as
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Mubarak met with Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat for talks on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived in Cairo early this morning, briefed Mubarak
on the outcome of a four-way summit that ended in Washington
Wednesday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit, attended by Arafat, Netanyahu, Jordan's
King Hussein and U.S. President Bill Clinton, failed to reach
agreements on any outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat and Netanyahu agreed to resume immediate
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks on Sunday with priority on
discussion of a long-delayed redeployment of Israeli forces in the
West Bank town of Hebron, a hot-bed for Israeli-Palestinian
conflicts.

HARARE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The supply of food aid to needy
people in the past few years dropped drastically from over 15
million tonnes in 1992/93 to about eight million in 1994/95, the
Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) has said.
</P>
<P>
Shortages of food are experienced the world over in both
developed and developing countries due to war, natural disasters
and poverty, the FAO release said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The decline in food aid supply is most damaging to the hungry
in food-deficit countries since it is they who most need, and
benefit from targeted food assistance," according to the release.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 800 million people worldwide are
undernourished.
</P>
<P>
FAO said food aid should target key areas of human development
such as women and children at critical times of their lives.

<HEADLINE> No Sleep For Woman After Taking Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese woman has gone without
any sleep for six consecutive months since she took medicine to
treat dizziness, but doctors are still unable to find an
effective cure for her lack of slumber.
</P>
<P>
Due to her lack of sleep, Li Hongmei, 36, can not watch TV
programs or movies, or read books because her brain is in a state
of extreme fatigue.
</P>
<P>
She suffers most as she stays awake in bed night after night
in order to rest her body.
</P>
<P>
Li, from central China's Wuhan City, recalled that she took
some common medicine on her doctor's advice in March when she felt
weak, had a poor appetite and was sleepy.
</P>
<P>
The medicine, however, gave Li a high temperature and caused
vomiting. She could sleep no longer than ten minutes, and could
eat nothing but a little apple and milk.
</P>
<P>
In early April, she took an oral liquid on her doctor's
advice. But her symptoms became even more serious afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Li's symptoms, such as headaches, feeling weak, low fever, and
vomiting, have been cured. But she is still left with the legacy
of sleeplessness.
</P>
<P>
Li said she was healthy previously and there was no history of
such a disease in her family.

<P>
JAKARTA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today called on the military to be all-out in safeguarding the
1997 general elections, which served as a means to realize the
people's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to commemorate the 51st founding
anniversary of the Indonesian Armed Forces, Soeharto predicted
that there existed no significant problem that would impede the
implementation of the general elections next year.
</P>
<P>
He said an internal rift that might happen to the social and
political organizations would disrupt the smooth implementation of
the elections.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces should be able to prevent, handle and take
measures against "any form of provocation wherever it comes from
and whatever it is addressed against," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said dissatisfaction should not be used to sow jealousy,
hatred and provocation which could endanger the country and
nation.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1945, the Indonesian Armed Forces now have 500,000
members including a police force.
</P>
<P>
Out of their very origins and from the key role they played
during the struggle for independence, the forces developed the
concept of dual functions as a guardian of the country's security
and as a stabilizing force in the nation's social and political
life.

talks on corporate results, with the SSE-30 index rising 287.89

DAMASCUS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Syria is conducting intensified
diplomatic activities for holding an emergency Arab summit in its
capital Damascus to discuss the latest developments in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The recent tension in the region and the Israeli intransigence
towards the peace process require a common Arab stand and active
and effective measures to face up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's hardline policy, according to local diplomatic sources,
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders have to draw up a unified strategy and freeze
relations with Israel to salvage the peace process by forcing
Israel to comply with the commitments made by its previous government,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab states have to prevent the area from returning to the
circle of tension and violence, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Arab summit aims to support the Arab strategy
that was based on the U.N. Security Council resolutions and the
land-for-peace principle, observers here believed.

The strategy aims to protect the legitimate rights of the
Palestinians, defending the Al Aqsa Mosque and Jerusalem which

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Selective buying of blue
chips by foreign funds on Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
Market helped lift the Composite Index (CI) to close firmer this
week after a moderate trading.
</P>
<P>
The 100-counter CI rose 19.59 points to 1,150.18, while the
all Main Board Emas Index gained 4.05 points to 333.72 and the
Industrial Index 41.44 points to 2,190.68.
</P>
<P>
But, continued consolidation and a generally lack of interest
from players saw the Second Board dropping 24.04 points to 595.28.
</P>
<P>
This week, the market started on a cautious note, focusing on
the second liners and selective blue chips as players mostly
stayed on the sidelines for lack of leads.
</P>
<P>
The market turned active toward the end of the week with
Thursday's and Friday's volume breaking the 250 million shares
mark.
</P>
<P>
With focus on the Main Board, especially the heavyweights, the
CI consistently recorded gains with the biggest being an 8.4-point
rise on Thursday while on Friday the gains which reached as high
as 9.97 points were reduced to 2.46 points at the close on profit
taking.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said institutionals might be accumulating shares on
expectations that the budget announcement and the ruling party
UMNO's general assembly from October 9 to 12 would give some boost
to the market to break the 1,200 points level.
</P>
<P>
There would be more buying of blue chips next week but the
index would not be going above 1,800 points as gains would be
limited by profit taking, an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
On the Second Board stock, analysts said there was a strong
psychological barrier at the 600 points level, adding that players
did not expect that level to be sustainable and as such did not
focus much on the Second Board this week.
</P>
<P>
An analyst said there might be some bargain hunting on the
Second Board next week but it would be limited.
</P>
<P>
On the Main Board, turnover decreased to 733.461 million
shares valued at 5.308 billion ringgit (about 2.123 billion U.S.
dollars) from 914.247 million shares worth 6.681 billion ringgit
(about 2.672 billion dollars) traded the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the Second Board was at 307.913 million shares worth
3.534 billion ringgit (about 1.414 billion dollars) against
602.420 million shares valued at 7.114 billion ringgit (about
2.8456 billion dollars) previously.
</P>
<P>
Off-market deals, however, dropped to 122.711 million units
valued at 1.076 billion ringgit (about 430.4 million dollars) from
133.405 million shares worth 1.433 billion ringgit (about 573.2
million dollars) last week.

LAGOS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States has denied the
speculated softening of its hardline stand on Nigeria following
the recent registration of five political parties in the west
African country.

The move was viewed as a major step in the country toward a

in the military government's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
Despite the registration of new parties, however, the United
States has not changed its policy toward Nigeria and santions
will continue, according to Michael Braxton, Press Attache of the
United States Information Service in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"United States policy is to promote the early return to
civilian democratic government and respect for human rights in
Nigeria. That is our position," Braxton said, quoted by the local

<HEADLINE> Experts Predict Sound Economic Growth for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to enjoy a
rapid and healthy economic growth this year and next, with the GDP
for this year around 10 percent, rising to 10.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was predicted by a panel of experts from the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences and the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector and the service sector will also grow
in a pace similar to that of the GDP during the two years,
announced the experts today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They forecast that the whole society's fixed assets investment
will grow at a nominal rate of 18 percent, or a real rate of 10.7
percent, to 2,350 billion yuan this year, with the investment rate
standing around 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the total fixed assets investment will rise more than
19 percent nominally, or 12.5 percent in real terms, to 2,800
billion yuan, with the investment rate remaining at 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
The experts said in a report that China's inflation will fall
further this year and next, with the retail price index growing
and price rise level around seven percent and 6.7 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the retail price index grew 14.8 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
The experts claimed that the Chinese economy has basically
achieved a "soft landing" thanks to a tight monetary policy
adopted since the second half of 1993.
</P>
<P>
With the lowering of interest rates twice this year, many
localities felt a strong urge to launch new construction projects,
they noted. They suggested that the Central government continue to
keep a tight rein on fixed assets investments, which are in danger
of running rampant.
</P>
<P>
"On a profounder level, the quantitative mode of economic
growth has not been efficiently transformed (into the qualitative
mode of economic growth), and there still exist severe problems,
such as wasteful allocation of resources, poor efficiency and
management," said the report.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, a risk investment system has yet to be
established."
</P>
<P>
"It poses a tremendously gigantic task to establish a system
suiting the needs of a socialist market economy."
</P>
<P>
The report called on the government to strengthen supervision
of the construction market.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today renewed his call on Israel to commit itself to the signed
agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process will not be advanced "without
commitment to the signed agreements which the whole world has
witnessed," he said here in a speech marking the 23rd anniversary
of the Egyptian army's successful crossing of the Suez Canal at
the start of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
"We want a just and overall peace that realizes equal security
for all the parties and ends a conflict that has drained the
capacities and potentialities of the region for more than half a
century," Mubarak said in the speech.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has acted as a mediator in Arab-Israeli peace
talks, has repeatedly urged the Israeli government led by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to honor the Palestinian-Israeli
agreements and resume peace talks with Syria, Lebanon as well as
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak meets today with Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat for talks on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived in Cairo early this morning, is expected to
brief Mubarak on the outcome of a four-way summit that ended in
Washington Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit, attended by Arafat, Netanyahu, Jordan's
King Hussein and U.S. President Bill Clinton, failed to reach
agreements on any outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat and Netanyahu agreed to resume immediate
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks on Sunday with priority on
discussion of a long-delayed redeployment of Israeli forces in the
West Bank town of Hebron.

<HEADLINE> HK Business Group Leaves for Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of Hong Kong
business leaders left here today for Cambodia on a mission to
assess new business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) and
led by chairman of the TDC's Garment Advisory Committee, Kenneth
Fang, the delegation will meet Cambodia's two prime ministers as
well as other senior government officials and industry leaders.
</P>
<P>
According to Fang, Hong Kong is currently the sixth-largest
investor in Cambodia. The territory's total exports to Cambodia
increased by 21 percent in 1995 to reach 302.6 million HK dollars
(39 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said that his delegation will make a study of the rapid
growth in garment production in Cambodia for export to Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that several members of the Hong Kong delegation
representing garment manufacturers were planning to establish
production lines in that country.
</P>
<P>
A TDC's research showed that the main objective of reform
measures implemented by the Cambodian Government is to
rehabilitate a market economy from a centrally planned economy and
raise the standard of living.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment in the country is being strongly
encouraged by the Cambodian government with an investment law
offering tax incentives and other preferential treatments to
foreign investors engaged in manufacturing, tourism, agro-industry
and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodia Investment Board has approved 194 projects
involving foreign investment with a total registered capital of
2.15 billion US dollars since a new foreign investment law was
passed in August 1994.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Former Indian PM Further Isolated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The non-bailable warrant
issued against former Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao in a
forgery case on Friday appears to have further isolated him with
Congress Party President Sitaram Kesri unwilling to fully rally
the party behind him.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a lie to say that the Congress Party image has not
been affected by the issuing of the non-bailable warrant against
Mr. Rao," The Hindustan Times today quoted Kesri as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party president made the remarks Friday evening
soon after he met Rao following the Delhi High Court stayed a
non-bailable warrant against the former prime minister in the
sensational St. Kitts forgery case.
</P>
<P>
Kesri succeeded Rao last month as the latter resigned from the
post because of his involvement in another 100,000 U.S. dollar
cheating case.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has charged Rao and
his co-accused with criminal conspiracy to fabricate documents so
as to defame and prosecute former Prime Minister V. P. Singh.
</P>
<P>
On the crucial question of Rao continuing as leader of the
Congress Parliament Party (CPP, the parliamentary group of the
Congress party), Kesri said, "It is for him to decide. I will not
say anything."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Congress Party would fully stand behind Rao
and ask him to continue as CPP president, Kesri said, "Please do
not ask me anything further."
</P>
<P>
He also explained that his meeting with Rao Friday evening was
on personal terms and not as the Congress party president and
Rao's successor.
</P>
<P>
Judging from his remarks, Kesri was unwilling to commit the
party's full support to Rao at this stage in view of the party
members' attitude toward Rao following a series of court cases
against him.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the forgery and cheating cases, Rao was also
involved in a bribery case in which he was accused of paying some
parliament members from a small party for their support in a
crucial vote of confidence in his government in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior Congress Party leader K. Karunakaran, one of
the main party members who deserted Rao, said Rao should resign as
Congress Party parliamentary leader on his own.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Rao as a senior Congress Party leader should decide
whatever is in the interest of the party," another senior party
leader said.
</P>
<P>
Congress Party sources said the rebels' plan was to mount moral
pressure rather than make too much vocal demand that Rao step down
from the leadership of the Congress Parliamentary Party.
</P>
<P>
Their strategy was not to accentuate the crisis already facing
the party as Kesri too shares their view, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The morale among Rao's loyalists was low after the Delhi High
Court served the warrant on Rao Friday evening and few leaders
were willing to openly show their support to Rao for retaining his
post of CPP president.

six-day conference ending here today pledged support to improve
teachers' status and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The conference adopted nine proposals on matters including the

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Hold Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's first post-Gulf War
National Assembly (parliament), which was elected in 1992, ended
its term today, two days ahead of the eighth legislative elections
scheduled for October 7.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50 new parliament members will be elected into the
eighth National Assembly from 230 candidates in 25 constituencies
on Monday when nearly 110,000 eligible voters are expected to turn
out to exercise their franchises.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's first National Assembly was inaugurated in 1963 when
late Sheikh Abdullah Al-Sabah, the former Amir of Kuwait,
announced that Kuwait entered the constitutional era.
</P>
<P>
Statistics published by the parliament's general secretariat
suggested the parliament played an increasingly important role in
the country's political life. Dozens of laws concerning
political, economic and social welfare matters were drafted out in
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
However, the outgoing parliament was also sharply criticized by
some parliamentary candidates and a number of voters on some
fronts.
</P>
<P>
Candidate Abdulreda Aseeri told a gathering lately during his
campaign that although Kuwait seems to be moving towards a
full-fledged democracy, the threat to extinguish any such
movement exists.
</P>
<P>
He said: "democracy in Kuwait has its ups and downs."
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait's mode is very new, and this phenomenon needs an
evolutionary process," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a pubic opinion poll carried out by
candidate Adel Al-Sarawi from the seventh constituency recently
showed that 68 percent of respondents viewed the parliament as a
body that could play "legislative monitoring role."
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that people of Kuwait hope priority will
be given to economic and security issues in the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said all people care about their security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Now a total of 230 candidates are in their last-ditch efforts
to gain the mandate of the voters. The local media described the
occasion as a "democratic festival" with posters, signboards and
makeshift tents popped up at every corner of the country for the
election campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Continue Dialogue with Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today it will
not isolate Myanmar but will continue to have meaningful dialogue
with the Yangoon government which is showing signs of change.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said there was
evidence that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN)
policy of constructive engagement with Myanmar had brought about
changes as the country was slowly opening up.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar is a rich country. If we shut them off, they can live
for years without any contact with the rest of the world. In
fact, that was what they did for almost 20 years," he said while
talking to reporters, asking: "why was there no effort to block
them then?"
</P>
<P>
Asked for his views on the U.S. ban on members of the Myanmar's
State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and their families
from traveling to the United States, Mahathir said "I don't think
they want to go to the U.S. unless the U.S. prevents them from
attending the United Nations which happens to be there. That
would be wrong."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that unlike the United States, which is a super
power that tended to use force, Malaysia preferred to interact and
have meaningful dialogue with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
He also said it would be good if Myanmar joined the ASEAN so
that the rest of the regional group would be able to have some
influence and effect on the Yangoon regime.
</P>
<P>
On whether Myanmar's membership in ASEAN would be decided at
next month's informal summit of ASEAN leaders, he said: "I don't
know yet. If we have our way, we want them in."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam. Myanmar, which was given
observer status earlier this year, has recently applied formally
for full membership of the group.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Peasant Farmers' Union of
Zambia will assist its 40,000 members with inputs for the next
agricultural season.
</P>
<P>
The "Zambia Daily Mail" newspaper today quoted union Vice
President Roger Phiri as saying at a farmers' meeting held in
Kalomo in southern Zambia that a total number of 800 associations
with an average of 50 members per association will benefit from
the credit facility.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the loans to be offered to the farmers will
have no part payment as demanded by other lending institutions in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The measure is to alleviate the suffering the farmers have
experienced for a long time, said the union official.
</P>
<P>
But he said the distribution of the inputs is pathetic because
fertilizers are inadequate.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 5 (Xinhua)-- The Norwegian government's
proposed budget for 1997 envisages a surplus of 40.9 billion
Norwegian kroner (about 6.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to press reports reaching here today, the expected
surplus in the state budget will be equivalent to 5.1 percent of
Norway's gross domestic product (GDP) next year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government expects to earn 2.4 billion kroner
in interest income from an oil-generated financial surplus it has
previously set aside in special funds.
</P>
<P>
The entire 1997 surplus, if realized, will be placed in the
Norwegian government's petroleum funds, which will be then
invested overseas by the country's investment bank.
</P>
<P>
Although Norway is not a European Union member, it has the
finances to meet the EU single currency union's financial
criteria, which many other European countries do not.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- To enliven the State-run
enterprises is a task that must be accomplished since it is
related to boosting China's economic strength and consolidating
the economic base for socialism with Chinese characteristics,
Premier Li Peng said recently.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks while inspecting State-run
enterprises in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
between October 2 and 4.
</P>
<P>
He told leaders of the State-run enterprises in Nanning and
Liuzhou cities that certain achievements have been made in the
reform and development of the State-run enterprises in recent
years and in 1997, the Central Government will continue to give
the task priority and will take more effective measures to deepen
the reform.
</P>
<P>
He said that a responsibility system aimed at putting an end to
losses should be introduced at different levels of the enterprises
that are still suffering losses, while stressing the gradual
setting up of a social security system.
</P>
<P>
Li said that to revitalize the State-run enterprises, it is
necessary to have a good operation mechanism and marketable
products, but what is more important is to have a good leadership
for the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that the State-run enterprises are still facing
many difficulties and problems, saying the Central Government is
very much concerned about it.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the reform of the State-run enterprises is a
long-term task and asked the enterprises not to blindly seek
economic growth but to pay more attention to the market demand.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting the flood prevention facilities in Liuzhou
City, the premier said that the fact the city suffered again huge
losses from a major flood this summer revealed flaws in the city's
flood-prevention work and called for improved efforts in
flood-prevention.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng praised the autonomous region for its achievements in
all aspects in economic and social developments in recent
years. However, he said the region still faces a heavy task in
poverty relief work.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia CPO, Rubber and Tin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Crude palm oil (CPO),
rubber and tin markets in Malaysia ended the week mixed with CPO
unchanged and rubber and tin lower.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals traded on the Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange
(KLCE) wrapped up this week unchanged following uncertainty in
future market trend.
</P>
<P>
During the week, trading was volatile with closing prices
ranging between 1,160 ringgit (about 464 U.S. dollars) per tonne
and 1,195 ringgit (about 478 U.S. dollars) per tonne. The price
movement was heavily affected by movement of crude palm oil
futures.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber closed this week slightly easier in lower
range due to the absence of significant leads.
</P>
<P>
November RSS One dropped half sen to 313.00 sen (about 125.2
U.S. cents) per kg against 313.50 sen (about 125.4 U.S. cents) per
kg last week, while SMR 20 fell 1.50 sen from 307.00 sen (about
122.8 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Scattered interests from Europe for November shipment saw
little impact on the local rubber market.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said players liquidated their positions ahead of the
weekend on fears that the market would be bearish next week, which
prompted the easier close.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the tin price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM)
closed slightly lower this week on a slight higher offering
prompted by the weaker sentiment on the London Metal Exchange
(LME).
</P>

BANGKOK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai caretaker government
will not review its Myanmar policy despite the recent developments
in Yangon, newly-appointed caretaker Deputy Foreign Minister Thep

"Under this policy, we call for democratization and national
reconciliation (in Myanmar)," he added.

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Maintain Fiscal, Money Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's economic strategy
for 1997 will maintain the fiscal austerity and an exchange policy
in which the peso will continue to be sustained by the forces of
the market, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo said today.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo told the opening of the annual meeting of the
Industrial Chambers Confederation in the central state of
Guanajuato that it would be uncongruous and risky to compromise an
evolution of the exchange rate based on a flotation band.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that this would amount to putting in the
hands of speculators the economic policies, as well as the
economic future of the country.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the need of maintaining fiscal austerity and of
encouraging internal savings to support productive investments and
not financial speculation.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo expressed the intention to propose a clear, consistent
and realistic strategy for the gross domestic product (GDP) to
grow by 4 percent next year while reducing inflation and interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government, the president said, will absorb the
cost of the reforms to the Social Security system, as well as the
cost of financial supports channeled to diverse sectors after the
1995 crisis.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted that the strategy for next year will include the
continuation of structural reforms, the promotion of productive
investments and the enhancement of economic productivity.

<HEADLINE> National Examination on Lawyer Qualification Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth National Examination
on Lawyer Qualification began today in 295 test sites across the
country.
</P>
<P>
A new record of 127,111 people registered for the test, an
increase of more than 9,200 over last year. Shandong Province,
with 11,000 applicants, topped the list. Both Henan and Sichuan
provinces have over 8,000 applicants, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 entrants in the Tibet Autonomous Region have signed
up for the test.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Ministry of Justice, the Lawyers
Law and the revised Criminal Procedure Law will take effect on
January 1 next year, which will improve lawyers' practice
conditions and the country's law-enforcement environment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more scientific test questions have boosted the
confidence of entrants in obtaining lawyer qualification through
the test.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more graduating university students and
those with Master's degrees or above are attending the test this
year, which helps optimize the age structure of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the ministry noted that local law-enforcement
and administrative departments have taken effective measures to
organize the test well. Many local departments on lawyer
management have adopted scientific statistical and analyzing
methods.
</P>
<P>
By June this year, there had been 7,547 law firms around the
country which employ more than 95,000 lawyers. However, the number
and capability of lawyers are not yet able to meet the need of
fast economic and social development in China.
</P>
<P>
According to future plans worked out by the ministry, there
will be 150,000 lawyers in China by the end of the century, and
the figure will rise to 300,000 by the year 2010.

KATHMANDU, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Opposition lawmakers in the
Nepali lower house of parliament have asked Supplies Minister
Gajendra Singh to resign on alleged corruption charges, the local
press said today.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of parliament was disrupted for one hour Friday as
MPs from the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) demanded explanation from Singh on
recent press reports indicating his involvement in a corruption
case, newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Two local weekly newspapers recently published an interview
with Assistant Supplies Minister Anish Ansari alleging that Singh
had taken some 50 million rupees (over 800,000 US dollars) in
bribes from public corporations under the ministry.
</P>
<P>
But the reports did not reveal details of the case.
</P>
<P>
Singh was not available for comments on the allegation against
him as he was out of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Singh is president of the Sabdhavana (Goodwill) Party, the
smallest party in the three-party ruling coalition which came to
power in September last year with Sher Bahadur Deuba from the
Nepali Congress (NC) party as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, while clarifying the issue to the meeting,
Ansari denied the reports on his interview regarding the
corruption allegation against Singh.

WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe said here today that there would be still a need of
international peacekeeping force in Bosnia next year and his
country would send troops to join such a force.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we (NATO) have achieved a lot... but not enough to
leave Yugoslavia totally. So we have asked our authorities to
study the situation," visiting Minister Ruehe told reporters
before a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are some 60,000 NATO-led peace implementation
force (IFOR) in Bosnia and the force was scheduled to leave the
country at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe predicted that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was
likely to sponsor a new force to maintain peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Germany currently provides medical and logistics support for
IFOR, but it hinted recently that it would be prepared to
contribute infantry peacekeepers with armored vehicles to a future
mission.
</P>
<P>
The United States has a force of more than 15,000 in Bosnia and
planned to completely withdraw them before mid-March next year.
Perry said Thursday that the United States has not yet decided

</P>
<P>
Collenette offered his resignation Thursday in a letter to the
prime minister, saying he has "inadvertently contravened the
guidelines" by writing to the federal immigration board on behalf
of a constituent in an immigration case.
</P>
<P>
"I take full responsibility for this action and it is my duty
to resign from the government forthwith," Collenette said.
</P>
<P>
The resignation was accepted today by Chretien, who called the
resignation "a great loss to the government".
</P>
<P>
The former defense minister has been under pressure recently to
quit because of his relatively passive response to the Somalia
scandal, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged that military commanders may have tried to cover
up details of abuses committed by Canadian peace-keepers in
Somalia in 1992-93. Canadian soldiers killed several Somalis under
controversial circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Although Collenette, 50, insisted his resignation has nothing
to do with the Somalia scandal, the analysts said that the letter
to the board was simply a convenience out for the embattled
minister.

<HEADLINE> Canada Welcomes WTO Ruling on Japan Liquor Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
welcomed a ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Appellate
Body requesting that Japan change its liquor tax regime to remove
barriers to liquor imports.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased with this ruling," said Canadian Minister
for International Trade Art Eggleton.
</P>
<P>
"It will end a long-standing dispute and we expect that it will
lead to higher Canadian exports to the Japanese distilled liquor
market," he said, adding that Japan should carry out the ruling
quickly.
</P>
<P>
Currently, distilled liquor such as Canadian whiskey is taxed
at much higher rates than competing Japanese distilled spirits.
</P>
<P>
A WTO dispute settlement panel ruled in favor of Canada, the
United States and the European Union in July, and its ruling was
upheld today in a report by the WTO Appellate Body.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO rules, the Appellate Body report must be adopted
within 30 days of being circulated to WTO members.
</P>
<P>
Japan will then have 30 days to notify the WTO dispute
settlement body of its plans to implement the report's
recommendations.

<HEADLINE> Girls Do Better Than Boys in Canadian Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Girls outperform boys in Canadian
classrooms in reading, writing and even in traditionally "male"
subjects like mathematics.
</P>
<P>
Standard tests in Canada have shown that girls outpace boys in
reading and writing skills, from kindergarten through high school,
according to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
The first national writing test in 1994 found that 24 percent
of 16-year-old boys could not write at an acceptable level,
compared with only 13 percent of girls.
</P>
<P>
The first national math test, conducted in 1993, concluded that
"there is essentially no difference in performance between males
and females at age 13."
</P>
<P>
In Alberta Province, western Canada, girls now outnumber boys
in every senior academic subject except physics. Even in physics,
girls scored slightly higher marks than boys in the past school
year.
</P>
<P>
In recent standard tests across Canada, "there is no
significant differences between the performance of boys and girls
in math and science," the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Now, there is concern among educators about the literacy skills
of boys, the reports added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chile's Export of Forestry, Agriculture Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chilean government gives bonuses to the owners of small
tracts of forest land who cultivate a surface of 15 hectares.
Official sources said that some 170 million dollars had been paid
as bonuses and the government will pay another 200 million dollars
from 1996 to 2010.
</P>
<P>
The great variety of climates in the country, which runs
4,000-kilometer from north to south, permits Chile to cultivate a
large diversity of fruit. By 1995, it had 182,000 hectares
planted with fruit trees, compared with the 65,000 hectares in
1980.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Ariztia, president of the National Federation of Fruit
Producers Association, said that if climate conditions are
favorable, the volume of the 1996-1997 season export is expected
to go up 10 percent from the previous season which ended on August
31 of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the previous season, the export of Chilean fresh fruit, such
as table grapes, kiwis, apples, pears, produced 1.027 billion
dollars. Table grapes brought in 520 million dollars, and kiwis
more than 77 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The kiwi, native of China, was introduced in Chile from New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
But Chile still faces challenges in the agricultural sector,
such as the expansion of urban areas, which is encroaching on the
arable lands.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 alone, 50,000 hectares of rich soil were taken away
from agriculture by the expansion of metropolitan regions.
</P>
<P>
However, a trade agreement between Chile and the South American
Common Market (Mercosur) offers the country an opportunity to
gain a larger market share for its products.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry estimates that Chilean fruit export to
the Mercosur countries is expected to witness an annual increase
of 12 percent to 14 percent. Chile's fruit export to the Mercosur
countries is now at 185.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Correa, president of the National Agriculture Society,
said that the trade agreement with Mercosur will also have a
negative effect on the prices of some products and cause a shift
of funds, at some 460 million dollars a year, from agriculture to
other economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government has pledged to provide the agricultural
sector with an additional 500 million dollars during the next five
years to mitigate the damage possibly caused by a wider opening of
an economic sector which was traditionally tariff-protected.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM, French President Mend Fence at Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
and French President Jaques Chirac today reached a consensus on
the timetable for the launch of the single European currency at
summit talks in southern Italian city of Naples.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the single European currency must be launched
at the beginning of 1999 and the timetable should not be changed
unless there appear unexpected incidents.
</P>
<P>
The consensus will help iron out the differences between the
two countries triggered by Chirac's criticism earlier this week of
the unstable lira and his questioning whether Italy could qualify
as a founder of a single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Prodi discussed the lira's return to the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM), the single European currency due to
be launched in 1999, the reform of EU institutions and the
Schengen accord on closer cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Prodi insisted that Italy wanted the lira
to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The lira dropped out of the ERM in a European currency crisis
in 1992, and has devalued considerably since then.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference after the summit, Chirac said France
and Italy employed "practically identical approaches" on all
issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on bilateral relations, the
situation in Middle East and the former Yugoslavia and other
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
They called on the conflicting parties in the bloody clashes
between the Israelis and Palestinians to refrain themselves and to
continue the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that the meeting is of great significance to both
Italy and France and the cooperation between the two countries
could contribute not only to the economic development of Europe
but also to the world situation.

WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Ike Quartey of Ghana beat Oba
Carr of the United States to retain the WBA welterweight title in
New York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Quartey seemed to slip after he missed with a right hand in the
11th round but referee Arthur Mercante called it a knockdown. A
legitimate knockdown almost occurred in the seventh round when
Quartey landed a smashing hook to Carr's body and the challenger's
knee almost touched the floor.
</P>
<P>
Quartey was penalized a point in the fourth round for hitting
behind the head and Carr was penalized points in the eighth and
10th rounds for low blows.
</P>
<P>
At fight's end, Carr was bleeding from a cut beneath his right
eye and his left eye was almost closed from Quartey's punishing
left jab and solid rights and left hooks to the head.
</P>
<P>
Judge Gonzalo Rivera, however, scored the fight 112-112. Judge
Luis Rivera saw it 116-109 and Jose Laurino scored it 117-107,
both for Quartey.
</P>
<P>
Quartey, 147, is 33-0 with 28 knockouts. Carr, 147, lost for

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chile's Export of Forestry, Agricultural Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Chile, a South American country
rich in copper, had witnessed a big success in developing its
forestry, agricultural, and livestock resources for export in
recent years, taking advantage of its geographical and climate
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Studies and Policies of the Agriculture Ministry
said that Chilean forestry, agricultural and livestock exports
gained 2.35 billion U.S. dollars in the first six months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chile obtained 2.37 billion dollars from the export
of its forestry products, accounting for 14.8 percent of the
country's total export for the year. Forestry was its second
biggest hard currency earner, after copper.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Emiliano Ortega said, in 1970 the export
of forestry, agricultural, and livestock products produced only 70
million dollars, but in 1995 it brought home 4.47 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ortega said Chile now exports 40 percent of its forestry,
agricultural and livestock products, and by the year 2010, it will
export 66 percent of those products.
</P>
<P>
Chile has an area of 75.6 million hectares, most of which is
mountains and deserts, and only 5.1 million hectares -- less than
7 percent of the nation's territory -- is arable land. And only
1.2 million hectares can be irrigated.
</P>
<P>
But 34 million hectares or 45 percent of its territory is apt
for forestry development. Of which productive forests now cover 19
percent or some 6.4 million hectares.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of five former Soviet
republics today called on the warring parties in Afghanistan,
especially the Taleban, to immediately stop military actions and
seek ways of national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Nursultan Nazarbayev, Islam Karimov, Imomali Rakhmonov and
Askar Akayev, presidents of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and
Kyrgyzstan as well as Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin
issued the call at a summit here today on the current situation in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after the summit, they voiced their
concerns over the situation in Afghanistan and said they would
take steps to prevent fighting from spilling over the border.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan shares common borders with Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
The Taleban militia seized the Afghan capital Kabul last
week. Their advance towards CIS borders has worried Russia and
some other states, especially Tajikistan, which has a common
border of 1,500 kilometers with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the fighting was spreading towards the
borders of the CIS countries and has posed a direct threat to the
interests and security of those nations.
</P>
<P>
The CIS states warned that they will take appropriate measures
against any actions that would harm the stability and peace along
the border between Afghanistan and the CIS according to the
Collective Security Treaty .
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed by some of the former Soviet republics in
1992, considers those actions a threat to the common interests of
CIS members.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the five leaders urged other states not to
interfere in the internal affairs of war-battered Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
They also asked the United Nations Security Council to meet on
Afghanistan and seek measures for a political settlement of the
Afghan conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Menem Vows to Go Ahead with Labor Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem today reaffirmed that his government will go ahead with its
controversial labor reform programs, despite a warning of strike
from the trade unions.
</P>
<P>
"It is not easy to govern a country like ours, where there is
the need for profound transformations," Menem said.
</P>
<P>
Menem submitted to Congress a draft law on decentralizing
collective bargaining on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bill aims to reform the present collective bargaining law
between labor unions and entrepreneurial chambers and replace it
with direct negotiations between unions and individual employers.
</P>
<P>
The draft law is part of a package of labor reforms that
includes changes relating to salaries, working hours and the
system of compensation for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The unions are strongly opposed to the labor reforms and have
organized a series of strikes in protest against the government's
plans. The General Labor Confederation even threatened to call a
48-hour strike.
</P>
<P>
But the government says the new laws will help cut unemployment
which now stands at around 17 percent. They will provide
incentives for companies to hire workers.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Caro Figueroa said the nation needed to create
some 500,000 new jobs a year to solve its unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
He said the current system of collective bargaining, which had
existed for more than 20 years, was out-dated and unworkable
under the conditions of today's domestic and international labor
market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- China adopts the Lawyers Law to
set higher standards and stricter requirements for lawyers, whose
professional standards need further improvement, Saturday's China
Daily quoted a high judicial official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Lawyers Law is to take effect on January 1, 1997 along with
the Revision of the Criminal Procedure Law.
</P>
<P>
Applicants for lawyers' licences must pass professional ethics
and discipline courses and examinations, and all criminal defence
lawyers must complete special training by the end of this year,
according to the two new laws.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Geng, Vice-Minister of Justice, told a press conference
that the Ministry of Justice is also formulating some 40
regulations related to the Lawyers Law, covering professional
activities and management of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pledged severe punishment on lawyers who do not
adhere to professional ethics and discipline.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that there were 95,000 lawyers and more
than 7,500 law firms across the country as of June, almost 12
times and 4.7 times, respectively, of the corresponding figures in
1981.
</P>
<P>
Also, a record 127,000 people have applied to take the national
lawyers' qualification examination this year, some 10,000 more
than last year.

<P>
OTTAWA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- David Collenette, Canadian
Minister of National Defense and Veteran Affairs resigned today
over a letter he sent to the head of the federal immigration and
refuge board.
</P>
<P>
The letter asked the chief of the board if there was some way
to speed the process for one of Collenette's constituents, who was
sponsoring the immigration of her husband to Canada.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that I have inadvertently contravened your draft

Cabinet and quasi-judicial bodies)," Collenette said in his letter
to Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
"I take full responsibility for this action and it is my duty

</P>
<P>
Collenette's resignation has been accepted by Chretien, who

</P>
<P>
Chretien also expressed the hope that "one day in the not too

</P>
<P>
Collenette has been under pressure recently to quit as defense
minister because of the Somalia scandal.
</P>
<P>
There is immediate speculation here that the letter to the

Collenette's post has been taken up by Douglas Young, who was
formerly Minister for Human Resources Development.

<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The State will select several of
the 800-odd ministry-managed research institutes to spearhead
science and technology system reforms during the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000), reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Selected units are expected to work more closely with
enterprises and markets, form scientific and technological
companies, and set up businesses to independently develop and
distribute products, the newspaper quoted Xu Guanhua,
vice-minister of State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC),
as saying at a seminar in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The pilot programs will gradually be expanded to other research
institutions, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, held in response to the State Council's Decision
on Deepening Reforms of China's Science and Technology System
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, saw participation of 70
officials in charge of scientific and technological work in all
government ministries and departments.
</P>
<P>
The SSTC will formulate more specific measures to bring
scientific and technological research more in line with industrial
needs and to provide closer support for State-owned enterprises,
the daily quoted Zhu Lilan, the SSTC's vice-minister, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should redouble their efforts to
promote co-operation between enterprises, research institutions
and institutions of higher learning to raise the present low
levels of technological efficiency, Zhu urged.
</P>
<P>
He also added that major research institutions are encouraged
to establish engineering centers and to expedite the application
of technological products.

<HEADLINE> Japan Complains About Indonesia's National Car Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has
formally submitted a letter to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
in Geneva raising its objections to Indonesia's national car
policy.
</P>
<P>
Yashuhisa Kawamuradi, a consul at the Japanese embassy here,
said on Friday that Japan's move reflected its discontent over
Indonesia's responses to questions Japan had raised on its
national car policy at a number of previous meetings, Antara news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan had asked Indonesia for explanations on its
"Timor" car policy at a number of consultative meetings between
high-ranking officials and even ministers of the two countries.
But Indonesia's explanations were unsatisfactory, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto issued a decree in February authorizing a
national car with fiscal facilities in the form of exemptions from
import duties and luxury sales taxes. But after the third year of
production, the car must have a local content of at least 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
Pt. Timor then invited Kia Motors of South Korea to help
produce a national car brandnamed "Timor."
</P>
<P>
"We think the policy discriminates against other foreign car
makers. It is clearly against provisions of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)," the Japanese diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Pending the production start-up of its own factory in 1998, Pt.
Timor was allowed to import 2,800 cars from Kia Motors. The first
batch of the fully built-up Kia sedans has arrived in Indonesia
recently and their sale to the public began on October 1 at prices
much lower than cars from other makers.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which holds a 90-percent share of the Indonesian auto
market, has urged Indonesia to treat all foreign car makers in the
same manner and to grant tax breaks to all foreign car makers
including those from Japan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign pressure on Indonesia's car policy continued to mount
as the European Union and the United States joined Japan in a move
to bring the issue to a WTO meeting to be held in December in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
However, Indonesia said it will not change its car program
which aims to strengthen its industry structure.

<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- China can keep up with world
trends in developing new medicines and therapies to prevent and
treat once "incurable" respiratory diseases including lung cancer,
bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive lung diseases, Saturday's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The country's research into respiratory diseases is already in
par with the the level of some developed countries, the daily
quoted Luo Weici, president of the Chinese Society of Internal
Medicine, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Luo made the remarks in an interview with China Daily before
the opening of the fourth Congress of the Asian Pacific Society of
Respirology (APSR) in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,100 medical specialists from 18 countries in the
Asia-Pacific region are meeting at the three-day event to discuss
the latest researches into respiratory diseases.
</P>
<P>
Luo said the conference is held to promote medical information
exchanges between nations and to keep the Asia-Pacific region
abreast of scientific advances.
</P>
<P>
Bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive lung diseases are
among the topics to be discussed during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Others include allergies, tuberculosis and non-tuberculous
mycobacterial diseases, smoking-related lung disease, occupational
lung diseases and also AIDS-related pulmonary diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to Luo, chronic respiratory ailments remain the
number one killer of rural Chinese, and the third biggest killer
of urban Chinese, after cardio-vascular diseases and malignant
tumors.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the situation on smoking, deterioration of the
environment and the public's ignorance about those illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Ecological Improvement Efforts on Yangtze's Upper Reaches Pay Off (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
predicted that the deteriorating ecological environment in the
Yangtze River is expected to be brought under control in the
middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
It follows a massive billion-yuan drive to save the crucial
water artery, the third longest river in the world.
</P>
<P>
The scientists optimistic prediction was derived from the
massive efforts since the 1980s in planting trees and controlling
soil erosion on the middle and upper reaches of China's longest
river running from west to east.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey at Heguantun Township in southwest China's
Guizhou province showed that one-time barren hills have turned
into high-yield terraces, surrounded with trees and ditches.
</P>
<P>
Nie Shaohui, a 54-year-old local farmer, said that disasters,
such as the destruction of cultivated land and houses caused by a
heavy rain, have not occurred since the 1980s. And the land yields
more crops with the improvement of the ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
The over 6000-kilometer-long Yangtze is of great importance to
China's economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
However, the over felling of trees and the growing population
brought heavy soil erosion to the river basin, worsening the
ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Forestry (MF) and Ministry of Water
Resources (MWR) cooperated to implement a comprehensive plan to
protect the ecological environment of the Yangtze River in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The two ministries have invested more than one billion yuan
(about 124 million US dollars) in the plan since, and the
success in Heguantun is the epitome of the achievements the
country made over seven years in controlling the Yangtze
River.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to officials of MF and MWR, the plan, which will
continue into the next century, consists of two parts, an
afforestation project and a water and soil conservation project.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the afforestation project has so far
resulted in more than six million hectares of new forests, raising
the vegetation coverage rate in the basin of upper and middle
reaches of the Yangtze River from 28.2 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The water and soil conservation project has eased soil erosion
in areas of 40,000 square kilometers, through the building of
terraced fields, drainage ditches, and sand-retaining walls.
</P>
<P>
The survey department of MWR said that amount of sand in the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River has gradually gone down in
recent years, as reported by Yichang hydrometric station in
central China's Hubei province.
</P>
<P>
An official at MWR said that the government also brought in a
policy assuring farmers about the trees they plant, which has
greatly stimulated the building of forests.
</P>
<P>
The newly built orchard forests not only protect the ecological
environment, but also become a ready source of money for local
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Cunpu, a farmer who has built an apple orchard, said that
the fruit can earn more than 4,000 yuan this year, and the whole
village are now enthusiastic about planting trees.
</P>
<P>
The official added that in the past seven years farmers in the
basin of the upper and middle reaches have thrown in labour force
equaling four billion yuan (about 482 million US dollars) in the
control of the Yangtze River.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is ready to consult
with the European Union (EU) regarding the country's national car
policy, but does not intend to change its car program, a senior
Indonesian official said.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is ready to hold a consultation with the EU in
Geneva regarding the national car policy," Minister of Industry
and Trade Tungky Ariwibowo said last night after meeting with
President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The EU has sent a letter to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
asking Indonesia to hold a consultation on its national car
program through the WTO forum.
</P>
<P>
"We should not worry since the WTO is a forum which seeks
solutions to differences in international trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that until Friday, Japan and the United
States had not asked for similar consultations.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry plans to
take action over Indonesia's car policy, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government issued a presidential directive in
February ruling that producers of the national car would be
granted exemptions on import duties and luxury sales taxes, which
add about 60 percent to the price of other cars in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pt. Timor, controlled by Hutomo Mandala Putra, the youngest son
of President Soeharto, was chosen as the first national car
supplier and has been required to meet the 60 percent local
content of cars over three years.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which holds a 90-percent share of the Indonesian auto
market, has joined the United States and the EU in criticizing

<HEADLINE> UEFA Impose Fine on Ferencvaros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
GENEVE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian champions Ferencvaros
were fined 100,000 Swiss francs ($80,000) and warned that they
could be kicked out of European soccer by UEFA in Nyon,
Switzerland, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fine and threatened sanctions were imposed following
crowd trouble when Ferencvaros played Olympiakos of Greece in a
UEFA Cup, first round, second leg match in Budapest on September
10.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after a meeting of UEFA's control and
disciplinary committee warned Ferencvaros that their supporters
could be banned from their matches, or that the club would be
banned from European competition if there was a repeat of the
trouble.
</P>
<P>
Ferencvaros were knocked out of the preliminary round of the
European Cup this season by Gothenburg, before switching to the
UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
They beat Olympiakos 5-3 on aggregate after winning 3-1 at
home and drawing 2-2 away and now face Newcastle United of
England in the next round of that competition later this month.
</P>
<P>
Vitoria Guimaraes of Portugal also received a hefty
punishment from UEFA, fined 25,000 Swiss francs ($20,000) because
of the bad behaviour of their ball boys during their UEFA Cup
first round second leg match against Parma on September 24.
</P>
<P>
Guimaraes lost the first leg 2-1 but held on to a 2-0 lead
for 41 minutes to win the tie 3-2 on aggregate.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Dismisses Officials in Privatization Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian government has
decided to dismiss the entire leading team of the state property
privatization and management company due to its involvement in a
financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the company was accused of illegally shifting a lot
of proceeds from the privatization of state-owned properties into
the bank account of a lawyer named Tocsik Marta.
</P>
<P>
Investigation showed that the company had illegally shifted 800
million forints (about 5.2 million U.S. dollars) into Tocsik's
bank account, State Secretary Kiss Elemer of Hungarian Prime
Minister's office told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
All 11 members of the company's supervisory committee will also
be dismissed from their posts because of their failure to
supervise managing activities and Tocsik has been ordered to
return the shifted money, said Kiss.
</P>
<P>
The nation's media, calling the scandal the biggest in the
privatization process of eastern Europe, demanded that the
government discharge Privatization Minister Suchman Tamao from his
post and hold Prime Minister Horn Gyula and his cabinet
responsible for the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Oppositions, which alleged that the ruling Socialist Party was
preparing to use the 800 million forints as the funds for the 1998
general elections, called for further investigation into the
scandal.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Closes Enterprises with Heavy Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
province has closed over 9,000 small-sized enterprises which
caused pollution.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises were earmarked for closure after a
comprehensive check on the province's 15 kinds of heavy-polluting
enterprises, including tanneries which treat less than 30,000
cattlehides a year, paper mills and dye factories with annual
output, respectively, under 5,000 and 500 tons.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government demanded that administrative
departments for industry and commerce should revoke the licenses
of the enterprises on the close-down list, and financial
institutions should stop making loans to the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Local governments were asked to forcefully dismantle the
enterprises which were on the list but refused to close down, or
the governments would be held responsible for the delayed
close-down action.

<HEADLINE> Red Tide Kills 90 People in 13 Years in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Red tide has killed 90 people and
injured 1,517 in various parts of the Philippines in the past 13
years, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the worst year was 1992 when 22 people out
of 480 cases died of paralytic shellfish poisoning, and the second
most disastrous year was 1983 with 21 deaths and 278 being
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Red tide are blooms or population explosions of dinoflagellates
or tiny planktonic organisms, usually in coastal waters. The
organisms become so dense that the water turns discolored, taking
on a red, brown, green or yellow hue.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms of the disease are tingling around the lips and
face, sometimes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, weakness and
incoordination and in severe cases, paralysis of muscles and vocal
chords. Deaths usually come within 12 hours due to respiratory
failure.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: EU Leaders to Hold Special Summit in Dublin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUBLIN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state or government from
the 15 members of the European Union (EU) are due to hold a
special summit in Dublin Saturday in an effort to seek a fresh
impetus to the stalled Inter Governmental Conference (IGC).
</P>
<P>
The special EU summit, proposed by French President Jacques
Chriac during the EU Florence summit in June, has failed to win
whole-hearted support from the other EU countries as they fear
that the gathering without a clear-cut agenda will not produce any
positive results.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which is deadly opposed to further European
integration, has openly said that the summit is unnecessary and
Prime Minister John Major even proposed to postpone or cancel the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Political commentators say that Major, under increasing
pressure from the Tory Euroseptics, will not make any concessions
to its EU partners when his ruling Conservative Party is to hold
its last annual party conference only three days after the
informal summit.
</P>
<P>
The IGC conference, which was launched at the special EU summit
in Turin last March and will last for 15 months, is aimed to
review the Maastricht Treaty on the future of the EU.
</P>
<P>
But the conference has become bogged down and failed to make
any dramatic progress over the past seven months as some member
states hold quite different views on which direction the IGC will
be heading for.
</P>
<P>
Under the current circumstances, John Bruton, whose country is
currently the EU rotating president, said in a letter to his EU
partners that they should provide a "political impetus" to the
European integration process.
</P>
<P>
But Bruton stressed, "There will be no conclusions reached at
tomorrow's meeting. Rather we will be using it as a preparation
for the important work that is to be done at the formal European
Council which takes place in December this year."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is commonly
regarded as the flag-carrier of the European integration, said
during a visit to Ireland Thursday that the Dublin summit is aimed
at reaching understandings to get best results from the IGC and no
major decision will be made.
</P>
<P>
The German leader also admitted for the first time that the
European integration process may be postponed, casting a long
shadow over the coming informal summit.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that if the current IGC on reforming the
Maastricht treaty or "Maastricht 2" made little progress, there
would have to be a "Maastricht 3" conference at a later date.

<HEADLINE> Court Turns Down Perot's Appeal on Debate Exclusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A federal appeals court today
rejected Reform Party Presidential candidate Ross Perot's attempt
to sue his way into the debates with U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Republican challenger Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a district court order
dismissing the lawsuits of Perot and the Natural Law Party
presidential candidate, John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
Perot's lawyers had complained that the Commission on
Presidential Debates, which excluded him, used criteria that went
beyond Federal Election Commission regulations and that the FEC
delegated its power to the private group.
</P>
<P>
The debate commission, formed by five representatives each of
the Democratic and Republican parties, earlier ruled Perot and
Hagelin did not have a realistic chance of being elected and did
not invite them to the debates.
</P>
<P>
"We'll take this to the American people and on the election day
they'll have the opportunity to rectify it," said Russ Verney,
Perot's campaign coordinator. "We'll step up public appearances
and long-format television appearances to talk about this travesty
of justice."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Federal Communications Commission, in a decision
announced earlier today, rejected Perot's attempt to force the
major TV networks to sell his campaign more commercial air time.
</P>
<P>
Perot complained he had not been able to buy desirable
broadcast times for his 30-minute commercials.
</P>
<P>
The networks have followed proper standards, the communications
regulators said, taking into account the potential for requests
from other candidates and the amount of time already offered to
Perot.
</P>
<P>
Pat Choate, Perot's running mate, said the campaign would
consider an appeal to the FCC for a review, or a court fight.
</P>
<P>
Before the appeals court, Perot contended that the FEC
unlawfully delegated its legislative authority to a private
non-profit corporation, in violation of the free speech clause in
the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Traders Continue Strike Against VAT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Shops and markets remained
closed in Uganda's capital Kampala today as traders' strike
against the value added tax (vat) entered into the fifth day.
</P>
<P>
The strikers, who want the vat to be reduced to 10 percent
from the original 17 percent announced by the government, refused
to bow to government's threat that they might lose their business
licenses.
</P>
<P>
"If the traders' strike is not called off, the government may
be compelled to cancel their trading licenses and give them to
those interested in development," said Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni earlier on Thursday, adding that the strike has crippled
the country's civil services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet refused to scrap or suspend vat as
demanded by the striking traders, according to reliable official
sources who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
They said that instead of bowing to traders' demands to scrap
the tax, the government has resolved to embark on a major shake
up in the Department of the Uganda's Revenue Authority which is
responsible for tax collection.

<HEADLINE> Lilic: Conditions Ripe for Normalization With World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
said today that the lifting of the anti-Yugoslav sanctions had
paved the way for normalization of relations with the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions' removal has opened prospects for the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia's economic and spiritual development, whose
results will depend on the people themselves," Lilic told local
reporters in Novi Sad, a city in northern Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
After the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia in 1992,
Serbia and Montenegro formed the rump Yugoslavia in April 1992,
but it has failed to join the United Nations and many important
international financial institutions, partly because of the
comprehensive sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav president said that economic recovery, which began
after the suspension of the U.N. sanctions in late 1995, was now
getting a chance to be even swifter and more successful.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council lifted Tuesday sanctions against
Yugoslavia, imposed 52 months earlier on Yugoslavia's alleged
involvement in the civil war in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Only an economically strong Yugoslavia can command respect in
every way, and its economic strength will favorably affect the
development of culture and all other spheres of social life, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA to Hold Talks Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) are to begin a crucial round of talks Sunday,
reports reaching here from Tel Aviv today said.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's talks, the gaps will be large, as the Palestinians
insist on a quick Israeli redeployment from the West Bank town of
Hebron as agreed to under a deal signed with the previous Israeli
government. Netanyahu insists on making changes to the accord.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops were supposed to have handed most of Hebron to the
Palestinian Authority by March 28, which was delayed due to a
series of suicide bombings inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the only major city yet to be handed over the the
Palestinians. 450 Jewish settlers live among 200,000 Arabs in
Hebron, a hot-bed for Palestinian-Israeli conflicts.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Labor Conference Gives Its Leader Boost in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Party's
annual conference ended its five-day gathering here today, which
gave Tony Blair, the party leader, a further boost in credibility.
</P>
<P>
It was a good week for the party. Tony Blair carried his party
with him and gained fruitful results in his efforts to persuade
British voters that the Labor Party can be trusted.
</P>
<P>
The leader won overwhelming support from delegates for his
manifesto during the week by clearing every hurdle on the way to
success.
</P>
<P>
Before the party conference, there was a fear among party
officials that heated argument and even conflicts on certain
motions would be inevitable. However, none of it happened.
</P>
<P>
Party officials were especially delighted when a vote to scrap
the Trident Missile System was narrowly defeated. It was the first
time that a majority of delegates had backed the leadership on the
system.
</P>
<P>
To many political observers' surprise, a demand to cut defense
spending, which used to be a main motion of the Labor conference,
did not even set on this year's conference's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair even avoided a defeat on pension debate, despite an
emotional speech by Barbra Castle, an veteran former Social
Services Secretary at the conference, by 66 to 34 percent votes.
</P>
<P>
In his key-note speech at the conference, the Labor leader
promised voters a new age of achievement. "Ask me my three main
priorities for government. I tell you, education, education and
education," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
What the Labor leader promised are regarded as realistic. More
money will be spent on education and help for the unemployed.
There will be summer camps for slow learners. Cancer patients will
no longer have to wait ages for their operations....
</P>
<P>
But best of all in his blue-print speech is that taxes for many
might come down, with the rate starting at 15 percent or even 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
A party official told this reporter, "The desire of unity which
all the delegates show at the conference is the key to the success
of the conference, and it will lead to win the election next
spring as well."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Labor leader's performances during the
conference, The Times wrote in an article, "The voters of Britain
are looking for a vision of the future that John Major does not
readily provide. Many will have watched Tony Blair's speech on
television and marveled at a man who spins words like spells and
makes the future seem as though it is happening now."
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, another British national newspaper, said, "Tony
Blair is preparing for office."

<HEADLINE> UK Financial Services Firms More Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Business optimism among financial
services firms in Britain has risen sharply for the third quarter
running, according to a survey out today by the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) and the accountancy firm Coopers and
Lybrand.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the subdued conditions in manufacturing,
confidence rose among suppliers of financial services such as life
insurers, finance houses and building societies, but fell among
security traders, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said that higher spending on financial services by
individuals, rather than by companies, was the biggest reason for
the growth in demand.
</P>
<P>
Of the 292 companies interviewed, including banks, building
societies, insurance companies and fund managers, those reporting
a rise in confidence exceeded those reporting a decrease by a
balance of 46, compared with 50 in the second quarter and a
balance of minus 11 in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 25 percent more companies think they are gaining
ground in Europe rather than losing it. A positive balance of 7
percent takes the view that competitiveness is improving outside
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Activity is expected to grow rapidly in the fourth quarter in
all industry sectors except venture capitalists and securities
traders.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Police Arrest Two Albanian Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian police arrested two
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia, on
charges of terrorist actions, the Serbian Interior Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that the arrested are Besim
Sokolja Rama from the village of Gornja Prekaze and Avni Smailja
Nur from the village of Prelovac. They are members of the
terrorist group that was responsible for several terrorist attacks
on the police and citizens in the last three years in which four
people were killed and seven wounded.
</P>
<P>
Four people, one civilian and three policemen, were killed in
the attacks and seven policement were wounded, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
While hunting the two men, the police also found large
quantities of arms, munitions and explosive devices at their
hideouts.
</P>
<P>
Besim Rama and Avni Nur have been handed over to the
investigative judge, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A strong separatist movement has been active for decades in
Kosovo where 90 percent of the 2 million population are Albanians.
The separatists proclaimed a so-called Republic of Kosovo and
their objective is to separate the province from Serbia and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to join the neighboring Albania.

<HEADLINE> EU Ambassadors Cancel Ceremony on Mostar Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The flying of a national flag
of the Bosnian Croats over a newly-built bridge near Mostar today
prompted a group of EU ambassadors to boycott the opening
ceremony, the Bosnian TV reported.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was consequently canceled over the bridge which
was constructed with funds from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Mostar has been divided into Muslims- and Croats-controlled areas
and due to sensitivity of the issue, both sides had been told not to
hoist flags over the Aviator's Bridge which re-links the two parts of
the southern Bosnian city.
</P>
<P>
But just two minutes before the arrival of the EU diplomats who
were based in Sarajevo, the Bosnian Croatian flag, which resembles
that of neighboring Croatia, was spotted fluttering on the
Croats-controlled part of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
Sir Martin Garrod, EU envoy to Mostar, later told a press
conference that "some fool" put the flag with the intention to
scuttle the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"That fool knew that his action was against the interests of
the Croats.... It's not a Croatian bridge, it's a bridge for the
citizens of Mostar," Garrod said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that such incident has happened in
Mostar. Early this year, a German minister also left the ceremony
for a reconstructed railway bridge to protest the flying of a
Bosnian Croatian flag over it.

<HEADLINE> LSE Confirms Order-Driven Trading Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A new computerized system for
trading the Financial Times-Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 leading
British shares will not be introduced for at least another year,
the London Stock Exchange (LSE) said today.
</P>
<P>
The LSE has decided to give member firms the time they wanted
to prepare for the introduction of the new system. Member firms
had pressed for a minimum of nine months, and possibly as much as
a year, to get the system up and running.
</P>
<P>
The new "order-driven" system will be a radical departure from
the present trading methods, introduced exactly 10 years ago,
under which market makers offer competing quotations.
</P>
<P>
The new system will execute trades automatically once they have
been input to the computer system.
</P>
<P>
Initial rules for the new computerized dealing method were
published today by the exchange's chief executive Gavin Casey, who
said, "It is part of a continuing evolution in the London market
following extensive consultation over nine months."
</P>
<P>
In the new system, any firm with enough capital to satisfy the
regulator will be allowed tax relief on borrowed stock, which will
allow them to speculate by taking short positions.
