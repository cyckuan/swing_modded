Peru agrees to military free zone on border with Ecuador
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add President's quotes in 2nd and 3rd grafs,
destination of Fujimori in 8th graf. No pick up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Peru agreed to establish a demilitarized
zone on its border with Ecuador Thursday to ease tensions, Brazil's
president Fernando Cardoso said.
	   ``This is the only way to restart negotiations aimed at
establishing peace,'' Cardoso said after nearly five hours of
emergency talks with his Peruvian counterpart Alberto Fujimori.
	   Fujimori said the zone would ``avoid armed incidents and allow
talks to progress''.
	   The removal of troops was proposed by a peace-keeping group of
countries comprising Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the United
States.
	   Cardoso said that he and Fujimori consulted representatives from
these countries by telephone during the meeting.
	   He stressed that the border area would not be completely
demilitarized, but rival troops would be separated and observed by
neutral peacekeepers.
	   Tensions between both countries, who have been trying to
negotiate ownership of the disputed border since 1995, flared up
over the past few days after army units began concentrating.
	   After his meeting with Cardoso, Fujimori late Thursday flew to
Argentina to meet with President Carlos Menem.

Earthquake rattles nerves near volcano looming over Mexico City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A small earthquake shook the ground near the
towering Popocatepetl volcano on Thursday, but experts said there
was no sign it affected the smoking mountain 30 miles (50
kilometers) southeast of Mexico City.
	   The quake, measured at magnitude 3.7, occurred about 18 miles
(30 kilometers) southwest of the volcano at 2:47 p.m. local time,
according to the National Center for Disaster Prevention, which
monitors the volcano.
	   A second very small quake of magnitude 1.8 occurred two minutes
later just under the 18,000-foot (5,500-meter) volcano's summit.
	   But the disaster center said only small emissions of gas and
steam were seen flowing from the volcano's crater.
	   About 300,000 people live on the mountain's slope and another 15
million live within 50 miles (80 kilometers) of it. The volcano has
been active since 1994, regularly emitting gas and steam,
occasionally ash and rocks.

Protest against re-election proposal in Panama
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Several hundred protesters formed a
human chain along one of Panama City's main boulevards Thursday to
protest a proposal to allow President Ernesto Perez Balladares to
run for re-election.
	   Wearing yellow T-shirts with the slogan ``We independents are
the majority ... Vote No,'' the protesters, organized by the
Independent Movement, stood with arms linked for more than an hour.
	   The protest comes about two weeks before a planned Aug. 30
referendum on a proposed constitutional amendment that would strike
down a prohibition on re-election, allowing Perez Balladares to
seek a second five-year term.
	   Recent polls indicate that opposition to the proposal exceeds
support for it.
	   Panama's economy is in transition from heavy state control and
dependence on U.S. military bases to a free-market model, and that
has caused some pain for the more vulnerable segments of the
population. The U.S. bases revert to Panama by the end of next
year.

Philippines posts first trade surplus since 1988
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines posted its first
trade surplus in nearly a decade in June as slowing economic growth
and a weaker peso dragged down imports.
	   June's dlrs 130 million trade surplus was a dramatic turnaround
from the dlrs 903 million deficit registered a year earlier.
	   For the first six months of the year, the trade deficit narrowed
to dlrs 1.4 billion from dlrs 5.6 billion in the year-earlier
period, according to figures released Friday by the government.
	   Exports for the six-month period rose 18.8 percent to dlrs 13.90
billion while imports increased 11.3 percent to dlrs 15.37 billion.
	   The Philippines last turned a trade surplus in December 1988.
The surplus then was dlrs 80 million.
	   For June alone, exports rose 12.3 percent to dlrs 2.39 billion
while imports dove 25.3 percent to dlrs 2.26 billion.
	   In a sign of slowing economic growth, imports of industrial
machines and equipment fell 37.8 percent to dlrs 146.95 million.
	   Economists expect the trade deficit will narrow further as
imports continue to contract because of the slowdown in economic
activity, caused by the regional financial crisis and a drought
attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon.
	   The Philippines' trade deficit has been narrowing since last
October. The weak peso, which has fallen by about 40 percent
against the dollar in the past year, has caused the cost of many
imported goods to rise.

Police suspect poisoning after three sickened from eating cake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Three sisters suffered mild numbness and trembling
Friday after eating cakes bought from a pastry shop, and police
suspect the sweets may have been poisoned.
	   Police are conducting tests on the cakes for toxic substances,
said police spokesman Takao Niikura.
	   The sisters _ Michiko, Wakako and Natsue Nishimoto _ were taken
to a hospital in Kyoto, 374 kilometers (234 miles) southwest of
Tokyo shortly after midnight Friday. They showed no serious
symptoms and were soon released.
	   The cakes had been bought by a friend to celebrate Natsue's
birthday. The sisters told police the cakes had tasted ``bitter''
and ``strange.''
	   Japan has been unsettled by a series of poison-related incidents
in recent weeks. In late July, four people died from eating curry
laced with cyanide and arsenic at a festival in southwestern Japan.
	   Two weeks later, 10 company employees in northern Japan suffered
vomiting and numbness after drinking tea containing a toxic sodium
compound.
	   This week, a man was arrested in northern Japan for allegedly
trying to blackmail a confectionary shop by threatening to lace its
cakes with salmonella.
	   The incidents have sparked fears of copycat incidents in coming
weeks.

Paul McCartney's intrusion of privacy complaint upheld
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's Press Complaints Commission has ruled
that photographs taken for a celebrity magazine of Paul McCartney
and his family inside Notre Dame cathedral in Paris were an
invasion of privacy and an intrusion into their grief.
	   McCartney had filed a complaint against Hello! magazine, which
on May 30 published photographs taken of him and his family around
Paris a month after his wife, Linda, had died of breast cancer.
	   Since her death April 17, McCartney has repeatedly pleaded with
the press to let him grieve in private.
	   One photograph showed the family inside Notre Dame cathedral,
and the magazine described how they ``lit a candle for Linda and
took some time to meditate in peace.''
	   According to a statement released Thursday by the former Beatle,
McCartney said he had been unaware that he and his family had been
``stalked'' by photographers, who had taken ``highly intrusive
photographs of us in our most private moments at this very
difficult time in our lives.''
	   The magazine responded that the photographs had been obtained
from news agencies and wrote to McCartney to apologize for any
distress caused, saying: ``We were touched to see your wonderfully
close relationship _ which is, I am certain, what readers also felt
when they saw them.''
	   The complaints commission, an independent industry
self-regulatory body that rules on complaints against the press by
the public or competing publications, said it did not believe the
public interest was served by showing how ``wonderfully close'' his
relationship was with his children.
	   In particular, it deplored publication of the photograph of them
inside the cathedral and upheld the complaints relating to privacy
and intrusion into grief. Such rulings do not carry financial
penalties against the offending media.
	   A spokesman for the McCartney family, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, said the ruling ``is not only a victory for
decent human values, it is also a milestone adjudication in defense
of anyone who finds themselves hounded merely because of
questionable news values.''

Report: Japan selling more autos in Latin America, Middle East
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES newspaper report as sourcing for fact in 5th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Facing weak demand in key Asian and Western
markets, Japan's automakers are boosting exports to Latin America
and the Middle East, an industry group said Friday.
	   Automakers shipped 256,000 cars to Central and South America in
the first six months of 1998, up 30 percent from the same period
last year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
	   That's the most cars Japan has ever exported to the region, the
association said.
	   Exports to the Middle East were also robust, reaching a
five-year high. Japanese automakers shipped 180,000 cars to the
region for an increase of 20.5 percent, it said.
	   Most of the gains came in sales of smaller models. Exports to
Latin America of Honda Motor Corp.'s small-sized Civic surged 70
percent in the first six months, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said
Friday.
	   The gains come as a severe economic crisis has slashed demand by
more than half _ from 315,000 cars exported to 141,000 _ in Asia,
the region Japanese automakers had seen as their key growth market,
the association said.
	   Exports to the United States and Europe have also stalled as
Japanese automakers produce more cars locally to avoid trade
friction, it said. Domestic sales have been hurt by a long economic
slump.

Indonesian police arrest 16 people for allegedly inciting riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Police have arrested 16 people
suspected of instigating riots in Jakarta in which 1,200 people
were killed, police said Friday.
	   Thousands of shops and homes, many of them owned by ethnic
Chinese, were looted or burned in the May riots, which helped
dislodge former President Suharto's hold on power.
	   The unrest appeared to be a spontaneous outburst of anger over
price increases fueled by Indonesia's economic crisis. But
witnesses said that in some areas of the city, groups of men were
seen urging mobs to attack buildings.
	   Sixteen men have been arrested for allegedly inciting riots and
authorities are looking for another 20 suspects, said Lt. Col.
Edward Aritonang, a police spokesman in the capital. He did not
identify the suspects.
	   Two of the detainees have been accused of setting fire to a
police precinct, Aritonang said.
	   A government panel is investigating whether elements in the
armed forces were involved.
	   About 2,000 people were arrested during the riots, 336 of whom
have been charged with looting and other crimes.
	   The military has stepped up security in Jakarta amid rumors that
riots will erupt on Aug. 17, Indonesia's independence day.

Three Americans arrested in Cozumel for weapons possession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) _ Police on the Caribbean island of Cozumel
arrested three U.S. citizens Thursday after assault rifles were
found aboard the trio's yacht, the Rupture.
	   The arrests came during a campaign of increased weapons searches
of foreign ships and airplanes, the Attorney General's Office in
Quintana Roo state reported.
	   Police reported finding three military-style rifles and two
other large-caliber rifles in concealed compartments aboard the
45-foot (14-meter) Rupture, which was anchored at Cozumel, about 45
miles (70 kilometers) south of Cancun.
	   No hometowns were available for the three Americans arrested:
captain Scott Douglas, crew member Noah Bayley and Eugene McCluny.
	   The trio said they had left Miami and were headed for Panama
when they were arrested. They reportedly sought assistance from
U.S. consular authorities in Cancun. The Americans said the boat
was used to transport tourists.
	   Importation of firearms without a permit is illegal and
punishable by jail terms in Mexico, where civilians are prohibited
from possessing most firearms larger than .22 caliber.
	   The Mexican Senate has approved a bill to eliminate jail terms
and impose only fines under the proposed law for first offenses by
tourists who bring a single, small-caliber weapon into the country.
The law must still be approved by the lower house.

China's floods spread, leaving thousands stranded along rail lines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Rescue workers began evacuating more than 20,000
people who were stranded after floods washed out railway tracks in
northeastern Heilongjiang province, state-run media reported
Friday.
	   Floods also forced the closure of the main rail line in
northwestern China, between the Xinjiang capital, Urumqi, and the
city of Lanzhou, the reports said.
	   With a rain belt stretching across central China, floods were
predicted to continue and to worsen in the northeast and along the
Yellow River, which was expected to become dangerously swollen in
the next few weeks, the official newspaper China Daily reported.
	   Meanwhile, residents and soldiers worked feverishly to shore up
levees along the turbulent Yangtze, bracing for yet another flood
crest forecast to sweep downriver within the next few days.
	   Experts warned that as flood waters receded, dikes might weaken
further.
	   In the northeast, the industrial city of Harbin declared a state
of ``high alert'' and set a 24-hour curfew along the levees
protecting it from the rising Songhua River, which was likely to
surge with two major flood crests within the next 10 days, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   More than 20,000 people had been stranded for six days along the
Harbin-Manzhouli railway line, northwest of Harbin. Evacuation
began Thursday after the line was reopened.
	   State-run television showed rails that had been cobbled together
with boards and wire after embankments and bridges were washed
away. Vast areas surrounding the line remained inundated.
	   To the west, along the Nen river in Inner Mongolia, 113,600
people remained stranded by floods that began August 8 and had left
414,000 people homeless, Xinhua reported.
	   In neighboring Liaoning province, rescue workers were struggling
to unearth villages buried by a landslide Tuesday that killed nine
people and left five others missing following a violent
thunderstorm, Xinhua News Agency reported late Thursday.
	   It said another landslide on the same day, in southwestern
Sichuan province, had killed six farmers and seriously injured two
others, destroying 17 houses.
	   The floods have caused outbreaks of disease, with more than 600
people suffering dysentery, typhoid, cholera, skin rashes and eye
diseases, Xinhua said.

Eighteen foreigners arrested in Myanmar to be tried
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new grafs 5,6 with 18 not knowing trial was Friday and
quote from diplomat, and new graf 14 with trial open to public

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Eighteen foreigners arrested last week
for handing out pro-democracy leaflets in Yangon were to go on
trial Friday, the government said.
	   The trial for the 18, from six Asian and Western nations, was to
begin at 10 a.m. (0300 GMT) at a court in Insein, a northern suburb
of Yangon that is home to a prison where political detainees are
usually kept. Yangon is Myanmar's capital.
	   Those arrested include six Americans, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Filipinos and an Australian.
	   The government has not said what charges they will face. But
most political detainees are charged under section 5j of theday said
they had been unaware they would be tried on Friday. The diplomatic
community also was not informed until Friday morning, he said.
	   ``We didn't know. I hope they will be treated leniently,'' said
Kent Wiedemann, charge d'affairs of the U.S. embassy in Yangon, as
he entered the courtroom.
	   The foreigners were detained Sunday, the day after the 10th
anniversary of a nationwide democracy uprising that was brutally
crushed by the military, for handing out small cards to Myanmar
citizens telling them the outside world supported their struggle
for democracy.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. More than 3,000 demonstrators were
gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   The 18 foreign activists have been kept at a military guest
house in the capital. Diplomats who have visited them have
described them as cheerful, well-fed and treated humanely.
	   The military government issued a statement this week, however,
saying their release had been delayed because they were being
uncooperative.
	   The military is attempting to find a way to discourage foreign
activists from entering Myanmar and inciting the population to
revolt, while at the same time avoiding repercussions from the
governments of countries from which the activists come.
	   Earlier this year, the military government sentenced a British
national, James Mawdsley, to five years in prison for also handing
out pro-democracy leaflets in Yangon. He was released after three
months.
	   Mawdsley had been detained in 1997 for a similar action, but was
deported with just a warning from the government not to return.
	   His trial was the first open to some members of the public in
decades. Friday's trial of the 18 foreigners was also open to some
members of the public such as diplomats and journalists.
	   Myanmar citizens put on trial rarely ever receive an attorney to
defend them, democracy activists and human rights groups have said.
Trials usually consist of reading out the charges and sentencing
the accused, they say. Most trials take less than an hour, as the
sentence has already been decided by officials higher up in the
government, the activists and groups say.
	   The foreigners are unlikely, however, to receive the same
treatment. Mawdsley was represented by a Myanmar lawyer at his
trial.
	   Insein prison, which sits just beyond the court, is where
hundreds of political prisoners are kept along with violent
criminals.
	   Political prisoners are frequently subjected to torture and kept
in solitary confinement or cells meant for military dogs, human
rights groups and former prisoners say.
	   In 1995, the International Red Cross pulled out of Myanmar in
protest after it was not allowed access to political prisoners.

	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ Carlos Hermosillo scored two
second-half goals as the Los Angeles Galaxy broke the Major League
Soccer single-season scoring record in a 3-0 victory over Kansas
City Thursday night.
	   Los Angeles (19-6), the first team to clinch a playoff spot, has
71 goals with seven games left, topping D.C. United's record of 70
set last year.
	   Hermosillo, scoreless in 10 previous games, scored his first
goal in the 76th minute and made it 3-0 two minutes later. The two
goals in two minutes equaled an MLS record held by three other
players.
	   Cobi Jones opened the scoring in the 32nd minute. The U.S.
national team star has 13 goals in 17 games.
	   Kevin Hartman made one save for his fourth shutout of the season
before a announced crowd of 10,291 at the Rose Bowl. Mike Ammann
made two saves for Kansas City (10-13).

Thailand unveils package to rescue financial system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to note purge of former management, ADDS other
details

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank Friday said it
is taking over seven debt-ridden financial institutions and purging
their top executives as part of a comprehensive package to rescue
the country's tottering financial system.
	   An effective plan is considered essential for reviving the
recession-bound economy. Thailand's financial sector all but
collapsed last year after a slowdown in the economy exposed
insolvency in companies in many sectors of business.
	   A bank statement said a new board of directors and management
would be appointed to head the two banks and five finance companies
that were nationalized.
	   ``The current boards, if found in any misconduct, shall face
legal procedures,'' the statement said.
	   Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Kitti Patpongpibul said
non-performing loans will be written off existing shareholder
equity. The institutions' 10 baht (25 U.S. cents) shares will be
written down to .01 baht a share.
	   The central bank's rescue fund, the Financial Institutions
Development Fund, will then take over the seven institutions with
swaps of debt for new shares. In some cases cash will also have to
be injected, and at a later stage the institutions will be merged
with others or possibly offered for sale.
	   The remainder of the government's salvage program is to be
announced later Friday.
	   On the eve of the announcement, the central bank said it has
prepared a large amount of cash in case of a run by nervous
depositors, but there were no initial signs of panic after the
announcement.
	   Local television stations reported Thursday that small
depositors had rushed to withdraw their money from some of the four
commercial banks taken over by the central bank earlier this year.
But the reports said major clients of those banks did not join the
move.
	   Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul said the
financial institutions nationalized, including the Laem Thong Bank
and the Union Bank of Bangkok, will continue to operate as normal.
	   Laem Thong Bank is to be merged with Radhanasin Bank, which will
look for ``foreign strategic partners,'' he said. The Union Bank of
Bangkok will be merged with Krungthai Thanakit, a state-owned
finance company.
	   The finance companies taken over are Dhana Siam Finance and
Securities, First City Investments, IFCT Finance and Securities,
Vajiradhanathun Finance Co. Ltd., and Thai Summit Finance and
Securities Ltd.
	   The majority of Thailand's 15 commercial banks have failed to
raise adequate new capital from the private sector after becoming
laden with bad debt. Four were nationalized earlier this year.
	   Chatu Mongkol said the nine banks which have not yet seen
intervention have been able to maintain adequate safeguards on
loans. He said the total package will include options for remaining
financial institutions to raise fresh capital.
	   Domestic political pressure is rising on the government, with
unemployment expected to hit almost 3 million this year, up from 1
million last year.
	   Opposition politicians have accused the government of committing
billions to prop up financial institutions owned by rich families,
while the poor suffer from factory closures and rising food prices.
	   A delegation from the International Monetary Fund was recently
in Bangkok negotiating terms of the latest quarterly installment of
a dlrs 17.2 billion fund to help rescue Thailand's economy.

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The parents of a British tourist
missing in Australia are flying to Brisbane to join the search,
police said Friday.
	   Celina Bridge, 28, a hiker and environmentalist, was last seen
leaving Crystal Waters on Queensland state's Sunshine Coast on July
12.
	   She had been expected at a birdwatchers' meeting at nearby
Kenilworth the following weekend but did not arrive. Police fear
she has had an accident while hiking in a forest.
	   The alarm was raised by Bridge's fiance Jonathan Webb, who
arrived in Australia last Sunday and was supposed to have been met
by her.
	   Police spokesman Mick Spinks told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
Radio Friday that police had conducted an intensive search of
backpacker lodges, hostels and camping grounds throughout the
Sunshine Coast.
	   ``Unfortunately, there has been no sighting of Celina,'' Spinks
said. ``A month has gone by now and obviously concerns are running
high for her safety.''
	   Police hope that Bridge's distinctive hat, which has a leather
chin strap with a shark's tooth attached, will be recognized by a
member of the public and help police in their investigations.
	   There is no suggestion at this stage Bridge had met with foul
play, Spinks said.
	   Bridge had been backpacking alone around Australia since leaving
Britain on May 6 to study birds and ecosystems.

Philippine town commemorates slain U.S. Peace Corps volunteer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ILOILO, Philippines (AP) _ Residents of a central Philippine
town lit candles and offered prayers Friday for a U.S. Peace Corps
volunteer who was among 10 people slain by a gang of robbers.
	   Vice Mayor John Arcosa called the death of Robert Bock, 33, of
New York, a ``senseless killing.''
	   Bock was murdered Wednesday night when five men, apparently
drunk or high on drugs, fired assault rifles and pistols at the
occupants of four passing vehicles, including Bock's van, and then
stole the victims' belongings, police said.
	   Arcosa said officials in the town of Concepcion, where Bock
lived, asked U.S. Embassy officers who came to retrieve his body to
allow an overnight wake for Bock but were turned down. Instead,
residents burned candles at their doors in a sign of mourning, he
said.
	   ``He will sorely be missed,'' Arcosa said. ``He was very much a
part of Concepcion. He was well-loved by the people.''
	   Bock was helping the Iloilo provincial government in fisheries
management and the conservation of coral reefs. He was assigned to
Iloilo last year and was one of four American Peace Corps
volunteers working there, the U.S. Peace Corps office in Manila
said.
	   Bock had also accepted an additional assignment to assist
Concepcion residents _ the management of the town's fledgling swine
production program, Arcosa said.
	   Among the items recovered from Bock's van was a blood-stained
pamphlet on pig raising, he said.
	   Police said a suspect who was picked up for questioning Thursday
was arrested after tests showed traces of nitrates on him,
indicating he had recently fired a gun.
	   Regional police Director Ricardo de Leon said murder charges are
being prepared for the suspect.
	   De Leon said 10 police teams have been formed to search for the
remaining suspects.
	   The U.S. Embassy strongly condemned the attack. It said there
was no indication Bock or the United States was specifically
targeted.
	   The Peace Corps returned to the Philippines in 1992 after an
18-month absence following the kidnapping of a volunteer. Bock was
one of 108 volunteers in the country, many working in development
and environmental projects.
	   Iloilo is about 460 kilometers (285 miles) south of Manila.
	   Despite on-and-off government crackdowns, crimes like robberies
and kidnappings remain rampant in the country.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Eighteen foreigners arrested last week
for handing out pro-democracy leaflets in the Myanmar capital of
Yangon were put on trial Friday.
	   The trial for the 18, from six Asian and Western nations, was
being held at a court just outside the walls of Insein Prison where
political detainees are usually kept. It began in the late morning
after an unexplained delay. Insein is a northern suburb of Yangon.
	   Those arrested include six Americans, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Filipinos and an Australian.
	   They were charged under section 5j of the 1950 Emergency
Provision Act, a sweeping law that allows authorities to hand out
maximum 20-year jail sentences for attempting to incite unrest or
disrupt the peace and stability of the state.
	   A diplomat who visited the American activists on Thursday said
they had been unaware they would be tried on Friday. The diplomatic
community also was not informed until Friday morning, he said.
	   ``We didn't know. I hope they will be treated leniently,'' said
Kent Wiedemann, charge d'affairs of the U.S. embassy in Yangon, as

China's floods spread, leaving thousands stranded along rail lines

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with dike protecting major oilfield giving way grafs
1-2, flood in Xinjiang kills 4, graf 4

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A major levee protecting Daqing, China's largest
oil field, gave way Friday as floods spread into northeastern
Heilongjiang province, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Local residents were safely evacuated and no casualties were
reported from the breach in the dike, which had expanded to 500
meters (800 feet) by midday, Xinhua said.
	   Rescue workers also were evacuating more than 20,000 people who
had been stranded after floods washed out railway tracks in
northeastern Heilongjiang province, state-run media reported.
	   A flash flood near Aksu, in northwestern Xinjiang province,
killed four people and left dozens missing Thursday, inundating an
area inhabited by some 100,000 people, the official newspaper
Workers Daily reported.
	   Floods and landslides also forced the closure of a the main rail
line in northwestern China, between the Xinjiang capital, Urumqi,
and the city of Lanzhou, the reports said.
	   With a rain belt stretching across central China, floods were
predicted to continue and to worsen in the northeast and along the
Yellow River, which was expected to become dangerously swollen in
the next few weeks, the official newspaper China Daily reported.
	   Meanwhile, residents and soldiers worked feverishly to shore up
levees along the turbulent Yangtze, bracing for yet another flood
crest forecast to sweep downriver within the next few days.
	   Experts warned that as flood waters receeded, dikes might weaken
further.
	   In the northeast, the industrial city of Harbin declared a state
of ``high alert'' and set a 24-hour curfew along the levees
protecting it from the rising Songhua River, which was likely to
surge with two major flood crests within the next 10 days, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reproted.
	   More than 20,000 people had been stranded for six days along the
Harbin-Manzhouli railway line, northwest of Harbin. Evacuation
began Thursday after the line was reopened.
	   State-run television showed rails that had been cobbled together
with boards and wire after embankments and bridges were washed
away. Vast areas surrounding the line remained inundated.
	   To the west, along the Nen river in Inner Mongolia, 113,600
people remained stranded by floods that began August 8 and had left
414,000 people homeless, Xinhua reported.
	   In neighboring Liaoning province, rescue workers were struggling
to unearth villages buried by a landslide Tuesday that killed nine
people and left five others missing following a violent
thunderstorm, Xinhua News Agency reported late Thursday.
	   It said another landslide on the same day, in southwestern
Sichuan province, had killed six farmers and seriously injured two
others, destroying 17 houses.
	   The floods have caused outbreaks of disease, with more than 600
people suffering dysentery, typhoid, cholera, skin rashes and eye
diseases, Xinhua said.

Thailand offers embassy as site for East Timor negotiations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has agreed to an Indonesian
request to make its embassy in Lisbon, Portugal, available as a
site for negotiations over the fate of East Timor, a foreign
ministry spokesman said Friday.
	   East Timor is a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded
in 1975 and annexed a year later. Neither Portugal nor the United
Nations has recognized Indonesia's sovereignty over the island.
	   East Timor independence movements have been violently crushed by
the Indonesian military on several occasions and a number of
Timorese activists are in jail in Jakarta.
	   Since former Indonesian President Suharto stepped down from
power this May after 32 years of authoritarian rule, new President
B.J. Habibie has been searching for a negotiated solution to the
longstanding conflict.
	   Indonesia has been the target of international criticism over
its occupation of East Timor.
	   Thailand's decision came after the Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas asked the Thais for help because Indonesia no longer has
an embassy in the Portuguese capital, said Kobsak Chutikul, the
foreign ministry spokesman.
	   He said it was Thailand's gesture of good will to try and help
the two countries solve the problem of East-timor.
	   Kobsak said the Netherlands had also offered Portugal the use of
a room in its embassy in Jakarta.

Crowds continue to pour in for Catholic festival in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA VANG, Vietnam (AP) _ A sunrise Mass caused a 4 a.m. traffic
jam Friday as Roman Catholic pilgrims poured into this tiny village
for the 200th anniversary of an apparition of the Virgin Mary.
	   Families munched picnic breakfasts on the lawn around the raised
outdoor Mass site as organizers delayed the scheduled 6 a.m. start
by 15 minutes to let more people arrive for the biggest-ever
Catholic event in Vietnam.
	   But the casual atmosphere quickly turned to rapt attention as
the service began with a procession of top Church officials in
bright red and blue followed by 260 priests in crisp white
vestments.
	   Hand fans fluttered and umbrellas shot up as the sun crested the
trees and burned off the early-morning cool. The vestments soon
were plastered to the priests' bodies with sweat.
	   The people heard Pham Minh Man, the recently appointed
archbishop for Ho Chi Minh City, describe how previous generations
of Vietnamese Catholics ``faced many difficulties such as
persecution and a ban by King Canh Thinh.''
	   Today, he said, the young face different challenges, including
materialism and other temptations.
	   ``But with the help of the Virgin Mary, we can help get rid of
all these and live a good life,'' he said.
	   As the service ended, people surged forward to take communion.
But in a country with no tradition of standing in line, they
patiently waited for their turns.
	   Church officials estimated the crowd had swollen to more than
70,000 people from all over the country for the service that opened
the middle day of the three-day festival, although that figure
appeared to be a little high.
	   Father Guise Duong Duc Toai, head of the local church and the
organizing committee for the festival, forecast that with more bus
loads still en route for a nighttime service Friday and a wrapup
Mass on Saturday morning, overall attendance could surpass 150,000.
	   ``I am very moved to be here in such a big crowd,'' said Nguyen
Thi Nam, 44, who arrived three days earlier from Quang Ngai. ``When
I go home, I will try to describe things as visibly as possible for
those who couldn't come.''
	   A handful of foreigners were sprinkled amid the crowd.
	   Things appeared to be going smoothly, although Toai said there
had been minor problems with child thieves working the crowd and
people using too much of the trucked-in water. Surrounding Quang
Tri province is suffering from a major drought.
	   Toai also said the festival's main generator almost ran out of
fuel when a tanker truck got bogged down in traffic at 4 a.m. on
the one-lane road that runs the two kilometers (more than a mile)
from Highway 1.
	   ``We had to send some people to get fuel in hand containers,''
he laughed. ``It's amazing.''
	   While the communist government has limited its visible presence
to traffic police outside the festival site, several plainclothes
officers videotaped the proceedings and individuals in the crowd.
	   The vice chairman of the government committee for religious
affairs was on hand, along with several provincial officials.
	   The government, saying it sees religion as a way to ease rises
in youth drug use and prostitution, has shown a recent desire for
an improvement in its strained relations with organized religions.
	   But it also emphasizes that patriotism comes first. Only
officially recognized religions are permitted and must operate
under government rules.
	   Although the government tried to discourage people from coming
with widespread reports that there wouldn't be enough food, water
or accommodation, it did give brief front-page coverage of the
event in Friday's edition of the Communist Party daily Nhan Dan.

Corporate bankruptcies in July highest since World War II
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's banking crisis helped drive the number of
corporate bankruptcies in July to its highest level since the end
of World War II, a private credit research agency said Friday.
	   Bankruptcies rose 35.7 percent from the same month last year to
1,710, the highest number recorded for any month of July during the
post-war period, Teikoku Databank Ltd. said.
	   The number of companies going out of business has risen at a
rate of greater than 20 percent per month for the past eight
months, the Tokyo-based agency said.
	   It said the pace is expected to continue.
	   Teikoku Databank cited the nation's banking crisis as the single
biggest cause behind the rise. Japan's banks have triggered a
credit crunch as they've diverted funds to writing off some 76.7
trillion yen (dlrs 530 billion) in bad loans.
	   The total debts left behind by the companies that folded in July
fell 16.8 percent from a year earlier to 906 billion yen (dlrs 6.2
billion), it said.

Eighteen foreigners arrested in Myanmar put on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with congressman, relatives demanding release, grafs
7-10 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Eighteen foreigners arrested last week
for handing out pro-democracy leaflets in the Myanmar capital of
Yangon were put on trial Friday.
	   The trial for the 18, from six Asian and Western nations, was
being held at a court just outside the walls of Insein Prison,
where political detainees are usually kept. It began in the late
morning after an unexplained delay. Insein is a northern suburb of
Yangon.
	   Those arrested include six Americans, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Filipinos and an Australian.
	   They were charged under section 5j of the 1950 Emergency
Provision Act, a sweeping law that allows authorities to hand out
maximum 20-year jail sentences for attempting to incite unrest or
disrupt the peace and stability of the state.
	   A diplomat who visited the American activists on Thursday said
they had been unaware they would be tried on Friday. The diplomatic
community also was not informed until Friday morning, he said.
	   ``We didn't know. I hope they will be treated leniently,'' said
Kent Wiedemann, charge d'affairs of the U.S. embassy in Yangon, as
he entered the courtroom.
	   In Bangkok, Thailand, weeping and angry relatives appealed at a
news conference for their release.
	   They were joined by a U.S. congressman, Rep. Chris Smith,
chairman of the House International Operations and Human Rights
subcommittee, who accused the government of committing a ``public
relations disaster.''
	   Smith, a New Jersey Republican who has a constituent, Michele
Keegan, among the detainees described them as ``idealistic,
empathetic and caring about democracy.''
	   Smith said it would be ``premature'' to discuss new U.S.
sanctions against Myanmar but ``right now, there's an opportunity,
a small window, to release these people.''
	   The activists were detained Sunday, the day after the 10th
anniversary of a nationwide democracy uprising that was brutally
crushed by the military, for handing out small cards to Myanmar
citizens telling them the outside world supported their struggle
for democracy and to not give up.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. More than 3,000 demonstrators were
gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   The 18 foreign activists have been kept at a police guest house
in the capital. Diplomats who have visited them have described them
as cheerful, well-fed and treated humanely.
	   The military government issued a statement this week, however,
saying their release had been delayed because they were being
uncooperative.
	   The military is attempting to find a way to discourage foreign
activists from entering Myanmar and inciting the population to
revolt, while at the same time avoiding repercussions from the
governments of countries from which the activists come.
	   Earlier this year, the military government sentenced a
British-Australian national, James Mawdsley, to five years in
prison for also handing out pro-democracy leaflets. He was released
after three months.
	   Mawdsley had been detained in 1997 for a similar action, but was
deported with just a warning from the government not to return.
	   His trial was the first open to some members of the public in
decades. Friday's trial of the 18 foreigners was also open to some
members of the public such as diplomats and journalists.
	   Myanmar citizens put on trial rarely ever receive an attorney to
defend them, democracy and human rights activists have said.
	   Trials usually consist of reading out the charges and sentencing
the accused, they say. Most trials take less than an hour, as the
sentence has already been decided by officials higher up in the
government, the activists and groups say.
	   The foreigners are unlikely, however, to receive the same
treatment. Mawdsley was represented by a Myanmar lawyer at his
trial.
	   Insein prison, which sits just beyond the court, houses hundreds
of political prisoners along with violent criminals.
	   Political prisoners are frequently subjected to torture and kept
in solitary confinement or cells meant for military dogs, human
rights groups and former prisoners say.
	   In 1995, the International Red Cross pulled out of Myanmar in
protest after it was not allowed access to political prisoners.

Hong Kong's Chan says Asia recovery two to three years away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Asia's recovery from the financial crisis is
two to three years away, mainly because stronger economies such as
Hong Kong's are slipping into recession, Hong Kong's chief
secretary Anson Chan said Friday.
	   ``Recovery, which we had hoped would come sooner, now appears to
be further on the horizon _ perhaps two to three years away,'' Chan
said in a speech. ``Some of the stronger regional economies, such
as our's, are slipping into recession.''
	   She told the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce, ``A
deflating Japan could not only lengthen recovery in Asia, but
derail it altogether. In addition, the stability of the (Chinese)
renminbi and the Hong Kong dollar must be maintained as the anchors
of currency strength in Asia.''
	   The renminbi, China's currency, is also called the yuan.
	   Japan's ailing economy and fears of a possible devaluation of
the Chinese and Hong Kong currencies have continued to spook Asian
markets in recent days, casting doubt over a recovery anytime soon
from the region's worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Describing the Hong Kong dollar as ``rock solid,'' she said,
``In the face of the regional currency devaluations, many have
questioned whether we can maintain the Hong Kong-U.S. dollar
link.''
	   ``Our argument remains _ we cannot afford to lose the link,''
she said.
	   ``It is certainly not in Hong Kong's interest to do so, and
cutting the link would be like cutting the lifeline, not only to
Hong Kong, but the region as a whole, and it would set off another
wave of destabilization.''

Dollar, Tokyo stock prices fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Friday amid
speculation financial authorities may intervene to support the
ailing Japanese currency. Tokyo stock prices followed Wall Street
lower.
	   The dollar bought 144.84 yen as of mid-afternoon, down 1.72 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and below its late New York rate of
145.16 yen.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average fell 258.09 points, or 1.68 percent, to close at
15,123.93. On Thursday, the Nikkei index edged up 3.05 points, or
0.02 percent.
	   Traders said the dollar carried over from its weakness in New
York, where the currency moved lower overnight on profit-taking
after recent gains.
	   Fears among investors that monetary authorities may intervene to
stem the yen's slide also supported the currency. On Wednesday,
Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's influential vice finance minister for
international affairs, suggested that the government was ready to
step into the market to buy yen if necessary.
	   On the stock exchange, share prices tumbled as investors grew
wary of yet more declines on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial
average lost just over 1 percent on Thursday and is down about 10
percent for the last month.
	   A brewing financial crisis in Russia, coming on the heels of the
financial meltdown in the once booming markets of Asia, also
dampened investor confidence, analysts said.
	   ``There are very few reasons to buy at this point,'' said
Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Co.
	   While Thursday's gain by the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average
snapped an eight-day losing streak, a faltering domestic economy
will continue to weigh on stocks, analysts said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 12.91 points, or 1.09 percent, to 1,168.80.
The TOPIX closed up 1.71 points, or 0.15 percent, the day before.
	   Trading remained light as many investors in Japan took off this
week for Japan's annual ``Obon'' summer holidays.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.175 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.185 yen, pushing its price up to 111.94 yen from 111.87 yen.

U.S. airman dies in parachute accident in Okinawa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. Air Force serviceman stationed in Okinawa
was killed in a parachute accident during a training session, the
U.S. military said Friday.
	   Senior Airman Sean McDermott, who specialized in parachute
rescues, died Thursday while training in high altitude-low opening
parachute operations, said Chris Ames, the chief of media at Kadena
Air Base.
	   No further details were available and McDermott's hometown was
not immediately released, Ames said.
	   Earlier this week, a navy serviceman died and another was
seriously injured after a pipe ruptured aboard the USS Cushing,
which was at port in Okinawa, located about 1,600 kilometers (1,000
miles), southwest of Tokyo.
	   There are currently about 47,000 U.S. military personnel
stationed in Japan under mutual security arrangements between Japan
and the United States.

China plans to revise eugenics law, boost genetic research
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The Ministry of Health plans to clarify a law
passed in 1994 that discourages people suffering from ``genetic
diseases'' from marriage and childbearing, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency reported Friday.
	   The Maternal and Infant Health Care law was ineffective because
it does not say which genetic disorders are serious enough to fall
under its jurisdiction, Xinhua quoted Qiu Renzhong, a scientist
with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, as telling a genetics
conference in Beijing.
	   The law also should specify that men and women diagnosed with
genetic disorders should be fully informed of medical opinions and
should have the right to decide for themselves if they will undergo
treatment, Qiu said.
	   In addition, Qiu said that although the 1994 law requires people
with infectious diseases such as AIDS, gonorrhea, syphilis and
leprosy to ``postpone marriage,'' it does not make clear whether
people infected with HIV, which causes AIDS, can marry.
	   He said a committee of the national legislature had accepted his
suggestions and planned to revise the law.
	   Meanwhile, Xinhua reported that China plans to spend 250 million
yuan (dlrs 30 million) in the next three years to support genetic
research related to human health.
	   Two major research centers in Beijing and Shanghai are focusing
on research into genes linked with liver cancer, diabetes, high
blood pressure and other diseases, it said.

Taliban hope to take last bits of Afghanistan without force
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Taliban fighters said Friday they
wanted to use persuasion, not force, to take their opposition's few
remaining strongholds in Afghanistan.
	   ``We don't want more people to die,'' said Mullah Abdul Satar,
the Taliban general commander at the front line just north of
Kabul, the capital. ``We are ready to fight, but we want to prevent
human casualties.''
	   Satar said he was in touch with several opposition commanders,
trying to persuade them to open the key Salong Highway leading
north from Kabul. Satar said the opposition has no more reason to
resist now ``that we have 90 percent of the territory of
Afghanistan.''
	   In the past, the Taliban have suffered heavy causalities trying
to fight their way north of Kabul into the Panjshir Valley,
territory held by Ahmed Shah Masood, the military chief they pushed
from the capital in 1996.
	   The territory in the hands of a loose coalition of anti-Taliban
militias has been reduced to the Panjshir Valley and central
Bamiyan province.
	   Thursday, civilians and foreign aid workers fled Bamiyan,
capital of the province of the same name, fearing the Taliban would
mount a decisive attack any day.
	   The Taliban promise to bring peace, and to unite a country
plagued by strife and civil war for decades under a strict form of
Islam. In parts of the country they control, women are confined to
the home, girls are barred from school and men are required to wear
beards. Movies, music and books are banned to keep out foreign
influence and ensure Afghans spend their free time at prayer.
	   The Taliban have scored stunning victories in recent days,
seizing both Mazar-e-Sharif, the biggest city in northern
Afghanistan, and the border town of Hayratan that had been the
opposition's only gateway to the outside world.
	   With the opposition weakened and isolated, the mood on the
Taliban side of the front line was calm and confident Friday. Satar
and his men sipped tea at Hassin Koot, about 20 kilometers (12
miles) from Kabul, answered sporadic shells from the north with
shells of their own, and described an overnight rocket exchange as
routine.

Cash-strapped Indonesian airline to return planes to Boeing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's debt-ridden state-owned
airline, Garuda Indonesia, will return five jetliners to
Seattle-based Boeing Co. in a drive to cut costs, the government
said Friday.
	   Sofyan Djalil, a senior official at the state enterprises
ministry said Boeing had agreed to accept the planes, which Garuda
had leased with a view to purchasing.
	   ``We have renegotiated with Boeing. We were committed to buy 17
aircraft, now we can't. So we have reduced our commitment from 17
to 12,'' he said.
	   ``Boeing understands our condition. Boeing will find another
buyer, and Garuda in the future may be able to resume the
commitment to buy,'' Sofyan said.
	   The move marks the latest cost-cutting measure by Garuda as it
tries to pull itself out of a dire financial plight, triggered by a
massive national economic crisis.
	   Passengers numbers have fallen dramatically and so too has the
value of the rupiah.
	   Garuda's operation has been squeezed by the fact that much of
Garuda's revenue is in rupiah but its costs are in dollars.
	   It is also trying to renegotiate a foreign currency debt of dlrs
400 million, of which dlrs 200 million is due this year.
	   Garuda returned six McDonnell Douglas-11 aircraft in mid-June.
It recently received approval from Airbus to lower leasing costs
for some other planes.
	   Other Indonesian airlines are also struggling to survive the
economic meltdown.
	   The third largest carrier, Sempati, ceased operations because of
financial problems in June.

Newspaper: Indonesian agency to stop importing wheat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's National Logistics Agency
will stop importing wheat in October after the government ends its
subsidy on the commodity, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   ``In October we will leave the wheat business, and private
companies will have to take over our job,'' agency chairman Beddu
Amang was quoted as saying by the Jakarta Post.
	   He said the agency, known as Bulog, wouldn't lobby for an
extension of the subsidy beyond the October deadline demanded under
an economic bailout and reform package with the International
Monetary Fund.
	   The IMF has set Indonesia a list of tough economic reforms to
implement in exchange for billions of dollars in aid and loans.
	   Indonesia is currently battling its worst economic crisis in a
generation.
	   Food prices have soared along with inflation and mass
unemployment and there have been reports of some food shortages.
	   Beddu said Bulog will concentrate on importing rice and sugar.
	   He added that Bulog plans to purchase 700,000 tons of wheat next
month to cover the country's consumption for two to three months.
He estimates Indonesia will import 4.25 million tons of wheat in
the fiscal year ending March 31.
	   Bulog lost its monopoly to import and distribute all commodities
other than rice under the IMF bailout package, but under a revision
in June the subsidies were extended in an attempt to lessen the
impact of the worsening economic crisis.
	   Bulog has been gradually lifting the subsidy on wheat since the
beginning of July.
	   The agency is currently the sole distributor for government
subsidized cooking oil and sugar, but has said it will hand over
that role to a network of cooperatives on Jan. 1.

Yeltsin: Economy stable, no need to interrupt vacation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ A relaxed President Boris Yeltsin
insisted Friday that the Russian economy is stable and said there
is no need to interrupt his month-long vacation to take charge of
the unfolding crisis.
	   ``At this moment, there is no need for that,'' Yeltsin told
reporters upon arrival at this ancient Russian capital north of
Moscow. ``Moreover, when the president rushes to the Kremlin,
everybody thinks that something is wrong.''
	   Yeltsin flew by helicopter to Novgorod from a resort in the wild
Valdai region, and was expected to issue an edict restoring the old
name of Novgorod Veliky, or Novgorod the Great, in honor of the
city's 1,140th anniversary next year.
	   Reporters peppered him with questions about the economic crisis.
In recent days, the Russian stock market has accelerated its slide
and the ruble has come under intense pressure, prompting fears of a
devaluation.
	   ``No, we are not going to devalue the ruble,'' Yeltsin insisted,
adding that he thought the government had the economic situation
under control.
	   He also said he saw no need for a special session of the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament, to consider the remainder of
the government's economic austerity plan. The Duma has passed some
portions of the plan, which was demanded by international lenders,
but recessed for the summer without passing all of it.
	   Duma leaders had been balking at calling a special session to
reconsider the plan in light of the latest crisis, and there had
been calls for Yeltsin to exercise his constitutional power to call
a mandatory session.
	   ``I'm not considering this possibility for the moment, as there
is no need,'' Yeltsin said. ``I do not exclude it in the future.''
	   Duma speaker Gennady Zyuganov met Thursday with Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko, and said afterward that he would consider calling
a special session.

Dutch probing allegations that their troops killed Muslims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WILLIAM J. KOLE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Defense Ministry has ordered
an investigation into a new report that Dutch U.N. peacekeepers
drove a tank into a crowd of Bosnian Muslims in 1995, killing as
many as 30.
	   Defense Minister Frank de Grave opened the probe Thursday
evening after unidentified military sources told Dutch television
about the alleged incident in the eastern Bosnia enclave of
Srebrenica.
	   The allegations came as the Netherlands reels under fresh
accusations that its peacekeepers _ assigned to protect the former
U.N. ``safe haven'' _ helped the Bosnian Serbs who overtook the
area separate Muslim men from women for deportation.
	   The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, a U.N. court in The Hague
bringing to justice those accused of atrocities during the war,
released a 1995 report this week absolving Dutch troops of
complicity in war crimes.
	   De Grave, however, said he was deeply concerned about the
persistent allegations of wrongdoing and that an investigation was
necessary to clear up ``this terrible situation.''
	   The Dutch television report said Dutch peacekeepers in
Srebrenica intentionally drove their tank into the Muslims on July
11, 1995, just as the Serbs were consolidating their stronghold on
the town.
	   A military official said the unit had been stopped by the
Muslims, some of whom were armed, and that the tank commander
ordered his men to mow down the crowd.
	   Dutch officials already are investigating accusations that the
military intentionally destroyed film that would have showed its
soldiers helping the Serbs prepare Muslim captives at Srebrenica
for deportation.
	   The Defense Ministry has said the film was destroyed
accidentally during processing, a claim disputed by the peacekeeper
who took the pictures. Military brass also have denied any
conspiracy of a coverup.
	   The Dutch already have come under international criticism for
doing little, if anything, to stop the Serbs from seizing the town,
which later became the site of some of the Bosnian war's worst
bloodshed.
	   Thousands of Muslims at Srebrenica were slain, their bodies
buried in mass graves. Dutch commanders testified later that their
300 troops were overpowered by the Serbs and that their U.N.
mandate was too weak to do more to stop them.
	   Immediately after the fall of Srebrenica, the Defense Ministry
conducted an internal investigation which officially cleared the
Dutch unit of any wrongdoing.
	   Another investigation by the Netherlands State Institute for War
Documentation is still in progress.

Foreigners barred from swimming pool in northern Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Foreigners have been barred from a public pool in
northern Japan after a non-Japanese resident was accused of
molesting a young girl at the facility, officials said Friday.
	   Local legal authorities said they were investigating whether the
ban represents a human rights violation.
	   Officials in the town of Azuma imposed the ban on July 12, a day
after the parents of a 10-year-old girl reported that their
daughter had been touched by an unidentified foreigner in the pool.
	   The District Legal Affairs Bureau in Maebashi, a city near
Azuma, believes the ban could be violating foreigners' rights, said
Junichi Sato, a spokesman for the bureau.
	   ``It will be a human rights problem, if the ban has been taken
against all foreigners uniformly,'' Sato said.
	   Azuma, a small town of 20,000 people about 120 kilometers (74
miles) north of Tokyo, is home to about 500 foreigners.
	   Tetsuya Kubota, an education board official, said there have
also been reports that another elementary school girl was roughly
pulled into the pool by a group of five foreigners on July 11.
	   Town officials put up a sign, reading: ``The pool will be closed
to foreigners ... Some children have been receiving rough behavior
from foreigners in the pool lately.''
	   Kubota defended the ban.
	   ``Putting up the notice was decided among village authorities,
who considered the safety of children more important than anything
else,'' he said.

Report: Psychologists brought into the SilkAir crash probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Psychologists have joined the investigation of
December's SilkAir jetliner crash in Indonesia to study the
background of the crew members, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The SilkAir Boeing 737-300 mysteriously dropped from the sky
into the Musi River in the Sumatran jungle on Dec. 19, killing all
104 people aboard, including the pilots and flight attendants.
	   Some people have speculated that one of the pilots was suicidal,
and the Asian Wall Street Journal reported that the debt-ridden
captain had taken out a last-minute life insurance policy, and that
he had tampered with a cockpit tape recording of a previous flight
to hide an error he had made during it.
	   The report Friday by Singapore's leading Straits Times daily
said the chief investigator in the SilkAir crash, Indonesian
Oetarjo Diran, met Wednesday with the some of the victims' families
in Singapore at their request.
	   Diran told them that psychologists will now take part in the
investigation and that it has been narrowed to study a possible
engineering failure in the plane or ``human factors,'' The Straits
Times said. The story did not identify those factors.
	   Last week, the Indonesian-led team investigating the SilkAir
crash said it had found ``no indication that air traffic control,
weather or maintenance were factors in the accident.'' It said the
investigation would continue to study other issues, such as human
factors.
	   One of the relatives told The Straits Times that the 4-hour-long
meeting with Diran had turned bitter near the end, with some of the
participants shouting at him.
	   SilkAir is a subsidiary of the flag carrier Singapore Airlines.
When Singapore Airlines officials were asked to comment on Friday's
Straits Times report, they did not immediately respond.

Sales at Tokyo-area department stores fall for third month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A slump in consumer spending drove down sales at
Tokyo department stores for a third straight month in July, an
industry association said Friday.
	   Sales at Tokyo-area department stores totaled 221.7 billion yen
(dlrs 1.5 billion) in July, down 5 percent from the same month a
year earlier, the Japan Department Stores Association said.
	   The association said sales have dropped 15 of the last 16
months, following an increase in the national sales tax in April
1997 that many economists blame for helping send Japan into
recession.
	   Sales of clothing, which account for one-third of all department
store sales, fell 2.5 percent to 80.6 billion yen (dlrs 555
million).
	   The association's survey is based on data from 32 Tokyo-area
stores.

Deadline looms over foreign workers amid fear of riots

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Clutching passports and eying
their watches, throngs of foreign workers spill into the street
outside the cavernous Immigration Department in a final rush to
renew work permits.
	   ``I have until Saturday. After that, this Indonesian must go
back to Indonesia,'' said restaurant owner Abu Bakree Bakar,
flashing the passport of an employee whose work permit _ along with
those of 237,000 other immigrants _ expires Saturday.
	   With time ticking against the government deadline, tension can
be felt throughout Malaysia. Rumors circled the country last week
that foreign workers, mostly Indonesians, were buying up machetes
to prepare for a violent protest.
	   One rumor even had a riot under way in the capital Aug. 7,
prompting workers to leave early, stock up on staples and lock
themselves indoors.
	   Authorities quickly dismissed the hearsay, which spread over the
Internet, and jailed three alleged rumor mongers. People wonder,
however, if the falsehoods weren't grounded in some truth.
	   ``A lot of Indonesians are going to have to go home, and they
don't want to,'' said Richard Yap, owner of a debt-ridden
manufacturing company that had to let go of 10 Indonesians,
effective Saturday. ``I'm not ruling out that there could be
trouble.''
	   At the last roundup there was.
	   On March 26, rioting broke out at four detention camps
throughout Malaysia. Eight people were killed in one camp outside
Kuala Lumpur when illegal Indonesians resisted deportation.
	   Since then, joblessness has soared in neighboring Indonesia,
where more than half its 202 million people are expected to sink
into poverty by the end of the year.
	   During Asia's boom years, Malaysia imported millions of foreign
workers to build its modern cityscape. Now, with rising
unemployment and a plunging economy, the welcome mat has been
yanked from beneath their feet.
	   Earlier this year, more than 30,000 undocumented Indonesians
were deported, in addition to Thais, Bangladeshis and others. To
accommodate a shrinking work force, the government cut back 200,000
jobs in the construction industry and 16,000 in the service
sectors.
	   Separately, some 237,000 permits that expire Saturday, the
normal annual expiration date, can be renewed if employers submit
applications by then.
	   It is unclear how many workers will be deemed illegal as of
Saturday or what will become of them.
	   When the deadline was announced months ago for employers to
renew their workers' permits, the government said 200,000 illegal
immigrants would be deported by Aug. 15. But that hasn't happened.
	   ``They will leave on their own as far as immigration officials
are concerned,'' said department spokesman Sabri Zainal.
	   Authorities have vowed on Sunday to swoop down on workplaces
known to employ foreign workers, particularly restaurants,
factories and plantations.
	   The warning has spurred a mini exodus. More than 100,000
foreigners have registered to leave the country. Several airlines
are reporting all economy-class seats booked to Bangladesh and
Indonesia through the end of the month.
	   This prompted authorities to provide foreign workers a ``grace
period'' of up to three weeks to find a way home.
	   To free up jobs for Malaysians during the economic slump, the
government recently ruled that foreigners were only eligible for
service-sector jobs shunned by locals.
	   Work permits would be extended for up to six years for those
undesirable jobs in cemeteries, retirement homes, restaurants,
laundries, orphanages and gas stations.
	   The government, however, would not renew permits for positions
at beauty salons, health clinics, supermarkets, karaoke lounges and
furniture shops.
	   ``Bosses everywhere are cutting, cutting, cutting,'' said Abdul
Awala, who moved from Bangladesh three years ago for a job at an
auto plant paying 400 ringgit (dlrs 95) a month.
	   His boss refused to renew his work permit or fund his ticket
home, as the law requires. Abdul, one of nearly a thousand waiting
his turn outside the Immigration Department on Thursday, said he
fears for his future.
	   ``There are thousands in Malaysia like me.''

Lonely women can call fire station, not phone sex line, operator
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australian (AP) _ An anti-discrimination tribunal
Friday gave permission for an Australian telephone sex service to
advertise for women workers only, after the owner said women who
wanted to talk to men could simply call their local fire station.
	   ``Let's face it, why would a woman need to pay for a fantasy
phone call when all she has got to do is ring up the local army
base or fire station,'' Peta King told the Anti-Discrimination
Tribunal.
	   ``I am sure the guys there would be only too happy to talk to
her for nothing.''
	   King was granted an exemption from the Equal Opportunity Act,
which requires that job advertisements not specify a gender
preference.
	   She said she was bombarded with male job applicants every time
she advertised for her business, Grandma's Live Phone Talk.
	   But all her clients were heterosexual men so she had no need for
male workers.
	   ``I need the exemption,'' King said. ``If I cannot put `ladies
only,' I have so many men that ring and apply for the job, and when
you tell them that you don't have work for men some of them become
very obstreperous.''
	   ``In fact some of them have reported me to the
Anti-Discrimination Tribunal.''
	   The business advertised for new workers often because the job
was difficult and few workers stayed long.

Pakistan's Sharif vows to help Indian Kashmiris on independence
</HEADLINE>
day &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos ISL101-102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed
Friday to continue supporting Kashmiri separatists fighting in
neighboring India.
	   Sharif, in his address to the nation marking 51 years of
independence, also said violence in Kashmir would ``force India to
come to the negotiation table.''
	   Pakistan and India have fought two of their three wars over
Kashmir since both gained independence from Britain in 1947. India
celebrates its independence day Saturday.
	   India accuses Sharif's government of arming Muslim guerrillas
fighting for Kashmir's independence or its merger with Islamic
Pakistan, while Pakistan accuses India of violating human rights in
its crackdown on militants. Islamabad says it offers only political
and moral support to Kashmir's indigenous movement, and Sharif said
that support would continue as long as ``Kashmiris are victim of
Indian atrocities.''
	   The Himalayan territory of Kashmir is divided between India and
Pakistan, with both nations claiming all of it. Their armies
regularly fire across the border, with the heaviest exchanges in
recent memory late last month and early this month coming as peace
talks between Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari
Vajpayee failed because of the Kashmir issue. The two are to meet
again in September.
	   Sharif on Friday also defended his decision to answer Indian
nuclear weapons tests in May with his own tests.
	   ``On August 14, we won independence. On May 28 we preserved our
independence with nuclear tests forever,'' he said.
	   The winners of this year's national award for excellence,
announced every year on independence day, included the architect of
Pakistan's nuclear program, Abdul Qadeer Khan.

Yeltsin: Economy stable, no need to interrupt vacation

<TEXT>
	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ A haggard-looking President Boris
Yeltsin insisted Friday that the Russian economy is stable and said
there is no need to interrupt his month-long vacation to take
charge of the unfolding crisis.
	   ``At this moment, there is no need for that,'' Yeltsin told
reporters upon arrival at this ancient Russian capital north of
Moscow. ``Moreover, when the president rushes to the Kremlin,
everybody thinks that something is wrong.''
	   Yeltsin flew by helicopter to Novgorod from a resort in the wild
Valdai region, and was expected to issue an edict restoring the old
name of Novgorod Veliky, or Novgorod the Great, in honor of the
city's 1,140th anniversary next year.
	   Despite having been on vacation for nearly a month, the
67-year-old president had bags under his eyes and his face appeared
puffy. He walked slowly and seemed to have difficulty understanding
reporters' questions about the economic crisis.
	   In recent days, the Russian stock market has accelerated its
slide and the ruble has come under intense pressure, prompting
fears of a devaluation.
	   ``No, we are not going to devalue the ruble,'' Yeltsin insisted,
adding that he thought the government had the economic situation
under control.
	   He also said he saw no need for a special session of the State
Duma, the lower house of parliament, to consider the remainder of
the government's economic austerity plan. The Duma has passed some
portions of the plan, which was demanded by international lenders,
but recessed for the summer without passing all of it.
	   Duma leaders had been balking at calling a special session to
reconsider the plan in light of the latest crisis, and there had
been calls for Yeltsin to exercise his constitutional power to call
a mandatory session.
	   ``I'm not considering this possibility for the moment, as there
is no need,'' Yeltsin said. ``I do not exclude it in the future.''
	   Duma speaker Gennady Zyuganov met Thursday with Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko, and said afterward that he would consider calling
a special session.

Howard coy about election date as government sells tax plan to
</HEADLINE>
public &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard remained
coy Friday about when he will call elections, one day after
launching his plan to overhaul Australia's tax system as the
centerpiece of his reelection campaign.
	   ``I do not have a date in mind, I have not made up my mind,''
Howard said in a radio interview. ``I'm accepting dinner date
invitations right through October.''
	   Many observers have tipped October as the month the polls will
be called, providing the public's reaction to the tax package is
positive. Howard can call elections anytime before May, 1999.
	   Howard said the plan ``will be the major issue in the election
campaign,'' but that for now he was concentrating only on
explaining it to all Australians.
	   In sweeping reforms outlined Thursday, Howard proposed to
introduce a broad-based 10 percent consumption tax to replace a
host of sales and state taxes. Most European governments have had
similar consumption taxes since the 1970s.
	   The plan also includes personal income tax cuts and streamlined
social security payments worth more than U.S. dlrs 7.8 billion (13
billion Australian dollars).
	   The plan will take effect from July 1, 2000, if it is approved
by voters at the coming elections. The plan must also pass
Parliament's upper house, the Senate, where the government
currently does not have a majority of seats.
	   The consumption tax proposal is a risky strategy for Howard's
conservatives. A similar plan was overwhelmingly rejected in 1993
by Australian voters who shunned the campaign of Howard's
predecessors, despite a hugely unpopular Labor government.
	   Opposition leader Kim Beazley said the government's figures to
impose income tax cuts could not be relied upon, and that he
expected the government to rush to an election before anyone had a
chance to look closely at the plan.
	   ``If he (Howard) goes to the election now, you know the package
won't stand up,'' Beazley said.
	   Beazley will launch Labor's tax package in two week's time. He
said it would contain tax cuts and no consumption tax.

Hong Kong index roars back, but gains could be short-lived
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Halfway through one of its most miserable
months in recent memory, Hong Kong's main stock index roared back
Friday _ at least for a day.
	   After dropping 16 percent of its value and falling to a
five-year low in the first two weeks of August, the Hang Seng Index
posted a 5.5 percent gain in its morning session. It rose 368
points to 7,029 at the midday break.
	   Analysts weren't quite sure what was happening, and questioned
whether it was more than a blip in the downward spiral that
continued to dominate much of Asia on Friday. Besides regional
worries, which now focus on Japan's weakness and prospects for
China and Hong Kong to devalue their currencies, Asia's markets on
Friday also were watching Russia's renewed economic troubles.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei index fell sharply. Markets in Singapore and
Kuala Lumpur were suffering further from what traders said was an
overall meltdown in confidence.
	   Traders in Hong Kong said it appeared that a few buyers had
moved into the market to buy up blue-chips and suggested they were
trying to cover short positions.
	   Short-selling is essentially a bet that the market will drop. An
investor borrows stocks and sells them, betting he can buy them
back at a lower price, repay the lender and pocket a profit.
	   However, short-sellers may be burned badly if they bet wrong,
and analysts said Friday's buying may have been in order to cover
short-selling before a long holiday weekend.
	   Analysts said none of the market's fundamentals had changed, and
they weren't sure who was doing the buying. Steve Chiu, a trader at
Sassoon Securities, said it appeared the market's sudden move
upward was temporary.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei index was down 150 points in afternoon
trading. There was no dramatic movement in the yen, which has been
under severe selling pressure.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Industrial Index, already at a
10-year low, fell another 1 percent in early trading. The Kuala
Lumpur Composite Index was down 3.3 percent in early trading.
Southeast Asian currencies were mixed.

Driver kills gas station attendant for pumping wrong gas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ An angry customer shot and killed a
gas station attendant for pumping the wrong type of fuel into his
vehicle, police said Friday.
	   Police said the attendant, Francisco Marquez, was shot in the
neck late Wednesday night after a heated argument with the
customer, who was driving a jeep-style vehicle.
	   The unidentified driver became angry after noticing Marquez was
pumping premium gasoline into the vehicle, which had a diesel
engine. Several passengers in the vehicle joined the dispute and
reportedly identified themselves as off-duty soldiers.
	   The driver then pulled out a gun and shot the attendant, police
said.
	   The men quickly escaped by driving off in the vehicle, they
said.
	   Using the wrong type of fuel can cause serious engine trouble,
and removing it from an engine can be a costly process.

Grandson of gambling kingpin wounded in botched kidnap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The grandson of one of Macau's original
gambling kingpins was wounded in a shootout with attackers who
apparently planned to kidnap him, news reports said Friday.
	   Yip Wai-tong, 46, was shot in the abdomen and seriously wounded
in an attack Thursday morning on a Macau street. He returned fire
with his own handgun, shattering windows of the attackers' van and
driving them off.
	   The van was abandoned about 500 meters (yards) away, and police
were looking for the attackers, Hong Kong newspapers said.
	   Macau has struggled with gang violence, much of it connected to
the gambling industry, this year, its last full year under
Portuguese rule. After some 450 years as a Portuguese territory, it
returns to Chinese rule in December 1999.
	   Critics say the territory, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) across
the mouth of the Pearl River from Hong Kong, relies too much on
gambling for its income.
	   Hong Kong newspapers said Yip lives in Hong Kong and runs soft
drink and water distilling companies for his father. They said Yip
had a license to carry a gun.
	   His grandfather, Yip Hon, was one of Macau's original gambling
tycoons. He died last year at the age of 93. At his funeral,
another one of Macau's gambling top gambling figures, Stanley Ho,
referred to Yip Hon as the ``the God of gambling.''

Thailand changes route of motor race after activists protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has changed the route of
international motor car race after environmentalists protested that
it would cross a wildlife sanctuary, a Thai tourism official said
Friday.
	   About 70 cars are participating in the 3,866 kilometer (2,396
mile) 3rd Asian Rally, which began on Aug. 8 in the Malaysian
capital of Kuala Lumpur and will finish Saturday in the northern
Thai city of Chiang Mai.
	   Drivers from Malaysia, Thailand, Korea and Japan were entered in
the contest.
	   On Friday, the drivers were scheduled to pass through Mae Hong
Son, 650 kilometers (400 miles) north of Bangkok, near the border
with Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Ten local environmental activist groups had written to the
province's governor protesting that the route crosses several
wildlife sanctuaries and demanded it be changed.
	   Officials of the Tourism Authority of Thailand said the governor
and race officials sympathized with the environmentalists'
concerns, and adjusted the route.

Dutch probing allegations that their troops killed Muslims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Defense Ministry has ordered
an investigation into a new report that Dutch U.N. peacekeepers
drove a tank into a crowd of Bosnian Muslims in 1995, killing as
many as 30.
	   Defense Minister Frank de Grave opened the probe Thursday
evening after unidentified military sources told Dutch television
about the alleged incident in the eastern Bosnia enclave of
Srebrenica.
	   The allegations came as the Netherlands reels under fresh
accusations that its peacekeepers _ assigned to protect the former
U.N. ``safe haven'' _ helped the Bosnian Serbs separate Muslim men
from women for deportation.
	   The U.N. Yugoslav war crimes tribunal released a 1995 report
this week absolving Dutch troops of complicity in war crimes.
	   De Grave, however, said he was deeply concerned about the
persistent allegations of wrongdoing and that an investigation was
necessary to clear up ``this terrible situation.''
	   The Dutch television report said Dutch peacekeepers in
Srebrenica intentionally drove their tank into the Muslims on July
11, 1995, just as the Serbs were consolidating their stronghold on
the town.
	   A military official said the unit had been stopped by the
Muslims, some of whom were armed, and that the tank commander
ordered his men to mow down the crowd.
	   Dutch officials already are investigating accusations that the
military intentionally destroyed film that would have showed its
soldiers helping the Serbs prepare Muslim captives at Srebrenica
for deportation.
	   The Defense Ministry has said the film was destroyed
accidentally during processing, a claim disputed by the peacekeeper
who took the pictures. Military brass also have denied any
conspiracy of a cover-up.
	   The Dutch already have come under international criticism for
doing little, if anything, to stop the Serbs from seizing the town,
which later became the site of some of the Bosnian war's worst
bloodshed.
	   Thousands of Muslims at Srebrenica were slain, their bodies
buried in mass graves. Dutch commanders testified later that their
300 troops were overpowered by the Serbs and that their U.N.
mandate was too weak to do more to stop them.
	   Immediately after the fall of Srebrenica, the Defense Ministry
conducted an internal investigation which officially cleared the
Dutch unit of any wrongdoing.
	   Another investigation by the Netherlands State Institute for War
Documentation is still in progress.

Philippine shares close up 2.7 percent on technical rebound
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks ended six sessions
of losses with a technical rebound Friday fueled by bargain-hunters
looking for oversold issues, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 34.63 points,
or 2.7 percent, to 1,337.92, after slipping 4.01 points Thursday to
its lowest closing level in five and a half years.
	   The market indicator shed a total of 221.46 points over the
previous six trading days.
	   Friday's rebound, though, was purely technical and may prove
short-lived, said Helen Alvarez, research head of All Asia Capital
Securities Management Corp.
	   She said shaky Asian economies and volatile regional currencies
are still putting pressure on the local stock market and clouding
its prospects.
	   In currency trading, the peso was stronger against the dollar at
midday as a result of slack demand for the U.S. currency following
the Japanese yen's slight recovery in early trading, dealers said.
	   The dollar averaged 43.250 pesos at midday, down from Thursday's
average of 43.456 pesos.
	   Traders said the market was much calmer now that the yen appears
to have settled.
	   After hitting the 147 yen to the dollar level in Thursday
trading, the yen recovered some of its losses Friday as
participants took profits on the U.S. currency.
	   Philippine traders noted, however, that participants in Manila
continued to closely monitor the yen's movements and were prepared
to react accordingly.
	   The central bank held its overnight borrowing rate at 18 percent
and its overnight lending rate at 20 percent. It raised both by 5
percentage points earlier this week to reduce money available for
speculating on the dollar.
	   Traders expect the central bank to maintain its overnight rates
for a few more days until there are clearer signs that the yen's
volatility has subsided.

Angry, tearful relatives, congressman demand release

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Angry and tearful relatives of the 18
foreign democracy activists jailed in Myanmar demanded their
release Friday just half an hour after learning they had been put
on trial.
	   The relatives, human-rights groups supporting the detainees and
U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who has a
constituent among them, said the military regime of Myanmar was
committing a blunder.
	   ``The longer this goes on, the more the government of Burma will
come under international scrutiny,'' said Smith, who chairs the
House International Operations and Human Rights subcommittee.
``From a public relations point of view, this is a disaster.''
	   A dozen relatives of the activists and members of human rights
groups supporting them were told Friday by the Myanmar Embassy that
their requests for visas would take a week to process and
interviews would be necessary. Normally, visas are granted in a few
hours.
	   Smith hoped his status as a high-ranking politician would get
him a visa Friday and had booked a plane to fly to Myanmar, which
is also known as Burma.
	   The activists were arrested Sunday in the Myanmar capital,
Yangon, for distributing leaflets urging people to remember the
10th anniversary of an uprising against military rule and to not
give up. The protests in 1988 were bloodily crushed.
	   The activists include six Americans, three Indonesians, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Filipinos and an Australian.
	   Eva Sana, the mother of Filipino social activist Ellene Sana,
pressed a handkerchief to her face and wept on learning that a
trial was being held, following days of statements by the Myanmar
government that their fate had not been decided.
	   ``Six days is already too long and too much for these young
people, who are not prepared for this kind of treatment,'' Sana
said.
	   Greg Vicary, brother of Australian university lecturer Alison
Vicary, said that there was widespread outrage in Australia over
her detention and that anger could escalate.
	   ``We will not go away,'' said Vicary, who displayed a life-size
photograph of his sister. ``If that's what they want, that's what
will happen. I say to the Burmese government, release these
innocent people.''
	   Smith said it was ``premature'' for the United States to think
about imposing new sanctions on Myanmar, but said the government
had an ``opportunity, a small window'' to free the activists.
	   Washington last year barred U.S. companies from making new
investments in Myanmar due widespread human-rights violations and
the government's refusal to compromise with pro-democracy leader
Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.

Report: Inmates at rehabilitation center riot over cigarettes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police fired bullets to quell
inmates at a drug rehabilitation center who went on a rampage after
being denied cigarettes. Two people were injured, a newspaper said
Friday.
	   Inmates armed with iron bars, machetes and knives smashed
computers and windshields of four vehicles and set fire to a
building in northern Malaysia on Thursday, New Straits Times
reported quoting Kedah state's police.
	   About 40 of the 441 inmates at the center for drug addicts
escaped during the violence, sparked after security guards
intercepted a supply of cigarettes.
	   Police fired bullets, injuring two inmates, after security
guards were attacked with stones and knives, said Kedah's deputy
commissioner of police, Nik Ismail Nik Yusuf. The wounded were shot
in the chest, hands and legs. They were admitted to a hospital.

Arrest of Internet abusers provokes public debate
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The first arrests in Malaysia for
spreading rumors over the Internet have people debating freedom of
speech and the right to privacy on the information superhighway.
	   The largest Internet service provider Friday assured worried
subscribers that it wouldn't snoop into their e-mails, a key tool
in a nation that sees information technology as the cutting edge of
its development policy.
	   The debate follows an investigation into last weekend's rumors
of violence which sparked off panic buying of food and forced many
to rush home from work and bolt their doors.
	   Cyber sleuths at Mimos Co., which brings the Internet to the
bulk of Malaysia's 200,000 subscribers, tracked down an unsigned
e-mail that warned of the widespread purchase of machetes by
migrant Indonesian workers.
	   ``Are they going to start anything funny?'' the widely
distributed e-mail read. ``We don't know. Please make sure that
your house, family and others are well protected.''
	   Two people were arrested Monday and another Wednesday under the
country's harsh Internal Security Act, which allows for detainment
without trial.
	   For some, the action has exploded the illusion of electronic
privacy.
	   ``The current action by the government may lead to the
short-circuiting of lively Internet discussions and shut off
perhaps the only remaining independent avenue for Malaysians to
discuss and debate issues,'' said Elizabeth Wong of the human
rights group The Voice of the People.
	   The Malaysian Bar Council said the use of the ISA was excessive.
Those arrested should undergo a public trial for spreading rumors,
a crime that has specific laws under which they should be charged,
a Council statement said.
	   Harsh punishment could hurt the image of a country that wants to
portray itself as Asia's Silicon Valley, a movement personally
backed by Bill Gates.
	   Malaysia soon hopes to launch its Multimedia Super Corridor, a
vast area bound by a fiber-optics network, providing links between
high-tech companies, government offices, homes, hotels and even
shopping malls.
	   Rumors ``breed best in a society which is deprived of factual
information,'' Wong said, saying the tightly-controlled local media
had lost credibility.
	   ``What is read in the newspapers is reduced to the status of
propaganda, whereas what is heard on the grapevine is elevated to
fact,'' she said.
	   Others see the whole affair as an opportunity to advocate
self-restraint on the Internet, warning that more electronic drivel
could lead to more government controls.
	   ``It is regrettable that they had to crack down like this,''
said Farish A. Noor of The International Movement for a Just World,
another human-rights group.
	   Farish said Internet users must create their own ethical
guidelines to prevent abuse if they want to protect their freedom
of expression.

New Zealand prime minister sacks deputy in coalition infighting

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley fired her deputy Friday as the ruling coalition collapsed,
throwing the government into turmoil which could lead to its
downfall.
	   Winston Peters was sacked from his cabinet post as treasurer and
as deputy prime minister by Shipley, who said at a news conference
she no longer had confidence or trust in him.
	   After a third tumultuous day for the government, Shipley is left
clinging to power, dependent on the votes of disaffected members of
Peters' New Zealand First party, who she has already begun wooing.
	   The collapse was triggered Wednesday by a Peters-led walkout of
a Cabinet meeting during a dispute about the sale of the
government's stake in Wellington airport.
	   Shipley said she intends to continue in power as leader of a
minority government, and approached the seven NZ First ministers
Friday, suggesting they continue in their positions.
	   With the coalition in tatters, Shipley needs to retain at least
seven votes from the 16-strong minority coalition partner to ensure
the government reform program is secure in the 120-vote Parliament.
	   Peters, who was not told of the firing until after it happened,
told reporters later he was fired because Shipley's National Party
did not like being seen as not in full control of events.
	   He said his legislators were people of principle and integrity
who ``cannot be bought off.''
	   ``The National Party can put all the privileges and perks of
public office before our members, but they will not fall for
that,'' he said.
	   But one has already broken ranks. Associate Treasurer and
Customs Minister Tuariki Delamere has given Shipley his support by
saying he will attend a Cabinet meeting scheduled for Monday.
	   Shipley said she would not call a snap election. She would
``explore all the options'' for deals with NZ First legislators.
	   Shipley said Peters was fired because he had called the nation's
commercial integrity into question by threatening to overturn the
airport sale.
	   National has 44 votes in its own right in Parliament, NZ First
has 16. The government coalition relies on up to 10 votes from
other parties for an outright majority in the House.
	   The numbers are unlikely to be tested immediately. No votes of
confidence are scheduled in the Parliament before next February. If
the government lost such a motion, however, an early election would
be almost inevitable.
	   Running high in the polls, Labor Opposition leader Helen Clark
called for immediate elections.

Indonesia's Habibie honors wife, general, ministers, Muslim leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie Friday awarded
medals on honor to his wife, the top military commander, senior
Cabinet ministers and a former political prisoner to celebrate
Indonesia's 53 years of independence.
	   The medals were awarded to a total of 38 people, including two
prominent Muslim leaders, for services to the nation, officials at
the presidential palace said.
	   National independence day falls on Monday.
	   Habibie's wife Hasri Ainun Besar Habibie received her award in
recognition of her charity work.
	   Military chief Gen. Wiranto, who is also defense minister, along
with Security and Politics Minister Feisal Tanjung and Economics
Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita were also honored as the nation
grapples with its worst economic crisis in 30 years amid fears of
potential civil unrest.
	   Wiranto has been instrumental in his support for Habibie's
presidency in recent months.
	   The military has stepped up security in Jakarta and other cities
because of rumors of possible rioting on Monday.
	   Ginandjar was a principal player in negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund for a dlrs 43 billion to set up a
economic rescue package.
	   Abdurrahman Wahid and Amien Rais, who each head the country's
two largest Muslim organizations, were named in the honor list, but
neither attended the award ceremony at the state palace.
	   Both were critics of the regime of Habibie's predecessor
ex-President Suharto and have also called on Habibie to accelerate
political reform. Rais has indicated that he wants to run for the
president next year.
	   Suharto ended 32 years of authoritarian rule in May after
protests and riots rocked the world's fourth-most populous nation.
Since then Habibie has promised political and economic reform.
	   Among those honored Friday was Muhammad Sanusi Sierad, an
ex-Cabinet minister and dissident who served nine and a half years
in prison during Suharto's reign.

Cambodian opposition leader seeks pardons for political convicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Former Co-Prime Minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh on Friday asked that royal pardons be granted to
five exiled opponents of Cambodian leader Hun Sen.
	   The prince asked his father, King Norodom Sihanouk, to provide
royal amnesties to two of his close aides now leading an armed
resistance movement, Nhek Bunchhay and Serey Kosal, and three other
prominent political convicts.
	   ``With your humble permission I would like to request Your
Majesty to pardon them from all convictions by the Phnom Penh
military court and the court of Battambang, allowing them to return
to their motherland,'' the prince wrote in an Aug. 13 letter to the
king.
	   A copy of the letter was forwarded to strongman Hun Sen, who in
the past has blocked such requests. But Hun Sen now needs
Ranariddh's support to form a new government after last month's
parliamentary elections, so Ranariddh has some bargaining power.
	   Nhek Bunchhay and Serey Kosal began their resistance movement
after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in a coup d'etat a year ago. A
military court later convicted Ranariddh and the two resistance
leaders in absentia for treason, but only the prince has won a
pardon.
	   The other three persons for whom pardons are being sought are
Prince Norodom Sirivudh, King Sihanouk's half-brother; Prince
Norodom Chakrapong, Ranariddh's half-brother; and Sin Song, a
former interior minister.
	   Sirivudh, a former foreign minister, was sentenced in a show
trial to 10 years in prison on charges of conspiring to kill Hun
Sen in 1995, while Chakrapong and Sin Song were convicted of
staging a failed coup in 1994.
	   The king has the right to provide royal amnesties on his own,
but in the past has sought the approval of Hun Sen, who he feels
might try to demolish the monarchy.
	   On Friday, Sihanouk said he did not object to the pardons in
principle, but asked that the request be passed onto Hun Sen for
his approval.
	   With the election battle over, the main political parties are
maneuvering to strengthen their positions before the new government
is formed.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party was named the winner of the
July 26 polls, but the party will not have the two-thirds majority
it needs in the 122-seat National Assembly to form a government on
its own.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and its opposition ally the Sam
Rainsy Party will control the other 58 seats, giving them the power
to block Hun Sen in the assembly.
	   The opposition leaders have stood firm in demanding that
irregularities in the polling and counting process be addressed
before they will even consider joining in a coalition government.

Philippine Communist rebel leader sees early cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Communist rebels are
willing to declare a 30-day cease-fire soon to improve the
atmosphere for peace talks expected to resume early next month, a
rebel leader said Friday.
	   Luis Jalandoni, chief peace negotiator of the National
Democratic Front, the Marxist umbrella group, said the recent
approval of a human rights accord by President Joseph Estrada was a
major boost to the talks.
	   The rebels had refused to resume negotiations without
presidential approval of the agreement on human rights and
international humanitarian law signed by negotiators in March.
Estrada approved the accord last Friday.
	   ``There is a high probability for a 30-day cease-fire that will
be agreed upon by both sides,'' Jalandoni said. ``It could come
quite soon because you might see a significant improvement in the
human rights situation.''
	   He said a unilateral cease-fire could be declared by the rebels
between September and December.
	   Government negotiators say the human rights agreement will help
``humanize and lessen the severity of the armed conflict,''
particularly on children, women and the elderly.
	   The accord also supports the indemnification of 9,539 Filipinos
who won a class action suit for human rights abuses under the late
dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   The peace negotiations began in September 1992 and have been
stalled several times, partly because of the arrest of several
rebel leaders said to have been involved in the talks.
	   When they resume, the two sides will attempt to craft an
agreement on economic and social reforms, the second of four
accords leading to a political settlement of the 29-year-old
insurgency.
	   The two others cover political and constitutional reforms and
disposition of armed forces.

	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin called on
parliament Friday to convene in an emergency session to respond to
Russia's unfolding economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin insisted, however, that the economic remained stable,
that the ruble would not be devalued, and said there was no need to
interrupt his month-long vacation to take charge of the situation.
	   ``At this moment, there is no need for that,'' Yeltsin told
reporters upon arrival at this ancient Russian capital north of
Moscow. ``Moreover, when the president rushes to the Kremlin,
everybody thinks that something is wrong.''
	   Yeltsin flew by helicopter to Novgorod from a resort in the wild
Valdai region, and was expected to issue an edict restoring the old
name of Novgorod Veliky, or Novgorod the Great, in honor of the
city's 1,140th anniversary next year.
	   Despite having been on vacation for nearly a month, the
67-year-old president had bags under his eyes and his face appeared
puffy. He walked slowly and seemed to have difficulty understanding
reporters' questions about the economic crisis.
	   In recent days, the Russian stock market has accelerated its
slide and the ruble has come under intense pressure, prompting
fears of a devaluation.
	   ``No, we are not going to devalue the ruble,'' Yeltsin insisted,
adding that he thought the government had the economic situation
under control.
	   Upon arrival, Yeltsin said he saw no need for a special session
of the Duma to consider the remainder of the government's economic
austerity plan.
	   ``I'm not considering this possibility for the moment, as there
is no need,'' Yeltsin said. ``I do not exclude it in the future.''
	   Within an hour, he had apparently changed his mind. As Yeltsin
arrived for a tour of a meat factory, his press secretary, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, said Yeltsin had signed a decree calling on the Duma
to meet.
	   It wasn't clear whether the decree invoked Yeltsin's
constitutional right to mandate a Duma meeting, or whether he was
merely requesting it.
	   The Duma has passed some portions of the government's austerity
plan, which was demanded by international lenders, but recessed for
the summer without passing all of it.
	   Duma leaders had been balking at calling a special session to
reconsider the plan in light of the latest crisis, and there had
been calls for Yeltsin to exercise his constitutional power to call
a session.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Zyuganov met Thursday with Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko, and said afterward that he would consider calling
a special session.

Long-awaited anti-racism campaign launched, criticized as too late
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The government Friday launched its long
awaited anti-racism campaign in response to the rise of right-wing
populist politician Pauline Hanson more than two years after it was
first promised.
	   The U.S. 3 million (Australian dollars 5 million) first stage of
the campaign, called ``Living in Harmony'' would made it clear
``there is no place for racism in Australia,'' said Immigration and
Multicultural Affairs Minister Philip Ruddock.
	   The campaign emphasizes the social and economic benefits of
diversity and reinforces the need for individuals and communities
to accept racial and cultural differences, he said.
	   The centerpiece will be U.S. dlrs 1.5 million (Australian
dollars 2.5 million) in grants to community organization for
special projects to ``generate better understanding, respect and
cooperation among people of different backgrounds.''
	   There will also be U.S. dlrs 600,000 (Australian dollars 1
million) advertising campaign promoting the slogan ``You, Me,
Australian.''
	   The strategy has already been criticized by ethnic groups who
say the government has dragged its feet in its efforts to counter
racism.
	   ``(The policy) has been too long in the making,'' said Ramdas
Sankaran, president of a state branch of the Ethnic Communities
Council. ``Especially given the political circumstances that his
country has been in for the last two years,'' he told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Hanson was elected to the federal Parliament as an independent
in 1996. She has since launched her One Nation party, which secured
more than 23 percent of a vote at a state election and which scores
double figures in national public opinion polls.
	   Hanson claims Australia is in danger of becoming ``Asianized,''
wants to drastically cut immigration levels, opposes special
welfare payments to Aborigines and advocates economic
protectionism.
	   In the latest of a string of embarrassments for Australia, the
Bangkok Post recently published a letter by a man claiming to be a
One Nation member which said Asians did not fit into Australian
society, were unwelcome as tourists and were sports drug cheats.
	   Then in opposition, the now ruling Liberal party expelled Hanson
shortly before the 1996 elections and promised a U.S. 6 million
(Australian dollars 10 million) anti-racism strategy.

Report: Psychologists brought into the SilkAir crash probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with response from Silk Air in final graf

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Psychologists have joined the investigation of
December's SilkAir jetliner crash in Indonesia to study the
background of the crew members, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The SilkAir Boeing 737-300 mysteriously dropped from the sky
into the Musi River in the Sumatran jungle on Dec. 19, killing all
104 people aboard, including the pilots and flight attendants.
	   Some people have speculated that one of the pilots was suicidal,
and the Asian Wall Street Journal reported that the debt-ridden
captain had taken out a last-minute life insurance policy, and that
he had tampered with a cockpit tape recording of a previous flight
to hide an error he had made during it.
	   The report Friday by Singapore's leading Straits Times daily
said the chief investigator in the SilkAir crash, Indonesian
Oetarjo Diran, met Wednesday with the some of the victims' families
in Singapore at their request.
	   Diran told them that psychologists will now take part in the
investigation and that it has been narrowed to study a possible
engineering failure in the plane or ``human factors,'' The Straits
Times said. The story did not identify those factors.
	   Last week, the Indonesian-led team investigating the SilkAir
crash said it had found ``no indication that air traffic control,
weather or maintenance were factors in the accident.'' It said the
investigation would continue to study other issues, such as human
factors.
	   One of the relatives told The Straits Times that the 4-hour-long
meeting with Diran had turned bitter near the end, with some of the
participants shouting at him.
	   Silkair, which is a subsidiary of flag carrier Singapore
Airlines, declined to elaborate on the news report.
	   ``The investigations are still going on and until a report on
the findings is published, we are not at liberty to comment,'' said
a statement from the airlines.

Hong Kong's Chan reassures on currency stability

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hong Kong's chief secretary gave strong
assurances Friday that the despite market pressure the Chinese
currency will not be devalued and the Hong Kong dollar will remain
tied to its U.S. counterpart.
	   ``In the face of the regional currency devaluations, many have
questioned whether we can maintain the Hong Kong-U.S. dollar
link,'' Anson Chan said in a speech to the Singapore International
Chamber of Commerce.
	   ``Our argument remains _ we cannot afford to lose the link,''
she said, comparing the cutting of that link to the severing of a
lifeline for the region.
	   Many are also worried that China will devalue the yuan _ also
known as the renminbi _ to remain competitive in trade with its
neighbors. But Chan referred to statements by Chinese leaders that
devaluation is not necessary.
	   ``I think that the leaders are fairly committed to defending the
renminbi,'' she told reporters afterward. ``It will not be devalued
because it is not in China's national interest to do so.
	   A move to either devalue the yuan or cut the link with the U.S.
dollar could set off a string of currency devaluations around the
region similar to the ones last year that led to Asia's current
financial crisis.
	   Chan said recovery for Asia is two or three years away because
some of the ``stronger regional economies, such as ours, are
slipping into recession,'' adding that Hong Kong's unemployment
rate could rise from the current 4.1 percent when new figures come
out next week.
	   She also warned against deflationary pressures in Japan, which
``could not only lengthen recovery in Asia, but derail it
altogether.''

Foreigners barred from swimming pool in northern Japan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Foreigners have been barred from a public pool in
northern Japan after a non-Japanese resident was accused of
molesting a young girl at the facility, officials said Friday.
	   Local legal authorities said they were investigating whether the
ban represents a human rights violation.
	   Officials in the town of Azuma imposed the ban on July 12, a day
after the parents of a 10-year-old girl reported that their
daughter had been touched by an unidentified foreigner in the pool.
	   The District Legal Affairs Bureau in Maebashi, a city near
Azuma, believes the ban could be violating foreigners' rights, said
Junichi Sato, a spokesman for the bureau.
	   ``It will be a human rights problem, if the ban has been taken
against all foreigners uniformly,'' Sato said.
	   The pool ban comes a week after another racial discrimination
case in Japan, in which a Brazilian journalist sued a jewelry shop
owner in central Japan for 1.5 million yen (dlrs 10,400) for making
her leave the store because she was a foreigner.
	   Azuma, a small town of 20,000 people about 120 kilometers (74
miles) north of Tokyo, is home to about 500 foreigners.
	   Tetsuya Kubota, an education board official, said there have
also been reports that another elementary school girl was roughly
pulled into the pool by a group of five foreigners on July 11.
	   Town officials put up a sign, reading: ``The pool will be closed
to foreigners ... Some children have been receiving rough behavior
from foreigners in the pool lately.''
	   Kubota defended the ban.
	   ``Putting up the notice was decided among village authorities,
who considered the safety of children more important than anything
else,'' he said.

Report: Four police killed in troubled Caucasus region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Gunmen opened fire on a police checkpoint in the
troubled Caucasus region, killing four officers, a news agency
reported Friday.
	   The shooting occurred late Thursday at a checkpoint on the
historic Military Georgian Road in North Ossetia, Interfax
reported. Two of the officers died at the scene and two died later
in hospitals, authorities said.
	   It was not clear who the gunmen were or why they shot the
officers.
	   North Ossetia, a predominantly Christian region, fought a short
but bloody war in 1992 with neighboring Ingushetia, which is
largely Muslim. Hundreds of people were killed and most ethnic
Ingush were expelled from North Ossetia.
	   Since then, there has been periodic violence in the region,
mostly associated with the aftermath of the war. Two police
officers were killed last month at another shootout at a checkpoint
on the Ingushetian border.

Stock prices, dollar take a tumble in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS closing bond, late afternoon currency prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks tumbled to a seven-week low on Friday,
led by electronics companies, following declines on Wall Street.
The U.S. dollar fell against the yen on speculation about market
intervention by financial authorities.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 258.09 points,
or 1.68 percent, to close at 15,123.93 _ its lowest since June 24.
On Thursday, the Nikkei index edged up 3.05 points, or 0.02
percent.
	   In currency markets, the dollar bought 144.88 yen as of late
afternoon, down 1.68 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and below its
late New York rate of 145.16 yen.
	   Stock prices tumbled as investors grew wary of yet more declines
on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average lost just over 1
percent on Thursday and is down about 10 percent for the last
month.
	   That drove down shares of blue chip exporters such as Sony
Corp., whose earnings performance is closely tied to the U.S.
economy. Sony dropped 180 yen, or 1.5 percent, to 11,500.
	   Comments by the International Monetary Fund that Japan's
economic policies are not enough to pull its economy out of
recession also dampened investor sentiment, analysts said.
	   ``There are very few reasons to buy at this point,'' said
Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Co.
	   While Thursday's gain by the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average
snapped an eight-day losing streak, the dark outlook for the
economy will continue to weigh on stocks, analysts said. A new
round of declining stocks and currencies elsewhere in Asia hasn't
helped either, they said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 12.91 points, or 1.09 percent, to 1,168.80.
The TOPIX closed up 1.71 points, or 0.15 percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 433 million shares traded on the first section, up
from 333 million Thursday. Declining issues outnumbered gainers
2-to-1.
	   The dollar traded as low as 144.60 yen from a morning high of
145.85 yen.
	   Fears among investors that monetary authorities may intervene to
stem the yen's slide supported the Japanese currency. On Wednesday,
Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's influential vice finance minister for
international affairs, suggested that the government was ready to
step into the market to buy yen if necessary.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.175 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.185 yen, pushing its price up to 111.94 yen from 111.87 yen.

Cambodian appeals body turns away election complaints
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's highest legal body turned
away a stack of opposition complaints about last month's election
Friday, demanding they be refiled with a proper cover letter.
	   Opposition politician Sam Rainsy went to the Constitutional
Council building for the second time in two days to submit hundreds
of complaints about election irregularities.
	   He was submitting the appeals after the National Election
Committee earlier this week dismissed as ``baseless'' the more than
800 complaints alleging such problems as improper vote counting and
intimidation of voters.
	   The deputy office manager for the council confirmed that
reception staff turned away the stack of appeals saying that the
papers were not accompanied with a cover letter.
	   Sam Rainsy _ who said the rules for complaints do not mention
the need for a cover letter _ was told by the clerks moments
earlier that the National Election Committee had not officially
ruled on the complaints so there could no appeal.
	   ``This is very strange,'' an agitated Sam Rainsy told reporters
after he walked out of the building, leaving eight envelopes of
complaints at the reception desk.
	   ``They are not lawyers, they are petty clerks, but they
interpret the law,'' he said. ``I told them, `the laws are made by
members of parliament, and must be interpreted by the
Constitutional Council. You are not the Constitutional Council!'''
	   Even before attempting to register their complaints, the Sam
Rainsy Party had expressed doubt that the council, which like the
election committee is stacked with supporters of Hun Sen's ruling
party, would provide a fair hearing.
	   ``With this rejection, they are dropping even the pretense of
being a legitimate Constitutional Council,'' Sam Rainsy said
Friday. ``They are just testing to see how far they can go in
ignoring the Constitution, the law, and the will of the people.''
	   Cambodia held parliamentary elections on July 26, one year after
strongman Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-prime
minister in a coup d'etat.
	   Hun Sen hoped new elections would bring back his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and aid lost after his
takeover.
	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority
in the 122-seat National Assembly in the election, but not the
two-thirds majority needed to form a government.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy Party _ which
together won 58 parliamentary seats _ have alleged rampant fraud in
voting and ballot counting.
	   They have threatened to boycott parliament unless their
complaints are properly investigated.

Gosper calls for more drug company accountability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
plans to ask major drug manufacturers to attend a summit meeting in
Lausanne next January as the IOC reassesses its fight against drugs
in sport.
	   Australian IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper said Friday
that sport has to regain the moral high ground or risk losing the
confidence of the general public.
	   Gosper will be in Lausanne this weekend at a meeting of the IOC
executive board to plan the agenda for the anti-doping summit on
Jan. 25-26.
	   ``It's time we made it clear to major drug manufacturers of
steroids, EPOs, human growth hormones, that if they're not careful
and don't apply more stringent controls, and the public perceives
that drugs are bringing down the character of sport, their
reputation is at stake,'' Gosper said.
	   He also backed last month's suggestion from IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch that the list of banned drugs be re-examined and
narrowed and was adamant such action would not open new avenues for
cheating.
	   ``This full aggregation of the drug list is, we think,
inhibiting young athletes who fear that through misadventure they
could be caught in a drug test,'' Gosper said.
	   ``They can't take headache pills or get an injection at the
dentist. People get nervous when we talk about reducing the list of
drugs to get a tighter focus against cheating and think we will
disregard drugs that do boost performance.
	   ``But I can assure you that scrutiny will be very, very tough.
The IOC has to be preoccupied with the cheating element and we need
to narrow down the list of drugs to weed out the cheats.''

	   BEIJING (AP) _ A major levee protecting Daqing, China's largest
oil field, gave way Friday as floods spread their misery into the
northeast, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Heilongjiang, an industrial and agricultural province that
borders Russia, mobilized 1 million civilians and soldiers for ``a
round-the-clock fight'' against the flooded Nen and Songhua rivers,
Xinhua said.
	   More than 200,000 people were fighting flooding in Daqing. Local
residents were safely evacuated and no casualties were reported
from the breach in the dike, which expanded to 500 meters (1,650
feet) by midday, Xinhua said.
	   Rescue workers also were evacuating more than 20,000 people
stranded after floods washed out railway tracks in Heilongjiang,
state media said.
	   A flash flood near Aksu, in the northwestern region of Xinjiang,
killed four people and left dozens missing Thursday, inundating an
area inhabited by some 100,000 people, the official Workers Daily
reported.
	   Floods and landslides also forced the closure of a major rail
line in the northwest, between Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, and the
city of Lanzhou, the reports said.
	   With a rain belt stretching across central China, floods were
predicted to continue and to worsen in the northeast and along the
Yellow River, which was expected to become dangerously swollen in
the next few weeks, the official China Daily reported.
	   Meanwhile, residents and soldiers worked feverishly to fortify
levees along the turbulent Yangtze, bracing for yet another flood
crest forecast to sweep downriver within the next few days.
	   Experts warned that as flood waters recede, dikes might weaken
further. Diseases also threaten, with skin infections already on
the rise because people have been immersed in polluted water for
weeks.
	   ``People must wade through waist high water to go about their
daily life,'' the Red Cross reported from one flood-hit province.
	   Already, 10,000 medical teams are handing out food, water
purification tablets, medical supplies, and evacuating people in
flooded areas.
	   But shortages of funds are delaying relief efforts, the Red
Cross said. It appealed urgently for money to provide food, water
purification tablets and medical supplies to one million people.
	   It also warned that the floods threaten efforts to control snail
fever in some areas, and said outbreaks of this tropical disease
may increase.
	   In the northeast, the industrial city of Harbin declared a state
of ``high alert'' and set a 24-hour curfew along levees protecting
it from the rising Songhua River, which was likely to suffer two
major flood crests within the next 10 days, Xinhua said.
	   More than 20,000 people had been stranded for six days along the
Harbin-Manzhouli railway line, northwest of Harbin. Evacuation
began Thursday after the line was reopened.
	   State-run television showed rails that had been cobbled together
with boards and wire after embankments and bridges were washed
away. Vast areas surrounding the line remained inundated.
	   To the west, along the Nen River in Inner Mongolia, 113,600
people remained stranded by floods that began August 8 and left
414,000 people homeless, Xinhua reported.
	   In neighboring Liaoning province, rescue workers were struggling
to unearth villages buried by a landslide Tuesday that killed nine
people and left five others missing, Xinhua reported late Thursday.
	   It said another landslide on the same day, in southwestern
Sichuan province, killed six farmers and seriously injured two
others, destroying 17 houses.

Myanmar puts ambulance on standby for pro-democracy leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The military regime said Friday that an
ambulance has been put on standby at a roadblock where Nobel Peace
Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi was in the third day of a new
standoff against the government.
	   Suu Kyi's party, the opposition National League for Democracy,
has said the government will be responsible for her health if she
is not allowed to visit her supporters in Bassein, 160 kilometers
(100 miles) west of Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, was stopped Tuesday at a checkpoint 32 kilometers
(19 miles) west of the capital. It was the site of six-day standoff
last month that ended when authorities forcibly drove her back to
her Yangon home. She was suffering from dehydration and fever.
	   A government statement faxed to The Associated Press in Bangkok,
Thailand, said that an ambulance had been placed on standby in case
Suu Kyi or 75-year-old Hla Pe, a member of the party's central
executive committee, or their two drivers fell ill.
	   ``There are not many ambulances in Yangon, however, and the
government hopes that Ms. Suu Kyi and her companions will return
home soon so that ambulance and medical staff may be put back to
use helping the truly needy,'' the statement said.
	   Security has reportedly been tight around the area. The
government claimed Friday that ``recent threats of violence have
raised security concerns, making travel there by prominent persons
unadvisable at this time.''
	   The statement noted that Suu Kyi was the daughter of
independence hero Aung San, who was assassinated shortly after
Myanmar was freed from British colonial rule in 1948.
	   Suu Kyi has been battling for more democracy since 1988, when
she rose to prominence during a nationwide uprising against
military rule that was eventually crushed. An estimated 3,000
people died.
	   But her political activities are severely curtailed by the
military, which has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
She has been allowed outside the capital once since her release
from six years of house arrest in 1995, to visit a Buddhist monk.
	   Suu Kyi's latest attempted foray into the provinces appears
intended to raise international pressure _ one of the few tools
available to her _ on the government ahead of an Aug. 21 deadline
she has set for parliament to be convened.
	   Elections allowed in 1990 were overwhelmingly won by the
opposition, but the military never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   Suu Kyi has prepared for a long standoff, traveling in a van
this time instead of the sedan she used last month. Her party has
expressed fears that the small wooden bridge where it has been
moved could collapse under its weight.
	   The government said that Suu Kyi and her companions ``continue
to rest in a camping vehicle.''
	   ``In order to provide for their comfort and welfare, government
officials have provided a beach umbrella, some garden chairs and a
selection of journals to help Ms. Suu Kyi pass the time,'' the
statement said.
	   It did not say whether Suu Kyi was availing herself of the
amenities. A government spokesman Thursday that Suu Kyi refused to
speak to authorities and the windows of the van were kept rolled
up.

South Korean President outlines ``nation building'' program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae Jung is calling for
``daring reform and a new beginning'' in a new program to lift
South Korea out of its economic doldrums and assure its progress in
the coming century.
	   In a speech prepared for delivery Saturday on the 50th
anniversary of the founding of South Korea's government, Kim said
he would embark on a ``second nation building'' rivaling South
Korea's emergence from the ashes of the Korean War in the early
1950s to become a leading industrial power.
	   ``The second nation building represents our historic decision to
save our nation from crisis and develop it anew,'' Kim said.
	   To that end, he called for:
	   _Decentralizing government to place more responsibility for
administration, finance, education and public security in the hands
of local authorities, and a German-style system of proportional
representation in the national legislature.
	   _Elimination of government controls on the economy and quick and
effective restructuring of the corporate, financial, labor and
public sectors.
	   _A greater opening of South Korea to the rest of the
international community, shedding the country's image as a closed
society.
	   _Restructuring the education system ``to phase out the current
inefficient practices in favor of a creative learning system'' that
would emphasize science and information technology.
	   _Creation of ``a constructive labor-management relationship''
that would ``put an end to the confrontation and animosity between
two major sectors in society.''
	   _A new relationship ``of exchanges and cooperation'' between
South and North Korea, ``overcoming the 50-year confrontation on
the Korean peninsula.''

Hong Kong index roars back, but gains could be short-lived
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hang Seng closing sharply higher; Nikkei close &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Halfway through one of its most miserable
months in recent memory, Hong Kong's main stock index roared back
Friday _ at least for a day.
	   After dropping 16 percent of its value and falling to a
five-year low in the first two weeks of August, the Hang Seng Index
posted a gain of 8.5 percent, jumping 564 points to close at
7,224.69.
	   Analysts weren't quite sure what happened, and questioned
whether it was more than a blip in the downward spiral that
continued to dominate much of Asia on Friday.
	   Besides regional worries, which now focus on Japan's weakness
and prospects for China and Hong Kong to devalue their currencies,
Asia's markets on Friday also were watching Russia's renewed
economic troubles.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei index fell sharply. Markets in Singapore and
Kuala Lumpur were suffering further from what traders said was an
overall meltdown in confidence.
	   Traders in Hong Kong said it appeared that a few buyers had
moved into the market to buy up blue-chips and suggested they were
trying to cover short positions.
	   Short-selling is essentially a bet that the market will drop. An
investor borrows stocks and sells them, betting he can buy them
back at a lower price, repay the lender and pocket a profit.
	   However, short-sellers may be burned badly if they bet wrong,
and analysts said Friday's buying may have been in order to cover
short-selling before a long holiday weekend.
	   Analysts said none of the market's fundamentals had changed, and
they weren't sure who was doing the buying. Steve Chiu, a trader at
Sassoon Securities, said it appeared the market's sudden move
upward was temporary.
	   ``The market as a whole was very short,'' said Gilbert Wong,
managing director at BNP Prime Peregrine Securities. He reported a
wave ``of panic short-covering.''
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei index closed down 258 points to 15,123.93,
a drop of 1.7 percent. There was no dramatic movement in the yen,
which has been under severe selling pressure.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Industrial Index, already at a
10-year low, fell another 1 percent in early trading. The Kuala
Lumpur Composite Index was down 3.3 percent in early trading.
Southeast Asian currencies were mixed.

Swiss insurer reaches agreement in U.S. on approach to wartime
</HEADLINE>
policies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A leading Swiss insurer said Friday
it has reached an agreement with U.S. insurance commissioners to
resolve unclaimed Holocaust-era policies.
	   The memorandum of understanding calls for the creation of an
international commission which will develop a common process to be
followed by European insurance companies that sign up, Zurich
Insurance Co. said in a statement.
	   It ``anticipates that issues brought before the international
commission will be resolved within two years,'' the company said.
	   On Wednesday, Switzerland's two biggest commercial banks agreed
to pay dlrs 1.25 billion in an out-of-court settlement with
Holocaust survivors.
	   The settlement involved the release of all claims not only
against the two banks, but also against the Swiss government, the
central bank and Swiss industry.
	   But insurance companies, involved in their own negotiations,
were excluded.
	   Zurich is one of four European insurance companies that in April
reached agreement with California Insurance Commissioner Chuck
Quackenbush and New York State Insurance Commissioner Neil D. Levin
to form an international commission to pay insurance claims.
	   Zurich chairman Rolf Hueppi said the company had ``agreed to
serve as a catalyst in order to help fashion a speedy and just
resolution process'' with the latest agreement.
	   ``The U.S. insurance commissioners expect that over the next few
weeks other European insurance companies will join this effort for
a rapid resolution,'' Friday's statement said.
	   Also in April, Zurich set up its own ``international commission
of eminent persons'' to review disputed life insurance claims
arising from the Holocaust era.
	   Last week, it launched a U.S. advertising campaign to locate
Holocaust survivors and heirs who could be beneficiaries of its
life insurance policies.

Yeltsin calls for emergency parliament session on economy
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin called on
parliament Friday to convene an emergency session to respond to
Russia's unfolding economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin insisted, however, that the economy remained stable,
that the ruble would not be devalued, and said there was no need to
interrupt his month-long vacation to take charge of the situation.
	   ``At this moment, there is no need for that,'' Yeltsin told
reporters upon arrival at this ancient Russian capital north of
Moscow. ``Moreover, when the president rushes to the Kremlin,
everybody thinks that something is wrong.''
	   The Russian stock market opened tentatively higher Friday,
boosted in part by the hope that the United States was patching
together a plan to augment the recent financial bailout announced
by international lenders.
	   ``There's a bit of short-covering and all kinds of rumors flying
around about aid coming to Russia,'' said Dmitry Kryukov, a trader
at the MFK Renaissance investment bank in Moscow. ``This is a
bounce, but I don't think this bounce will live long. I would not
buy into this strength.''
	   Deputies from the Group of Seven industrialized nations held a
conference call Thursday to discuss Russia's deteriorating economic
situation. Officials declined to say what further measures might be
taken.
	   Trade on the ruble was almost nonexistent, with banks fearful of
trading with each other. There have been growing concerns about the
stability of some Russian banks. While no defaults have been
reported, the Central Bank said Thursday that it was looking into
particular problems with two major banks, SBS Agro and Inkombank.
	   Yeltsin flew by helicopter to Novgorod from a resort in the wild
Valdai region. He was there to issue an edict restoring the old
name of Novgorod Veliky, or Novgorod the Great, in honor of the
city's 1,140th anniversary next year.
	   Despite having been on vacation since mid-July, the 67-year-old
president had bags under his eyes and his face appeared puffy. He
walked slowly and seemed to have difficulty understanding
reporters' questions about the economic crisis.
	   In recent days, the Russian stock market has accelerated its
slide and the ruble has come under intense pressure, prompting
fears of a devaluation.
	   ``No, we are not going to devalue the ruble,'' Yeltsin insisted,
adding that he thought the government had the economic situation
under control.
	   Upon arrival, Yeltsin said he saw no need for a special session
of the Duma to consider the remainder of the government's economic
austerity plan.
	   ``I'm not considering this possibility for the moment, as there
is no need,'' Yeltsin said. ``I do not exclude it in the future.''
	   Within an hour, however, he had apparently changed his mind. As
Yeltsin arrived for a tour of a meat factory, his press secretary,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said Yeltsin had signed a decree calling on
the Duma to meet.
	   It wasn't clear whether the decree invoked Yeltsin's
constitutional right to mandate a Duma meeting, or whether he was
merely requesting it.
	   The Duma has passed some portions of the government's austerity
plan, which was demanded by international lenders, but recessed for
the summer without passing all of it.
	   Duma leaders had been balking at calling a special session to
reconsider the plan in light of the latest crisis, and there had
been calls for Yeltsin to exercise his constitutional power to call
a session.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Zyuganov met Thursday with Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko, and said afterward that he would consider calling
a special session.

Singapore newspaper castigates poor toilet practices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's leading daily newspaper had a stern
message Friday for public toilet users: don't stand on the seats,
don't forget to flush, and please watch your aim.
	   The story about sloppy restroom habits came during Singapore's
annual Clean Public Toilets Campaign, which was launched late last
month to encourage sanitary practices.
	   The Straits Times hammered home the point with a story
identifying six types of uncivil lavatory behavior, including
standing on the seat, parents helping their infants urinate in wash
basins _ and poor aim.
	   ``Some bad aimers are notoriously nonchalant about their lack of
accuracy and think nothing about spraying urine all over the toilet
floor. Give such people a wide berth,'' cautioned the newspaper.
	   There are fines in Singapore for those who don't flush public
toilets after using them, though in practice few people are ever
caught or punished for what is a common transgression.
	   As in past years, the government is running a contest for the
cleanest public toilet island-wide, and has set up a hot line to
take nominations.
	   Singapore is fond of public awareness drives to instill approved
values and behavior among its 3.1 million citizens.
	   Campaigns over the years have focused on saving water, the evils
of drugs, speaking Mandarin instead of Chinese dialects, being more
punctual, more courteous, and exercising more.

Hong Kong's Chan reassures on currency stability
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REMOVES extraneous word `the' in lead.
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hong Kong's chief secretary gave strong
assurances Friday that despite market pressure the Chinese currency
will not be devalued and the Hong Kong dollar will remain tied to
its U.S. counterpart.
	   ``In the face of the regional currency devaluations, many have
questioned whether we can maintain the Hong Kong-U.S. dollar
link,'' Anson Chan said in a speech to the Singapore International
Chamber of Commerce.
	   ``Our argument remains _ we cannot afford to lose the link,''
she said, comparing the cutting of that link to the severing of a
lifeline for the region.
	   Many are also worried that China will devalue the yuan _ also
known as the renminbi _ to remain competitive in trade with its
neighbors. But Chan referred to statements by Chinese leaders that
devaluation is not necessary.
	   ``I think that the leaders are fairly committed to defending the
renminbi,'' she told reporters afterward. ``It will not be devalued
because it is not in China's national interest to do so.
	   A move to either devalue the yuan or cut the link with the U.S.
dollar could set off a string of currency devaluations around the
region similar to the ones last year that led to Asia's current
financial crisis.
	   Chan said recovery for Asia is two or three years away because
some of the ``stronger regional economies, such as ours, are
slipping into recession,'' adding that Hong Kong's unemployment
rate could rise from the current 4.1 percent when new figures come
out next week.
	   She also warned against deflationary pressures in Japan, which
``could not only lengthen recovery in Asia, but derail it
altogether.''

Police intervention threatened in Hyundai dispute

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The government on Friday gave Hyundai
Motor Co. workers until next week to end their month-long strike or
be forced from the company's plants.
	   The nation's largest automaker has been idle since July 20 when
thousands of workers began picketing the company's main plants in
Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul, to protest
rising layoffs.
	   The government's ultimatum was issued after senior security
officials met behind closed doors to discuss the dispute, which
they said was hurting South Korea's troubled economy.
	   Almost simultaneously, Hyundai's management announced an
indefinite shutdown of its main plants _ a move seen as signaling a
government intervention.
	   Tension grew around Hyundai's car plants in Ulsan as thousands
of riot police were deployed. Workers prepared for a police raid by
erecting more barricades, news reports said.
	   ``We can not let this illegal work stoppage drag down the
economy forever,'' said Kim Soo-min, a senior prosecutor in charge
of public security. ``A police raid is inevitable.''
	   Authorities have ruled the strike illegal, noting that the union
did not seek mandatory government mediation.
	   Kim refused to give a target date for a raid. To ``minimize
violence,'' he said, the government needed time to remove flammable
materials and other dangerous items from the grounds of the plants
and persuade elderly workers to move out.
	   Union leaders said they were ``prepared for the worst.'' About a
dozen Hyundai union leaders barricaded themselves atop an elevated
platform set up inside the plants' grounds.
	   Hyundai's union is known for its militancy. Previous police
intervention in Hyundai's disputes resulted in violent clashes with
workers.
	   The Korea Confederation of Trade Unions, an umbrella group which
claims 500,000 members in key industries, has already warned that
police intervention in the Hyundai dispute will result in violent
clashes and more strikes.
	   Hyundai's 26,000 unionized workers want the company to take back
1,600 workers it fired July 31 because of sharply falling domestic
sales.
	   Hyundai, which earlier got rid of 6,100 workers by offering them
enhanced early retirement packages, insists it has to reduce its
work force in line with slumping demand for its cars.
	   With inventories empty and lost exports costing millions of
dollars a day, Hyundai has tried but failed to restart its plants
since Monday.
	   As of Friday, Hyundai said the strike had cost it dlrs 573
million in lost production. Nearly 75 percent of that amount would
have come from exports, it said.
	   Hyundai Motor, a subsidiary of Hyundai group, South Korea's
second largest conglomerate, has been operating at 40 percent of
its annual capacity of 1.25 million cars.

Israeli jets raid Palestinian guerrilla base in Bekaa Valley
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes on Friday bombed a base
used by a radical Palestinian group in the eastern Bekaa Valley,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   There were no reports of casualties in the 1:10 a.m. (2210gmt
Thursday) raid on a base of the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
	   A statement from the group said two jets fired two rockets at a
base causing damage but no casualties. It described the site as a
``logistics post,'' but didn't elaborate.
	   Two hours earlier, Israeli jets hit trails used by guerrillas
from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in southern
Lebanon.
	   That raid was in retaliation for a Hezbollah ambush on an
Israeli patrol near the village of Sojod. Hezbollah claimed an
armored vehicle was hit.
	   The Israeli army radio reported both air raids but said nothing
of the ambush.
	   Hezbollah has led a guerrilla war to try to oust some 1,500
Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied members of the South Lebanon Army
militia from southern Lebanon. The troops maintain a ``security
zone'' set up by Israel in 1986 to protect its northern settlements
from guerrilla attacks.

Romanians chew over prime minister's teeth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALISON MUTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ When Prime Minister Radu Vasile snuck
off for three days during an official visit to Israel to get his
teeth fixed, it set tongues wagging.
	   After an intensive four-day visit where he met his counterpart
Benjamin Netanyahu, toured a helicopter factory and greeted
thousands of Romanian construction workers in Israel, Vasile
vanished from the public spotlight.
	   Where could the prime minister be? Basking in the sun on some
Mediterranean beach? Mediating in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?
Or had he thrown in the towel on Romania's economic and political
woes?
	   When he returned, the buzz was about his dental implants - a
reported 16 of them. It sparked a discussion about politicians
wanting to bite off a bigger slice of the pie.
	   ``I wouldn't invest a nickel tooth in the prime minister's
mouth,'' wrote poet Mircea Dinescu. ``But lomerciful people in
Israel have buried 50,000 dollars under Radu Vasile's moustache. A
brand-new Mercedes.''
	   Premier's counsellor Petrisor Peiu denied Vasile had spent the
dlrs 50,000 reported widely in the media. Peiu said Vasile had gone
to an Israeli dentist friend and had parted with just dlrs 2,000
for fairly minor dental work.
	   Whatever the facts, the story touches a nerve when Romanians
believe those in office are pampering themselves or want to move
above their station. For pampering, read dental treatment or any
minor surgery. Former President Ion Iliescu was also ridiculed when
he went to the dentist and later removed a facial mole. It was seen
as vanity, a sign of feminine weakness, not seemly in a male Balkan
leader.
	   ``When you get into office, there is this belief that we are all
mortals, but some of the chosen among the chosen ones are an
exception to this,''wrote Tudor Octavian in humorous weekly
Catavencu
	   ``Your children have to study in the West, the wife has to get
her clothes from Paris and caries have to be taken care with
dollars,'' he wrote.
	   Like many Romanians, Vasile's teeth were not his strong point. A
smoker, his teeth were mostly hidden by a bushy mustache. When he
opened his mouth, he revealed nicotine-stained incisors.
	   After he became premier, Vasile worked on his appearance -
taming his wild mane, removing a heavy gold signet ring and
dressing with an Italian feel.
	   In Romania, the dentist is the last resort - you go there when
your teeth keep you awake at night.t people don't have dental
records and have a horror of the dentist's chair.
	   As Romanians ape Western habits, attitudes are changing.
Newscasters have dazzling smiles and a few German and American-run
dentists have opened, offering flossing and mouthwash, at a Western
price.

Indonesia's Habibie honors wife, brother, ministers, Muslim leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with more details of recipients

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie on Friday
awarded medals of honor to his wife and brother, the top military
commander and senior Cabinet ministers to celebrate Indonesia's 53
years of independence.
	   Medals were awarded to 38 people, including two prominent Muslim
leaders as well as some former and current Habibie aides, officials
at the presidential palace said.
	   National independence day falls on Monday.
	   It was the first time that Habibie has bestowed the awards for
service to the nation since he replaced former President Suharto
after riots and protests in May.
	   Since taking office, Habibie has promised to introduce
democratic reform and to end corruption and nepotism that permeated
Suharto's 32-year-old regime.
	   Among those honored were Habibie's wife Hasri Ainun Besari
Habibie and his younger brother Junus Effendy Habibie, a former
ambassador and the ex-head of the Batam Island industrial
development project near Singapore.
	   Six serving Cabinet ministers were also honored as the nation
grapples with its worst economic crisis in 30 years amid fears of
potential civil unrest.
	   They included military chief Gen. Wiranto, who is also defense
minister, and Economics Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita.
	   Wiranto has been instrumental in his support for Habibie's
presidency in recent months. The military has stepped up security
in Jakarta and other cities because of rumors of possible rioting
on Monday.
	   Ginandjar has been a principal player in negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund for a dlrs 43 billion economic rescue
package.
	   Abdurrahman Wahid and Amien Rais, who each head the country's
two largest Muslim organizations, were named in the honor list, but
neither attended the award ceremony at the state palace.
	   Both were critics of Suharto and have also called on Habibie to
accelerate political reform. Rais has indicated that he wants to
run for president next year.
	   Among others honored Friday was Muhammad Sanusi Sierad, an
ex-Cabinet minister and dissident who served nine and a half years
in prison during Suharto's reign.

Foreign activists relaxed as Myanmar puts them on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with witnesses testifying, no
defense lawyers, unknown how long trial will last, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Eighteen foreign activists arrested last
week for handing out pro-democracy leaflets were put on trial
Friday by Myanmar's military government in a courtroom outside the
walls of a notorious prison.
	   The six Americans, three Malaysians, three Indonesians, three
Thais, two Filipinos and one Australian were charged after six days
of questioning and investigation with violating the 1950 Emergency
Provision Act.
	   The sweeping law allows authorities to hand out maximum 20-year
jail sentences for attempting to incite unrest or disrupt the peace
and stability of the state.
	   The defendants appeared relaxed as prosecutors presented four
witnesses _ a hotel maid and security guard and two Special Branch
policemen _ before a one-hour lunch break. They whispered to each
other and drank water from bottles.
	   Various diplomats asked to consult with the defendants during
the break, but were denied permission. A single judge, Khang Gyi,
presided. There was no jury. The trial was open to diplomats and
journalists.
	   ``The trial could be finished today if they don't raise any
questions,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The legal procedure would apparently allow the defendants to
wait for the prosecution to finish its case. They would then enter
their plea and could demand a lawyer.
	   The courtroom was a concrete building outside the walls of
Insein Prison, where hundreds of political prisoners are kept along
with violent criminals.
	   A diplomat who visited the American activists Thursday said
embassies were not informed of the trial until Friday morning.
	   ``I hope they will be treated leniently,'' said U.S. Charge
d'Affaires Kent Wiedemann as he entered the courtroom.
	   In Bangkok, Thailand, weeping and angry relatives appealed at a
news conference for their release.
	   They were joined by a U.S. congressman, Rep. Chris Smith,
chairman of the House International Operations and Human Rights
subcommittee, who accused the government of committing a ``public
relations disaster.''
	   Smith, a New Jersey Republican who has a constituent, Michele
Keegan, 19, among the detainees described them ``idealistic,
empathetic and caring about democracy.''
	   Smith said it would be ``premature'' to discuss new U.S.
sanctions against Myanmar but ``right now, there's an opportunity,
a small window, to release these people.''
	   The activists were detained Sunday, the day after the 10th
anniversary of a failed nationwide democracy uprising, for handing
out small cards to Myanmar citizens telling them the outside world
supported their struggle and to not give up.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. More than 3,000 demonstrators were
gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   The 18 foreign activists have been kept at a police guest house
in the capital. Diplomats who have visited them have described them
as cheerful, well-fed and treated humanely.
	   The government issued a statement this week saying their release
had been delayed because they were being uncooperative.
	   The military is attempting to find a way to discourage foreign
activists from entering Myanmar and inciting revolt, while at the
same time avoiding repercussions from the governments of countries
from which the activists come.
	   Earlier this year, the military government sentenced a
British-Australian national, James Mawdsley, to five years in
prison for handing out pro-democracy leaflets. He was released
after three months.
	   Mawdsley had been detained in 1997 for a similar action, but was
deported with just a warning not to return. His trial was the first
open to some members of the public in decades and he was
represented by a lawyer.
	   Myanmar citizens put on trial rarely ever receive an attorney to
defend them, democracy and human rights activists have said.
	   Trials usually consist of reading out the charges and sentencing
the accused, they say. Most trials take less than an hour.
	   Political prisoners are frequently subjected to torture and kept
in solitary confinement or cells meant for military dogs, human
rights groups and former prisoners say.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The government on Friday gave Hyundai
Motor Co. workers until next week to end their month-long strike or
be forcibly removed from the company's plants.
	   The nation's largest automaker has been idle since July 20 when
thousands of workers began picketing the company's main plants in
Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul, to protest
rising layoffs.
	   The government's ultimatum was issued after senior security
officials met behind closed doors to discuss the dispute, which
they said was negatively affecting South Korea's troubled economy.
	   Almost simultaneously, Hyundai's management announced an
indefinite shutdown of its main plants _ a move seen as signaling a
government intervention.
	   Tension grew around Hyundai's car plants in Ulsan as thousands
of riot police were deployed. Workers prepared for a police raid by
erecting more barricades, news reports said.
	   ``We can not let this illegal work stoppage drag down the

	   Authorities have ruled the strike illegal, noting that the union

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hong Kong's chief secretary gave strong
assurances Friday that the despite market pressure the Chinese
currency will not be devalued and the Hong Kong dollar will remain
tied to its U.S. counterpart.
	   ``In the face of the regional currency devaluations, many have
questioned whether we can maintain the Hong Kong-U.S. dollar
link,'' Anson Chan said in a speech to the Singapore International
Chamber of Commerce.
	   ``Our argument remains _ we cannot afford to lose the link,''
she said, comparing the cutting of that link to the severing of a
lifeline for the region.
	   Many are also worried that China will devalue the yuan _ also
known as the renminbi _ to remain competitive in trade with its
neighbors. But Chan referred to statements by Chinese leaders that
devaluation is not necessary.
	   ``I think that the leaders are fairly committed to defending the
renminbi,'' she told reporters afterward. ``It will not be devalued
because it is not in China's national interest to do so.
	   A move to either devalue the yuan or cut the link with the U.S.
dollar could set off a string of currency devaluations around the
region similar to the ones last year that led to Asia's current
financial crisis.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A slump in consumer spending drove down sales at
Tokyo department stores for a third straight month in July, an
industry association said Friday.
	   Sales at Tokyo-area department stores totaled 221.7 billion yen
(dlrs 1.5 billion) in July, down 5 percent from the same month a
year earlier, the Japan Department Stores Association said.
	   The association said sales have dropped 15 of the last 16
months, following an increase in the national sales tax in April
1997 that many economists blame for helping send Japan into
recession.
	   Sales of clothing, which account for one-third of all department
store sales, fell 2.5 percent to 80.6 billion yen (dlrs 555
million).
	   The association's survey is based on data from 32 Tokyo-area
stores.
	    &UR; ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's banking crisis helped drive the number of
corporate bankruptcies in July to its highest level since the end
of World War II, a private credit research agency said Friday.
	   Bankruptcies rose 35.7 percent from the same month last year to
1,710, the highest number recorded for any month of July during the
post-war period, Teikoku Databank Ltd. said.
	   The number of companies going out of business has risen at a
rate of greater than 20 percent per month for the past eight
months, the Tokyo-based agency said.
	   It said the pace is expected to continue.
	   Teikoku Databank cited the nation's banking crisis as the single
biggest cause behind the rise. Japan's banks have triggered a
credit crunch as they've diverted funds to writing off some 76.7
trillion yen (dlrs 530 billion) in bad loans.
	   The total debts left behind by the companies that folded in July
fell 16.8 percent from a year earlier to 906 billion yen (dlrs 6.2
billion), it said.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's National Logistics Agency
will stop importing wheat in October after the government ends its
subsidy on the commodity, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   ``In October we will leave the wheat business, and private
companies will have to take over our job,'' said agency chairman
Beddu Amang as quoted by the Jakarta Post.
	   He said the agency, known as Bulog, wouldn't lobby for an
extension of the subsidy beyond the October deadline demanded under
an economic bailout and reform package with the International
Monetary Fund.
	   The IMF has set Indonesia a list of tough economic reforms to
implement in exchange for billions of dollars in aid and loans.
	   Indonesia is currently battling its worst economic crisis in a
generation.
	   Food prices have soared along with inflation and mass
unemployment and there have been reports of some food shortages.
	   Beddu said Bulog will concentrate on importing rice and sugar.
	   He added that Bulog plans to purchase 700,000 tons of wheat next
month to cover the country's consumption for two to three months.
He estimates Indonesia will import 4.25 million tons of wheat in
the fiscal year ending March 31.
	   Bulog lost its monopoly to import and distribute all commodities
other than rice under the IMF bailout package, but under a revision
in June the subsidies were extended in an attempt to lessen the
impact of the worsening economic crisis.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Facing weak demand in key Asian and Western
markets, Japan's automakers are boosting exports to Latin America
and the Middle East, an industry group said Friday.
	   Automakers shipped 256,000 cars to Central and South America in
the first six months of 1998, up 30 percent from the same period
last year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
	   That's the most cars Japan has ever exported to the region, the
association said.
	   Exports to the Middle East were also robust, reaching a
five-year high. Japanese automakers shipped 180,000 cars to the
region for an increase of 20.5 percent, it said.
	   Most of the gains came in sales of smaller models. Exports to
Latin America of Honda Motor Corp.'s small-sized Civic surged 70
percent in the first six months, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said
Friday.
	   The gains come as a severe economic crisis has slashed demand by
more than half _ from 315,000 cars exported to 141,000 _ in Asia,
the region Japanese automakers had seen as their key growth market,
the association said.
	   Exports to the United States and Europe have also stalled as
Japanese automakers produce more cars locally to avoid trade
friction, it said. Domestic sales have been hurt by a long economic
slump.
	    &UR; ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines posted its first
trade surplus in nearly a decade in June as slowing economic growth
and a weaker peso dragged down imports.
	   June's dlrs 130 million trade surplus was a dramatic turnaround
from the dlrs 903 million deficit registered a year earlier.
	   For the first six months of the year, the trade deficit narrowed
to dlrs 1.4 billion from dlrs 5.6 billion in the year-earlier
period, according to figures released Friday by the government.
	   Exports for the six-month period rose 18.8 percent to dlrs 13.90
billion while imports increased 11.3 percent to dlrs 15.37 billion.
	   The Philippines last turned a trade surplus in December 1988.
The surplus then was dlrs 80 million.
	   For June alone, exports rose 12.3 percent to dlrs 2.39 billion
while imports dove 25.3 percent to dlrs 2.26 billion.
	   In a sign of slowing economic growth, imports of industrial
machines and equipment fell 37.8 percent to dlrs 146.95 million.
	   Economists expect the trade deficit will narrow further as
imports continue to contract because of the slowdown in economic
activity, caused by the regional financial crisis and a drought
attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon.

<TEXT>
	   KARUIZAWA, Japan (AP) _ Kaori Harada and Kyoko Ono shot
6-under-par 66s Friday to share a one-stroke lead in the opening
round of the 60 million yen (dlrs 414,000) NEC Karuizawa 72.
	   Harada, seeking her third victory this season and eighth
overall, birdied the final two holes in a round of eight birdies
and two bogeys.
	   Ono, a non-winner in three years as a pro, sank six birdies,
including three straight from No. 13, in a bogey-free trek over the
6,483-yard (5,900-meter), par-72 Karuizawa 72 Golf Club North
Course.
	   Defending champion Yuka Irie and Mikino Kubo were one shot back
at 67, followed by Tomiko Ikebuchi and Harumi Sakagami who were
tied for fifth at 68.
	   Akiko Fukushima, the Japan tour's best player in the last two
years, South Korean Ku Ok-hee and Taiwan's Li Wen-lin were in a
group of 12 sharing 11th at 70.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With rebel forces driving toward Kinshasa
from the west, a jittery Congolese capital awoke Friday literally
in the dark without electricity, radio, television or newspapers.
	   President Laurent Kabila's whereabouts were unknown Friday amid
widespread rumors he had fled the city. Several senior government
advisers contacted by The Associated Press said they did not know
where Kabila was.
	   The city was bracing for what many believe will be the imminent
arrival of rebel forces that launched a rebellion against Kabila
earlier this month.
	   Rumors and gossip fueled an uneasy sense of muffled panic as
many people tried to go about their business despite the power cut.
	   ``This is the end,'' said Jean-Pierre Mwenge, standing amid a
crowd of people searching for transport to leave the city. ``Now
I'm alone and this will be the end.''
	   Asked where he would go, Mwenge just shrugged.
	   The United States was preparing emergency evacuation plans for
its citizens, while foreign airlines have stopped service to
Kinshasa in the wake of the escalating crisis in Congo's troubled
capital.
	   A primary exit route across the Congo River to Brazzaville, the
capital of neighboring Republic of Congo, was closed days ago with
all traffic across the water stopped and port facilities shut.
	   In a stunning move, the rebels, led by Tutsi and Rwandan
fighters and disenchanted members of Kabila's military, quickly
captured key towns in the east and west and have since been pushing
close to Kinshasa.
	   Western diplomats and rebel spokesmen on Thursday said the
insurgent forces had captured the town of Inga, about 200
kilometers (135 miles) from the capital, where the primary power
transformer for Kinshasa is located.
	   The rebels also said some of their troops had advanced as far as
Kasangalu, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   In Kinshasa, a power outage throughout the capital cut off water
supplies to most homes with the city's main water authority
crippled without electricity.
	   Groups of women, working in packs, trod back and forth to the
shores of the Congo River to fill basins with brown, polluted water
for their families.
	   The power has also cut off state-controlled television and
radio. No newspapers were published Friday.
	   Rebel leaders in Goma said Kinshasa was now in their sights.
	   ``The objective is Kinshasa. It should fall in the next few
days, by the end of the week or by the end of the month for sure,''
rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said Thursday in the eastern
city of Goma.
	   In the United States, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said two
Marine amphibious warships had been dispatched to the Atlantic
waters off Congo in case they are needed to evacuate U.S. citizens
living there.
	   It will take nine or ten days for the ships to reach Congo,
Bacon said.
	   Kabila's propaganda campaign accusing neighboring Rwanda of
staging an invasion and orchestrating the rebel uprising was
abruptly cut off Thursday when power to the city was severed.
	   Rage and anger at Rwanda were giving way to fear, as many people
speculated over their fate.
	   ``It's time to pray now,'' said Amina Nzuze, a waitress. Her
restaurant, like many small businesses shut for fear of looting
during the dark of night.
	   Rumors of ethnic attacks by both sides only worsened the fear of
what will happen if and when the rebels arrive.
	   On Thursday, Congo and Rwanda accused each other of ethnic
attacks against Hutu and Tutsi civilians.
	   The Rwandan government called on international agencies to
intervene and save ethnic Tutsis it said were being persecuted by
Congolese authorities, state-run Radio Rwanda reported.
	   In Kinshasa, the human rights minister said Rwandan troops were
attacking ethnic Hutus living in eastern Congo.
	   Kabila's government denies it is persecuting Tutsis, but
authorities in the capital acknowledge a number of civilians have
been arrested on suspicion of complicity with the rebels.

Italian premier joins celebrations for Tour of France winner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CESENATICO, Italy (AP) _ Italian premier Romano Prodi, a
self-proclaimed cycling fan, was among 30,000 people who celebrated
Marco Pantani for his sensational double victory in the Tours of
Italy and France this year.
	   The huge crowd wildly applauded the Italian cyclist Thursday
night as he appeared on a platform, in a downtown square of
Cesenatico, wearing a yellow shirt and bandana.
	   Yellow is the color of the Tour of France leadership.
	   ``At these times, when people mostly talk of doping, everybody
like Pantani because he represents the model of the clean
sportsman,'' Prodi said during the celebration, as he embraced the
new Italian cycling idol.
	   The French cycling race, which ended earlier this month, was
plagued by a doping scandal while Italian judges are investigating
allegations that some Italian soccer stars may have used
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Pantani, who lives in this Adriatic sea resort, said he amazed
by the number of fans attending the ``Pantani Day.''
	   Meanwhile officials of Pantani's commercial team, Mercatone Uno,
announced the Tour of France winner will not start in the Spanish
Vuelta.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ In a show of unity and grief, Christian
and Muslim members of parliament laid a huge wreath of red and
white roses at the site of the embassy bombing on Friday.
	   American officials remain mum about possible culprits in last
week's deadly twin bombings at U.S. embassies in East Africa, but
Muslims claim investigators and the media are unfairly targeting
them.
	   With rescue operations wrapped up and the death toll apparently
fixed at 257, the focus Friday was on cleanup work and the all-out
push to learn who perpetrated the nearly simultaneous bombings in
Nairobi and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7.
	   The legislators sang ``We Shall Overcome'' and prayed for unity
and tolerance. Nearby, an FBI evidence response team labored over
debris with rakes, continuing their search for evidence.
	   In another sad pilgrimmage to the ruins, a group of Kenyan
women, each carrying a red or white rose and many weeping, offered
prayers for the dead at an ecumenical service.
	   ``Women in Pain,'' said a banner they carried.
	   The head of the Vatican missionary service, Cardinal Jozef
Tomko, also showed up Friday morning. Tomko is in Nairobi to ordain
two new bishops.
	   ``Who can approve of terrorism?'' he said after praying for the
dead and wounded. ``We must find another way of living together on
this earth. Look at it: It is so beautiful. Why this? Why?''
	   Friday's newspapers were filled with grief: Death notices for
bomb victims, with pictures of the deceased.
	   One showed a smiling young couple on their wedding day. Both
died in the blast. Another showed two sisters, ages 16 and 17.
	   The papers were also full of bitterness and anger at the United
States. Columns and letters to the editor complained that the
United States tried only to save its own citizens after the blast.
	   ``You could show us a little more sympathy, America,'' said one
headline in the East Africa Standard.

Philippine shares end higher on technical rebound; index up 2.7

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing higher; adds details throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks ended six sessions
of losses with a technical rebound Friday fueled by bargain-hunters
looking for oversold issues, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, was boosted by the higher Japanese yen and
the central bank's tight grip on domestic liquidity, dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 34.63 points,
or 2.7 percent, to 1,337.92, after slipping 4.01 points Thursday to
its lowest closing level in five and a half years.
	   The market indicator had shed a total of 221.46 points over the
previous six trading days.
	   Friday's rebound, though, was purely technical and may prove
short-lived, said Helen Alvarez, research head of All Asia Capital
Securities Management Corp.
	   She said shaky Asian economies and volatile regional currencies
are still putting pressure on the local stock market and clouding
its prospects.
	   Wall Street's sharp decline overnight weakened the market at the
opening, traders said. The Philippine trade report, which showed
the country posting a trade surplus of dlrs 130 million in June, a
first in nearly a decade, also hurt Manila stocks early in the
session.
	   Analysts said the surplus reflected the economic slowdown
plaguing the country as business establishments reduced imports of
capital equipment and raw materials to cut down on costs.
	   Bargain-hunting toward the end of Friday's session saved the
market from posting losses for the seventh straight day, dealers
said.
	   Gainers outpaced decliners 62 to 28, while 37 issues were
unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 43.199 pesos for the
day, down from 43.456 pesos on Thursday. The peso last traded at
its intraday high of 43.050 pesos.
	   Dealers said moderate gains in the yen provided the peso's main
support, followed by the central bank's maintenance of high
overnight interest rates.
	   Earlier this week, the central bank raised its overnight
borrowing rate, its main tool to control domestic liquidity, by 5
percentage points to curb speculation on the peso.
	   Traders said the move has been effective.
	   On Monday, the dollar climbed to an intraday high of 44.790
pesos on heavy speculative dollar buying.

	   The rebels also said some of their troops had advanced as far as
Kasangalu, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   In Kinshasa, a power outage throughout the capital cut off water
supplies to most homes with the city's main water authority
crippled without electricity.
	   Groups of women, working in packs, trod back and forth to the
shores of the Congo River to fill basins with brown, polluted water
for their families.
	   The power has also cut off state-controlled television and
radio. No newspapers were published Friday.
	   Rebel leaders in Goma said Kinshasa was now in their sights.
	   ``The objective is Kinshasa. It should fall in the next few
days, by the end of the week or by the end of the month for sure,''
rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said Thursday in the eastern
city of Goma.
	   In the United States, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said two
Marine amphibious warships had been dispatched to the Atlantic
waters off Congo in case they are needed to evacuate U.S. citizens
living there.
	   It will take nine or ten days for the ships to reach Congo,
Bacon said.
	   Kabila's propaganda campaign accusing neighboring Rwanda of
staging an invasion and orchestrating the rebel uprising was
abruptly cut off Thursday when power to the city was severed.
	   Rage and anger at Rwanda were giving way to fear, as many people
speculated over their fate.
	   ``It's time to pray now,'' said Amina Nzuze, a waitress. Her
restaurant, like many small businesses shut for fear of looting
during the dark of night.
	   Rumors of ethnic attacks by both sides only worsened the fear of
what will happen if and when the rebels arrive.
	   On Thursday, Congo and Rwanda accused each other of ethnic
attacks against Hutu and Tutsi civilians.
	   The Rwandan government called on international agencies to
intervene and save ethnic Tutsis it said were being persecuted by
Congolese authorities, state-run Radio Rwanda reported.
	   In Kinshasa, the human rights minister said Rwandan troops were
attacking ethnic Hutus living in eastern Congo.
	   Kabila's government denies it is persecuting Tutsis, but
authorities in the capital acknowledge a number of civilians have
been arrested on suspicion of complicity with the rebels.

Government puts ambulance on standby for pro-democracy leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that Suu Kyi has in past refused medical treatment from
government, grafs 4-5

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime said Friday
that an ambulance is on standby at a roadblock where Nobel Peace
Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi was in the third day of a new
standoff over her right to travel outside Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi's party, the opposition National League for Democracy,
has said the government will be responsible for her health if the
deadlock continues. She was stopped Tuesday as she attempted to
travel to Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Yangon, to
meet supporters.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, was stopped Tuesday at a checkpoint 32 kilometers
(19 miles) west of the capital, the same site as three previous
standoffs with the government during the past two months.
	   During an earlier six-day confrontation, Suu Kyi and her party
said they would not accept medical treatment from anyone except her
personal physicians. The government said it was providing her food
and water.
	   After it was over, Suu Kyi said the authorities had prevented
her from obtaining food and water and stopped her physician seeing
her because she attempted to bring her food. She ended up suffering
from a high fever and severe dehydration.
	   A government statement faxed to The Associated Press in Bangkok,
Thailand, said that an ambulance had been placed on standby in case
Suu Kyi or 75-year-old Hla Pe, a member of the party's central
executive committee, or their two drivers fell ill.
	   ``There are not many ambulances in Yangon, however, and the
government hopes that Ms. Suu Kyi and her companions will return
home soon so that ambulance and medical staff may be put back to
use helping the truly needy,'' the statement said.
	   Security has reportedly been tight around the area. The
government claimed Friday that ``recent threats of violence have
raised security concerns, making travel there by prominent persons
unadvisable at this time.''
	   Suu Kyi has been battling for more democracy since 1988, when
she rose to prominence during a nationwide uprising against
military rule that was eventually crushed. An estimated 3,000
people died.
	   But her political activities are severely curtailed by the
military, which has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
She has been allowed outside the capital once since her release
from six years of house arrest in 1995, to visit a Buddhist monk.
	   Suu Kyi's latest attempted foray into the provinces appears
intended to raise international pressure on the government ahead of
an Aug. 21 deadline she has set for parliament to be convened.
	   Elections allowed in 1990 were overwhelmingly won by the
opposition, but the military never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   Suu Kyi has prepared for a long standoff, traveling in a van
this time instead of the sedan she used last month. Her party has
expressed fears that the small wooden bridge where it has been
moved could collapse under its weight.
	   ``In order to provide for their comfort and welfare, government
officials have provided a beach umbrella, some garden chairs and a
selection of journals to help Ms. Suu Kyi pass the time,'' the
statement said.
	   A government spokesman Thursday that Suu Kyi refused to speak to
authorities and the windows of the van were kept rolled up.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila has fled his
embattled capital as rebel forces drive toward Kinshasa, a senior
government official said Friday.
	   ``The president is not in Kinshasa,'' the high level government
adviser told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. ``I
can't tell you any more than that.''
	   A western diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity
in Paris, said Kabila had gone to the southern city of Lubumbashi,
his former rebel base.
	   Asked if Kabila intended to return, the official would only say
``For that, we'll have to wait and see.''
	   With rebel forces driving toward Kinshasa from the west, the
jittery Congolese capital awoke Friday without electricity, radio,
television or newspapers and rumors their leader had fled.
	   The city was bracing for what many believe will be the imminent
arrival of rebel forces that launched a rebellion against Kabila
earlier this month. Rumors and gossip fueled an uneasy sense of
muffled panic as many people tried to go about their business
despite the power cut.
	   ``This is the end,'' said Jean-Pierre Mwenge, standing amid a
crowd of people searching for transport to leave the city. ``Now
I'm alone and this will be the end.''
	   Asked where he would go, Mwenge just shrugged.
	   The United States was preparing for the emergency evacuation
plans of its citizens, while foreign airlines have stopped service
to Kinshasa in the wake of the escalating crisis in Congo's
troubled capital.
	   A primary exit route across the Congo River to Brazzaville, the
capital of neighboring Republic of Congo, was closed days ago with
all traffic across the water stopped and port facilities shut.
	   In a stunning move, the rebels, led by Tutsi and Rwandan
fighters and disenchanted members of Kabila's military, quickly
captured key towns in the east and west.
	   The rebels also said some of their troops had advanced as far as
Kasangalu, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   Western diplomats and rebel spokesmen on Thursday said the
insurgent forces had captured the town of Inga, about 200
kilometers (135 miles) from the capital, where the primary power
transformer for Kinshasa is located.
	   The rebels were reportedly responsible for the power outage in
Kinshasa, which cut off water supplies to most homes because the
city's main water authority cannot operate without electricity.
	   Groups of women, working in packs, trod back and forth to the
shores of the Congo River to fill basins with brown, polluted water
for their families.
	   The power has also cut off state-controlled television and
radio. No newspapers were published Friday.
	   Rebel leaders in Goma said Kinshasa was now in their sights.
	   ``The objective is Kinshasa. It should fall in the next few

Hong Kong share prices surge

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices staged a dramatic turnaround
Friday, with the key index soaring 8.5 percent a day after it fell
to a new five-year low.
	   After shedding 16 percent of its value and falling to a
five-year low in the first two weeks of August, the Hang Seng Index
rose 564.27 points to close at 7,224.69. On Thursday, the index
slumped 199.06 points, or 2.9 percent.
	   Turnover amounted to 8.55 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.1 billion), up from Thursday's 5.14 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 658 million).
	   The surge took many traders by surprise after weeks of gloomy
predictions for the market.
	   Traders said it appeared that a few buyers had moved into the
market to buy up blue-chips and suggested they were trying to cover
short positions.
	   In a short-sale an investor an investor borrows stocks then
sells them, betting he can buy them back at a lower price, repay
the lender and pocket a profit.
	   There were also rumors that the Hong Kong government was
propping up the market by buying shares through the Land Fund,
which manages proceeds from government land sales and is allowed to
purchase shares.
	   Henry Lui, senior research analyst at Mansion House Securities
Ltd, described the rise as a ``technical rebound'' as the market
has been oversold.
	   Analysts said none of the market's fundamentals had changed, and
they weren't sure who was doing the buying. Steve Chiu, a trader at
Sassoon Securities, said it appeared the market's sudden move
upward was temporary.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong rose 3.15 Hong Kong dollars to
32.00, and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 2.40 dollars to 24.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 7.00 dollars to
158.00, and Hang Seng Bank rose 3.20 dollars to 40.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 3.90 dollars to 35.60, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 1.50 dollars to 21.50.

Negotiators in Kosovo face lack of support
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with influential ethnic Albanian
politician saying ``real'' talks still distant, Rugova calls for
halt to offensive, international protection of Kosovo, German
minister saying it's time to discuss NATO intervention; CHANGES

 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An influential ethnic Albanian
politician said Friday an international military intervention to
guarantee a cease-fire in Kosovo is necessary before ``real'' talks
on the province's future can start.
	   Mahmut Bakalli, a veteran politician in Kosovo who enjoys the
respect of U.S. and other Western officials, downplayed Thursday's
announcement of a new ethnic Albanian negotiating team for talks
with the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``I think we are no closer to real talks,'' Bakalli said. ``We
must first have a cease-fire on the ground and enable thousands of
refugees return to their homes.''
	   ``These two essential conditions cannot be fulfilled without a
direct international military and political intervention,'' he told
The Associated Press.
	   Bakalli was a member of pacifist Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova's negotiating team, which held several meetings with a
Serbian government delegation but walked out in May to protest a
Serb military offensive.
	   Asked when negotiations can be expected to start, Rugova told
reporter on Friday: ``First the (government) offensive must stop in
order to create a favorable atmosphere for the start of the
dialogue.''
	   He also said that the return of refugees to their homes must be
internationally monitored and appealed to the United States, the
United Nations, NATO and European Union for international
protection of Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, a republic that
dominates Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in
the province's population of 2 million. They want independence from
Serbia.
	   Rugova on Thursday announced a new team to resume talks with the
government. But he failed to win the backing of the underground
Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence of the embattled
province.
	   Representatives of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
were top meet Friday with the team to hammer out a platform for
negotiations.
	   Failure to obtain KLA support is a serious drawback because
sustained negotiations on the future of Kosovo are inconceivable
without a stable cease-fire. So is any peace settlement without the
rebel force's approval.
	   ``Only international factors, not Milosevic, can guarantee a
cease-fire in Kosovo,'' said Bakalli, calling for an
internationally-monitored ``peaceful transition phase in which
serious and effective talks can be held.''
	   In Germany, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said the time had come
for ``a serious discussion of an active intervention'' by NATO in
Kosovo.
	   ``We must now finally go on the offensive with the political
debate,'' Ruehe told Bild newspaper.
	   But U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who for weeks has been
struggling to persuade ethnic Albanian rebels and politicians to
stop squabbling and join forces, said the ongoing violence in
Kosovo made it imperative to start talks immediately _ with or
without the rebels.
	   The ethnic Albanians' five-member team comprises mainly
disciples of Rugova, who is supported by one branch of the KLA and
despised by others. Rugova, Hill and European diplomats hope the
rebels will join the talks when they see progress made.
	   The Serb-led government applauded Rugova's decision. So did
foreign powers.
	   Milosevic has offered to discuss restoring self-rule he revoked
from Kosovo in 1989. But it remains unclear what degree of autonomy
Milosevic is willing to grant the province, which Serbs consider
the medieval cradle of their national identity.

Sri Lanka sent into bat by South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Sri Lankan opener Sanath Jayasuriya
was ruled fit as South Africa won the toss and sent Sri Lanka into
bat in the first match of the limited-overs triangular series at
Trent Bridge Friday.
	   Jayasuriya, who was under an injury cloud on the eve of the
match, made himself available for the three-way limited overs
series opener after his condition improved dramatically overnight.
	   Sri Lanka also picked attacking batsman Mahela Jayawardena ahead
of the experienced left-hander Hashan Tillakaratne to bat at No.6.
	   Playing its first international in England since winning the
World Cup, Sri Lanka will field seven members of the team which
beat Australia in the final in 1996 to claim the world crown.
	   South Africa named a strong line-up with replacement batsman
Mike Rindel opening the innings along side Gary Kirsten and fast
bowler Allan Donald spearheading the attack with Shaun Pollock.
	   South Africa also named a spinner, with veteran spinner Pat
Symcox getting a call-up.
	   Teams:
	   South Africa: Gary Kirsten, Mike Rindel, Jacques Kallis, Daryll
Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Jonty Rhodes, Shaun Pollock,
Mark Boucher, Pat Symcox, Steve Elworthy and Allan Donald.
	   Twelfth man: Mornantau Hayward.
	   Sri Lanka: Sanath Jayasuriya, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Marvan

AFL-CIO calls for withdrawal of Cambodia's GSP trade rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The AFL-CIO, the biggest labor
federation in the United States, has asked the U.S. government to
withdraw Generalized System of Preferences trade privileges from
Cambodia because of ``systematic and severe labor rights abuses''
there.
	   The AFL-CIO filed a petition with the U.S. Trade Representative
in Washington D.C. asking that GSP benefits be removed until the
abuses are corrected, said a news release from the AFL-CIO's
American Center for International Labor Solidarity issued in
Bangkok on Friday.
	   Cambodia has both Most Favored Nation and GSP trade status,
which lower or eliminate tariffs on many Cambodian exports to the
United States.
	   GSP privileges are linked by law to a country having adequate
labor protection. Both sets of privileges come up for review
annually.
	   The complaint charges that the Cambodian government colludes
with factory owners to rig the elections of union officers and
operates a biased union registration process that favors the
creation of tame unions affiliated with the ruling Cambodian
People's Party of Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen.
	   It says there is also political interference in labor disputes,
intimidation of workers and unnecessary and burdensome procedures
to register unions.
	   The AFL-CIO issued the complaint because of the government's
``systematic effort to suppress free trade unions,'' said Philip
Robertson, an AFL-CIO representative in Bangkok.
	   ``Despite the passage of a labor code that meets international
standards, it's clear that the Cambodian government is still not at
all interested in guaranteeing basic worker rights,'' said the
AFL-CIO's statement.
	   ``In fact, in some cases, the very officials charged with
enforcing the law are the ones deliberately undermining it, working
hand-in-hand with labor fixers connected to elements of the
Cambodian People's Party.''
	   The trade privileges are crucial in helping Cambodia build up an
industrial base virtually from scratch after decades of war and the
genocidal regime of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979.
	   The textile industry is probably the biggest beneficiary of GSP
privileges. Cambodian garment workers are paid on average the
equivalent of dlrs 40 a month for a working week that can be seven
days long. Factories routinely fail to pay overtime or other
benefits.

German authorities block neo-Nazis from attending Hess march
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLENSBURG, Germany (AP) _ The German border patrol said Friday
it had stopped 29 suspected neo-Nazis this week from traveling to
Denmark, where a march marking the anniversary of the death of
Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess, is planned.
	   Border patrol spokesman Karsten Jargstorf said the 29 Germans
were believed to be headed for the Saturday march in Copenhagen.
	   They were prevented from leaving the country on suspicion that
they could damage Germany's image abroad, a charge allowed under
Germany's passport law, Jargstorf said.
	   He added Germany would continue its stepped up controls along
the Danish-German border regardless of whether Danish authorities
eventually ban the march, which is organized by the Danish Nazi
movement.
	   Past marches in Denmark to mark Hess' Aug. 17, 1987, prison
suicide have ended with violence.

Yeltsin calls for emergency parliament session on economy

<TEXT>
	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin called on
parliament Friday to convene an emergency session to respond to
Russia's unfolding economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin insisted, however, that the economy remained stable,
that the ruble would not be devalued, and said there was no need to
interrupt his month-long vacation to take charge of the situation.
	   ``At this moment, there is no need for that,'' Yeltsin told
reporters upon arrival at this ancient Russian capital north of
Moscow. ``Moreover, when the president rushes to the Kremlin,
everybody thinks that something is wrong.''
	   The speaker of the State Duma, the Communist-dominated lower
house of parliament, said lawmakers ``wouldn't mind'' holding the
emergency session that Yeltsin requested.
	   The Russian stock market opened tentatively higher Friday,
boosted in part by the hope that the United States was patching
together a plan to augment the recent financial bailout announced
by international lenders.
	   ``There's ... all kinds of rumors flying around about aid coming
to Russia,'' said Dmitry Kryukov, a trader at the MFK Renaissance
investment bank in Moscow. ``This is a bounce, but I don't think
this bounce will live long. I would not buy into this strength.''
	   Deputies from the Group of Seven industrialized nations held a
conference call Thursday to discuss Russia's deteriorating economic
situation. Officials declined to say what further measures might be
taken.
	   Trade on the ruble was almost nonexistent, with banks fearful of
trading with each other. There have been growing concerns about the
stability of some Russian banks. While no defaults have been
reported, the Central Bank said Thursday that it was looking into
particular problems with two major banks, SBS Agro and Inkombank.
	   At one SBS branch in Moscow, customers said they were allowed
only to withdraw money in rubles, even from accounts that were
established in U.S. dollars. Those who wanted dollars were told to
fill out a form and return in five days.
	   ``They say they will pay me, but I'm still not sure,'' said one
customer who only gave her first and middle names, Nina Sergeyevna.
	   Yeltsin flew by helicopter to Novgorod from a resort in the wild
Valdai region. He was there to issue an edict restoring the old
name of Novgorod Veliky, or Novgorod the Great, in honor of the
city's 1,140th anniversary next year.
	   Despite having been on vacation since mid-July, the 67-year-old
president had bags under his eyes and his face appeared puffy. He
walked slowly and seemed to have difficulty understanding
reporters' questions about the economic crisis.
	   In recent days, the Russian stock market has accelerated its
slide and the ruble has come under intense pressure, prompting
fears of a devaluation.
	   ``No, we are not going to devalue the ruble,'' Yeltsin insisted,
adding that he thought the government had the economic situation
under control.
	   Upon arrival, Yeltsin said he saw no need for a special session
of the Duma to consider the remainder of the government's economic
austerity plan.
	   ``I'm not considering this possibility for the moment, as there
is no need,'' Yeltsin said. ``I do not exclude it in the future.''
	   Within an hour, however, he had apparently changed his mind. As
Yeltsin arrived for a tour of a meat factory, his press secretary,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said Yeltsin had signed a decree calling on
the Duma to meet.
	   It appeared that the decree did not invoke Yeltsin's
constitutional right to mandate a Duma meeting, but merely
requested it.
	   The Duma has passed some portions of the government's austerity
plan, which was demanded by international lenders, but recessed for
the summer without passing all of it.
	   Duma leaders had been balking at calling a special session to
reconsider the plan in light of the latest crisis, and there had
been calls for Yeltsin to exercise his constitutional power to call
a session.
	   However, after both Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Yeltsin
pleaded for the session, Speaker Gennady Zyuganov said the Duma
probably would convene sometime before Sept. 1. ``We wouldn't
mind,'' he told reporters.

Italian premier joins celebrations for Tour of France winner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CESENATICO, Italy (AP) _ Italian premier Romano Prodi, a
self-proclaimed cycling fan, was among 30,000 people who
congratulated Marco Pantani for his sensational double victory in
the Tours of Italy and France this year.
	   The huge crowd wildly applauded the Italian cyclist Thursday
night as he appeared on a platform, in a downtown square of
Cesenatico, wearing a yellow shirt and bandana.
	   Yellow is the color of the Tour of France leadership.
	   ``At these times, when people mostly talk of doping, everybody
like Pantani because he represents the model of the clean
sportsman,'' Prodi said during the celebration, as he embraced the
new Italian cycling idol.
	   The French cycling race, which ended earlier this month, was
plagued by a doping scandal while Italian judges are investigating
allegations that some Italian soccer stars may have used
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Pantani, who lives in this Adriatic sea resort, said he was
amazed by the number of fans attending ``Pantani Day.''
	   Meanwhile officials of Pantani's commercial team, Mercatone Uno,
announced the Tour of France winner will not start in the Spanish
Vuelta.

Arrest of Internet abusers provokes public debate

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The first arrests in Malaysia for
spreading rumors over the Internet have people debating freedom of
speech and the right to privacy on the information superhighway.
	   The largest Internet service provider Friday assured worried
subscribers that it wouldn't snoop into their e-mails, a key tool
in a nation that sees information technology as the cutting edge of
its development policy.
	   The debate follows an investigation into last weekend's rumors
of violence which sparked off panic buying of food and forced many
to rush home from work and bolt their doors.
	   Cyber sleuths at Mimos Co., which brings the Internet to the
bulk of Malaysia's 200,000 subscribers, tracked down an unsigned
e-mail that warned of the widespread purchase of machetes by
migrant Indonesian workers.
	   ``Are they going to start anything funny?'' the widely
distributed e-mail read. ``We don't know. Please make sure that
your house, family and others are well protected.''
	   Two people were arrested Monday and another Wednesday under the
country's harsh Internal Security Act, which allows for detainment
without trial.
	   On Friday, police revealed a new arrest, a university student in
the northern state of Penang, for allegedly distributing malicious
letters by e-mail. He was not involved in the recent
rumormongering, but his letters could provoke racial tension,
police said.
	   For some, the action has exploded the illusion of electronic
privacy.
	   ``The current action by the government may lead to the
short-circuiting of lively Internet discussions and shut off
perhaps the only remaining independent avenue for Malaysians to
discuss and debate issues,'' said Elizabeth Wong of the human
rights group The Voice of the People.
	   The Malaysian Bar Council said the use of the ISA was excessive.
Those arrested should undergo a public trial for spreading rumors,
a crime that has specific laws under which they should be charged,
a Council statement said.
	   Harsh punishment could hurt the image of a country that wants to
portray itself as Asia's Silicon Valley, a movement personally
backed by Bill Gates.
	   Malaysia soon hopes to launch its Multimedia Super Corridor, a
vast area bound by a fiber-optics network, providing links between
high-tech companies, government offices, homes, hotels and even
shopping malls.
	   Rumors ``breed best in a society which is deprived of factual
information,'' Wong said, saying the tightly-controlled local media
had lost credibility.
	   ``What is read in the newspapers is reduced to the status of
propaganda, whereas what is heard on the grapevine is elevated to
fact,'' she said.
	   Others see the whole affair as an opportunity to advocate
self-restraint on the Internet, warning that more electronic drivel
could lead to more government controls.

Bomb targets police in Istanbul, four injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A bomb blast ripped through a police bus
parked near a university Friday, injuring four people, a television
station reported.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   One passer-by injured in the explosion was in serious condition,
said the private station NTV.
	   Police are often stationed near university campuses to respond
quickly in case of student demonstrations.
	   There have been similar attacks on police in Istanbul recently.
	   The leftist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front
claimed responsibility for one of them. Outlawed Kurdish and
radical Islamic groups are also active in the city.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices staged a dramatic turnaround
Friday, with the key index soaring 8.5 percent, a day after it fell
to a new five-year low.
	   After shedding 16 percent of its value and falling to a
five-year low in the first two weeks of August, the Hang Seng Index
rose 564.27 points to close at 7,224.69. On Thursday, the index
slumped 199.06 points, or 2.9 percent.
	   Turnover amounted to 8.55 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.1 billion), up from Thursday's 5.14 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 658 million).
	   The surge took many traders by surprise after weeks of gloom and
doom predictions.
	   Traders said it appeared that a few buyers had moved into the
market to buy up blue-chips and suggested they were trying to cover
short positions.
	   Short-selling is essentially a bet that the market will drop. An
investor borrows stocks and sells them, betting he can buy them
back at a lower price, repay the lender and pocket a profit.
	   There were also rumors that the Hong Kong government was
propping up the market by buying shares through the Land Fund,
which manages proceeds from government land sales and is allowed to
purchase shares.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang confirmed after the market
closed that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de
facto central bank. had intervened in the stock and futures
markets.
	   He said this was done to fend off recent speculative attacks on
the Hong Kong dollar, which has caused local interbank interest
rates to rise and shares to plummet.
	   Tsang emphasised that Hong Kong's ``long-standing policy of
non-intervenion'' in the stock and futures markets remained
unchanged.
	   ``We only contemplate invervention in very exceptional
curcumstances,'' he added.
	   Henry Lui, senior research analyst at Mansion House Securities
Ltd, decribed the rise as a ``technical rebound'' as the market has
been oversold.
	   Analysts said none of the market's fundamentals had changed, and
they weren't sure who was doing the buying. Steve Chiu, a trader at
Sassoon Securities, said it appeared the market's sudden move
upward was temporary.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong rose 3.15 Hong Kong dollars to
32.00, and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 2.40 dollars to 24.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 7.00 dollars to
158.00, and Hang Seng Bank rose 3.20 dollars to 40.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 3.90 dollars to 35.60, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 1.50 dollars to 21.50.

Negotiators in Kosovo face lack of support
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with influential ethnic Albanian
politician saying ``real'' talks still distant, Rugova calls for
halt to offensive, international protection of Kosovo, German
minister saying it's time to discuss NATO intervention; CHANGES
byline and TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An international military
intervention is the only way to guarantee a cease-fire in Kosovo
and ``real'' talks on the province's future, an influential ethnic
Albanian politician said Friday.
	   Mahmut Bakalli, a veteran politician in Kosovo who enjoys the
respect of U.S. and other Western officials, downplayed Thursday's
announcement of a new ethnic Albanian negotiating team for talks
with the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``I think we are no closer to real talks,'' Bakalli said. ``We
must first have a cease-fire on the ground and enable thousands of
refugees return to their homes.''
	   ``These two essential conditions cannot be fulfilled without a
direct international military and political intervention,'' he told
The Associated Press.
	   Bakalli was on the negotiating team led by pacifist Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova, which held several meetings with a Serbian
government delegation but walked out in May to protest a Serb
military offensive.
	   Asked when negotiations can be expected to start, Rugova told
reporters on Friday, ``First the (government) offensive must stop
in order to create a favorable atmosphere for the start of the
dialogue.''
	   He also said that the return of refugees to their homes must be
internationally monitored and appealed to the United States, the
United Nations, NATO and European Union for international
protection of Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, a republic that
dominates Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in
the province's population of 2 million. Many want independence from
Serbia.
	   Rugova on Thursday announced a new team to resume talks with the
government. But he failed to win the backing of the underground
Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA has taken up arms for independence
of the embattled province.
	   Representatives of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
were to meet Friday with the team to hammer out a platform for
negotiations.
	   The Serb-led government applauded Rugova's decision. So did
foreign powers.
	   Failure to obtain KLA support is a serious drawback because
sustained negotiations on the future of Kosovo are inconceivable
without a stable cease-fire.
	   ``Only international factors, not Milosevic, can guarantee a
cease-fire in Kosovo,'' said Bakalli, calling for an
internationally-monitored ``peaceful transition phase in which
serious and effective talks can be held.''
	   In Germany, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said the time had come
for ``a serious discussion of an active intervention'' by NATO in
Kosovo.
	   ``We must now finally go on the offensive with the political
debate,'' Ruehe told Bild newspaper.
	   But U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who for weeks has been
struggling to persuade ethnic Albanian rebels and politicians to
stop squabbling and join forces, said the ongoing violence in
Kosovo made it imperative to start talks immediately _ with or
without the rebels.
	   Milosevic has offered to discuss restoring self-rule he revoked
from Kosovo in 1989. But it remains unclear what degree of autonomy
Milosevic is willing to grant the province, which Serbs consider
the medieval cradle of their national identity.

Romanians chew over prime minister's teeth

 &UR; Eds: REPEATS to fix garbling &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ When Prime Minister Radu Vasile snuck
off for three days during an official visit to Israel to get his
teeth fixed, it set tongues wagging.
	   After an intensive four-day visit where he met his counterpart
Benjamin Netanyahu, toured a helicopter factory and greeted
thousands of Romanian construction workers in Israel, Vasile
vanished from the public spotlight.
	   Where could the prime minister be? Basking in the sun on some
Mediterranean beach? Mediating in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?
Or had he thrown in the towel on Romania's economic and political
woes?
	   When he returned, the buzz was about his dental implants - a
reported 16 of them. It sparked a discussion about politicians
wanting to bite off a bigger slice of the pie.
	   ``I wouldn't invest a nickel tooth in the prime minister's
mouth,'' wrote poet Mircea Dinescu. ``But the merciful people in
Israel have buried 50,000 dollars under Radu Vasile's moustache. A
brand-new Mercedes.''
	   Premier's counsellor Petrisor Peiu denied Vasile had spent the
dlrs 50,000 reported widely in the media. Peiu said Vasile had gone
to an Israeli dentist friend and had parted with just dlrs 2,000
for fairly minor dental work.
	   Whatever the facts, the story touches a nerve when Romanians
believe those in office are pampering themselves or want to move
above their station. For pampering, read dental treatment or any
minor surgery. Former President Ion Iliescu was also ridiculed when
he went to the dentist and later removed a facial mole. It was seen
as vanity, a sign of feminine weakness, not seemly in a male Balkan
leader.
	   ``When you get into office, there is this belief that we are all
mortals, but some of the chosen among the chosen ones are an
exception to this,''wrote Tudor Octavian in humorous weekly
Catavencu
	   ``Your children have to study in the West, the wife has to get
her clothes from Paris and caries have to be taken care with
dollars,'' he wrote.
	   Like many Romanians, Vasile's teeth were not his strong point. A
smoker, his teeth were mostly hidden by a bushy mustache. When he
opened his mouth, he revealed nicotine-stained incisors.
	   After he became premier, Vasile worked on his appearance -
taming his wild mane, removing a heavy gold signet ring and
dressing with an Italian feel.
	   In Romania, the dentist is the last resort - you go there when
your teeth keep you awake at night. People don't have dental
records and have a horror of the dentist's chair.
	   As Romanians ape Western habits, attitudes are changing.
Newscasters have dazzling smiles and a few German and American-run
dentist offices have opened, offering flossing and mouthwash, at a
Western price.

Tour of Spain drops plans to cross border into France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Tour of Spain organizers have dropped plans
for the race to cross the border into France, thus avoiding the
police anti-doping raids that occurred during the Tour de France.
	   ``Since it is impossible to predict how (French) judges will
behave, we cannot go,'' race director Alberto Gadea said.
	   The 13th leg of next month's tour was to have taken 198 cyclists
from 22 teams across the border into France and through several
mountain passes before returning to Sabinanigo.
	   But memories of the Tour de France drug scandals are still
fresh. The top-ranked Festina team was expelled after officials and
riders admitted to a systematic doping program.
	   All four Spanish teams _ Banesto, ONCE, Kelme and Vitali Cio _
dropped out of the Tour to protest alleged harassment by French
police investigating the use of banned drugs.
	   In changing the route, Tour of Spain officials insisted they
were not acting out of spite against the French, but could not risk
seeing the race disrupted as it passed through France.
	   ``We were looking forward to it,'' Gadea said. `` Everything was
all ready. But no one can guarantee that police investigators will
not intervene in their territory, as they did during the Tour.''
	   The Spanish tour is scheduled Sept. 5-27.
	   Spain had previously pulled its teams out of this month's
women's Tour de France in protest at the police raids during the
men's race.
	   And the ONCE team pulled out of three races it had been due to
take part in in France later this year.

Indonesian Chinese are jittery as rumors of riots spread
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Some ethnic Chinese at Jakarta's
international airport on Friday were students bound for schools
abroad. Some were vacationers escaping for a long weekend. And some
were fleeing in fear.
	   Rumors have swept Indonesian cities that riots will erupt on
Aug. 17, national independence day, unsettling a traditional target
of social unrest, the Chinese minority.
	   In Jakarta, gutted or boarded up Chinese-owned shops bear
testament to deadly rioting in May and the memory of those lawless
days is vivid for its victims.
	   ``I'm scared of staying in Jakarta,'' said Peter, a 19-year-old
Chinese who was pushing a trolley piled with suitcases at the
airport. He boarded a flight for neighboring Malaysia.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up just 4 percent of Indonesia's population
of 202 million, but their dominant role in the economy has long
invited resentment that often spills into violence.
	   With Indonesia crippled by economic turmoil, millions of poor
people have blamed the relatively wealthy Chinese for their woes,
targeting them as scapegoats.
	   In the May rioting, which along with student protests helped
oust former President Suharto, thousands of Chinese shops and homes
in Jakarta were attacked. Women's groups say as many as 168 women,
most of them Chinese, were raped.
	   Worried about rumors of violence on Monday, the government is
deploying thousands of troops in the capital. Many people are
skeptical there will be violence.
	   ``When people riot, they don't give an invitation,'' businessman
Chin Yi said. He speculated there may be more unrest in October,
when the government is expected to remove subsidies on flour and
other commodities, forcing up prices.
	   The origin of the rumors, many of which have circulated on the
Internet, is unclear. But there have been deliberate attempts to
scare Chinese.
	   In the city of Semarang, authorities recently found graffiti on
Chinese-owned buildings, allegedly marking them as targets for
attack. Some anti-Chinese leaflets have been found in Jakarta.
	   Some Chinese have reportedly bought firearms on the black market
for self-protection and sales of legal air guns in some stores are
up. In May, the military did not intervene or failed to show up in
many areas hit by rioting.
	   New President B.J. Habibie has promised security and financing
for Chinese, trying to undo decades of government indifference,
even hostility, toward the ethnic minority. Above all, he wants
them to reinvest capital in the economically ravaged country.
	   ``The tendency in the past was, `Well, let the Chinese help
themselves because they are rich,''' said Ginandjar Kartasasmita,
the chief economics minister.
	   Responding to criticism that it responded slowly to the riots,
the government on Friday condemned the rapes of ethnic Chinese
women and said it would provide counseling for victims.
	   Outrage over the May rioting has galvanized ethnic Chinese
worldwide, sparking protests, some of them outside Indonesian
diplomatic offices, in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the United
States.
	   On Friday, a couple of soldiers in camouflage uniforms strolled
through the Mangga Dua shopping mall in Jakarta. But some Chinese
storeowners, doubtful the government can protect them, close early
to get home before dark.

Brunei launches campaign to stamp out bootlegging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ On a campaign against illegal
drinking, Brunei authorities arrested 10 people in a series of
raids this week, including three British soldiers and two
policemen, officials said Friday.
	   Since Islamic Brunei banned the import and sale of alcohol five
years ago, a thriving underground market has grown. Smuggled beer
is served secretly in teapots in some restaurants and young men
gather late at night at private clubs to drink.
	   Only foreigners are allowed to bring in a few bottles of
alcohol, but have to fill in a form at the airport to declare their
un-Islamic cargo. They cannot drink in public or offer it to a
Muslim.
	   ``We are determined to clean up the place and the current blitz
will continue,'' said an official of the Royal Brunei Customs,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   This week's raids began in the coastal oil-producing town of
Seria-Belait, 108 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   Three soldiers of a British contingent deployed in Brunei were
arrested for drinking beer at a cafe and two women for stashing
beer in their homes, said customs officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity. They did not disclose the dates of arrest.
	   The soldiers were freed on bail, but could face weeks of
imprisonment or a fine if convicted by the Brunei judiciary or
disciplinary action if tried by the military court. The maximum
punishment is three years in jail.
	   Of the two women arrested in the oil town, one was a 31-year-old
businesswoman, who was fined 17,000 Brunei dollars (dlrs 10,000)
for a similar offense in January.
	   In Bandar Seri Begawan, a cook working for a club was arrested
for storing beer. Two local policemen were nabbed with 72 cans of
beer in their possession.
	   Raids were likely to intensify and spread to other towns of the
tiny Sultanate of 300,000 people, which has been ruled by a Muslim
royal family for more than 500 years.

Foreigners barred from swimming pool in northern Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with a comment from the town mayor in last two graphs

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Foreigners have been barred from a public pool in
northern Japan after a non-Japanese resident was accused of
molesting a young girl at the facility, officials said Friday.
	   Local legal authorities said they were investigating whether the
ban represents a human rights violation.
	   Officials in the town of Azuma imposed the ban on July 12, a day
after the parents of a 10-year-old girl reported that their
daughter had been touched by an unidentified foreigner in the pool.
	   The District Legal Affairs Bureau in Maebashi, a city near
Azuma, believes the ban could be violating foreigners' rights, said
Junichi Sato, a spokesman for the bureau.
	   ``It will be a human rights problem, if the ban has been taken
against all foreigners uniformly,'' Sato said.
	   The pool ban comes a week after another racial discrimination
case in Japan, in which a Brazilian journalist sued a jewelry shop
owner in central Japan for 1.5 million yen (dlrs 10,400) for making
her leave the store because she was a foreigner.
	   Azuma, a small town of 20,000 people about 120 kilometers (74
miles) north of Tokyo, is home to about 500 foreigners.
	   Tetsuya Kubota, an education board official, said there have
also been reports that another elementary school girl was roughly
pulled into the pool by a group of five foreigners on July 11.
	   Town officials put up a sign, reading: ``The pool will be closed
to foreigners ... Some children have been receiving rough behavior
from foreigners in the pool lately.''
	   Kubota defended the ban.
	   ``Putting up the notice was decided among village authorities,
who considered the safety of children more important than anything
else,'' he said.
	   The mayor of Azuma, Nobuyuki Hagiwara dismissed accusations the
no-foreigners-allowed policy would constitute a violation of human
rights.
	   ``We can't specify the foreigner'' who commited the offense,
Hagiwara said. The ban was implemented to ``protect the rights of
the villagers and to protect people. Human rights are secondary to
that,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A first large group of refugees in some two months
has crossed from the troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo into
northern Albania, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday.
	   Thursday's arrivals are likely to further test already stretched
resources in Europe's poorest country, said Kris Janowski,
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   UNHCR so far has registered 320 people out of the group,
estimated to number 500 or more, he added.
	   ``It's still very risky to cross,'' Janowski said. ``I guess it
depends on the stakes.'' The crossing seems to be the result of
intense fighting in the Junik area of Kosovo, he added.
	   On Thursday, Albanian television reported that 600 people had
crossed from Kosovo into Albania in the previous 24 hours,
including 12 wounded.
	   The Interior Ministry sent a helicopter to take the wounded to
the capital Tirana, it added.
	   More than 13,000 ethnic Albanians fled over the mountains into
Albania earlier this year. About 6,000 remain in the town of Bajram
Curri near the border, with others staying with families in nearby
Tropoja.
	   ``This is not a huge group of people _13,000 plus _ but they
went to probably the poorest corner of Europe,'' Janowski said.
``It does put an enormous strain on the local population there.''
	   ``We're looking for new accommodation, but in northern Albania
we're scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of accommodation
and lodging, and it's getting to be a bit like this in
Montenegro.''
	   Some 35,000 other Kosovo refugees have flooded into neighboring
Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ In a show of unity and grief, Christian
and Muslim members of parliament laid a huge wreath of red and
white roses at the site of the embassy bombing on Friday.
	   The legislators sang ``We Shall Overcome'' and prayed for unity
and tolerance. Nearby, an FBI evidence response team labored over
debris with rakes, continuing their search for evidence.
	   With rescue operations wrapped up and the death toll apparently
fixed at 257, the focus Friday was on cleanup work and the all-out
push to learn who perpetrated the nearly simultaneous bombings in
Nairobi and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7.
	   ``It will take at least four more weeks to complete examination
of both bomb sites and witness interviews, and from that we will
develop leads,'' Assistant FBI Director Thomas Pickard said in
Washington.
	   In another sad pilgrimmage to the ruins, a group of Kenyan
women, each carrying a red or white rose and many weeping, offered
prayers for the dead at an ecumenical service.
	   ``Women in Pain,'' said a banner they carried.
	   The head of the Vatican missionary service, Cardinal Jozef
Tomko, also showed up Friday morning. Tomko is in Nairobi to ordain
two new bishops.
	   ``Who can approve of terrorism?'' he said after praying for the
dead and wounded. ``We must find another way of living together on
this earth. Look at it: It is so beautiful. Why this? Why?''
	   Friday's newspapers were filled with grief: Death notices for
bomb victims, with pictures of the deceased.
	   One showed a smiling young couple on their wedding day. Both
died in the blast. Another showed two sisters, ages 16 and 17.
	   The papers were also full of bitterness and anger at the United
States. Columns and letters to the editor complained that the
United States tried only to save its own citizens after the blast.
	   ``You could show us a little more sympathy, America,'' said one
headline in the East Africa Standard.
	   A travel warning from the U.S. State Department travel advisory
warning people against visiting Kenya also created ill will.
Tourism is vital to Kenya's economy and there were fears the
advisory would deal it a crippling blow.
	   The embassy said Friday that the warning had been lifted. James
Flannery, head of the Kenya Tourist Board, welcomed the move. ``We
are very pleased,'' he said.
	   Ambassador Prudence Bushnell said Friday that Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright would be visiting East Africa soon. Bushnell
spoke a ceremony at which the United States donated
search-and-rescue equipment to Kenya.
	   On Thursday, Sheila Horan, FBI special agent in charge of the
investigation, said investigators had gathered ``very critical and
important information'' on the bombers' identities.
	   The FBI has 215 agents, lab examiners, evidence technicians,
computer specialists, photographers and translators in Kenya and
Tanzania, he said.
	   A British forensic team was expected to join the 22 FBI lab
examiners at the two sites shortly.
	   Pickard said agents on the scene had 700 interviews to conduct
in Nairobi and 200 in Dar es Salaam. Some of the Kenyan guards at
the embassy who may have seen the bombers survived the blast.
	   Kenyan police say about five people have been detained. In
Tanzania, about 14 people have been picked up for quetioning.
	   Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said joint police work with
Kenya ``has given us important leads in our investigations.''
	   Kenya's Muslims feel they have been unfairly targeted because of
suspicions that Islamic terrorists are involved in the blast. They
say several Muslims were detained without cause.
	   ``It seems they've decided that the people who did it are
Muslims, now let's go for the evidence,'' Mohamed Farouk Adam, vice
chairman of Nairobi's Jamia Mosque.
	   In Dar es Salaam Friday, acting U.S. Ambassador John Lange
raised the flag at the embassy's temporary headquarters in a house
across the road from the Indian Ocean.
	   The house is almost hidden from view by a high security wall
that is now topped by barbed wire.
	   ``It is a difficult time for all of us,'' Lange said at the
brief ceremony.

Bomb scare on ferry in Sydney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Police blew up a package suspected of
containing a bomb on a passenger ferry at the main passenger wharf
in Sydney on Friday. Authorities refused to say whether the package
held explosives.
	   The suspicous package was discovered aboard the ferry Sirius
mid-morning, as it traveled from Neutral Bay on Sydney's north
shore to Circular Quay, in the heart of the city, a police
spokesman said.
	   About 30 passengers aboard the ferry were evacuated and the boat
was isolated at a mooring near the International Passenger Terminal
in Sydney Cove.
	   Emergency services cordoned off the immediate vicinity and the
busy Circular Quay ferry terminal complex was closed to harbor
traffic for more than two hours.
	   Bomb disposal specialists detonated the package after about
three hours and the wharf was reopened, the spokesman said, on
condition of anonymity.
	   The bomb scare comes as the city is preparing to host the 2000
Olympic Games, and authorities have been on the lookout for
possible security threats to the harbor.
	   Special ferries will serve as public transport from the wharf to
the key Olympics site, and athletes and dignitaries will also
travel this way.
	   Inspector Garry Smith of the Bomb Squad refused to confirm
whether the device that was destroyed had been bomb.

Yeltsin praises premier, plans meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Friday
praised the performance of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, while
blasting economics, finance and customs officials.
	   Yeltsin, who was visiting the ancient Russian capital of
Novgorod on Friday, flew back to the Valdai lake resort later in
the day and was to meet with Kiriyenko on Monday.
	   Asked if he was happy with Kiriyenko, Yeltsin replied: ``Yes,
yes yes. I'm going to keep him.''
	   But during a visit to a meat-processing factory in Novgorod,
Yeltsin bemoaned the lack of government support for Russian
manufacturers, and singled out his Economics and Finance Ministers
for blame.
	   ``This has happened because Economics Minister (Yakov) Urinson
has spent his whole life in laboratories,'' Yeltsin said. ``Then he
was made minister, and from the point of view of science, he knows
and does everything, but he knows nothing about practice; he can't
get his bearings.''
	   ``So he has fallen behind, and the rest of us has followed
him,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Yeltsin also summoned Urinson and Customs Committee chief Valery
Draganov to Novgorod, ordering them to visit the meat-processing
plant within 24 hours, Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   During the meeting Saturday, Yeltsin and Kiriyenko plan to
discuss Russia's economic crisis and measures for stabilization, as
well as the volatile situation in Russia's Caucasus region,
especially in breakaway Chechnya, Kiriyenko said, according to the
ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies.
	   Kiriyenko said that officials in Moscow have ``pretended too
long that there are no problems'' in Russia's relations with
Chechnya, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   ``These problems do exist and are quite serious,'' Kiriyenko was
quoted as saying.
	   Russia has withdrawn its troops from Chechnya after an
unsuccessful attempt to quench its independence drive, but
continues to insist that Chechnya is part of Russia.
	   Chechnya, meanwhile, maintains it's an independent state, and
has been running its own affairs, often in open defiance of
Russia's central government.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Halfway through one of its most miserable
months in recent memory, Hong Kong's main stock index roared back
Friday _ at least for a day. After dropping 16 percent of its value
and falling to a five-year low in the first two weeks of August,
the Hang Seng Index posted a gain of 8.5 percent, jumping 564
points to close at 7,224.69. Analysts weren't quite sure what
happened, and questioned whether it was more than a blip in the
downward spiral that continued to dominate much of Asia on Friday.
Besides regional worries, which now focus on Japan's weakness and
prospects for China and Hong Kong to devalue their currencies,
Asia's markets on Friday also were watching Russia's renewed
economic troubles. Tokyo's Nikkei index fell sharply. Markets in
Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were suffering further from what traders
said was an overall meltdown in confidence. In Tokyo, the Nikkei
index closed down 258 points to 15,123.93, a drop of 1.7 percent.
There was no dramatic movement in the yen, which has been under
severe selling pressure. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin called on
parliament Friday to convene an emergency session to respond to
Russia's unfolding economic crisis. Yeltsin insisted, however, that
the economy remained stable, that the ruble would not be devalued,
and said there was no need to interrupt his month-long vacation to
take charge of the situation. The speaker of the State Duma, the
Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, said lawmakers
``wouldn't mind'' holding the emergency session that Yeltsin
requested. The Russian stock market opened tentatively higher
Friday, boosted in part by the hope that the United States was
patching together a plan to augment the recent financial bailout
announced by international lenders. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The government on Friday gave Hyundai
Motor Co. workers until next week to end their month-long strike or
be forced from the company's plants. The nation's largest automaker
has been idle since July 20 when thousands of workers began
picketing the company's main plants in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175
miles) southeast of Seoul, to protest rising layoffs. The
government's ultimatum was issued after senior security officials
met behind closed doors to discuss the dispute, which they said was
hurting South Korea's troubled economy. Almost simultaneously,
Hyundai's management announced an indefinite shutdown of its main
plants _ a move seen as signaling a government intervention.
(SKOREA-HYUNDAI STRIKE)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hong Kong's chief secretary gave strong
assurances Friday that despite market pressure the Chinese currency
will not be devalued and the Hong Kong dollar will remain tied to
its U.S. counterpart. ``In the face of the regional currency
devaluations, many have questioned whether we can maintain the Hong
Kong-U.S. dollar link,'' Anson Chan said in a speech to the
Singapore International Chamber of Commerce. Many are also worried
that China will devalue the yuan _ also known as the renminbi _ to
remain competitive in trade with its neighbors. A move to either
devalue the yuan or cut the link with the U.S. dollar could set off
a string of currency devaluations around the region similar to the
ones last year that led to Asia's current financial crisis. Chan
said recovery for Asia is two or three years away because some of
the ``stronger regional economies, such as ours, are slipping into
recession,'' adding that Hong Kong's unemployment rate could rise
from the current 4.1 percent when new figures come out next week.
(SINGAPORE-HONG KONG)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's banking crisis helped drive the number of
corporate bankruptcies in July to its highest level since the end
of World War II, a private credit research agency said Friday.
Bankruptcies rose 35.7 percent from the same month last year to
1,710, the highest number recorded for any month of July during the
post-war period, Teikoku Databank Ltd. said. The number of
companies going out of business has risen at a rate of greater than
20 percent per month for the past eight months, the Tokyo-based
agency said. It said the pace is expected to continue. Teikoku
Databank cited the nation's banking crisis as the single biggest
cause behind the rise. Japan's banks have triggered a credit crunch
as they've diverted funds to writing off some 76.7 trillion yen
(dlrs 530 billion) in bad loans. The total debts left behind by the
companies that folded in July fell 16.8 percent from a year earlier
to 906 billion yen (dlrs 6.2 billion), it said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila has fled his
embattled capital as rebel forces drive toward Kinshasa, a senior
government official said Friday. ``The president is not in
Kinshasa,'' the high level government adviser told The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity. ``I can't tell you any more than
that.'' A western diplomatic source, speaking on condition of
anonymity in Paris, said Kabila had gone to the southern city of
Lubumbashi, his former rebel base. Asked if Kabila intended to
return, the official would only say ``For that, we'll have to wait
and see.'' With rebel forces driving toward Kinshasa from the west,
the jittery Congolese capital awoke Friday without electricity,
radio, television or newspapers and rumors their leader had fled.
The city was bracing for what many believe will be the imminent
arrival of rebel forces that launched a rebellion against Kabila
earlier this month. (CONGO)
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ In a show of unity and grief, Christian
and Muslim members of parliament laid a huge wreath of red and
white roses at the site of the embassy bombing on Friday. American
officials remain mum about possible culprits in last week's deadly
twin bombings at U.S. embassies in East Africa, but Muslims claim
investigators and the media are unfairly targeting them. With
rescue operations wrapped up and the death toll apparently fixed at
257, the focus Friday was on cleanup work and the all-out push to
learn who perpetrated the nearly simultaneous bombings in Nairobi
and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7. (EMBASSY BOMBINGS)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Eighteen foreign activists arrested last
week for handing out pro-democracy leaflets were put on trial
Friday by Myanmar's military government in a courtroom outside the
walls of a notorious prison. The six Americans, three Malaysians,
three Indonesians, three Thais, two Filipinos and one Australian
were charged after six days of questioning and investigation with
violating the 1950 Emergency Provision Act. The sweeping law allows
authorities to hand out maximum 20-year jail sentences for
attempting to incite unrest or disrupt the peace and stability of
the state. (MYANMAR-FOREIGNERS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A major levee protecting Daqing, China's largest
oil field, gave way Friday as floods spread their misery into the
northeast, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. Heilongjiang,
an industrial and agricultural province that borders Russia,
mobilized 1 million civilians and soldiers for ``a round-the-clock
fight'' against the flooded Nen and Songhua rivers, Xinhua said.
More than 200,000 people were fighting flooding in Daqing. Local
residents were safely evacuated and no casualties were reported
from the breach in the dike, which expanded to 500 meters (1,650
feet) by midday, Xinhua said. Rescue workers also were evacuating
more than 20,000 people stranded after floods washed out railway
tracks in Heilongjiang, state media said. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Steve Fossett's solo attempt to circle the
globe in a balloon has enjoyed a renewed boost, thanks to a vein of
fast-moving easterly wind. Fossett's speed has ``just about
doubled'' as his balloon, the Solo Spirit, soars toward Australia,
said George Dunnavan, a meteorologist for the project's mission
control at Washington University in St. Louis. The balloon is
traveling on schedule and is ``still in the proper window to make
it'' around the world, Dunnavan said Friday. The Chicago
millionaire, making his fourth attempt to fly around the globe, is
approaching the halfway point of his journey. He had been in danger
of being drawn into a high-pressure system over the Indian Ocean
that ``would make him loop and go nowhere,'' said Alan Blount,
control center director. (US-BALLOON QUEST)

German election poll shows tight race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Six weeks before national elections,
Germany's main opposition Social Democratic Party and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservative union were neck-and-neck in a poll
released Friday.
	   The Emnid Institute poll, commissioned by n-tv, found support
for the Social Democrats unchanged from a week earlier at 41
percent. Also unchanged was the 38 percent for Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian
Social Union.
	   The weekly survey of about 1,000 people had a margin of error of
plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, however.
	   Voters' enthusiasm for the junior coalition partner in Kohl's
coalition, the Free Democratic Party, slipped by one percentage
point to 5 percent _ the minimum threshold needed for parliamentary
representation by parties.
	   Popularity for the Social Democrats' potential coalition
partner, the environmentalist Greens, was steady at 6 percent.
	   Only 4 percent of those surveyed said they would vote for the
successor party to former East Germany's communists, the Party for
Democratic Socialism, if elections _ set for Sept. 27 _ were held
this Sunday.

Indonesia's Habibie honors general blamed for 1991 massacre
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that former general blamed for massacre also honored;
RECASTS throughout; New to some points &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie on Friday
awarded a medal of honor to a former army general blamed for the
1991 massacre of demonstrators in the troubled territory of East
Timor.
	   The medal, one of 38 handed out to celebrate Indonesian
independence, went to retired Lt. Gen. Sintong Panjaitan, who
oversaw troops who shot dead dozens of pro-independence
demonstrators in the former Portuguese colony.
	   The president also gave medals to his wife, his brother, two
prominent Muslim leaders as well as some former and current Habibie
aides. National independence day falls on Monday. Indonesia became
independed in 1945.
	   It was the first time that Habibie has bestowed the awards for
service to the nation since he replaced former President Suharto
after riots and protests in May.
	   The medal for Sintong come after Habibie faced criticism from
human rights groups for making the former military man a
presidential aide.
	   The 1991 killings triggered international condemnation of
Indonesia, which invaded East Timor in 1975. Sintong, who was the
regional commander of the troops, was forced to quit.
	   Recently, Indonesia and Portugal, under the sponsorship of the
United Nations, restarted diplomatic attempts to find a peaceful
solution to East Timor's future.
	   In gesture of goodwill, Indonesia withdrew 1,300 troops after
Habibie said he was willing to grant some autonomy to East Timor,
about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Jakarta. About 11,000
troops remain in the territory of about 800,000 people.
	   Also honored Friday were Habibie's wife Hasri Ainun Besari
Habibie and his younger brother Junus Effendy Habibie, a former
ambassador and the ex-head of the Batam Island industrial
development project near Singapore.
	   Six serving Cabinet ministers were also honored as the nation
grapples with its worst economic crisis in 30 years amid fears of
potential civil unrest.
	   They included military chief Gen. Wiranto, who is also defense
minister, and Economics Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita.
	   Wiranto has been instrumental in his support for Habibie's
presidency in recent months. The military has stepped up security
in Jakarta and other cities because of rumors of possible rioting
on Monday.
	   Ginandjar has been a principal player in negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund for a dlrs 43 billion economic rescue
package.
	   Abdurrahman Wahid and Amien Rais, who each head the country's
two largest Muslim organizations, were named in the honor list, but
neither attended the award ceremony at the state palace.
	   Both were critics of Suharto and have also called on Habibie to
accelerate political reform. Rais has indicated that he wants to
stand for the presidency next year.
	   Among others honored Friday was Muhammad Sanusi Sierad, an
ex-Cabinet minister and dissident who served nine and a half years
in prison during Suharto's reign.

Fireworks injure more than 100 in Spanish festival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ELCHE, Spain (AP) _ More than 100 people were injured by
fireworks set off during a street festival, including three who
were hospitalized with serious burns, authorities said Friday.
	   In Thursday night's festivities in the town of Elche in
southeastern Spain, youths lit ``carretillas,'' rocket-like devices
that spin around on the ground.
	   Firefighters answered some 60 calls to put out burning trash
cans, bushes and other objects.
	   Authorities said those seriously injured included a small boy
with burns in his genital area and a woman who suffered burns over
20 percent of her body.
	   More than 100 people were treated for minor injuries and
released.

Negotiators in Kosovo face lack of support
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Rugova highlighting refugees' plight,
urging halt to Serb offensive, ADDS Pentagon comment; EDITS. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ibrahim Rugova, Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian pacifist leader, Friday said a Serbian offensive in the
secessionist province must stop before negotiations with the
government can begin.
	   On Thursday, Rugova announced a new team to resume talks with
the government. But he failed to win the backing of the underground
Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence of the embattled
province.
	   Representatives of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
were top meet Friday with the team to hammer out a platform for
negotiations.
	   Rugova told a news conference on Friday: ``The offensive in
Kosovo must stop. We demand international help and protection for
the people of Kosovo by the United States, the European Union, NATO
and the UNited Nations.''
	   Asked about the start of talks with the government, he
reemphasized: `` First the offensive must stop in order to create a
favorable atmosphere for the start of the dialogue.''
	   In Washington, Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said
Thursday the United States would ``strongly consider some sort of
participation'' in a NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo if a
diplomatic solution to the crisis there can be found.
	   The NATO alliance is preparing ``plans for both air and ground
operations'' in the province, Bacon told reporters.
	   Rugova complained that the Serb offensive continues, especially
in the region of Decani and Junik, a rebel stronghold near the
Albanian border where at least 1,000 civilians were last reported
to have fled. The besieged town repeatedly has been shelled by Serb
forces.
	   While not disclosing detailed figures, Rugova said, ``There are
a lot of killed and wounded civilians and material damage is
great.''
	   He said, ``The humanitarian situation for the displaced people
is very grave. Their return is being prevented by the police. The
return of the refugees should be internationally monitored.''
	   Earlier Friday, Mahmut Bakalli, an influential ethnic Albanian
politician, told The Associated Press, an international military
intervention to guarantee a cease-fire in Kosovo is necessary
before ``real'' talks on the province's future can start.
	   Bakalli, a veteran politician in Kosovo who enjoys the respect
of U.S. and other Western officials, downplayed Thursday's
announcement of a new ethnic Albanian negotiating team for talks
with the government.
	   Bakalli was a member of Rugova's negotiating team, which held
several meetings with a Serbian government delegation but walked
out in May to protest a Serb military offensive.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, a republic that
dominates Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in
the province's population of 2 million. They want independence from
Serbia.
	   Failure to obtain KLA support is a serious drawback because
sustained negotiations on the future of Kosovo are inconceivable
without a stable cease-fire. So is any peace settlement without the
rebel force's approval.
	   In Germany, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said the time had come
for ``a serious discussion of an active intervention'' by NATO in
Kosovo.
	   ``We must now finally go on the offensive with the political
debate,'' Ruehe told Bild newspaper.
	   But U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who for weeks has been
struggling to persuade ethnic Albanian rebels and politicians to
stop squabbling and join forces, said the ongoing violence in
Kosovo made it imperative to start talks immediately _ with or
without the rebels.
	   The ethnic Albanians' five-member team comprises mainly
disciples of Rugova, who is supported by one branch of the KLA and
despised by others. Rugova, Hill and European diplomats hope the
rebels will join the talks when they see progress made.
	   The Serb-led government applauded Rugova's decision. So did
foreign powers.
	   Milosevic has offered to discuss restoring self-rule he revoked
from Kosovo in 1989. But it remains unclear what degree of autonomy
Milosevic is willing to grant the province, which Serbs consider
the medieval cradle of their national identity.

Foreign activists tried in Myanmar as Suu Kyi continues standoff

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Eighteen foreign activists arrested last
week for handing out pro-democracy leaflets in the Myanmar capital
of Yangon were put on trial Friday and face possible 20-year jail
sentences.
	   At a press conference in Bangkok, Thailand, angry and tearful
relatives of the 18 activists, joined by a visiting United States
congressman, demanded their release.
	   Meanwhile, opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi prepared to spend
a third night in her van at a roadblock outside Yangon in her
fourth standoff with the military government in two months. She is
demanding the right to meet supporters outside the capital.
	   Hopes for mediating a settlement between the military and the
democratic opposition were dashed Friday when Myanmar, also known
as Burma, rebuffed a request from U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
to allow an envoy to visit the country.
	   ``The response stated there was no reason for such a rushed
visit,'' said U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt.
	   Friday's trial of the 18 foreigners took place in a courthouse
outside the walls of Insein Prison, where hundreds of political
prisoners are held along with violent criminals.
	   The six Americans, three Malaysians, three Indonesians, three
Thais, two Filipinos and one Australian were charged with violating
the 1950 Emergency Provision Act.
	   The sweeping law allows maximum 20-year jail sentences for
attempting to incite unrest or disrupt the peace and stability of
the state.
	   Diplomats were denied permission to speak with the accused. A
single judge presided. There was no jury. Unlike most trials in
Myanmar, the proceedings were open to diplomats and journalists.
	   A diplomat said the defendants and foreign embassies were not
informed a trial would take place until Friday morning.
	   ``I hope they will be treated leniently,'' said U.S. Charge
d'Affaires Kent Wiedemann as he entered the courtroom.
	   ``The trial could be finished today if they don't raise any
questions,'' a Myanmar Foreign Ministry spokesman said on condition
of anonymity.
	   After the prosecution finishes its case, the accused can then
enter their plea and demand a lawyer.
	   ``The longer this goes on, the more the government of Burma will
come under international scrutiny,'' Chris Smith, a Republican from
New Jersey, who chairs the House International Operations and Human
Rights subcommittee, said in Bangkok.
	   The activists were detained Sunday, the day after the 10th
anniversary of a failed nationwide democracy uprising, for handing
out small cards telling Myanmar citizens the outside world
supported their democratic aspirations and to not give up.
	   Myanmar has been ruled by the military since 1962. More than
3,000 demonstrators were gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   Suu Kyi rose to prominence at that time. She was placed under
house arrest from 1989-95 for leading the movement. Since her
release she has traveled outside Yangon only once, in 1995, to
visit a Buddhist monk.
	   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was stopped Wednesday at a
checkpoint 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of the capital, the same
site as the three previous standoffs.
	   She was attempting to travel to Bassein, 160 kilometers (100
miles) west of Yangon.
	   The government said Friday it had an ambulance waiting nearby in
case Suu Kyi fell ill, but she and her party have said she will
only accept treatment from her physicians.
	   During a six-day standoff earlier this month, the government
said it was providing her with food and water. But she later said
authorities had prevented her from obtaining food and water. She
ended up suffering from a high fever and severe dehydration.
	   Her party and the U.S. government said it would hold the
military responsible for her health and safety.
	   The government ended the six-day standoff by seizing her car,
forcibly restraining her and driving her back to Yangon against her
will.

Newspaper lashes out at Butler, Shah expects further talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A government newspaper renewed its attack
Friday on the chief U.N. weapons inspector amid efforts by a United
Nations envoy to resolve the dispute over inspections.
	   Envoy Prakash Shah met Thursday for more than an hour with
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Shah later told reporters
he would be ``available as long as it is necessary for the Iraqi
authorities to continue this dialogue.''
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent Shah with a message
urging the Iraqis to reverse their Aug. 5 decision to suspend
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors and the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
	   ``I mentioned to him (Aziz) that there is a unanimous view in
the council that Iraq should continue its cooperation with the U.N.
and UNSCOM,'' said Shah who described the meeting as ``cordial and
friendly'' but gave no details of its substance.
	   The suspension followed after chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler said he could not certify that Iraq had eliminated all its
weapons of mass destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions
following the 1991 Gulf War.
	   This must be done before the United Nations lifts punishing
trade sanctions that bar air travel to and from Iraq and limit the
sale of oil, its economic mainstay. They were imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Aziz was expected to brief senior Iraqi officials Friday on his
talks with Shah.
	   Iraq's major newspaper, meanwhile, kept up its drumbeat of
criticism of Butler.
	   Al-Thawra, published by the ruling Baath party, said in an
editorial that ``Butler knows very well that Iraq cannot rebuild
its arsenal of mass destruction weapons because the means to make
these weapons have been destroyed.''
	   It especially targeted a letter Butler sent earlier this week to
the U.N. Security Council in which he said Iraq's announcement of
non-compliance earlier this month were hindering both spot
inspections and long-term monitoring efforts.
	   ``This is solid evidence that he is not honest in dealing with
Iraq and that he is up to his chin in the American game, which aims
at prolonging the sanctions,'' the editorial said.
	   The United States and Britain have insisted that the sanctions
remain in place until all of Iraq's biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles are destroyed.
	   Aziz insisted Thursday that Iraq's latest moves had not hurt
long-term monitoring efforts.
	   In a letter to the Security Council released by the official
Iraqi News Agency, Aziz said U.N. inspectors still could go to 496
sites previously designated for monitoring.
	   He described this as enough to ``cover more than 94 percent of
the routine IAEA and UNSCOM activities.''
	   Annan designated Shah, an Indian diplomat, as his special envoy
to Iraq shortly after brokering a deal Feb. 23 with Saddam to end
Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. inspectors into presidential
compounds. Eight palaces later were inspected.
	   The agreement ended U.S. and British threats to use force to get
Iraq to cooperate.

Angry, tearful relatives, congressman demand release

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Angry and tearful relatives of the 18
foreign democracy activists jailed in Myanmar demanded their
release Friday just half an hour after learning they had been put
on trial.
	   The relatives, human-rights groups supporting the detainees and
U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who has a
constituent among them, said the military regime of Myanmar, also
known as Burma, was committing a blunder.
	   ``The longer this goes on, the more the government of Burma will
come under international scrutiny,'' said Smith, who chairs the
House International Operations and Human Rights subcommittee.
``From a public relations point of view, this is a disaster.''
	   A dozen relatives of the activists and members of human rights
groups supporting them were told Friday by the Myanmar Embassy that
their requests for visas would take a week to process and
interviews would be necessary. Normally, visas are granted in a few
hours.
	   Smith hoped his status as a high-ranking politician would get
him a visa Friday and had booked a plane to fly to Myanmar, but did
not receive one. He was still hopeful of obtaining one Saturday.
	   The activists were arrested Sunday in the Myanmar capital,
Yangon, for distributing leaflets urging people to remember the
10th anniversary of an uprising against military rule and to not
give up. The protests in 1988 were bloodily crushed.
	   The activists include six Americans, three Indonesians, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Filipinos and an Australian.
	   Eva Sana, the mother of Filipino social activist Ellene Sana,
pressed a handkerchief to her face and wept on learning that a
trial was being held, following days of statements by the Myanmar
government that their fate had not been decided.
	   ``Six days is already too long and too much for these young
people, who are not prepared for this kind of treatment,'' Sana
said.
	   Greg Vicary, brother of Australian university lecturer Alison
Vicary, said that there was widespread outrage in Australia over
her detention and that anger could escalate.
	   ``We will not go away,'' said Vicary, who displayed a life-size
photograph of his sister. ``If that's what they want, that's what
will happen. I say to the Burmese government, release these
innocent people.''
	   Smith said it was ``premature'' for the United States to think
about imposing new sanctions on Myanmar, but said the government
had an ``opportunity, a small window'' to free the activists.
	   Washington last year barred U.S. companies from making new
investments in Myanmar due widespread human-rights violations and
the government's refusal to compromise with pro-democracy leader
Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.

Iran asks Jordan to shut down opposition Mujahedeen office
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Iran has asked Jordan to close down the
Amman office of the Iranian dissident group Mujahedeen Khalq,
government officials said Friday.
	   One official said the Iranian request was made earlier this week
during Foreign Minister Jawad Anani's three-day visit to Tehran.
	   Another official declined to say if Jordan had agreed to the
request. Both spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Mujahedeen Khalq has had a press office here since 1990.
	   The group played a role in toppling Shah Reza Pahlavi's regime.
But it also opposed the Islamic regime set up in 1979 by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and has operated in exile since 1981.
	   A Mujahedeen Khalq official said his group has not been
contacted by the Jordanian government and that ``we have not felt
any change in Jordanian attitude towards us.'' He declined further
comment and also insisted his name not be used.
	   On Thursday, the English-language Jordan Times said Anani
declined to disclose to lawmakers in a closed-door session
Wednesday if Jordan would agree to Iran's demand.
	   Jordan is unlikely to act until Tehran reins in Iranian-backed
Muslim militant groups, such as Hezbollah, or the Party of God, in
Lebanon, and hard-line Palestinian factions in Syria.
	   Jordan has accused these groups of efforts to destabilize the
country since its 1994 peace treaty with Israel.
	   Relations with Tehran have warmed since diplomatic ties were
restored in 1992 after a 12-year gap caused by Amman's support for
Iraq in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.

Hong Kong index roars back, but gains could be short-lived
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures for all markets; ADDS government
intervened in Hong Kong market

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets ended the week higher
Friday, with the key index in Hong Kong soaring 8.5 percent after
the government made a rare intervention to prop up the market.
	   After shedding 16 percent of its value and falling to a
five-year low in the first two weeks of August, the Hang Seng Index
rose 564.27 points to close at 7,224.69. On Thursday, the index
slumped 199.06 points, or 2.9 percent.
	   Financial Secretary Donald Tsang confirmed after the market
closed that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's de
facto central bank, had intervened in the stock and futures
markets.
	   He said this was done to fend off recent speculative attacks on
the Hong Kong dollar, which have caused local interbank interest
rates to rise and shares to plummet.
	   Tsang emphasised that Hong Kong's ``long-standing policy of
non-intervenion'' in the stock and futures markets remained
unchanged.
	   ``We only contemplate invervention in very exceptional
curcumstances,'' he added.
	   Traders said earlier it appeared that a few buyers had moved
into the market to buy up blue-chips and suggested they were trying
to cover short positions.
	   Thai share prices jumped 5.5 percent after the Thai central bank
said it would take over seven ailing financial institutions as part
of a plan to fix the country's banking sector.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index rose 12.75 points to
243.62.
	   Tokyo stocks tumbled to a seven-week low, led by electronics
companies, following declines on Wall Street.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 258.09 points,
or 1.68 percent, to close at 15,123.93 _ its lowest since June 24.
On Thursday, the Nikkei index edged up 3.05 points, or 0.02
percent.
	   Comments by the International Monetary Fund that Japan's
economic policies are not enough to pull its economy out of
recession also dampened investor sentiment, analysts said.
	   In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 144.88 yen as of
late afternoon, down 1.68 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and below
its late New York rate of 145.16 yen.
	   Elsewhere:
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed sharply higher in reaction to the
sharp rebound in Hong Kong. The Composite index rose 11.689 points,
or 2.9 percent, to 414.630.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly lower after a renewed
pullback on Wall Street overnight. The market's key Weighted Price
Index fell 14.51 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,348.04.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, with brokers
saying the share market reacted positively to New Zealand Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley's dismissal of her deputy, Winston Peters.
The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 27.85 points, or 1.4 percent, to
1,941.57.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher after six straight
sessions of losses. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30
selected stocks rose 34.63 points, or 2.7 percent, to 1,337.92.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, digging out of
early losses with a shot of momentum from the Hong Kong market. The
All Ordinaries Index rose 27.8 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,569.0.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed higher. The Korea COmposite Stock
Price Index rose 1.60 points, or 0.5 percent, to 304.61.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed mixed, although the
benchmark index posted a slight recovery after Thursday's 4.5
percent sell-off. The Composite Index rose 1.25 points, or 0.3
percent, to 327.98.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly higher. Te Straits Times

Cambodian appeals body turns away election complaints
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS allegation of attempted suborning of oppositon lawmaker
in last five grafs

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's highest legal body turned
away a stack of opposition complaints about last month's election
Friday, demanding they be refiled with a proper cover letter.
	   Opposition politician Sam Rainsy went to the Constitutional
Council building for the second time in two days to submit hundreds
of complaints about election irregularities.
	   He was submitting the appeals after the National Election
Committee earlier this week dismissed as ``baseless'' the more than
800 complaints alleging such problems as improper vote counting and
intimidation of voters.
	   The deputy office manager for the council confirmed that
reception staff turned away the stack of appeals saying that the
papers were not accompanied with a cover letter.
	   Sam Rainsy _ who said the rules for complaints do not mention
the need for a cover letter _ was told by the clerks moments
earlier that the National Election Committee had not officially
ruled on the complaints so there could no appeal.
	   ``This is very strange,'' an agitated Sam Rainsy told reporters
after he walked out of the building, leaving eight envelopes of
complaints at the reception desk.
	   ``They are not lawyers, they are petty clerks, but they
interpret the law,'' he said. ``I told them, `the laws are made by
members of parliament, and must be interpreted by the
Constitutional Council. You are not the Constitutional Council!'''
	   Even before attempting to register their complaints, the Sam
Rainsy Party had expressed doubt that the council, which like the
election committee is stacked with supporters of Hun Sen's ruling
party, would provide a fair hearing.
	   Cambodia held parliamentary elections on July 26, one year after
strongman Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-prime
minister in a coup d'etat.
	   Hun Sen hoped new elections would bring back his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and aid lost after his
takeover.
	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority
in the 122-seat National Assembly in the election, but not the
two-thirds majority needed to form a government.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy Party _ which
together won 58 parliamentary seats _ have alleged rampant fraud in
voting and ballot counting.
	   They have threatened to boycott parliament unless their
complaints are properly investigated.
	   A newly-elected member of parliament from Sam Rainsy's party
meanwhile accused Hun Sen of trying to buy his allegiance and
having his young nephew killed when he refused.
	   Monh Siyonn said Friday at a news conference that earlier this
week he was offered a villa, car, mobile phone, bodyguards and
money by a man he didn't know who said he was representing Hun Sen.
	   When he refused the offer, Monh Siyonn said, the man asked
whether he was not worried about his safety and that of his family.
Early Friday, his 25-year-old nephew died in a traffic accident, he
said.

Negotiators in Kosovo face lack of support
</HEADLINE>

urging halt to Serb offensive, ADDS Pentagon comment; EDITS. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's ethnic Albanian pacifist
leader said Friday that a Serbian offensive in the secessionist
province must stop before negotiations with the government can
begin.
	   ``The offensive in Kosovo must stop. We demand international
help and protection for the people of Kosovo by the United States,
the European Union, NATO and the United Nations,'' said Ibrahim
Rugova, who a day earlier announced a new team to resume talks with
the government.
	   But he failed to win the backing of the underground Kosovo
Liberation Army fighting for independence of the embattled southern
Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in
the population of 2 million. Serbia is the dominant of the two
republics that make up Yugoslavia.
	   Representatives of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
were expected to meet Friday with the team to hammer out a platform
for negotiations.
	   Earlier Friday, Mahmut Bakalli, an influential ethnic Albanian
politician, told The Associated Press, that an international
military intervention to guarantee a cease-fire in Kosovo is
necessary before ``real'' talks can start.
	   Bakalli, a veteran politician in Kosovo who enjoys the respect
of U.S. and other Western officials, downplayed Thursday's
announcement of a new ethnic Albanian negotiating team. Bakalli was
a member of Rugova's negotiating team, which held several meetings
with a Serbian government delegation but walked out in May to
protest a Serb military offensive.
	   In Washington, Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said
Thursday that the United States would ``strongly consider some sort
of participation'' in a NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo if a
diplomatic solution to the crisis can be found.
	   The NATO alliance is preparing ``plans for both air and ground
operations'' in the province, Bacon told reporters.
	   Rugova complained that the Serb offensive continues, especially
in the western region of Decani and Junik, a rebel stronghold near
the Albanian border where at least 1,000 civilians were last
reported to have fled. The besieged town repeatedly has been
shelled by Serb forces.
	   While not disclosing detailed figures, Rugova said, ``There are
a lot of killed and wounded civilians and material damage is
great.''
	   ``The humanitarian situation for the displaced people is very
grave. Their return is being prevented by the police. The return of
the refugees should be internationally monitored,'' he said.
	   In Germany, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said the time had come
for ``a serious discussion of an active intervention'' by NATO in
Kosovo.
	   ``We must now finally go on the offensive with the political
debate,'' Ruehe told Bild newspaper.
	   But U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who for weeks has been
struggling to persuade ethnic Albanian rebels and politicians to
join forces, said the ongoing violence made it imperative to start
talks immediately with or without the rebels.
	   The ethnic Albanians' five-member team is comprised mainly of
disciples of Rugova, who is supported by one branch of the KLA and
despised by others. Rugova, Hill and European diplomats hope the
rebels will join the talks when they see progress made.
	   The Serb-led government applauded Rugova's decision. So did
foreign powers.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has offered to discuss
restoring self-rule he revoked from Kosovo in 1989. But it remains
unclear what degree of autonomy Milosevic is willing to grant the
province, which Serbs consider the medieval cradle of their
national identity.

Share prices surge, officials confirm intervening in market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Only a day after hitting a five-year low, share
prices in Hong Kong soared 8.5 percent on Friday in a dramatic
advance spurred by government intervention to crush speculators.
	   After shedding 16 percent of its value and falling to a
five-year low in the first two weeks of August, the Hang Seng Index
rose 564.27 points to close at 7,224.69. On Thursday, the index had
slumped 199.06 points, or 2.9 percent.
	   Turnover on the market surged to 8.55 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 1.1 billion), up from Thursday's 5.14 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 658 million).
	   Following the market's close for a long holiday weekend,
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang confirmed that the government had
moved into the stock and futures markets to stabilize them.
	   He bitterly criticized speculators for what he said was an
effort to manipulate Hong Kong's markets, and said the government
acted in response to ``very exceptional circumstances.''
	   Until Tsang's announcement, the market's sharp movement had
surprised many traders.
	   During the trading day, they had said it appeared that a few
buyers had moved into the market to buy up blue-chips, and
suggested they were trying to cover short positions.
	   Short-selling is essentially a bet that the market will drop. An
investor borrows stocks and sells them, betting he can buy them
back at a lower price, repay the lender and pocket a profit.
	   Speculators can get badly burned, though, if the prices go up.
Then, they must buy hastily before prices go even higher.
	   ``We believe that the speculator's aim has been to undermine the
stability of the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar and to
produce sharply higher Hong Kong dollar interest rates, as well as
sharp falls in the stock markets,'' Tsang said.
	   He said that would have allowed them to profit from short
positions in the futures market.
	   Tsang accused speculators of spreading rumors about the
delinking of the Hong Kong currency's fixed peg to the U.S. dollar,
devaluation of the Chinese currency, and the instability of Hong
Kong banks.
	   Tsang refused to reveal the size of the government's effort.
	   Miles Remington, head of sales trading at SG Securities, told
Hong Kong radio that Tsang's announcement helped explain the
market's advance Friday. He added that investors are likely to be
skittish when markets reopen next Tuesday.
	   Analysts said none of the market's fundamentals had changed.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong rose 3.15 Hong Kong dollars to
32.00, and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 2.40 dollars to 24.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 7.00 dollars to
158.00, and Hang Seng Bank rose 3.20 dollars to 40.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 3.90 dollars to 35.60, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 1.50 dollars to 21.50.

Indonesian government vows thorough investigation of rapes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Responding to international criticism,
the government on Friday condemned rapes of ethnic Chinese women
during riots in Jakarta in May.
	   Women's groups say as many as 168 women, most of them Chinese,
were raped during the unrest, which helped oust former President
Suharto. Human rights activists said the government was slow to
investigate the abuses.
	   In a statement, the foreign ministry said it has ``moved
decisively'' to set up investigations into the sexual assaults.
	   It also said it would help provide facilities where victims and
their families could seek counseling from psychologists, legal
experts and religious leaders.
	   ``Anyone determined to have been responsible for these
reprehensible acts wil be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the
law,'' the ministry said.
	   A task force led by Marzuki Darusman, head of the government
National Commission on Human Rights, is conducting an inquiry into
the rapes. So far, there have been no arrests.
	   As many as 1,200 people died in the riots, in which mobs angry
over price increases targeted ethnic Chinese who are often targeted
because of their relative wealth. Chinese constitute just 4 percent
of Indonesia's 202 million people, but dominate the economy.
	   Outrage over the May rioting has galvanized ethnic Chinese
worldwide, sparking protests, some of them outside Indonesian
diplomatic offices, in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the United
States.
	   The Indonesian government has often been indifferent toward the
plight of Chinese when they are targeted. New President B.J.
Habibie, however, has said he would guarantee their security.
	   ``The government of the Republic of Indonesia will work to
ensure that the human rights of Indonesians of all ethnic groups
are continually protected,'' the foreign ministry said in its
statement.

Former British spy Tomlinson leaves New Zealand: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Former British spy Richard
Tomlinson, under watch for trying to sell his story, appeared
headed for Thailand on Friday after boarding a flight from his home
country, New Zealand.
	   Tomlinson boarded a flight at Auckland airport, was escorted off
by Auckland criminal intelligence officer, then allowed to reboard
after items seized during an earlier raid on his hotel room were
returned, the New Zealand Press Association reported.
	   Tomlinson had a business-class seat on a flight booked to
Singapore, then Thailand, the agency reported.
	   Tomlinson, 35, who worked for Britain's foreign intelligence
agency MI6 and has dual British and New Zealand citizenship, fled
to New Zealand last week after serving a four-month jail sentence
for trying to sell his story.
	   Publishers in New Zealand said they met with Tomlinson, raising
suspicions he still intends to publish a book.
	   New Zealand courts last week granted a temporary injunction
against Tomlinson, at the request of Britain's Foreign Office.
	   Alan Smith, managing director of Reed Publishing (New Zealand)
Ltd., confirmed he and an Australian publishing executive dined
with Tomlinson on Aug. 7, then traveled with him to the airport for
a flight to Australia.
	   Tomlinson was offloaded from a Qantas flight that night after
airline staff were told there were problems with his travel
documents.
	   ``We had some informal discussions about publishing a book about
his time in jail,'' Smith said.
	   Smith said New Zealand detectives had questioned him several
times about the meeting.
	   ``There was some concern among authorities that something had
been passed from Mr. Tomlinson to the publishers, but there had
not,'' he said.
	   ``We confined our conversation to the time in jail.''
	   A British Foreign Office spokesman said last week Tomlinson
could ``cause substantial harm to the operations of the Secret
Intelligence Service and in some cases put life and livelihoods at
risk.''
	   Items returned to Tomlinson on Friday included the synopsis of a
book, documents barring him from publishing it, and his cellphone,
NZPA reported.

Member of French film crew killed in accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A member of French director Luc
Besson's crew was killed in an accident when his all-terrain
motorbike hit a tree, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The daily Pravo said 43-year-old lighting engineer Pierre Jouan
Loyc died Thursday, shortly after he was taken to a hospital in
Bruntal, 350 kilometers (218 miles) east of Prague.
	   The accident in north Moravia happened on the first day of an
eight-week shoot. Besson's film, ``Joan of Arc,'' is being shot at
the dam of Slezska Harta near Bruntal.
	   Pravo said the area near Slezska Harta is sealed and strict
security measures are in place to keep away possible intruders. No
planes have been allowed above the area since Aug. 1.
	   Most of the shooting near Slezska Harta will be of battle
scenes, Pravo reported. Besson is director of ``The Fifth
Element.'' His new film stars Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich and
Faye Dunaway.

Philippine town commemorates slain U.S. Peace Corps volunteer

<TEXT>
	   ILOILO, Philippines (AP) _ Residents of a central Philippine
town lit candles and offered prayers Friday for a U.S. Peace Corps
volunteer who was among 10 people slain by a gang of robbers.
	   Vice Mayor John Arcosa called the death of Robert Bock, 33, of
New York, a ``senseless killing.''
	   Bock was murdered Wednesday night when five men, apparently
drunk or high on drugs, fired assault rifles and pistols at the
occupants of four passing vehicles, including Bock's van, and then
stole the victims' belongings.
	   Arcosa said officials in the town of Concepcion, where Bock
lived, asked U.S. Embassy officers who came to retrieve his body to
allow an overnight wake for Bock but were turned down. Instead,
residents burned candles at their doors in a sign of mourning, he
said.
	   ``He will sorely be missed,'' Arcosa said. ``He was very much a
part of Concepcion. He was well-loved by the people.''
	   The killings took place on a road in Sara town near Concepcion.
	   Bock, whose parents are from Virginia, was helping the Iloilo
provincial government in fisheries management and the conservation
of coral reefs. He was assigned to Iloilo last year and was one of
four American Peace Corps volunteers working there, the U.S. Peace
Corps office in Manila said.
	   Police said a suspect who was picked up for questioning Thursday
was arrested after tests showed traces of nitrates on his hands,
indicating he had recently fired a gun.
	   Later Friday, police arrested another suspect who offered no
resistance, Sara police chief Romualdo Bayting said.
	   The U.S. Embassy strongly condemned the attack. It said there
was no indication Bock or the United States was specifically
targeted.
	   The Peace Corps returned to the Philippines in 1992 after an
18-month absence following the kidnapping of a volunteer. Bock was
one of 108 volunteers in the country, many working in development
and environmental projects.
	   Iloilo is about 460 kilometers (285 miles) south of Manila.

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Mark Ruiz, the bronze medalist in the Goodwill
Games last month in the men's 1-meter springboard, won gold in the
same event Thursday night in the U.S. National Diving
Championships.
	   The dive that made the difference at the Georgia Tech Aquatic
Center was his fourth attempt, a reverse 2 1-2 somersault that was
awarded three scores of 9.0.
	   ``My confidence level is pretty high right now,'' said Ruiz, a
19-year-old native of Puerto Rico and a resident of Orlando,
Florida. ``I felt pretty good going in, so I can't say I was
surprised to win.''
	   Ruiz, who also enters Sunday's platform competition in first
place, beat silver medalist Troy Dumais by 22.92 points. Dumais, an
18-year-old Los Angeles resident, said a left foot injury proved
too much to overcome.
	   P.J. Bogart, 24, a former University of Minnesota standout, took
the bronze, 24.21 points behind Ruiz.
	   In the women's platform competition earlier Thursday night,
Danielle Guarneri took first place. But even though she goes into
Sunday's final the No. 1 seed, Guarneri enters the event with only
155.43 points _ last among the eight divers in the last round.
	   Laura Wilkinson, the platform gold medalist in the Goodwill
Games last month, enters the final as the sixth seed but will carry
the most points _ 187.92 _ into Sunday's final event for women.
	   Divers who score high in the semifinals, a four-dive event
consisting only of voluntary attempts, can carry more points into
the final.
	   Kathy Pesek takes the second-most points into the final, 168.27,
and Powers was third with 167.85.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's former President Farooq
Leghari launched a new political party on Pakistan's independence
day Friday with pledges to bail the country out of its worsening
economic and political crisis.
	   Leghari told about 2,000 supporters that Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif ``has simply failed to deliver,'' while the opposition
Pakistan Peoples' Party led by Benazir Bhutto also had disappointed
the people of Pakistan. Leghari had been a member of Bhutto's
party.
	   The Millat Party, or ``Nation's Party,'' will fight to help the
country's poor, he said.
	   Leghari, a wealthy landowner, was elected president in 1993 with
Bhutto's support. But he fired his benefactor in 1996 on charges of
corruption and misrule, which she denies. The move paved way for
Sharif to sail to power in 1997 elections.
	   Later, Leghari also clashed with Sharif in a power struggle and
was forced to step down from the presidency last September.
	   Leghari enjoys faithful following in a few areas of populace
Punjab province, where his tribespeople are in the majority.

Jewish leader sees pressure on German banks following Swiss
</HEADLINE>
Holocaust settlement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A German Jewish leader said Friday he
hoped for a quick resolution to claims by Holocaust victims against
German banks following the settlement reached this week with Swiss
institutions.
	   An dlrs 18 billion lawsuit filed in New York in June on behalf
of 10,000 Holocaust survivors and relatives of victims charges that
Deutsche and Dresdner banks, Germany's two largest, knowingly
accepted, laundered or sold property of Nazi victims during World
War II.
	   Michel Friedman, board member of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, said more important than any negotiated settlement was the
principle ``that the amnesia of Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank _
like others _ is dissolved.''
	   In an interview with North German Radio, he accused both
financial institutions of trying to present ``active cooperation in
the Nazi era as pure business.''
	   Munich attorney Michael Witti, one of several lawyers
representing the Holocaust survivors in their lawsuit against the
German banks, called on Dresdner to release a report by historians
on its activities during the Nazi era. The bank announced it had
commissioned such a report months ago.
	   Deutsche Bank released a similar report last month, in which
independent historians confirmed the bank had profited from gold
plundered from Holocaust victims.
	   On Wednesday, Switzerland's two biggest commercial banks agreed
to pay dlrs 1.25 billion in an out-of-court settlement of Holocaust
survivors' claims against them.

More conservative infighting over links to far right
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's conservatives were shaken by more
infighting Friday when an influential member of the Liberal
Democracy party quit for taking in a politician with links to the
far-right National Front.
	   The party's revolving door spun a day after a conservative
regional president, kicked out of the center-right Union for French
Democracy for accepted National Front votes, joined Liberal
Democracy.
	   Gilles de Robien, a longtime moderate leader in the National
Assembly, said he was quitting Liberal Democracy and rejoining the
Union for French Democracy (UDF). He urged his colleagues to
follow.
	   As for Liberal Democracy, led by the maverick free-marketeer
Alain Madelin, de Robien told France 3 TV he had ``nothing more to
do with that family that has no more republican ideals.''
	   Jacques Blanc, one of four UDF leaders who accepted National
Front votes to remain regional presidents after March elections,
said Thursday that he was joining Liberal Democracy. Blanc
represents the southern region of Languedoc-Roussillon.
	   Madelin, and ex-finance minister, had supported Blanc and the
three other UDF leaders expelled from their party after they
accepted votes from National Front regional council members to beat
back leftist challenges in the wake of the elections.
	   The Front, led by the charismatic former paratrooper Jean-Marie
Le Pen, blames immigration for high urban crime and double-digit
unemployment. It has maintained about 15 percent support
nationwide, but in some regions garnered a third of the vote in
March, becoming a kingmaker in regional governments.
	   The conservative coalition splintered after its leader,
President Jacques Chirac, called early legislative elections in
June last year that propelled Socialist Lionel Jospin to the prime
ministership.
	   Since then, Jospin has maintained generally moderate policies in
a ``cohabitation'' with Chirac, while conservatives cast about for
a new platform. The regional elections in March confirmed the
leftist hold on French politics.

Russia restores the `Great' in ancient city name
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin said Friday that
he would soon sign a decree making this northern Russian city
``great'' again.
	   Yeltsin said he would change Novgorod's name back to Veliky
Novgorod, or ``Novgorod the Great,'' as it was called in medieval
times, when it was the most important city in what is now Russia.
	   ``I am grateful to you, residents of Veliky Novgorod, for all
that you are doing for the great Russia,'' he said during a visit,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``When looking through the figures, one cannot help but be
surprised and must say how good they are. Novgorod deserves to be
called `Veliky.'''
	   Novgorod, about 500 kilometers (300 miles) northwest of Moscow,
was an important cultural and trade center in medieval Russia. It
celebrates its 1,140th anniversary this year.
	   Archaeologists have found a wealth of coins and other artifacts
in the surrounding area from the period. The city's numerous
monuments comprise a UNESCO World Heritage site.

British pop stars to help fight polio in Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Two British pop stars _ one a polio
victim himself _ are flying to Sri Lanka to campaign for polio
immunization in the Tamil heartland, which has been wracked by an
ethnic war for 15 years, a UNICEF official said Friday.
	   Rocker Ian Dury, of the Blockheads, and former Take That idol
Robbie Williams will be in Jaffna on Wednesday when the polio
immunization program will be launched.
	   ``We are happy to say that it will greatly help Sri Lankan
children,'' said Joseph Mahase, program coordinator for the United
Nations Children's Education Fund.
	   Dury, a polio victim, and will fly with Williams, a U.N.
goodwill ambassador, Mahase said.
	   As in the past, both the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil
Tiger separatists are expected to stop fighting during the
immunization campaign.
	   Health officials say 95 percent of Sri Lankan children have been
immunized, but the program is expected to continue until the
disease is eradicated.

Thailand unveils package to rescue financial system
</HEADLINE>

rescue plan; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai government on Friday unveiled
a raft of measures to try to repair the country's debt-ridden
banking sector, the major move involving recapitalizing commercial
banks through a major government bond issue.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Lee-atham explained how the
government would issue 300 billion baht (dlrs 7.14 billion) in
10-year bonds and take equity stakes in ailing banks and finance
companies by subscribing to newly-issued preferred shares.
	   In a nationally-televised news conference, Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda gave an overview of the plan, which is
considered essential for reviving the recession-bound economy.
	   Thailand's financial sector all but collapsed last year after a
slowdown in the economy exposed insolvency in companies in many
sectors of business.
	   Under the plan, the banks will also have to set up their own
asset management corporations to manage their bad loans. After
closing down dozens of insolvent finance companies last year, the
government formed a separate asset management corporation to
dispose of their bad assets. That approach was rejected in the case
of the banks
	   Earlier Friday, Thailand's central bank said it is taking over
seven debt-ridden financial institutions and purging their top
executives as the first part of the comprehensive package to rescue
the country's tottering financial system.
	   A bank statement said a new board of directors and management
would be appointed to head the two banks and five finance companies
that were nationalized.
	   ``The current boards, if found in any misconduct, shall face
legal procedures,'' the statement said.
	   Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Kitti Patpongpibul said
non-performing loans will be written off existing shareholder
equity. The institutions' 10 baht (25 U.S. cents) shares will be
written down to .01 baht a share.
	   The central bank's rescue fund, the Financial Institutions
Development Fund, will then take over the seven institutions with
swaps of debt for new shares. In some cases cash will also have to
be injected, and at a later stage the institutions will be merged
with others or possibly offered for sale.
	   The majority of Thailand's 15 commercial banks have failed to
raise adequate new capital from the private sector after becoming
laden with bad debt. Four were nationalized earlier this year.
	   Domestic political pressure is rising on the government, with
unemployment expected to hit almost 3 million this year, up from 1
million last year.
	   Opposition politicians have accused the government of committing
billions to prop up financial institutions owned by rich families,
while the poor suffer from factory closures and rising food prices.
	   A delegation from the International Monetary Fund was recently
in Bangkok negotiating terms of the latest quarterly installment of
a dlrs 17.2 billion fund to help rescue Thailand's economy.

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Eighteen foreign activists arrested last

most of the day from nine prosecution witnesses.
	   In Myanmar courts, the prosecution presents its case and then

<TEXT>
	   In Manila, Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Lauro Baja said:
``Let my people go.''
	   In Bangkok, Thailand, weeping and angry relatives appealed at a
news conference for their release.
	   They were joined by a U.S. congressman, Rep. Chris Smith,
chairman of the House International Operations and Human Rights
subcommittee, who accused the government of committing a ``public
relations disaster.''
	   Smith, a New Jersey Republican who has a constituent, Michele
Keegan, 19, among the detainees described them ``idealistic,
empathetic and caring about democracy.''
	   Smith said it would be ``premature'' to discuss new U.S.
sanctions against Myanmar but ``right now, there's an opportunity,
a small window, to release these people.''
	   The activists were detained Sunday, the day after the 10th
anniversary of a failed nationwide democracy uprising, for handing
out small cards to Myanmar citizens telling them the outside world
supported their struggle and to not give up.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. More than 3,000 demonstrators were
gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   The 18 foreign activists have been kept at a police guest house
in the capital. Diplomats who have visited them have described them
as cheerful, well-fed and treated humanely.
	   The government issued a statement this week saying their release
had been delayed because they were being uncooperative.
	   The military is attempting to find a way to discourage foreign
activists from entering Myanmar and inciting revolt, while at the
same time avoiding repercussions from the governments of countries
from which the activists come.
	   Earlier this year, the military government sentenced a
British-Australian national, James Mawdsley, to five years in
prison for also handing out pro-democracy leaflets. He was released
after three months.
	   Mawdsley had been detained in 1997 for a similar action, but was
deported with just a warning not to return. His trial was the first
open to some members of the public in decades and he was
represented by a lawyer.
	   Myanmar citizens put on trial rarely ever receive an attorney to
defend them, democracy and human rights activists have said.
	   Trials usually consist of reading out the charges and sentencing
the accused they say. Most trials take less than an hour.
	   Political prisoners are frequently subjected to torture and kept
in solitary confinement or cells meant for military dogs, human
rights groups and former prisoners say.

Head of group that sought asset return hails settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VITA BEKKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The head of an organization that has
battled for the return of Holocaust survivors' assets on Friday
called a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement with Swiss banks a moral
victory.
	   ``We have achieved a historic agreement...not only because of
the money, but because of the statement made publicly in court by
the Swiss banks saying, `We have sinned, we betrayed a trust,'''
Avraham Burg told reporters, using a phrase echoing a Jewish
prayer.
	   Burg, chairman of the World Jewish Restitution Organization,
said meetings would be held in New York next week to begin working
out details surrounding the disbursement of the funds. The
settlement still needs a judge's approval.
	   In the years leading up to World War II, many European Jews
deposited money in secret Swiss bank accounts, expecting to
retrieve it later. But after the war, banks often told Holocaust
survivors or their heirs they could not find the accounts.
	   The settlement agreement calls for the money to be paid out to
survivors and their heirs over four years by the two largest Swiss
commercial banks _ UBS AG and the Credit Suisse _ against whom most
of the claims have been filed.
	   The settlement would cover all claims against them, plus all
other Swiss banks, the Swiss government and Swiss industry.
	   Echoing statements by Israeli leaders, Burg _ whose organization
spurned previous, smaller settlement offers from the Swiss _ vowed
to go after other companies and countries that have held back
assets of Holocaust survivors.
	   ``It is possible that it will be followed by another battle.
There is still millions of dollars missing that disappeared in
those days,'' he said on his arrival in Tel Aviv from the United
States.
	   The settlement agreement, reached Wednesday in New York, calls
for the money to be paid out over four years by the two largest
Swiss commercial banks _ UBS AG and the Credit Suisse _ against
whom most of the claims have been filed.
	   The settlement would cover all claims against them, plus all
other Swiss banks, the Swiss government and Swiss industry.
	   The banks said they expected ``other Swiss companies and
institutions will contribute to the financing of this sum.''
	   Lawsuits are still pending in the United States against 16
European insurance companies and two German banks. In addition, the
Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental group that acts as a liaison
between Israel and world Jewry, is looking into reports that
Portugal and other countries allegedly helped the Nazis move gold
taken from Jews to South America.

Foreign activists plead guilty as Myanmar puts them on trial

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Eighteen foreign activists arrested last
week for handing out pro-democracy leaflets in the Myanmar capital
of Yangon, pleaded guilty to violating sedition laws during a trial
Friday.
	   A judge was considering what sentence to impose.
	   The six Americans, three Malaysians, three Indonesians, three
Thais, two Filipinos and one Australian were charged, after six
days of questioning and investigation, with violating section the
1950 Emergency Provision Act.
	   The sweeping law allows authorities to hand out maximum 20-year
jail sentences for attempting to incite unrest or disrupt the peace
and stability of the state.
	   The defendants and foreign diplomats who attended the trial
appeared relaxed and jovial as the judge read out the charges and
asked for pleas from the accused after listening to testimony for
most of the day from nine prosecution witnesses.
	   In Myanmar courts, the prosecution presents its case and then
defendants are allowed to enter a plea and ask for a lawyer.
	   Various diplomats asked to consult with the defendants during
the break, but were denied permission. A single judge, Khang Gyi,
presided. There was no jury. The trial was open to diplomats and
journalists.
	   The courtroom was a concrete building outside the walls of
Insein Prison, where hundreds of political prisoners are kept along
with violent criminals.
	   A diplomat who visited the American activists Thursday said
embassies were not informed of the trial until Friday morning.
	   ``I hope they will be treated leniently,'' said U.S. Charge
d'Affaires Kent Wiedemann as he entered the courtroom.
	   In Manila, Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Lauro Baja said:
``Let my people go.''
	   In Bangkok, Thailand, weeping and angry relatives appealed at a
news conference for their release.
	   They were joined by a U.S. congressman, Rep. Chris Smith,
chairman of the House International Operations and Human Rights
subcommittee, who accused the government of committing a ``public
relations disaster.''
	   Smith, a New Jersey Republican who has a constituent, Michele
Keegan, 19, among the detainees described them ``idealistic,
empathetic and caring about democracy.''
	   Smith said it would be ``premature'' to discuss new U.S.
sanctions against Myanmar but ``right now, there's an opportunity,
a small window, to release these people.''
	   The activists were detained Sunday, the day after the 10th
anniversary of a failed nationwide democracy uprising, for handing
out small cards to Myanmar citizens telling them the outside world
supported their struggle and to not give up.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. More than 3,000 demonstrators were
gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   The 18 foreign activists have been kept at a police guest house
in the capital. Diplomats who have visited them have described them
as cheerful, well-fed and treated humanely.
	   The government issued a statement this week saying their release
had been delayed because they were being uncooperative.
	   The military is attempting to find a way to discourage foreign
activists from entering Myanmar and inciting revolt, while at the
same time avoiding repercussions from the governments of countries
from which the activists come.
	   Earlier this year, the military government sentenced a
British-Australian national, James Mawdsley, to five years in
prison for also handing out pro-democracy leaflets. He was released
after three months.
	   Mawdsley had been detained in 1997 for a similar action, but was
deported with just a warning not to return. His trial was the first
open to some members of the public in decades and he was
represented by a lawyer.
	   Myanmar citizens put on trial rarely ever receive an attorney to
defend them, democracy and human rights activists have said.
	   Trials usually consist of reading out the charges and sentencing
the accused they say. Most trials take less than an hour.
	   Political prisoners are frequently subjected to torture and kept
in solitary confinement or cells meant for military dogs, human
rights groups and former prisoners say.

Agreement gives human rights access to East Timor, U.N. says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ An agreement between the United Nations and
Indonesia will allow human rights observers ``access to all the
territory'' including East Timor, a U.N. spokesman said Friday.
	   On Thursday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and
Indonesia signed an agreement ``for cooperation in the promotion
and protection of human rights.''
	   The negotiation of the agreement, under way since 1994, was
``probably helped by events in Indonesia recently,'' said Jose
Diaz, spokesman for the U.N. human rights office.
	   Observers are to be given access to all regions ``to be able to
access priority needs,'' the office said in a statement. ``This is
understood to include facilitating access to East Timor.''
	   Personnel assigned to the program, which involves assisting
Indonesia's national human rights commission and other projects,
will be based in Jakarta, Diaz said. A representative there has yet
to be appointed.
	   East Timor has endured civil unrest, guerrilla warfare and human
rights abuses since Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the
territory as its 27th province the following year.
	   The United Nations is currently brokering peace talks on East
Timor's future with Indonesia and Portugal, the territory's former
colonial master.
	   Changes in the military's attitude toward Indonesia's
troublesome provinces have been made in the wake of the resignation
of longtime ruler Suharto.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised greater
political freedom and respect for human rights.
	   The Portuguese news agency Lusa reported that the country's
foreign ministry was ``satisfied'' with the agreement, which is
valid for two years.
	   ``It will allow improved observation of the Human Rights
situation in East Timor,'' Lusa quoted a ministry spokesman as
saying.

Head of group that sought asset return hails settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VITA BEKKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The head of an organization that has
battled for the return of Holocaust survivors' assets on Friday
called a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement with Swiss banks a moral
victory.
	   ``We have achieved a historic agreement ... not only because of
the money, but because of the statement made publicly in court by
the Swiss banks saying, `We have sinned, we betrayed a trust,'''
Avraham Burg told reporters, using a phrase echoing a Jewish
prayer.
	   Burg, chairman of the World Jewish Restitution Organization,
said meetings would be held in New York next week to begin working
out details surrounding the disbursement of the funds. The
settlement still needs a judge's approval.
	   In the years leading up to World War II, many European Jews
deposited money in secret Swiss bank accounts, expecting to
retrieve it later. But after the war, banks often told Holocaust
survivors or their heirs they could not find the accounts.
	   The settlement agreement, reached Wednesday in New York, calls
for the money to be paid out over four years by the two largest
Swiss commercial banks _ UBS AG and the Credit Suisse _ against
whom most of the claims have been filed.
	   The settlement would cover all claims against them, plus all
other Swiss banks, the Swiss government and Swiss industry.
	   Echoing statements by Israeli leaders, Burg, whose organization
spurned previous, smaller settlement offers from the Swiss, vowed
to go after other companies and countries that have held back
assets of Holocaust survivors.
	   ``It is possible that it will be followed by another battle.
There is still millions of dollars missing that disappeared in
those days,'' he said on his arrival in Tel Aviv from the United
States.
	   The banks said they expected ``other Swiss companies and
institutions will contribute to the financing of this sum.''
	   Lawsuits are still pending in the United States against 16
European insurance companies and two German banks. In addition, the
Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental group that acts as a liaison
between Israel and world Jewry, is looking into reports that
Portugal and other countries allegedly helped the Nazis move gold
taken from Jews to South America.

Economic official worried Japan could slip into deflationary spiral
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An influential economic official said on Friday he
is worried that the troubled Japanese economy may fall into a
deflationary spiral.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, the head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency,
also told reporters the Japanese economy would likely worsen before
it recovers.
	   Businesses are under intense pressure to lower prices amid a
stubborn slump in consumption. Economists worry that falling prices
will cut into corporate earnings and trigger salary cuts and rising
unemployment, dampening consumer confidence further.
	   Sakaiya predicted that there would be no growth in Japan's gross
domestic product for the fiscal year that began April 1.
	   Japan's gross domestic product for the fiscal year that ended in
March shrank by 0.7 percent, the first full year of economic
contraction since 1974.
	   Touching on when Japan's economic recovery might begin, Sakaiya
said, ``the government is saying it will happen within two years,
but I feel that it will be a little earlier.''

Kabila flees Kinshasa, rebels on the march
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more detail on situation in Kinshasa;
countries urging citizens to leave, flights canceled, background,

 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila has fled Congo's
embattled capital as rebel forces pushed toward Kinshasa, a senior
government official said Friday.
	   ``The president is not in Kinshasa,'' the high-level government
adviser told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. ``I
can't tell you any more than that.''
	   A Western diplomat in Paris, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Kabila was in Lubumbashi, his former rebel base, but had no
further information on his plans.
	   With rebel forces advancing on Kinshasa from the west, the
jittery Congolese capital awoke Friday without electricity, radio,
television or newspapers.
	   The city was bracing for the expected arrival of fighters who
launched a rebellion against Kabila earlier this month. Rumors and
gossip fueled an uneasy sense of muffled panic. Thousands of people
packed sidewalk shops and markets to buy extra provisions,
anticipating what many consider the imminent fall of the capital to
the rebels.
	   With water cut off by the electricity outage, groups of women
trod back and forth to the shores of the Congo River to fill basins
with brown, polluted water for their families.
	   The power outage also silenced state-controlled television and
radio _ though later reports said state radio had returned
intermittently. No newspapers were published Friday.
	   ``This is the end,'' said Jean-Pierre Mwenge, standing amid a
crowd of people searching for transport out of the city. ``Now I'm
alone and this will be the end.''
	   Asked where he would go, Mwenge just shrugged.
	   Amid a rush of people trying to withdraw money, banks throughout
the city closed Friday to avoid a drain on reserves.
	   The rebellion began earlier this month when Tutsi-led rebels
closely tied to Rwanda fought government troops in the capital and
opened up fronts in both the east and west of this central African
nation. Many of the rebels were the same soldiers who helped bring
Kabila to power and oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last
year.
	   Congo accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of masterminding the
uprising. Both countries vehemently deny involvement.
	   Congo's relations with his former allies have been deteriorating
throughout Kabila's 14 months of rule, and last month he expelled
Rwandan soldiers. Uganda and Rwanda have been angered by the
Congolese president's failure to contain attacks on their territory
by renegade groups based in eastern Congo.
	   On Thursday, rebels reportedly claimed that they had captured
one-third of the country. It was unclear Friday how much control
Kabila continued to wield after fleeing the capital.
	   The United States was preparing for the emergency evacuation of
its citizens, while foreign airlines _ including Belgian, South
African and Ethiopian carriers _ stopped service to Kinshasa in the
wake of the escalating crisis.
	   A French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said France sent a plane
to Kinshasa to pick up its nationals wishing to leave while Germany
also strongly advised its citizens to depart.
	   A primary exit route across the Congo River to Brazzaville, the
capital of neighboring Republic of Congo, was closed days ago with
all traffic across the water stopped.
	   Before leaving Kinshasa, Kabila sacked his new military
commander Celestin Kifwa _ the president's brother-in-law _ and
replaced him with Kalume Numbi. Kabila appointed Kifwa last month
after firing James Kabari, a Rwandan commander who had been a close
ally of Kabila's during his war against Mobutu.
	   Kabari, also known in Rwanda as Kabarere, has since joined the
rebel movement.
	   Numbi was a former general in Mobutu's army.
	   Western diplomats and rebel spokesmen on Thursday said the
insurgent forces had captured the town of Inga, about 200
kilometers (135 miles) from the capital, where the primary power
transformer for Kinshasa is located.
	   The rebels also said some of their troops had advanced as far as
Kasangalu, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   Rebel leaders in Goma said Kinshasa was now in their sights.
	   ``The objective is Kinshasa. It should fall in the next few
days, by the end of the week or by the end of the month for sure,''
rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said Thursday in the eastern
city of Goma.
	   In the United States, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said two
Marine amphibious warships had been dispatched to the Atlantic
waters off Congo in case they are needed to evacuate U.S. citizens.
	   It will take nine or ten days for the ships to reach Congo,
Bacon said.
	   In the capital, rage and anger at Rwanda were giving way to
fear, as many people speculated over their fate.
	   ``It's time to pray now,'' said Amina Nzuze, a waitress. Her
restaurant, like many small businesses shut for fear of looting
during the dark of night.
	   Rumors of ethnic attacks by both sides only worsened the fear of
what will happen if and when the rebels arrive.
	   On Thursday, Congo and Rwanda exchanged accusations of
ethnic-motivated attacks against Hutu and Tutsi civilians.

Greece says regional threats forcing weapons build-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Growing threats from Turkey force Greece
to stick to costly military build-up plans despite economic
hardships that have led to strikes and protests, senior government
officials said Friday.
	   ``Greece is facing with calmness and sobriety existing threats
in the general region,'' Premier Simitis said in an obvious
reference to rival Turkey.
	   Defense Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos urged for Greece to
maintain a strong military presence, including honoring its defense
pledge with Greek Cypriots.
	   The remarks were made to coincide with the Aug. 15 holiday that
marks the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. In Greece, the day also is
used to celebrate the armed forces.
	   Greece has earmarked an estimated dlrs 24 billion over the next
five years for new fighter jets, missiles, ships, tanks and other
weapons. Turkey also is upgrading its military forces.
	   The program has further strained Greece's economy, already
shaken from austerity programs designed to allow the country to
join the European Union's single currency group in 2001. Efforts to
sell state companies and restructure the economy have led to
widespread protests and strikes.
	   Since the early 1980s, Greece has tailored its defensive
doctrine to deal with a possible war with its neighbor and fellow
NATO member.
	   The two countries almost fought over a barren Aegean Sea rock
two years ago, the third time they have nearly gone to war in the
past 24 years.
	   Such a conflict could come in the late fall if Cyprus goes ahead
with the deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Turkey has threatened to take military action to stop the
missiles from being placed around a newly-built Greek Cypriot air
force base in southern Cyprus.
	   Ankara fears the missiles could be used to protect Greek jet
fighters at the base, whose presence would disturb Turkey's
strategic superiority and shift the balance of forces on the
island.
	   Cyprus has been divided into Greek- and Turkish-speaking sectors
since the Turkish occupation of its northern third. Turkey keeps
about 35,000 troops in the north, where a breakaway Turkish Cypriot
state is recognized only by Ankara.
	   Under a joint defense agreement between Greece and Cyprus, any
Turkish attack on the island will be considered an attack against
Greece proper.
	   Tsochadzopoulos described the agreement as ``a joint priority
... that armors the joint security of Greece and Cyprus.''

 &UR; Foreign activists sentenced to five years hard labor
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with activists get five years hard labor

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Eighteen foreign activists arrested last
week for handing out pro-democracy leaflets were sentenced to five
years hard labor after pleading guilty Friday to violating sedition
laws.
	   The six Americans, three Malaysians, three Indonesians, three
Thais, two Filipinos and one Australian were charged, after six
days of questioning and investigation, with violating the 1950
Emergency Provision Act.
	   The sweeping law allows authorities to hand out maximum 20-year
jail sentences for attempting to incite unrest or disrupt the peace
and stability of the state.

Head of group that sought asset return hails settlement

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The head of an organization that has
battled for the return of Holocaust survivors' assets on Friday
called a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement with Swiss banks a moral
victory.
	   ``We have achieved a historic agreement...not only because of
the money, but because of the statement made publicly in court by
the Swiss banks saying, `We have sinned, we betrayed a trust,'''
Avraham Burg told reporters, using a phrase echoing a Jewish
prayer.
	   Burg, chairman of the World Jewish Restitution Organization,
said meetings would be held in New York next week to begin working
out details surrounding the disbursement of the funds. The
settlement still needs a judge's approval.
	   In the years leading up to World War II, many European Jews
deposited money in secret Swiss bank accounts, expecting to
retrieve it later. But after the war, banks often told Holocaust
survivors or their heirs they could not find the accounts.
	   The settlement agreement calls for the money to be paid out to
survivors and their heirs over four years by the two largest Swiss
commercial banks _ UBS AG and the Credit Suisse _ against whom most
of the claims have been filed.
	   The settlement would cover all claims against them, plus all
other Swiss banks, the Swiss government and Swiss industry.
	   Echoing statements by Israeli leaders, Burg _ whose organization
spurned previous, smaller settlement offers from the Swiss _ vowed
to go after other companies and countries that have held back
assets of Holocaust survivors.
	   ``It is possible that it will be followed by another battle.
There is still millions of dollars missing that disappeared in
those days,'' he said on his arrival in Tel Aviv from the United
States.
	   Lawsuits are still pending in the United States against 16
European insurance companies and two German banks. In addition, the
Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental group that acts as a liaison
between Israel and world Jewry, is looking into reports that
Portugal and other countries allegedly helped the Nazis move gold
taken from Jews to South America.

Rafsanjani hits U.S. foreign policy, anti-Taliban protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Embassy Bombings &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian official on Friday expressed
regret over twin attacks on American embassies in East Africa but
said the United States must look to its own foreign policy for
clues to the motives.
	   Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former president who now heads a
powerful government advisory board, also demanded that the Taliban
militia free the Iranians _ including 11 diplomats _ that have been
taken prisoner in Afghanistan.
	   After his sermon following Friday prayers, about 400 Iranians
demonstrated in front of the Pakistani Embassy shouting ``Death to
the Taliban.''
	   They threw eggs, rotten vegetables and stones, which broke two
of the embassy's windows.
	   About 100 Iranian policemen surrounded the embassy and held the
demonstrators back. The protest broke up after about half an hour.
	   In his sermon, Rafsanjani said of the embassy bombings in East
Africa: ``We condemn this attack, and we are in no way happy about
it.''
	   But he suggested that America may have brought the bombings on
itself by policies that Muslims see as biased toward Israel.
	   ``The United States allows the Israelis to Judaize Jerusalem,
and this will not enable the United States to have a good image
among Muslims,'' he said.
	   Jerusalem is holy to Muslims because it is the site of the
Al-Aqsa Mosque.
	   Arab and Muslim nations have been critical of the United States
for failing to stop Israel from building settlements in Arab east
Jerusalem and in the West Bank. Israel also has been criticized for
making it difficult for Muslims to visit Al-Aqsa and other holy
sites in Jerusalem.
	   ``We think it's better for the United States to allocate the
dlrs 2 million reward money to scholars to find out why this kind
of attack is always made against American targets,'' Rafsanjani
said.
	   The U.S. government is offering a dlrs 2 million reward for
information leading to the capture of the bombers of its embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania. Last week's attacks killed 257 people,
including 12 Americans.
	   During his Friday prayer sermon, Rafsanjani also criticized
Washington for allowing an Iranian opposition group that Tehran
considers a terrorist organization to operate in the United States.
	   ``The United States allows the Mujahedeen Khalq organization to
open a bank account, an office and run a television station,''
Rafsanjani complained. ``This is something they would never allow
an Egyptian terrorist organization, for example, to do.''
	   The Mujahedeen Khalq played a role in toppling Shah Reza
Pahlavi's regime, but later turned against the Islamic regime set
up in 1979 by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. It has operated
in exile since 1981, mainly from bases in Iraq.
	   Jordanian officials said Friday that Tehran has asked the
country to close the Mujahedeen Khalq's press office in Amman. The
officials declined to say if they would agree to the request.
	   Rafsanjani also demanded that the Taliban militia release the
Iranians it has taken prisoner in Afghanistan.
	   ``We warn the Taliban and their supporters that we will no
longer tolerate that our beloved sons and brothers remain detained
in Afghanistan,'' Rafsanjani said.
	   Tehran says 11 diplomats, a journalist and 32 drivers were
seized in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif, which the
Taliban overran Saturday.
	   The Taliban say they know nothing about the Iranian diplomats
but claim to be holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming the
Taliban's enemies.
	   Tehran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the Iranians'
safety because Pakistan is widely believed to back the Taliban,
which is battling a northern-based opposition alliance.
	   Iran is widely believed to have supplied arms to the
anti-Taliban alliance.

 &UR; YANGON: the state

<TEXT>
	   Before the verdict was read, the defendants and foreign
diplomats who attended the trial appeared relaxed and jovial as the
judge read out the charges and asked for pleas from the accused
after listening to testimony for most of the day from nine
prosecution witnesses.
	   Speculation in foreign embassies and outside the country was
that the Myanmar government would deport the activists after trying
them.
	   Various diplomats had asked during the day to consult with the
defendants, but were denied permission. A single judge, Khang Gyi,
presided. There was no jury. The trial was open to diplomats and
journalists.
	   The courtroom was a concrete building outside the walls of
Insein Prison, where hundreds of political prisoners are kept along
with violent criminals.
	   A diplomat who visited the American activists Thursday said
embassies were not informed of the trial until Friday morning.
	   ``I hope they will be treated leniently,'' said U.S. Charge
d'Affaires Kent Wiedemann as he entered the courtroom.
	   In Manila, Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Lauro Baja said:
``Let my people go.''
	   In Bangkok, Thailand, weeping and angry relatives appealed at a
news conference for their release.
	   They were joined by a U.S. congressman, Rep. Chris Smith,
chairman of the House International Operations and Human Rights
subcommittee, who accused the government of committing a ``public
relations disaster.''
	   Smith, a New Jersey Republican who has a constituent, Michele
Keegan, 19, among the detainees described them ``idealistic,
empathetic and caring about democracy.''
	   Smith said it would be ``premature'' to discuss new U.S.
sanctions against Myanmar but ``right now, there's an opportunity,
a small window, to release these people.''
	   The activists were detained Sunday, the day after the 10th
anniversary of a failed nationwide democracy uprising, for handing
out small cards to Myanmar citizens telling them the outside world
supported their struggle and to not give up.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. More than 3,000 demonstrators were
gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   The 18 foreign activists have been kept at a police guest house
in the capital. Diplomats who have visited them have described them
as cheerful, well-fed and treated humanely.
	   The government issued a statement this week saying their release
had been delayed because they were being uncooperative.
	   The military is attempting to find a way to discourage foreign
activists from entering Myanmar and inciting revolt, while at the
same time avoiding repercussions from the governments of countries
from which the activists come.
	   Earlier this year, the military government sentenced a
British-Australian national, James Mawdsley, to five years in
prison for also handing out pro-democracy leaflets. He was released
after three months.
	   Mawdsley had been detained in 1997 for a similar action, but was
deported with just a warning not to return. His trial was the first
open to some members of the public in decades and he was
represented by a lawyer.
	   Myanmar citizens put on trial rarely ever receive an attorney to
defend them, democracy and human rights activists have said.
	   Trials usually consist of reading out the charges and sentencing
the accused they say. Most trials take less than an hour.
	   Political prisoners are frequently subjected to torture and kept
in solitary confinement or cells meant for military dogs, human
rights groups and former prisoners say.

Bulgarian police seize 3,200 pirate compact discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police have arrested a Bulgarian national
who tried to sell to a Turkish bus driver 3,200 compact discs
suspected to be pirate copies, a police official said Friday.
	   Metodi Metodiev, a 28-year-old jobless from Sofia, was arrested
late Thursday on a highway 30 kilometers (19 miles) east of Sofia
while he was trying to reload the discs from his car onto a Turkish
bus.
	   ``The discs lack a source identity code, which is an indication
that they are pirate,'' said Col. Vasil Vasilev, head of Sofia
district police.
	   Metodiev, who was being investigated for suspected smuggling,
confessed to buying the discs from a private firm in Sofia, Vasilev
said. He wouldn't identify the firm, citing the secrecy of the
investigation.
	   Bulgaria has won some international recognition for its efforts
to prevent further copyright violations which had earned it a
reputation of being a leading pirating center.
	   The government has closed all nine CD factories in the country
and issued licenses to only two of them to reopen under a system of
toughened criteria. Production facilities and CD dealers are put
under stringent police controls.
	   Vasilev said the discs in the latest seizure were most probably
printed before the new government measures were introduced.

King bogeys first four in a 77
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout, updates with Friday's play &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Co-leader overnight after
surviving the wind and rain, Betsy King bogeyed the first four
holes in calmer, kinder conditions Friday for a 5-over 77 at the
Women's British Open.
	   One of only two players to produce sub-par rounds on Thursday,
King twice had to hack out of the rough after pulling her tee shots
off the narrow fairways of the Royal Lytham course.
	   ``I was relieved to make the first par,'' said the American, who
followed it with the first of her two birdies and wound up 4 over
at 148 for two rounds.
	   That dropped her behind countrywoman Brandie Burton, 1-under
after parring the first two, England's Trish Johnson, level par and
still to go out for her second round, Leslie Spalding, whose 70
gave her a halfway score of 2-over 146 and Wendy Ward, two over
with two holes to play.
	   Scotland's Janet Moodie, one of King's playing partners, carded
a level-par 72 for a 3-over total of 147 and India's Smitri Mehra,
who plays on the U.S. Tour, was three over after six holes despite
bogeys at the first and third.
	   ``It was a little frustrating but I have just got to stay
patient,'' King said after her 77. ``I have managed by game pretty
well so far.''
	   King was co-leader with Burton, winner of the Du Maurier Classic
at Windsor Ontario, two weeks ago, after they each carded 1-under
71s in far worse playing conditions Thursday.
	   When the field went out Friday, the strong winds blowing in from
the Irish Sea had dropped to a breeze and there was no rain in the
early stages when King started her second round.
	   ``The course is playing hard but it's not impossible,'' she
said. ``It's very demanding. The bunkers are such a penalty and if
you drive into the long stuff you're in trouble.
	   ``I'm not an expert at bump and run but I sure know how to hit
it out of bunkers.''
	   At the par 3, 197-yard first, King missed the green, chipped to
10 feet and rolled the putt wide. Her second shot at the second hit
a greenside bunker and she missed from 15 feet for a bogey 5.
	   She drove into the long rough at the third, couldn't reach the
green with her second shot, had to make a 15-foot putt for par and
it lipped out.
	   King found the thick rough again from the fourth tee, had to
hack the ball onto the fairway and made a bogey 5 after missing a
10-foot putt.
	   She blamed herself for hitting drives into the long rough, which
was still wet and sticking from Thursday's rain.
	   ``I had to get out of that junk three times,'' she said. ``Even
though the wind was better I didn't hit the ball as well as
yesterday and I didn't make the putts.''
	   Korean star Se Ri Pak, winner of two majors and two more
tournaments in her rookie season, followed her first round 78 with
two pars before a bogey at the third left her on 7 over.
	   Defending titlist Karrie Webb of Australia, who carded a 76 on
Thursday, also began with two pars in the calmer conditions while
long-hitter Laura Davies made her second 79 in a row and had to
wait to see if she had made the cut.

Police arrest Albanians on heroin smuggling charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALEXANDROUPOLIS, Greece (AP) _ Customs officials arrested two
Albanian men Friday after finding 26 kilograms (57 pounds) of
heroin in the fuel tank of their car, media reported.
	   Bashkim Leka, 43, and Cezim Konti, 40, denied all knowledge of
the heroin, found in 51 packages floating in the fuel tank. They
told authorities they thought they were transporting jewelry across
the border from Turkey, media reports said.
	   The Albanians said a man in Istanbul, Turkey, promised them
17,000 German marks (dlrs 9,518) to transport the packages to
Albania.
	   But local media quoted a customs official, Stavros Tzioras, as
saying he believed the Albanians are members of an international
ring smuggling drugs from Turkey to Western Europe.

Bulgarian customs officials seize 670 kilos of cocaine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Customs officials at Bulgaria's Black Sea
port of Varna seized Friday 670 kilograms (1,474 pounds) of cocaine
worth an estimated dlrs 55 million, a customs official said.
	   ``The narcotic was found in a cargo container at the port,''
customs spokesman Ivan Kutevski said. ``Officers checked the
container because its seal was broken.''
	   He would not divulge any further details, citing the secrecy of
the investigation.
	   It was the second largest seizure at the port of Varna, 470
kilometers (294 miles) east of Sofia, in the past two years. In
summer 1996, police seized 6.5 tons of hashish on a Bulgarian truck
loaded at Varna port.
	   Drug traffic across Bulgaria and other Balkan states has surged
after border regulations were eased following the collapse of the
Communist system in 1989.

Finland's July inflation down to 1.1 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland's annual inflation rate in July
was 1.1 percent, down from 1.5 percent the previous month, and 1.2
percent in July last year, the government statistics agency said
Friday.
	   During a 12-month period, the 2.1 percent increase in costs of
housing and rents pushed up the inflation rate the most, Statistics
Finland said. Increases in the prices of alcoholic drinks and
package holidays also sustained inflation.
	   Inflation was curbed mainly by the abolition of stamp duty on
loans, lower mobile phone charges and prices.
	   From June to July, consumer prices went down by 0.3 percent,
mainly because of seasonal seasonal clothing sales, the agency
said.

Rains trigger landslide in Himalayans; 27 dead, 69 missing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Heavy rains triggered landslides in a
mountainous region popular with religious tourists, killing at
least 27 people, hundreds of animals and destroying several houses
and shops, an official said Friday.
	   Sixty-nine others were missing in the Ukhimutt neighborhood of
the Garhwal region of the Himalayas, 300 kilometers (185 miles)
northeast of New Delhi after torrential rains since Tuesday swept
away houses, knocked down telephone and electricity poles and
blocked roads, said Lalitmohan Upreti, a top administration
official.
	   The deaths occurred Wednesday.
	   Army and paramilitary soldiers dug out 27 bodies from the mud
and slush, Upreti said. Rescue work was hampered by continous
downpour and blocked roads, he said in a telephone interview.
	   All eight houses of Raulake village were completely destroyed,
he said.
	   The area is near Rudraprayag, one of the most important
pilgrimage centers of the Hindus and close to a region ravaged by
an earthquake in 1991, which left 341 people dead.

Asylum activist group wants Germany to take refugees from Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The European Union must get together
to decide how to help the 200,000 ethnic Albanian refugees in the
embattled Serb province of Kosovo, a German human rights group said
Friday.
	   Pro Asyl spokesman Heiko Kauffmann said Germany must continue to
grant asylum to Kosovo Albanian refugees as part of an overall
European program for those fleeing violence.
	   He said a special EU conference was needed to help resolve the
problem of 200,000 ethnic Albanian refugees in Kosovo.
	   Kauffmann suggested some of the 400,000 ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo already residing in Germany could take in refugees from
Kosovo without burdening the government.
	   He criticized suggestions by some German politicians that want
refugee camps set up just outside Kosovo in Albania and Macedonia.
Such an arrangement could result in the fighting spreading into the
two neighboring countries, he said.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, the dominant republic
in what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Ethnic Albanians want independence from the Serbs, whom they
outnumber 9-to-1 in Kosovo. Serb President Slobodan Milosevic
ordered a crackdown on the ethnic Albanians in February, and
fighting in the province has spiraled since then.

U.S. Admiral lauds Malaysia for safeguarding embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The commander of the U.S. Pacific
Fleet praised Malaysia on Friday for safeguarding the American
Embassy after the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania last week, a news
report said.
	   ``The government of Malaysia has been very responsive. I think
appropriate action had been taken,'' Admiral Archie Clemins was
quoted as saying by Bernama news agency after giving a talk at the
Maritime Institute of Malaysia.
	   The U.S. Ambassador to Malaysia, John R. Mallot, also thanked
the Malaysian government for its cooperation over the issue
security at the embassy.
	   ``We are extremely grateful to the government of Malaysia and
especially the Royal Malaysia Police for their full and total
support and cooperation,'' Mallot said in a statement.
	   More than 250 people, including 12 Americans, were killed and
5,000 wounded when car bombs exploded almost simultaneously in
Nairobi and the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam last Friday.
	   The US State Department on Tuesday warned of threats to US
interests in Egypt, Yemen and Malaysia saying that ``this could
include attacks on buildings.''
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Wednesday he did not see
any reason why Malaysia should be named as one of the countries.
	   Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi also voiced concern
Thursday that the statement could be misinterpreted by foreign
investors, tourists and sports fans who planned to be here for the
Commonwealth Games next month.

Share prices surge, officials confirm intervening in market

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa's comments in

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Only a day after hitting a five-year low, share
prices in Hong Kong soared 8.5 percent on Friday in a dramatic
advance spurred by government intervention to crush speculators.
	   After shedding 16 percent of its value and falling to a
five-year low in the first two weeks of August, the Hang Seng Index
rose 564.27 points to close at 7,224.69. On Thursday, the index had
slumped 199.06 points, or 2.9 percent.
	   Turnover on the market surged to 8.55 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 1.1 billion), up from Thursday's 5.14 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 658 million).
	   Following the market's close for a long holiday weekend,
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang confirmed that the government had
moved into the stock and futures markets to stabilize them.
	   He bitterly criticized speculators for what he said was an
effort to manipulate Hong Kong's markets, and said the government
acted in response to ``very exceptional circumstances.''
	   Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa also vowed that the government
will take resolute action against speculators, saying ``we will do
it time and time again.''
	   Tung said the government has a responsibility to act swiftly
``in order to provide a healthy environment for our economy.''
	   Until Tsang's announcement, the market's sharp movement had
surprised many traders.
	   During the trading day, they had said it appeared that a few
buyers had moved into the market to buy up blue-chips, and
suggested they were trying to cover short positions.
	   Short-selling is essentially a bet that the market will drop. An
investor borrows stocks and sells them, betting he can buy them
back at a lower price, repay the lender and pocket a profit.
	   Speculators can get badly burned, though, if the prices go up.
Then, they must buy hastily before prices go even higher.
	   Tsang said that would have allowed them to profit from short
positions in the futures market.
	   Tsang also accused speculators of spreading rumors about the
delinking of the Hong Kong currency's fixed peg to the U.S. dollar,
devaluation of the Chinese currency, and the instability of Hong
Kong banks.
	   Tsang refused to reveal the size of the government's effort.
	   Analysts said none of the market's fundamentals had changed.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong rose 3.15 Hong Kong dollars to
32.00, and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 2.40 dollars to 24.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 7.00 dollars to
158.00, and Hang Seng Bank rose 3.20 dollars to 40.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 3.90 dollars to 35.60, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 1.50 dollars to 21.50.

Vialli's head on the line as Chelsea starts league campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gianluca Vialli puts his World Cup stars on
display Saturday as Chelsea's foreign legion kicks off its Premier
League campaign against Coventry.
	   Vialli, who steered the Blues to a European Cup Winners Cup and
League Cup double last season, invested 12 million pounds (dlrs
19.7 million) in foreign talent in the off-season in his bid to win
the Premier League title.
	   The Italian player-coach signed French World Cup star Marcel
Desailly, Italy's Pierluigi Casiraghi, Spanish defender Albert
Ferrer and Danish hero Brian Laudrup.
	   The new signings join an international squad already assembled
at Stamford Bridge, which includes Frank Leboeuf, Gianfranco Zola
and Roberto Di Mateo.
	   Vialli, who could field a team full of World Cup players
Saturday, said he expects to lose his job if Chelsea doesn't win
the title this season.
	   ``We have got exactly the team that we were looking for,'' he
said. ``Now we've got the right team to do something great this
season, so we've got no excuses.''
	   But the Blues are mindful of Saturday's opponents, after losing
the season opener 3-2 to Coventry last season at Highfield Road.
	   Interest in the Premier League, which kicks off just over a
month after the World Cup final in France, is at an all-time high.
	   Eight of the 10 Premier League matches are already sold-out for
the opening weekend, with league officials estimating a gate in
excess of 5 million pounds (dlrs 8.2 million).
	   This season, 76 players representing the various countries which
contested the World Cup will be playing for Premier League teams. A
total of more than 170 foreign players are signed with teams in
England's domestic competitions.
	   Dwight Yorke will put the off-season bidding war for his
services behind him as he spearheads Aston Villa's attack against
Everton at Goodison Park.
	   The Trinidad and Tobago striker, the subject of a 10 million
pound (dlrs 16.4 million) offer from Manchester United, will
shoulder most of the attacking responsibility in the absence of
Stan Collymore, who is still sidelined by an injury.
	   Slaven Bilic is the only doubtful starter for Everton.
	   The Croatian player, whose theatrical reaction to a mild slap by
Laurent Blanc helped get the French captain sent off and miss the
World Cup final, was set to undergo a fitness test Friday.
	   Everton's other new signings, including Scottish striker John
Collins, Olivier Dacourt and Marco Materazzi, are expected to make
their debuts.
	   Clive Mendonca has overcome a back injury and will lead Charlton
into its historic Premier League clash against Newcastle United at
St. James' Park.
	   Charlton, which won promotion to the Premier League after six
seasons out of the top-flight competition, will be without Welsh
international Mark Bowen, who sustained an injury in a friendly at
Welwyn on Monday.
	   Meanwhile, Newcastle has given up hope of having French World
Cup striker Stephane Guivarc'h fit for the match.
	   Guivarc'h, the leading scorer in the French league for the last
two seasons, has been given another week to recover from a niggling
injury.
	   Ryan Giggs, Andy Cole and David Beckham will lead Manchester
United into its sell-out first round match against Leicester City
at Old Trafford fresh from a 2-0 European Champions League win over
Lodz on Wednesday.
	   Alex Ferguson has named a near-full strength Red Devils side for
the clash, with only Swedish international Jesper Blomqvist not
considered through injury.
	   Sheffield Wednesday's new boss Danny Wilson faces his first test
at the helm against West Ham at Hillsbrough.
	   Wilson, who was brought in as a late replacement for Ron
Atkinson, still concedes the Owls lack depth despite the recent
signing of Dutch midfielder Wim Jonk and Argentinian right back
Juan Cobian.
	   West Ham's new signing Ian Wright will partner Trevor Sinclair
up front against Wednesday in the absence of suspended John
Hartson.
	   Tottenham striker Chris Armstrong is fit and ready as Spurs open
their campaign across London against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park.
	   Armstrong, who has been hampered by injuries for the last two
seasons, partners Les Ferdinand in attack.
	   Italian defender Paolo Tramezzani, Christian Gross' only
off-season signing, is set for his debut.
	   Wimbledon manager and former Spurs star Joe Kinnear goes into
the opener without two key defenders. His main objective this
season will be to avoid relegation.
	   Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson is ready to unleash a
new-look Paul Gascoigne against Leeds United at Middlesbrough.
	   The former England midfielder has a point to prove after being
axed from England's World Cup squad for France 98 for not being
fit.
	   Blackburn Rovers take on Derby City at Ewood in the remaining
game Saturday.
	   On Sunday, Liverpool travels to Southampton in the match of the
day.
	   Liverpool skipper Paul Ince and other new signings Steve
Staunton and Vegard Heggem are expected to be recovered from
injuries and be fit for the game.
	   England's teenage World Cup hero Michael Owen is certain to be
the main attraction at the Dell, where he is expected to be
partnered up front by Czech player Patrik Berger.
	   Mark Hughes, Southampton's latest signing, is poised to make his
debut for the Saints after leaving Chelsea in the summer.
	   Arsenal, FA Cup and League double titlist last season, will host
last season's division one league champion Nottingham Forest at
Highbury on Monday.
	   Arsenal, which beat Manchester United 3-0 in the Charity Shield
at Wembley last Sunday, is favorite to start its title defense with
a win over a Forest team distracted by off-field problems.
	   In English division one, Bolton will host host Grimsby and
Barnsley travels to Crewe.
	   Bolton had a 2-2 tie with Crystal Palace last week, while
Barnsley had a 2-2 tie with West Bromwich.
	   Former England manager Terry Venables will continue the Crystal
Palace campaign to win promotion back into the Premier League with
a second round match against Birmingham on Sunday.
	   The Scottish Premier League goes into round three this weekend,
with Rangers hosting Motherwell at Ibrox.
	   Celtic, which won the Scottish league title from Rangers last
season for the first time in a decade, will play Aberdeen at
Pittodrie Stadium on Sunday.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila has fled Congo's
embattled capital as rebel forces pushed toward Kinshasa, a senior
government official said Friday.
	   ``The president is not in Kinshasa,'' the high-level government
adviser told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. ``I
can't tell you any more than that.''
	   A Western diplomat in Paris, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Kabila was in Lubumbashi, his former rebel base, but had no
further information on his plans.
	   With rebel forces advancing on Kinshasa from the west, the
jittery Congolese capital awoke Friday without electricity, radio,
television or newspapers.
	   Power was restored to some parts of the city in the early
afternoon and state radio began broadcasting with a weakened
signal.
	   ``We call on the people to remain calm, the president of the
republic and the government are doing everything to reverse this
situation,'' the radio said in a statement, referring to the power
outage.
	   The radio resumed its barrage of accusations against neighboring
Rwanda and Uganda, which Kabila accuses of waging a war against
Congo.
	   The city was bracing for the expected arrival of fighters who
launched a rebellion against Kabila earlier this month. Rumors and
gossip fueled an uneasy sense of muffled panic. Thousands of people
packed sidewalk shops and markets to buy extra provisions,
anticipating what many consider the imminent fall of the capital to
the rebels.
	   With water cut off by the electricity outage, groups of women
trod back and forth to the shores of the Congo River to fill basins
with brown, polluted water for their families.

Quakes jolt central Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with latest figures; government committee
warning &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moderate earthquakes jolted towns in central Japan
near the Winter Olympics site in Nagano on Friday, including one
tremor that registered a preliminary magnitude of 4.4.
	   A total of 365 quakes, including 11 strong enough to be felt by
humans, have hit the area since midnight Thursday, worrying locals
and prompting visitors to the resort area to cancel hotel
reservations.
	   The epicenter of Friday's quake at 7:42 p.m. (1042 GMT) was
located at a shallow 10 kilometers (6 miles) underground in central
Nagano, 210 kilometers (130 miles) northwest of Tokyo, the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   No major damage or injuries have been reported in the
mountainous area, which hosted the Olympics in February.
	   The agency said there was no fear of tsunami, the huge ocean
waves caused by the undersea earthquakes or volcanic activity, from
the latest series of tremors.
	   Members of the Science and Technology Agency's seismological
committee held an emergency meeting Friday and said that the
earthquakes will continue for several more weeks. The committee
warned that tremors could be intense near the epicenter.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.
	   A total of 2,985 quakes _ including 84 felt by humans _ have hit
the Nagano area since Aug. 7, when the recent series of joltings
began. The same area experienced a similar spates of seismic
activity in 1990 and 1967.

Rafsanjani hits U.S. foreign policy, anti-Taliban protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Embassy Bombings &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian official expressed regret Friday
over twin attacks on American embassies in East Africa but said the
United States must look to its own foreign policy for clues to the
motives.
	   Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former president who now heads a
powerful government advisory board, also demanded that the Taliban
militia in Afghanistan free a number of Iranians _ including 11
diplomats _ taken prisoner.
	   After his sermon following Friday prayers, about 400 Iranians
demonstrated in front of the Pakistani Embassy, where they shouted
``Death to the Taliban'' and threw eggs, rotten vegetables and
stones, which broke two of the embassy's windows.
	   Tehran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the Iranians'
safety because Pakistan is widely believed to back the Taliban,
which is battling a northern-based opposition alliance.
	   Iran is widely believed to have supplied arms to the
anti-Taliban alliance.
	   About 100 Iranian policemen surrounded the Pakistan Embassy and
held the demonstrators back. The protest broke up after about half
an hour.
	   In his sermon, Rafsanjani said of the U.S. Embassy bombings in
East Africa: ``We condemn this attack, and we are in no way happy
about it.''
	   But he suggested that America may have brought the bombings on
itself by policies that Muslims see as biased toward Israel.
	   ``The United States allows the Israelis to Judaize Jerusalem,
and this will not enable the United States to have a good image
among Muslims,'' he said.
	   Jerusalem is holy to Muslims because it is the site of the
Al-Aqsa Mosque.
	   Arab and Muslim nations have been critical of the United States
for failing to stop Israel from building settlements in Arab east
Jerusalem and in the West Bank. Israel also has been criticized for
making it difficult for Muslims to visit Al-Aqsa and other holy
sites in Jerusalem.
	   ``We think it's better for the United States to allocate the
dlrs 2 million reward money to scholars to find out why this kind
of attack is always made against American targets,'' Rafsanjani
said.
	   The U.S. government is offering a dlrs 2 million reward for
information leading to the capture of the bombers of its embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania. Last week's attacks killed 257 people,
including 12 Americans.
	   During his prayer sermon, Rafsanjani also criticized Washington
for allowing an Iranian opposition group that Tehran considers a
terrorist organization to operate in the United States.
	   ``The United States allows the Mujahedeen Khalq organization to
open a bank account, an office and run a television station,''
Rafsanjani complained. ``This is something they would never allow
an Egyptian terrorist organization, for example, to do.''
	   The Mujahedeen Khalq played a role in toppling Shah Reza
Pahlavi's regime, but later turned against the Islamic regime set
up in 1979 by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. It has operated
in exile since 1981, mainly from bases in Iraq.
	   Jordanian officials said Friday that Tehran has asked the
country to close the Mujahedeen Khalq's press office in Amman. The
officials declined to say if they would agree to the request.
	   Rafsanjani also demanded that the Taliban militia release the
Iranians it has taken prisoner in Afghanistan.
	   ``We warn the Taliban and their supporters that we will no
longer tolerate that our beloved sons and brothers remain detained
in Afghanistan,'' Rafsanjani said.
	   Tehran says 11 diplomats, a journalist and 32 drivers were
seized in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif, which the
Taliban overran last Saturday.
	   The Taliban say they know nothing about the Iranian diplomats
but claim to be holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming the
Taliban's enemies.

Commander, soldier thrown out of unit after guerrilla infiltration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli platoon commander and soldier were
expelled from their elite unit after a Lebanese guerrilla managed
to slip into their heavily fortified post and escape alive, the
army said Friday.
	   The incident in south Lebanon had caused an uproar in the
Israeli military, with the chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz,
calling it a ``a grave operational failure.''
	   In addition to the two expulsions, letters were being placed in
the files of three senior officers _ a lieutenant colonel, a
colonel and a brigadier general _ criticizing them for failing to
adequately prepare the paratroopers for their mission.
	   The infiltration occurred Sunday when a fighter from the
Hezbollah guerrilla force made his way in broad daylight into an
Israeli-held position in Israel's self-declared security zone.
	   According to the army's account, he encountered a paratrooper,
apparently at close quarters, and the two grappled. Another soldier
shot and wounded the guerrilla, who threw down his assault rifle
and escaped.
	   The army spokesman's office said it was decided after an inquiry
that the soldier who initially confronted the guerrilla and his
platoon commander _ normally a second lieutenant _ would no longer
be allowed to serve as combat paratroopers.
	   In Israel, service in elite combat units can be a springboard to
a successful civilian career.

 &UR; Foreign activists will be deported from Myanmar
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with activists will be deported

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Eighteen foreign activists were sentenced
to five years in prison with hard labor Friday for handing out
democracy leaflets, but will be deported from Myanmar by Saturday
morning.
	   Moments after a judge sentenced the activists to prison, an
official from the Ministry of Home Affairs read an order reducing

which the activists came to arrange for their deportations by

Four cross Atlantic on raft made from recycled New York garbage

	   CASTLETOWNBERE, Ireland (AP) _ Four artists, two rotweilers and
a Mexican terrier have completed a 63-day journey across the
Atlantic on a raft made from garbage pulled out of rivers.
	   The crew set out from Halifax, Nova Scotia, two months ago after
piecing together the 55-foot (16.8 meter) makeshift vessel, The Son
of Town Hall, from foam, plywood and other refuse.
	   They arrived Thursday in the Irish fishing port of
Castletownbere in County Cork, much to the amusement of local
residents, who thought ``these are the maddest people we have ever
seen,'' said the ship's skipper, 37-year-old Irish-American Edward
Garry.
	   The sail was made from a recycled tennis net. The raft is
equipped with a 40-horsepower engine.
	   The crew included three Americans and a Canadian.
	   The Evening Standard of London reported that two were New
Yorkers: Ron Pearlman, 65, who calls himself ``Poppa Neutrino'' in
honor of his son's jazz band, the Flying Neutrinos, and his wife
Amelia. The fourth passenger was Rodger Doncaster, 44, of Amherst,
Nova Scotia.

Killer wolves target children in northern India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAJUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Government-appointed hunters are scouring
the countryside in India's most populous state for wolves that have
killed 30 village children since March, forest officials said
Friday.
	   The hunters combing jungles around villages in the northern
Uttar Pradesh province have killed 11 wolves in the agricultural
districts of Raebareilly and Unnao bordering the state capital
Lucknow, R.L. Singh, the state's Chief Conservator of Forests, told
The Associated Press.
	   The children killed were all between the ages of 1 and 9, the
official said.
	   Hunters shoot any wolf sighted in the villages' neighborhood,
but there is no way to find out if the killed animals were
responsible for the children's deaths. Similar killings of wolves
in 1996 after attacks on children whipped up a furor among animal
rights activists in the state.
	   `Operation Wolftrack' was launched in March, when the first
killing was reported this year.
	   The hunters stepped up their search this week after protests in
the state's Lalganj village, where angry villagers who found the
badly mangled body of a 3-year-old girl on Wednesday. The child was
believed to have been attacked by a wolf a day earlier.
	   The village is near Raebareilly town, about 475 kilometers (295
miles) south east of Delhi. Two children were killed in the same
district two weeks ago.
	   Singh said six groups of five hunters each were scouring areas
in the two districts along the Ganges River. Forest officials
suspect at least four packs of wolves are involved in the attacks.
	   Singh said the wolves were attacking humans because their
natural habitat _ river banks and streams _ had been encroached by
farmers and real estate developers, and their natural prey
including fowls, hare and other small animals were getting scarce.
	   In 1996, at least 76 children were killed by the wolves in the
state's eastern districts of Sultanpur, Jaunpur and Pratapgarh.
Villagers and wildlife hunters killed 12 wolves that year.

	   The defendants, who appeared solemn when the judge read out the
five-year sentence, jumped up, embraced each other, shook hands and
thanked those around them in the courtroom after the deportation
order was announced.
	   They were also embraced by diplomats from their respective
countries who attended the one-day trial in a small concrete
courthouse outside the walls of Insein Prison north of Yangon.
	   The six Americans, three Malaysians, three Indonesians, three
Thais, two Filipinos and one Australian were charged, after six
days of questioning and investigation, with violating the 1950
Emergency Provision Act.
	   The sweeping law allows for maximum 20-year jail terms for
inciting unrest and disturbing the peace and tranquility of the
state.
	   The reduction in sentences came after one of the defendants, a
Malaysian man, appealed to the judge. He said he and his colleagues
meant no harm to the Myanmar people, didn't intend to incite unrest
and were unaware of the local laws.

Seven children wounded as gunmen attack Karachi school

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen attacked a school
in the troubled port city of Karachi on Friday, wounding at least
seven children celebrating their country's 51st independence day,
police said.
	   The gunmen drove into the compound of the Qayum Primary School
in a politically volatile eastern neighborhood and opened fire on
students attending an independence day program of songs and
speeches, police said. The gunmen then fled.
	   The victims, ages between 7 and 11, were hospitalized. Doctors
said at least one, a 7-year-old girl, was in critical condition.
	   No group claimed responsibility for the attack. A police
official said it was terrorist act aimed at wrecking independence
day celebrations. Despite the holiday in Pakistan, children
traditionally attend school for the celebrations.
	   Violence has again escalated in Karachi after a lull in the past
few weeks. At least 15 people were killed in violence between the
two factions of the ethnic Mohajir Qaumi Movement over the last two
days.
	   Elsewhere, police found another possible victim of factional
violence _ a bullet-riddled body of a man with his hands and feet
tied with a rope.
	   More than 500 people have been killed in Karachi's political,
ethnic and sectarian violence this year, compared with about 400 in
1997.

Karadzic's son briefly detained in Pale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The son of war crimes suspect
Radovan Karadzic was, for a while, among more than 30 people
detained by the Bosnian Serb police in connection with the recent
killing of a local police chief, sources in Pale said Friday.
	   Sasa Karadzic reportedly was briefly detained and questioned on
Wednesday, days after the head of the police in Pale, Srdjan
Knezevic, was gunned down in the Serb mountain stronghold.
	   The temporary detention of Karadzic's son by the Bosnian Serb
police indicated that the once undisputed Bosnian Serb leader
himself, who is sought by an international tribunal, is no longer
safe even among his own people.
	   Karadzic, who led Bosnian Serbs in the Bosnian war, has been
indicted twice by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands. He is believed to be hiding somewhere in Bosnia,
avoiding arrest by NATO-led peace troops.
	   More than 30 people have been detained and as many vehicles and
apartments searched in connection with the Knezevic killing.
Knezevic used to command a paramilitary unit and support Karadzic
but has recently turned against him.
	   Knezevic's killing has raised tensions among two rival Bosnian
Serb camps _ Karadzic's supporters and his opponents, led by
President Biljana Plavsic, ahead of general elections in Bosnia in
September.
	   Plavsic's supporters have accused the closest aide of Karadzic
and the Serb member of the Bosnian residency, Momcilo Krajisnik, of
allegedly orchestrating the killing of Knezevic.

	   The judge then stepped down from his chair and allowed the
official from the Ministry of Home Affairs to read the order
reducing the sentences.
	   Some observers said the episode appeared pre-planned. The
Myanmar government wanted to discourage foreign activists from
inciting the populace to revolt, but also wanted to avoid further
souring relations with some of the countries from which they came.
	   Earlier this year, a Myanmar court sentenced a
British-Australian national, James Mawdsley, to five years in
prison for handing out democracy leaflets.
	   It was the second time he committed the offense. The first time
he was simply deported and told not to come back.
	   Mawdsley was released after spending about three months in
Insein Prison, where hundreds of political prisoners and violent
criminals are held.

Pakistan's Sharif vows to help Indian Kashmiris on independence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif vowed Friday to continue supporting Kashmiri separatists
fighting in neighboring India as Pakistan celebrated its
independence day.
	   In Karachi, the southern port city that is Pakistan's economic
hub, unidentified gunmen attacked a school, wounding seven students
attending an independence-day program in a politically volatile
eastern Karachi neighborhood.
	   No group claimed responsibility for the shooting, which a police
official said was terrorist attack aimed at wrecking independence
day celebrations. More than 500 people have been killed in
Karachi's political, ethnic and sectarian violence so far this
year.
	   Sharif, speaking in the capital in his address to the nation
marking 51 years of independence, said violence in Kashmir would
``force India to come to the negotiation table.''
	   Pakistan and India have fought two wars of their three wars over
Kashmir since both gained independence from Britain in 1947. India
celebrates its independence day Saturday.
	   India accuses Sharif's government of arming Muslim guerrillas
fighting for Kashmir's independence or its merger with Islamic
Pakistan, while Pakistan accuses India of violating human rights in
its crackdown on the militants.
	   Islamabad says it offers only political and moral support to
Kashmir's indigenous movement, and Sharif said that support would
continue as long as ``Kashmiris are victim of Indian atrocities.''
	   The Himalayan territory of Kashmir is divided between India and
Pakistan, with both nations claiming all of it. Their armies
regularly fire across the border, with the heaviest exchanges in
recent memory late last month and early this month coming as peace
talks between Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari
Vajpayee failed because of the Kashmir issue. The two are to meet
again in September.
	   Sharif on Friday also defended his decision to answer Indian
nuclear weapons tests in May with his own tests.
	   ``On August 14, we won independence. On May 28 we preserved our
independence with nuclear tests forever,'' he said.
	   The winners of this year's national award for excellence,
announced every year on independence day, included the architect of
Pakistan's nuclear program, Abdul Qadeer Khan.

Taliban denies that bin Laden was involved in embassy bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The leader of Afghanistan's Taliban
militia denies that his anti-American Saudi billionaire guest had
anything to do with terrorist bombings in east Africa, according to
an interview published Friday in neighboring Pakistan.
	   In the interview with The News, reclusive Taliban leader Mullah
Omar was quoted as saying that Osama bin Laden had pledged not to
stage political or military acts from Afghanistan. Bin Laden has
lived in southern Afghanistan since he was forced out of Sudan in
1996 because of his reputation as a financier of Muslim militants.
	   Omar said he did not believe that bin Laden was capable of
carrying out attacks far from Afghanistan. But the U.S. State
Department describes bin Laden as one of the world's most
significant sponsors of militant Islamic activities around the
world.
	   Saying speculation would only hurt their investigation, the
United States has refused to publicly point the finger at anyone
for the Aug. 7 bombings of its embassies in Tanzania and Kenya that
killed more than 200 people.
	   But David Long, author of ``The Anatomy of Terrorism,'' was
quoted in Friday's Washington Post as saying that, given bin
Laden's anti-American statements, he is ``the least improbable''
place to start looking for responsibility. There has been no
official indication from Washington that he is a suspect.
	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, whose country is
believed to have great influence with the Taliban, told The
Associated Press this week that United States has not pressed him
for information about bin Laden.
	   Aziz added Pakistan was trying to persuade the Taliban ``to
adopt a more responsible international stance, particularly on
terrorism. We are against terrorism in all forms.''
	   Two years ago, bin Laden issued a call from Afghanistan for
``holy war'' against the U.S. military in his native Saudi Arabia.
There are reports that bin Laden paid for the 1996 bombing of the
U.S. military housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that
killed 19 American servicemen and injured hundreds more.
	   Bin Laden's Afghan connection dates to the 1980s, when he led
and financed hundreds of young Saudis, Egyptians and other Arabs
who fought beside Islamic guerrillas against the Soviet army in
Afghanistan.
	   After the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan, bin Laden, son of a
Saudi who made his fortune in the construction business, went to
Sudan, where Islamic fundamentalists have governed since the
mid-1980s. Some Arabs went with him to work, he said, in his
construction firm and other enterprises.
	   The U.S. State Department contends that bin Laden established
terrorist training camps in northern Sudan. It says Arab and other
investigations have found that bin Laden supported Egyptian
extremists and terrorist bombers in Yemen, among others.
	   Bin Laden is believed to have several homes in southern
Afghanistan, including one in the main Taliban headquarters of
Kandahar.

Swiss tourist agencies restart breaks to Egyptian resorts

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Less than a year after 36 Swiss
tourists were massacred at a temple in Luxor, Switzerland's three
biggest tour operators said Friday they will restart vacations in
Egypt this fall.
	   Kuoni, Hotelplan and ITV said they will resume offering tours to
the country's Red Sea resorts at the end of September.
	   The Swiss foreign ministry is still recommending against travel
in Egypt. The operators said tourists would be made aware of the
ministry's advice, but said their action was justified because all
other European countries have ceased making such a recommendation.
	   The Swiss tourists were among 58 people killed in the attack by
Islamic militants last November on the Temple of Hatshepsut in
Luxor.

Yeltsin calls for emergency parliament session on economy

<TEXT>
	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin called on
parliament Friday to convene an emergency session to respond to
Russia's unfolding economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin insisted, however, that the economy remained stable,
that the ruble would not be devalued, and said there was no need to
interrupt his monthlong vacation to take charge of the situation.
	   ``At this moment, there is no need for that,'' Yeltsin told
reporters in this ancient Russian capital north of Moscow.
``Moreover, when the president rushes to the Kremlin, everybody
thinks that something is wrong.''
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, whose party dominates the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament, said lawmakers
``wouldn't mind'' holding the emergency session that Yeltsin
requested.
	   Trading on the Russian stock exchange was suspended for about 15
minutes Friday after some stocks rose as much as 20 percent. At
4:40 p.m. (1230 GMT), the Russian Trading System was up 15 percent
at 116.48 points.
	   The market has fallen most of this week. Analysts said Friday's
rise was due in part to Yeltsin's comments and in part by the hope
that the United States was patching together a plan to augment the
recent financial bailout announced by international lenders.
	   Yeltsin flew by helicopter to Novgorod from a resort in the wild
Valdai region. He was there to restore the old name of Veliky
Novgorod, or Novgorod the Great, in honor of the city's 1,140th
anniversary next year.
	   Despite having been on vacation since mid-July, the 67-year-old
president had bags under his eyes and his face appeared puffy. He
walked slowly and seemed to have difficulty understanding
reporters' questions about the economic crisis.
	   In recent days, the Russian stock market has accelerated its
slide and the ruble has come under intense pressure, prompting
fears of a devaluation.
	   ``No, we are not going to devalue the ruble,'' Yeltsin insisted,
adding that he thought the government had the economic situation
under control.
	   On arrival, Yeltsin said he saw no need for a special session of
the Duma to consider the remainder of the government's economic
austerity plan.
	   ``I'm not considering this possibility for the moment, as there
is no need,'' Yeltsin said. ``I do not exclude it in the future.''
	   Within an hour, however, he had apparently changed his mind. As
Yeltsin arrived for a tour of a meat factory, his press secretary,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said Yeltsin had signed a decree calling on
the Duma to meet.
	   It appeared that the decree did not invoke Yeltsin's
constitutional right to mandate a Duma meeting, but merely
requested it.
	   The Duma has passed some portions of the government's austerity
plan, which was demanded by international lenders, but recessed for
the summer without passing all of it.
	   Duma leaders had been balking at calling a special session to
reconsider the plan in light of the latest crisis, and there had
been calls for Yeltsin to exercise his constitutional power to call
a session.
	   However, after both Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Yeltsin
pleaded for the session, Zyuganov said the Duma probably would
convene sometime before Sept. 1. ``We wouldn't mind,'' he told
reporters.

Company publishing Biblical books in separate pocket-sized
</HEADLINE>
editions &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT SEELY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The book of Revelation with the image of an atomic
bomb cloud on its cover, and a woman's figure adorning the front of
the Song of Solomon: This is the Bible packaged for the modern age.
	   Canongate Books, a small publishing house based in Edinburgh,
Scotland, is putting out 12 Biblical books as separate,
pocket-sized editions, complete with introductions by leading
authors such as Fay Weldon, A.N. Wilson and Doris Lessing.
	   The company is aiming for a new generation of secular, as well
as religious, readers _ many of whom may never have read any of the
Scriptures before and certainly never thought of reading Biblical
stories on the train on the way to work in the mornings.
	   ``I think they will be for all sorts of people,'' said Claire
Paterson, the series' commissioning editor. ``A lot of people will
read the separate books for the very first time.''
	   The company has chosen the King James version of the Bible,
first published in 1611, Paterson said, ``during an extraordinary
flowering of English literature.''
	   The twelve Biblical books chosen, which will retail for 1 pound
(dlrs 1.65) each starting this fall, include the four Gospels and
Genesis, Exodus and Proverbs.
	   Weldon is writing a forward for Corinthians, Wilson for the
Matthew's Gospel and Lessing for Ecclesiates. The forward to
Genesis is being written by a genetic scientist, while Revelations
has an introduction by novelist Will Self.
	   ``Each of the writers finds a particular interest in that book _
it did fit together quite well,'' Paterson said.
	   The idea was hatched just over a year ago when a friend of
Canongate's chairman, Jamie Byng, asked why he had never seen the
Bible published as separate books, she said.
	   Paterson said the company plans to publish another 12 Biblical
books next Easter, with crime novelist Ruth Rendall contributing
the introduction to Romans.
	   Grove-Atlantic Inc. will publish the first series in North
America next spring.

Eleven killed in latest Algeria violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Armed groups killed eleven people in two
separate attacks in towns south west of Algiers, the security
forces said in a statement Friday.
	   The attacks occurred overnight Thursday. Seven people were
killed near Khemis Miliana, about 100 kilometers south west of the
capital. Four others died soon after at nearby Ain Defla.
	   Nobody claimed reponsibility, although such killings are usually
blamed on Islamic militants waging a bloody insurgency against the
military-backed government.
	   The government said Friday an operation was underway in the
region to hunt for the assailants.
	   The area is a major hideout for militant groups, and has been
the scene of frequent conflict with security forces in recent
years.
	   The deaths were the latest violence in the insurgency that began
in 1992 and has killed an estimated 75,000 people.
	   The unrest was triggered by the government's decision to cancel
parliamentary elections the now banned Islamic Salvation Front was
poised to win.
	   On Wednesday, a bomb on a railroad track exploded southwest of
Algiers, killing 7 people and injuring 11 others.

 &UR; YANGON: are held. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said that all 18 detainees would be
leaving Yangon on Saturday for Bangkok. They would spend their last
night in the Myanmar capital in a police guest house.
	   ``We're very pleased to learn that the six Americans will be
reunited with their families,'' said the spokeswoman on condition
of anonymity.
	   The activists were detained Sunday, the day after the 10th
anniversary of a failed nationwide democracy uprising, for handing
out small cards to Myanmar citizens telling them the outside world
supported their struggle and to not give up.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. More than 3,000 demonstrators were
gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   The 18 foreign activists have been kept at a police guest house
in the capital. Diplomats who visited them described them as
cheerful, well-fed and treated humanely.
	   The government issued a statement this week saying their release
had been delayed because they were being uncooperative.
	   A diplomat who visited the American activists Thursday said
embassies were not informed of the trial until Friday morning.
	   ``I hope they will be treated leniently,'' said U.S. Charge
d'Affaires Kent Wiedemann as he entered the courtroom Friday
morning.
	   In Manila, Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Lauro Baja said:
``Let my people go.''
	   Earlier in the day at a press conference in Bangkok, Thailand,
weeping and angry relatives appealed for their release.
	   They were joined by a U.S. congressman, Rep. Chris Smith,
chairman of the House International Operations and Human Rights
subcommittee, who accused the government of committing a ``public
relations disaster.''
	   Smith, a New Jersey Republican who has a constituent, Michele
Keegan, 19, among the detainees described them ``idealistic,
empathetic and caring about democracy.''

Milan cracks down on prostitution with fines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ In a crackdown on prostitution in downtown
Milan, special police forces on Friday started fining people caught
negotiating with prostitutes on the streets.
	   Offenders must pay 333,000 lire (dlrs 190) on the spot or face a
fine mailed to them that will be triple that.
	   Italian cities have been experimenting various techniques to
curb prostitution, without much success. Angry Milanese who
complained their neighborhoods had become dangerous and noisy
because of the street encounters sparked the latest initiative.
	   Police in several other cities, including Padua, Verona and
Rimini, already fine customers.
	   Italian dailies said prostitution had declined by 80 percent in
Rimini, a popular resort on the Adriatic, since officers started
levying fines last year.
	   Four groups of officers will be patrolling about 30 Milan
streets where prostitutes work, from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
	   Two years ago, Milan's town council passed a law allowing local
police to photograph the cars of customers and mail the pictures to
their homes along with a fine. Opposition to the campaign was so
strong among many politicians and residents that it has virtually
been abandoned.

Dar es Salaam bomb vehicle &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ In a show of unity and grief, Christian
and Muslim members of Kenya's parliament laid a huge wreath of red
and white roses at the site of the embassy bombing on Friday.
	   The legislators sang ``We Shall Overcome'' and prayed for unity
and tolerance. Nearby, an FBI evidence response team labored over
debris with rakes, continuing their search for evidence.
	   With rescue operations wrapped up and the death toll apparently
fixed at 257, the focus Friday was on cleanup work and the all-out
push to learn who perpetrated the simultaneous bombings in Nairobi
and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7.
	   ``It will take at least four more weeks to complete examination
of both bomb sites and witness interviews, and from that we will
develop leads,'' Assistant FBI Director Thomas Pickard said in
Washington.
	   In another sad pilgrimage to the ruins, a group of Kenyan women,
each carrying a red or white rose and many weeping, offered prayers
for the dead at an ecumenical service.
	   ``Women in Pain,'' said a banner they carried.
	   The head of the Vatican missionary service, Cardinal Jozef
Tomko, also showed up Friday morning. Tomko is in Nairobi to ordain
two new bishops.
	   ``Who can approve of terrorism?'' he said after praying for the
dead and wounded. ``We must find another way of living together on
this earth. Look at it: It is so beautiful. Why this? Why?''
	   Friday's newspapers were filled with grief: Death notices for
bomb victims, with pictures of the deceased.
	   One showed a smiling young couple on their wedding day. Both
died in the blast. Another showed two sisters, ages 16 and 17.
	   The papers were also full of bitterness and anger at the United
States. Columns and letters to the editor complained that the
United States tried only to save its own citizens after the blast.
	   ``You could show us a little more sympathy, America,'' said one
headline in the East Africa Standard.
	   A warning from the U.S. State Department against visiting Kenya
also created ill will. Tourism is vital to Kenya's economy and
there were fears the warning would deal it a crippling blow.
	   Ambassador Prudence Bushnell announced Friday that the warning
had been lifted.
	   James Flannery, head of the Kenya Tourist Board, welcomed the
move. ``We are very pleased,'' he said.
	   Bushnell said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to
Kenya in the near future ``will show the world that the United
States and important Americans are not afraid to come to Kenya.''
	   She spoke a ceremony at which the United States donated
search-and-rescue equipment to Kenya. ``Friends do not desert one
another in times of disaster,'' she said.
	   On Thursday, Sheila Horan, FBI special agent in charge of the
investigation, said investigators had gathered ``very critical and
important information'' on the bombers' identities.
	   The FBI has 215 agents, lab examiners, evidence technicians,
computer specialists, photographers and translators in Kenya and
Tanzania, Pickard said in Washington, and a British forensic team
was expected to join the 22 FBI lab examiners in Kenya and Tanzania
shortly.
	   Pickard said agents on the scene had 700 interviews to conduct
in Nairobi and 200 in Dar es Salaam. Some of the Kenyan embassy
guards who may have seen the bombers survived the blast.
	   Kenyan police say about five people have been detained. In
Tanzania, about 14 people have been picked up for questioning.
	   Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said joint police work with
Kenya ``has given us important leads in our investigations.''
	   Kenya's Muslims feel they have been unfairly targeted because of
suspicions that Islamic terrorists are involved in the blast. They
say several Muslims were detained without cause.
	   ``It seems they've decided that the people who did it are
Muslims, now let's go for the evidence,'' Mohamed Farouk Adam, vice
chairman of Nairobi's Jamia Mosque.
	   In Dar es Salaam, U.S. military sources said investigators are
now looking at the possibility that a bomb-laden vehicle was behind
a water delivery truck at the embassy entrance.
	   Suspicion had been centered on the water truck, and embassy
spokesman Dudley Simms said Friday that embassy officials still
think the truck was the likely delivery vehicle.
	   Acting U.S. Ambassador John Lange raised the flag at the
embassy's temporary headquarters Friday in a house across the road
from the Indian Ocean.
	   The house is almost hidden from view by a high security wall
that is now topped by barbed wire.
	   ``It is a difficult time for all of us,'' Lange said at the
brief ceremony.

 &UR; Foreign activists will be deported from Myanmar
 &UR; EDS: COMBINES urgent series; Minor editing; TRIMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Eighteen foreign activists were sentenced
to five years in prison with hard labor Friday for handing out
democracy leaflets, but will be deported from Myanmar on Saturday.
	   Moments after a judge sentenced the activists to prison, an
official from the Ministry of Home Affairs read an order reducing
the sentences and saying the activists would be expelled on the
condition they would not violate Myanmar laws again.
	   He asked diplomats from the six Asian and Western nations from
which the activists came to arrange for their deportations
Saturday.
	   The defendants, who appeared solemn when the judge read out the
five-year sentence, jumped up, embraced each other, shook hands and
thanked those around them in the courtroom after the deportation
order was announced.
	   They were also embraced by diplomats from their respective
countries who attended the one-day trial in a small concrete
courthouse outside the walls of Insein Prison north of Yangon.
	   The six Americans, three Malaysians, three Indonesians, three
Thais, two Filipinos and one Australian were charged, after six
days of questioning and investigation, with violating the 1950
Emergency Provision Act.
	   The sweeping law allows for maximum 20-year jail terms for
inciting unrest and disturbing the peace and tranquility of the
state.
	   The reduction in sentences came after one of the defendants, a
Malaysian man, appealed to the judge. He said he and his colleagues
meant no harm to the Myanmar people, didn't intend to incite unrest
and were unaware of the local laws.
	   The judge then stepped down from his chair and allowed the
official from the Ministry of Home Affairs to read the order
deporting them.
	   Some observers said the episode appeared planned. The Myanmar
government was caught between trying to discourage foreign
activists from coming and inciting the populace, and souring
relations with foreign countries.
	   Earlier this year, a Myanmar court sentenced a
British-Australian national, James Mawdsley, to five years in
prison for also handing out democracy leaflets.
	   Mawdsley was released after spending about three months in
Insein Prison, where hundreds of political prisoners and violent
criminals are held.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said that all 18 detainees would be
leaving Yangon on Saturday for Bangkok. They would spend their last
night in the Myanmar capital in a police guest house.
	   ``We're very pleased to learn that the six Americans will be
reunited with their families,'' said the spokeswoman on condition
of anonymity.
	   ``We are thrilled. We are excited,'' said Callie Keegan, mother
of defendant Michele Keegan from New Jersey.
	   The activists were detained Sunday, the day after the 10th
anniversary of a failed nationwide democracy uprising, for handing
out small cards to Myanmar citizens telling them the outside world
supported their struggle and to not give up.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. More than 3,000 demonstrators were
gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   The activists were kept at a police guest house. Diplomats who
visited them described them as cheerful, well-fed and treated
humanely.
	   The government issued a statement this week saying their release
had been delayed because they were being uncooperative.
	   A diplomat who visited the American activists Thursday said
embassies were not informed of the trial until Friday morning.
	   ``I hope they will be treated leniently,'' said U.S. Charge
d'Affaires Kent Wiedemann as he entered the courtroom Friday
morning.
	   In Manila, Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Lauro Baja said:
``Let my people go.''
	   Earlier in the day at a press conference in Bangkok, Thailand,
weeping and angry relatives appealed for their release.
	   They were joined by a U.S. congressman, Rep. Chris Smith,
chairman of the House International Operations and Human Rights
subcommittee, who accused the government of committing a ``public
relations disaster.''
	   Smith, a New Jersey Republican, called the activists
``idealistic, empathetic and caring about democracy.''

Portuguese doctors strike over salary demands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Striking doctors paralyzed several
hospitals and health centers around Portugal Friday, a union leader
said.
	   The Independent Doctors Union, or SIM, began an 11-day strike to
press demands for a steep pay rise for physicians working in the
state health care system, union leader Antonio Bento said.
	   ``In Portugal there are doctors who earn less than nurses when
almost everywhere else in the world they earn two or three times as
much,'' he said.
	   Bento said state-employed doctors earn between 215,000 escudos
per month (dlrs 1,200) and 465,000 escudos (dlrs 2,550) for a
35-hour week while nurses working the same hours can earn up to
450,000 escudos (dlrs 2,470).
	   The Health Ministry said the strike was affecting almost 25
percent of hospitals and health centers, and that emergency
services were working normally.
	   The ministry had negotiated a modest wage rise with the other
main medical union in July, but that deal was rejected by the SIM,
which represents some 4,000 of the country's 22,000 state-employed
doctors.
	   If SIM's strike does not force the government to negotiate a new
pay deal, the union will call on doctors to take individual strike
action, Bento said. He called it ``a self-service strike.'

Germany largest multimedia market in Europe, study shows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's multimedia market is the biggest
in Europe and has the potential of adding almost 300,000 jobs by
2001, Research Minister Juergen Ruettgers said Friday in presenting
a study by a U.S. consulting firm.
	   Multimedia operations account for 196 billion marks (dlrs 109.5
billion) a year in sales and employ some 710,000 people in Germany,
the study by Booz Allen and Hamilton found.
	   It said the market had the potential of adding another 280,000
jobs by 2001.
	   According to the study, the German direct marketing association
anticipates 80,000 new jobs alone in telemarketing.
	   The consulting company predicted an explosive development in
on-line services in Germany because of increasing numbers of users
and expanding electronic commerce. The study said turnover in that
field has the potential to jump to 38 billion marks (dlrs 21.2
billion) annually by 2001, up from 3 billion marks (dlrs 1.7
billion) in 1996.
	   Another growth area was the so-called ``Call Centers,''
Ruettgers said.
	   He said the number of employees had doubled from 1995 through
1997 to 61,000 in telephone ordering services, with the consulting
study showing that branch had a potential to produce another 55,000
jobs by 2001.

<TEXT>
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ Police arrested a member of a Kurdish rebel
group just days before she planned to carry out a suicide bombing,
Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency said Friday.
	   The attack was to have coincided with Saturday's 14th
anniversary of the start of the Kurdistan Workers Party's violent
campaign for autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The conflict has
killed 37,000 people.
	   In 1996, women belonging to the group killed 17 people and
themselves in three suicide bombings in eastern Turkey and the
southern city of Adana. There have been no such attacks since.
	   Adana slums harbor tens of thousands of Kurdish villagers,
refugees from the fighting between the army and the guerrillas.
	   The woman was arrested Thursday. Authorities said she was the
second Kurdish woman in two months to be detained within days of a
planned suicide bombing.
	   Also Friday, troops killed 13 guerrillas in fighting across the
southeast, Anatolia said. Three soldiers were also killed, the news
agency said.

Japanese factory during World War II sued the government and a
stainless steel maker Friday, demanding an apology and
compensation, court officials said.
	   Liu Zonggen and five other plaintiffs from Henan Province in
western China are seeking 20 million yen (dlrs 137,000) each in
compensation. They also demand an apology be published in Japanese
newspapers, Kyodo News reported.
	   A spokesman at the Kyoto District Court only confirmed the
lawsuit was filed Friday but refused to comment on details,
including plaintiffs' names or the amount of damages sought.
	   The plaintiffs claim they were coerced or kidnapped by Chinese
sympathizers of the Japanese military in 1944 while working in the
fields. They were sent to Japan's ancient capital of Kyoto as slave
laborers at Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co. nickel factory, Kyodo said.
	   The Japanese wartime military systematically abducted Chinese
and forced them to work for Japanese companies to make up for a
labor shortage at home.
	   Nearly 40,000 Chinese were brought to Japan between April 1943
and shortly before Japan's defeat in August, 1945, according to
Japan's wartime documents. They were sent to mines, construction
sites and factories operated by 135 Japanese companies, many of
them among Japan's modern corporate giants.
	   Seven thousand of the 40,000 died of malnutrition and the
violence of their employers.
	   The plaintiffs said they and some 200 other Chinese fellow
laborers were forced to work 14 hours a day and were repeatedly hit
with wooden clubs whenever they failed to meet their work quotas.
	   A dozen of the laborers died of illness, Kyodo said, quoting the
plaintiffs' claims submitted to the court Friday. None of the
Chinese slave laborers at the factory was paid any wages, it said.
	   The laborers had to live under harsh conditions, with no heat in
winter or proper nutrition _ usually just one soybean bun for each
meal. They were also left unattended when they fell ill or injured,
they claimed.
	   Officials of the Justice Ministry and Nippon Yakin Kogyo were
not immediately available for comment late Friday.
	   Last year, the Tokyo District Court dismissed damages claims by
another group of Chinese former slave laborers who worked at a
river redirection project in northern Japan.

Hoddle's job under threat over book
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Glenn Hoddle's job as England coach was under
threat Friday when he was criticized from several quarters for
publishing inside details about England's World Cup side in a
just-serialized book.
	   About the only person publicly defending Hoddle over the
controversial book, ``The 1998 World Cup Story,'' was F.A. chief
executive Graham Kelly.
	   ``Some of the matters are inevitably controversial,'' Kelly
said. ``I am not aware he has breached any confidences.''
	   The book was ghost-written by David Davies, the F.A. director of
public affairs.
	   In the book, Hoddle gives backroom details about: Paul
Gascoigne's tantrum, when he smashed a bedside lamp after being
told by Hoddle he was off England's World Cup team; a run-in with
Blackburn striker Chris Sutton; his talk with Teddy Sheringham
after the striker was caught out at dawn at a nightclub in
Portugal.
	   Former England coaches Terry Venables and Bobby Robson
challenged Hoddle's judgment.
	   ``I did a book on tactics and players of the past and future,
but I have never, ever gone into any detail in a private way on
players at all,'' Venables said.
	   ``It is Glenn's business if he wants to go down that road, but I
have never written a book like that and I never will. It's not for
me.''
	   Robson, who guided England in the 1990, was more moderate in his
criticism.
	   ``Glenn has to stand and fall on what he has said in the book,''
Robson said. ``Whether he was well advised or ill advised I cannot
say. But he clearly wanted to say what he said.''
	   The chief executive of the Professional Footballers'
Association, Gordon Taylor, also ripped Hoddle.
	   ``It is ironic. The F.A. have often reprimanded or charged their
members with bringing the game into disrepute for saying much
less,'' he said.
	   On Friday, the tabloid Daily Mail asked the F.A. to fire Hoddle
and other papers gave the story front-page treatment.
	   ``It seems impossible for Glenn Hoddle to continue as England
coach,'' the Daily Mail said. ``If he does not resign, the F.A.
should step in and dismiss him.''

Taiwan's economic growth fell in the second quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's economy slowed in the second
quarter of the year because of Asia's economic crisis, forcing the
government Friday to revise its growth forecast for the year from 6
percent down to 5.3 percent.
	   The government said the gross domestic product in the second
quarter fell to 5.21 percent from 6.22 percent in the same period a
year earlier, and from 5.92 percent in the first quarter.
	   Officials blamed the economic slowdown to a fall in exports
because of the region's financial crisis.
	   If the 5.3 percent economic growth for the full year is reached,
it would be the lowest rate since 1985, and only the eighth time
that Taiwan has registered growth below 6 percent.
	   Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and Development is
currently revising a proposal to stimulate the economy through
public spending.

Yeltsin calls for emergency parliament session on economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruble falling at currency exchange offices. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin called on
parliament Friday to hold an emergency session to respond to
Russia's economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin insisted, however, that the economy remained stable,
that the ruble would not be devalued, and said there was no need to
interrupt his monthlong vacation to take charge of the situation.
	   ``At this moment, there is no need for that,'' Yeltsin told
reporters in this ancient Russian capital north of Moscow.
``Moreover, when the president rushes to the Kremlin, everybody
thinks that something is wrong.''
	   However, trading on the Russian stock exchange was suspended for
about 15 minutes Friday after some stocks rose as much as 20
percent. The ruble was sharply lower at currency exchange offices
in Moscow.
	   The market has fallen most of this week. Analysts said Friday's
rise was due in part to Yeltsin's comments and in part by the hope
that the United States was patching together a plan to augment the
recent financial bailout announced by international lenders.
	   At 4:40 p.m. (1230 GMT), the Russian Trading System was up 15
percent at 116.48 points. The ruble was selling at between 6.75 to
7 to the U.S. dollar in Moscow on Friday, down from about 6.3 on
Thursday.
	   At one SBS bank branch in Moscow, customers said they were
allowed only to withdraw money in rubles, even from accounts that
were established in U.S. dollars. Those who wanted dollars were
told to fill out a form and return in five days.
	   Yeltsin flew by helicopter to Novgorod from a resort in the wild
Valdai region. He was there to restore the old name of Veliky
Novgorod, or Novgorod the Great, in honor of the city's 1,140th
anniversary next year.
	   Despite having been on vacation since mid-July, the 67-year-old
president had bags under his eyes and his face appeared puffy. He
walked slowly and seemed to have difficulty understanding
reporters' questions about the economic crisis.
	   ``No, we are not going to devalue the ruble,'' Yeltsin insisted,
adding that he thought the government had the economic situation
under control.
	   On arrival, Yeltsin said he saw no need for a special session of
the Duma to consider the remainder of the government's economic
austerity plan.
	   ``I'm not considering this possibility for the moment, as there
is no need,'' Yeltsin said. ``I do not exclude it in the future.''
	   Within an hour, however, he had apparently changed his mind. As
Yeltsin arrived for a tour of a meat factory, his press secretary,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said Yeltsin had signed a decree calling on
the Duma to meet.
	   It appeared that the decree did not invoke Yeltsin's
constitutional right to mandate a Duma meeting, but merely
requested it.
	   The Duma has passed some portions of the government's austerity
plan, which was demanded by international lenders, but recessed for
the summer without passing all of it.
	   Duma leaders had been balking at calling a special session to
reconsider the plan in light of the latest crisis, and there had
been calls for Yeltsin to exercise his constitutional power to call
a session.
	   However, after both Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Yeltsin
pleaded for the session, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said the
Duma probably would convene sometime before Sept. 1. ``We wouldn't
mind,'' he told reporters.

McLarens still faster than Schumacher's Ferrari in practice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hakkinen, Coulthard quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ David Coulthard led McLaren-Mercedes
teammate Mika Hakkinen in free practice Friday for the Hungarian
Grand Prix, with Michael Schumacher close behind in his Ferrari.
	   Schumacher, who trails Hakkinen by 16 points in the Formula One
drivers' standings, needs to win Sunday's 77-lap race to have any
hopes of overtaking the Finn by the end of the season.
	   Hakkinen, who is coming off back-to-back victories in Austria
and Germany, appeared ready for the challenge.
	   He had the fastest time in the morning's practice session,
during which the cars were slowed down by a summer shower.
	   The afternoon was dry and Hakkinen vaulted over Schumacher late
in the one-hour session.
	   He wasn't fast enough, however, for Coulthard, who finished
behind Hakkinen in the two last races.
	   ``It was good to have the opportunity to practice in both wet
and dry conditions and it was no surprise that the new surface here
in Hungary was very slippery in the rain this morning,'' Hakkinen
said.
	   ``We managed to complete some very good set-up work on the car
and we are enthusiastic about tomorrow,'' he said.
	   Coulthard, a Briton, is third in the drivers standings, 34
points behind Hakkinen, who has 76. Schumacher has 60. A victory is
worth 10 points.
	   ``It was an interesting day, having both wet and dry sessions,''
Coulthard said. ``We are working on the set-up to rectify some
oversteer, but I am happy with my performance today and I am
looking forward to tomorrow.''
	   With five races left in the season, Schumacher doesn't have much
time to achieve his goal of winning his third Formula One
championship and becoming he first Ferrari driver to clinch the
title since Jody Scheckter in 1979. Schumacher's previous two
titles were in different cars.
	   After a disappointing fifth place in the German Grand Prix,
Schumacher spent the past week testing on Ferrari's home track in
Fiorano, covering 1,200 kilometers (700 miles).
	   ``This afternoon showed that we are in much better shape than in
Hockenheim,'' Schumacher said. ``The gap to the front runners is
not too big.''
	   And although his gap to the McLaren was not huge, it was clear
that his rivals go into Saturday's qualifying with an advantage.
	   On Hungaroring's narrow, winding 3.9-kilometer (2.4-mile)
circuit, overtaking is very difficult and good grid position could
be a decisive factor.
	   ``Qualifying on the front row in Hungary is vital to achieving a
win in the race,'' said Norbert Haug, the Mercedes sports chief.
	   Coulthard posted a best-lap time of one minute, 19.989 seconds.
	   Hakkinen was .197 seconds behind, with Schumacher .450 off the
pace.
	   Reigning world champion Jacques Villeneuve of Canada was fourth
in a Williams, just two-thousandths of a second slower than
Schumacher.
	   Eddie Irvine, the second Ferrari driver, was fifth, while former
champion Damon Hill was sixth in a Jordan.

Toxic gas leak in northern Japan forces evacuation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toxic chlorine gas leaked from a water purification
plant in northwestern Japan on Friday, forcing dozens of people to
evacuate their homes, police said.
	   The gas was created accidentally when a plant employee spilled
soda hypochlorite, a germ killer, into a tank of polyaluminum
chloride, a chemical used to seperate soil and water, said Rokuro
Ando, a policeman for the town of Kosudo, where the accident
occurred.
	   None of the residents were injured and the 43 people forced to
ecvacuate their homes had returned by Friday evening, Ando said.
	   Kosudo is in Niigata Prefecture, about 250 kilometers (160
miles) northwest of Tokyo.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe's connections with the Internet
and international e-mail were out of order for nearly 18 hours on
Thursday, causing severe disruption to the growing number of
businesses that rely on the global information network.
	   No explanation was given by the parastatal Posts and
Telecommunications Corp. for the break, which began at 1 a.m. (2300
gmt) and lasted through the working day.
	   Since the Internet reached here two years ago Zimbabwe's
financial institutions, among the most sophisticated in Africa,
have updated their systems to reduce the traditional isolation of
this landlocked state.
	   The postal body maintains a monopoly over the international
link, which may be challenged in the near future by private
operators.
	   In 1995 Zimbabwe's Supreme Court ordered the licensing of a
private cellphone operator, saying the corporation's ``notorious''
bad service constituted an infringement of citzens' constitutional
right of freedom of expression and access to information.
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Hundreds more Eritreans were deported from
Ethiopia this week, pushing the total to more than 17,000, the
Eritrean news agency Erina said in a fax received Friday in
Nairobi.
	   Children, pregnant women and elderly people carried on
stretchers were among 800 Eritreans who arrived at the border town
of Badme on Tuesday, the report said.
	   The Eritreans, who had lived in Ethiopia's Tigray region for
decades, complained that after a border conflict with Ethiopia
began they were denied freedom of movement and had their property
taken away, according to Erina.
	   The rival Horn of Africa nations are locked in a border dispute
that erupted in brief but deadly clashes and air strikes in late
May and early June. Eritrea, which claims rights to the disputed
areas under colonial-era agreements, gained independence from
Ethiopia in 1993.
	   -----
	   CAPE TOWN, Johannesburg (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela returned
to his rural home in Qunu in the Transkei on Friday to officially
open a secondary school which he helped upgrade with private sector
contributions.
	   In a speech prepared for delivery at the reopening of the
Dalindyebo Senior Secondary School, he repeated that a partnership
between government, the private sector and communities was critical
for the country's development.
	   ``No one sector on its own, least of all government, can succeed
in ensuring that we do improve the quality of life of our people,''
he said.
	   He urged teachers and learners to commit themselves to education
and to ensure discipline in schools.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Management of the three South
African exchanges have agreed in principle that they would
integrate to form one exchange.
	   A joint statement Friday said it had been proposed that a new
integrated exchange would be licensed under both the Financial
Markets Control Act and the Stock Exchanges Control Act and that it
would list all the instruments currently listed in South Africa.
	   The move would be subject to approval by regulators and members
of the exchanges.
	   The new exchange would include the Johannesburg Stock Exchange,
Safex and BESA.
	   The aim was to ensure that the South African financial markets
provide efficient, cost effective, secure and transparent markets
which were internationally competitive.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A man was sentenced to 24 years in a
maximum-security prison on Friday for a grenade attack on a market
that killed two people and wounded 19, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Vitaly Matveyev, 24, was drunk when he threw the grenade into a
crowded market in Volgograd, 900 kilometers (550 miles) southeast
of Moscow last December, the news agency said.
	   He was angry at having been denied a cigarette and sunflower
seeds, it said.
	   A 12-year-old boy and a 30-year-old woman died in the attack.

China's floods spread, stranding thousands, hitting oil field
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with death toll of 625 in Hunan in graf 11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A major levee protecting China's largest oil
field gave way Friday, forcing the closure of some wells as
devastating floods spread to the northeast, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency said.
	   Heilongjiang, an industrial and agricultural province that
borders Russia, mobilized 1 million civilians and soldiers for ``a
round-the-clock fight'' against the worst-ever floods on the Nen
and Songhua rivers, Xinhua said.
	   More than 200,000 people were fighting flooding in Daqing, a
city of 2.34 million people and home of the field that produced
half of China's oil output last year, Xinhua said.
	   But a lack of manpower forced the abandonment of efforts to
repair the levee that collapsed some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from
the city center, Xinhua said. Some 20,000 people were evacuated and
no casualties were reported from the breach in the dike, which
expanded to 500 meters (1,650 feet) by midday, Xinhua said.
	   The floods forced the closure of 155 of Daqing's nearly 20,000
oil wells, and workers were building a barrier near the oil field
to protect it from the floods, Xinhua said.
	   Rescue workers also were evacuating more than 20,000 people
stranded after floods washed out railway tracks in Heilongjiang,
state media said.
	   A flash flood near Aksu, in the northwestern region of Xinjiang,
killed four people and left dozens missing Thursday, inundating an
area inhabited by some 100,000 people, the official Workers Daily
reported.
	   Floods and landslides also forced the closure of a major rail
line in the northwest, between Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, and the
city of Lanzhou, the reports said.
	   With a rain belt stretching across central China, floods were
predicted to continue and to worsen in the northeast and along the
Yellow River, which was expected to become dangerously swollen in
the next few weeks, the official China Daily reported.
	   Meanwhile, residents and soldiers worked feverishly to fortify
levees along the turbulent Yangtze, bracing for yet another flood
crest forecast to sweep downriver within the next few days.
	   Xinhua said this year's floods have killed 625 people in Hunan,
one of the worst-hit provinces along the Yangtze. Nationwide, the
death toll from summer flooding stands at more than 2,000.
	   Experts warned that as flood waters recede, dikes might weaken
further. Diseases also threaten, with skin infections already on
the rise because people have been immersed in polluted water for
weeks.
	   ``People must wade through waist high water to go about their
daily life,'' the Red Cross reported from one flood-hit province.
	   Already, 10,000 medical teams are handing out food, water
purification tablets, medical supplies, and evacuating people in
flooded areas.
	   But shortages of funds are delaying relief efforts, the Red
Cross said. It appealed urgently for money to provide food, water
purification tablets and medical supplies to one million people.
	   It also warned that the floods threaten efforts to control snail
fever in some areas, and said outbreaks of this tropical disease
may increase.
	   In the northeast, the industrial city of Harbin declared a state
of ``high alert'' and set a 24-hour curfew along levees protecting
it from the rising Songhua River, which was likely to suffer two
major flood crests within the next 10 days, Xinhua said.
	   More than 20,000 people had been stranded for six days along the
Harbin-Manzhouli railway line, northwest of Harbin. Evacuation
began Thursday after the line was reopened.
	   State-run television showed rails that had been cobbled together
with boards and wire after embankments and bridges were washed
away. Vast areas surrounding the line remained inundated.
	   To the west, along the Nen River in Inner Mongolia, 113,600
people remained stranded by floods that began August 8 and left
414,000 people homeless, Xinhua reported.
	   In neighboring Liaoning province, rescue workers were struggling
to unearth villages buried by a landslide Tuesday that killed nine
people and left five others missing, Xinhua reported late Thursday.
	   It said another landslide on the same day, in southwestern
Sichuan province, killed six farmers and seriously injured two
others, destroying 17 houses.

	   RINGSTED, Denmark (AP) _ Michael Steen Nielsen broke away from
the pack with 2 kilometers remaining and won the fourth stage of
the Tour of Denmark on Friday while Belgian Marc Streel maintained
his 41-second overall lead.
	   Nielsen's two-second victory over Alberto Ongarato of Italy gave
Denmark its third straight stage win. He completed the 125
kilometers (78 miles) from Odense in 2 hours, 50 minutes and 8
seconds.
	   Streel was still more than a half-minute ahead of Casino
teammate Bo Hamburger of Denmark.
	   Friday's stage started on Fuen Island and included a crossing
over the newly opened Great Belt Bridge, the longest bridge in
Europe. It took 23 minutes to cross the 15-kilometer link.
	   The remaining 88 of original 102 riders were to race another
stage later Friday, the tour's lone 20-kilometer (12-mile)
individual time trial.

Chinese former slave laborers sue government, firm to demand

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Six Chinese men forced into slave labor at a
Japanese factory during World War II sued the government and a
stainless steel maker Friday, demanding an apology and
compensation, court officials said.
	   Liu Zonggen and five other plaintiffs from Henan Province in
east-central China are seeking 20 million yen (dlrs 137,000) each
in compensation. They also demand an apology be published in
Japanese newspapers, Kyodo News reported.
	   A spokesman at the Kyoto District Court only confirmed the
lawsuit was filed Friday but refused to comment on details,
including plaintiffs' names or the amount of damages sought.
	   The plaintiffs claim they were coerced or kidnapped by Chinese
sympathizers of the Japanese military in 1944 while working in the
fields. They were sent to Japan's ancient capital of Kyoto as slave
laborers at Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co. nickel factory, Kyodo said.
	   The Japanese wartime military systematically abducted Chinese
and forced them to work for Japanese companies to make up for a
labor shortage at home.
	   Nearly 40,000 Chinese were brought to Japan between April 1943
and shortly before Japan's defeat in August, 1945, according to
Japan's wartime documents. They were sent to mines, construction
sites and factories operated by 135 Japanese companies, many of
them among Japan's modern corporate giants.
	   Seven thousand of the 40,000 died of malnutrition and the
violence of their employers.
	   The plaintiffs said they and some 200 other Chinese fellow
laborers were forced to work 14 hours a day and were repeatedly hit
with wooden clubs whenever they failed to meet their work quotas.
	   A dozen of the laborers died of illness, Kyodo said, quoting the
plaintiffs' claims submitted to the court Friday. None of the
Chinese slave laborers at the factory was paid any wages, it said.
	   The laborers had to live under harsh conditions, with no heat in
winter or proper nutrition _ usually just one soybean bun for each
meal. They were also left unattended when they fell ill or injured,
they claimed.
	   Officials of the Justice Ministry and Nippon Yakin Kogyo were
not immediately available for comment late Friday.
	   Last year, the Tokyo District Court dismissed damages claims by
another group of Chinese former slave laborers who worked at a
river redirection project in northern Japan.

South Africa bowl out Sri Lanka for 258
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ South Africa's bowlers came back
remarkably to bowl out the runaway Sri Lankan batting line-up for
258 in the one-day triangular series cricket opener at Trent Bridge
Friday.
	   The World Cup champions were set for a 300-plus total after
hitting 150 for three off 25 overs but lost their way in the face
of some tight South African bowling in the second half of the
innings.
	   Arjuna Ranatunga anchored the innings with a 91-ball 58 runs and
was the ninth man out. His dismissal was the fourth in a
lower-order collapse when Sri Lanka lost five wickets for 34 runs.
	   Openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana hit 85 off 72
balls but the leatherhunt was arrested with the introduction of
fast bowler Allan Donald and seamer Jacques Kallis.
	   Kallis struck with his first ball, forcing Kaluwitharana, 33 off
39 balls, to sky a catch.
	   Donald accounted for the two dangermen, Jayasuriya (36) and
Aravinda de Silva (12), in the space of six balls.
	   The Sri Lankan total was built around a crafty 80-run stand for
the fourth wicket between Marvan Atapattu (40) and Ranatunga, who
came in with the side in a spot of bother at 102 for three.
	   Ranatunga's innings included just two boundaries. He was
eventually run out, beaten by a Gary Kirsten throw from the square
leg boundary going for the second run.
	   Pollock, who took most of the early caning, conceding 20 runs in
his first overs but hit back with 3-11 in 13 balls in his third and
final spell to finish with 3-54.
	   During the early onslaught, South Africa could do nothing to
stop Jayasuriya and Kaluwitharana as they smashed nine boundaries
between them to bring up the 50 in 35 balls.
	   Jayasuriya, one of the most explosive opening batsmen in one-day
cricket, provided the day's exhilarating batting until Donald
removed him.
	   Skipper Hansie Cronje took 2-29 while Donald, 2-40.

German election poll shows tight race

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 2nd poll &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Six weeks before national elections,
Germany's main opposition Social Democratic Party and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservative union were neck-and-neck in polls
released Friday.
	   The Emnid Institute poll, commissioned by n-tv, found support
for the Social Democrats unchanged from a week earlier at 41
percent. Also unchanged was the 38 percent for Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian
Social Union.
	   The weekly survey of about 1,000 people had a margin of error of
plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, however.
	   Another survey of nearly 1,300 voters for public broadcaster ZDF
also pegged support for the CDU/CSU at 38 percent, one percentage
point higher than in July. Support for the Social Democrats was
static at 42 percent.
	   That poll, conducted by the Wahlen research group, also had a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.
	   Both polls put support for the junior coalition partner in
Kohl's coalition, the Free Democratic Party, at 5 percent _ the
minimum threshold needed for parliamentary representation by
parties.
	   And both had the Social Democrats' potential coalition partner,
the environmentalist Greens, at 6 percent.
	   Electoral rules mean a Social Democrat-Greens coalition would
still hold a majority, since other parties, including the successor
to the East German communist party, were unlikely to gain enough
votes to enter parliament in the Sept. 27 election.
	   But for the first time, the ZDF poll found a majority of voters
opposed to a so-called ``red-green'' coalition of the Social
Democrats and Greens; 51 percent, compared with 46 percent two
months ago.
	   The Greens have seen their support erode with such unpopular
proposals as higher gas taxes and autobahn speed limits.

	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ One-day cricket matches involving 18
countries at next month's Commonwealth Games in Malaysia won't have
the official status, an official said Friday.
	   Malaysia does not have official status to host one-day
internationals, said Jagmohan Dalmiya, president of the
International Cricket Council. Besides, Jamaica, Barbados and
Antigua are taking part in their individual capacities and not as
part of the West Indian team.
	   Dalmiya told journalists in Calcutta that the ICC gave the
Commonwealth Games Federation permission to include cricket in its
list of sports, but did not make any commitment for future games,
including the Olympics.
	   The rules of the ICC will apply to the matches in Kuala Lumpur,
he said. Players will be allowed to display the logos of
manufacturers of the equipment they use, but not those of sponsors.
They also will not be paid any fee as in other tournaments.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The book of Revelation with the image of an atomic
bomb cloud on its cover, and a woman's figure adorning the front of
the Song of Solomon: This is the Bible packaged for the modern age.
	   Canongate Books, a small publishing house based in Edinburgh,
Scotland, is putting out 12 Biblical books as separate,
pocket-sized editions, complete with introductions by leading
authors such as Fay Weldon, A.N. Wilson and Doris Lessing.
	   The company is aiming for a new generation of secular, as well
as religious, readers _ many of whom may never have read any of the
Scriptures before and certainly never thought of reading Biblical
stories on the train on the way to work in the mornings.
	   ``I think they will be for all sorts of people,'' said Claire
Paterson, the series' commissioning editor. ``A lot of people will
read the separate books for the very first time.''
	   The company has chosen the King James version of the Bible,
first published in 1611, Paterson said, ``during an extraordinary
flowering of English literature.''
	   The twelve Biblical books chosen, which will retail for 1 pound
(dlrs 1.65) each starting this fall, include the four Gospels and
Genesis, Exodus and Proverbs.
	   Weldon is writing a forward for Corinthians, Wilson for the
Matthew's Gospel and Lessing for Ecclesiates. The forward to
Genesis is being written by a genetic scientist, while Revelations
has an introduction by novelist Will Self.
	   ``Each of the writers finds a particular interest in that book _
it did fit together quite well,'' Paterson said.
	   The idea was hatched just over a year ago when a friend of
Canongate's chairman, Jamie Byng, asked why he had never seen the
Bible published as separate books, she said.
	   Paterson said the company plans to publish another 12 Biblical
books next Easter, with crime novelist Ruth Rendell contributing
the introduction to Romans.
	   Grove-Atlantic Inc. will publish the first series in North
America next spring.

Eight people granted refugee status this year: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Justice Ministry granted asylum to five
refugees Friday and announced it had given asylum to three others
earlier this year, Kyodo news reported.
	   The announcement was unusual because the ministry had previously
refused to reveal information on the status of refugees.
	   Those granted asylum include at least one person from Pakistan,
Kyodo reported, citing sources close to the refugees.
	   The ministry's Immigration Bureau formerly refused to disclose
information on refugees but decided to disclose more after
legislators accused it of being slow in responding to requests for
asylum, Kyodo reported, citing ministry officials.
	   In May, the ministry more than doubled its staff for screening
applications for asylum to 25 to deal with the more than 300
pending cases.
	   The ministry has granted asylum to only one or two people per
year over the last few years, Kyodo said.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Four robbers posing as police stopped a
Russian bus headed for Germany, severely beat one passenger and
made off with the equivalent of dlrs 141,000, police said Friday.
	   The attackers stopped the bus Thursday night by waving red
flashlights used by police _ a trick often used by criminal gangs _
near the village of Lubrza, some 420 kilometers (260 miles) west of
Warsaw, according to police spokesman Pawel Biedziak.
	   They then boarded and forced the driver to drive some 15
kilometers (9 miles) into a wooded area, Biedziak said. One man who

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila has fled Congo's
embattled capital as rebel forces pushed toward Kinshasa, a senior
government official said Friday.
	   ``The president is not in Kinshasa,'' the high-level government
adviser told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. ``I
can't tell you any more than that.''
	   A Western diplomat in Paris, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Kabila was in Lubumbashi, his former rebel base, but had no
further information.
	   With rebel forces advancing on Kinshasa from the west, the
jittery Congolese capital awoke Friday still without electricity,
radio, television or newspapers.
	   Power was restored to some parts of the city in the early
afternoon and state radio began broadcasting with a weakened
signal.
	   ``We call on the people to remain calm, the president of the
republic and the government are doing everything to reverse this
situation,'' the radio said in a statement, referring to the power
outage.
	   The radio resumed its barrage of accusations against neighboring
Rwanda and Uganda, which Kabila accuses of waging a war against
Congo.
	   The city braced for the expected arrival of fighters who
launched a rebellion against Kabila earlier this month. Rumors and
gossip fueled an uneasy sense of muffled panic. Thousands of people
packed sidewalk shops and markets to buy extra provisions,
anticipating what many consider the imminent fall of the capital to
the rebels.
	   With water cut off by the electricity outage, groups of women
trod back and forth to the shores of the Congo River to fill basins
with brown, polluted water for their families.
	   The power outage also silenced state-controlled television and
radio _ though later reports said state radio returned
intermittently. No newspapers were published Friday.
	   ``This is the end,'' said Jean-Pierre Mwenge, standing amid a
crowd of people searching for transport out of the city. ``Now I'm
alone and this will be the end.''
	   Asked where he would go, Mwenge just shrugged.
	   Amid a rush of people trying to withdraw money, banks throughout
the city closed Friday to avoid a drain on reserves.
	   The rebellion began earlier this month when Tutsi-led rebels
closely tied to Rwanda fought government troops in the capital and
opened up fronts in both the east and west of this central African
nation. Many of the rebels were the same soldiers who helped bring
Kabila to power and oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last
year.
	   Congo accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of masterminding the
uprising. Both countries vehemently deny involvement. Uganda and
Rwanda have been angered by the Congolese president's failure to
contain attacks on their territory by renegade groups based in
eastern Congo.
	   Congo's relations with his former allies have been deteriorating
throughout Kabila's 14 months of rule. Last month, he expelled
Rwandan soldiers.
	   On Thursday, rebels reportedly claimed that they had captured
one-third of the country. It was unclear Friday how much control
Kabila continued to wield.
	   The United States was preparing for the emergency evacuation of
its citizens, while foreign airlines _ including Belgian, South
African and Ethiopian carriers _ stopped service to Kinshasa.
	   A French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said France sent a plane
to Kinshasa to pick up its nationals wishing to leave while Germany
also strongly advised its citizens to depart.
	   A primary exit route across the Congo River to Brazzaville, the
capital of neighboring Republic of Congo, was closed days.
	   Before leaving Kinshasa, Kabila sacked his new military
commander Celestin Kifwa _ the president's brother-in-law _ and
replaced him with Joseph Kabila, the president's son. Kabila
appointed Kifwa last month after firing James Kabari, a Rwandan
commander who had been a close ally of Kabila's during his war
against Mobutu.
	   Kabari, also known in Rwanda as Kabarere, has since joined the
rebel movement.
	   Joseph Kabila was an aide to Kifwa.

Opposition survives attack by Meciar's party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The country's largest opposition
party can participate in September elections, the Slovak Supreme
Court ruled Friday, rejecting an attempt by Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar's followers to prevent it from taking part.
	   Earlier this week, Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia
had challenged the opposition party's eligibility to participate in
the Sept. 25 and 26 vote.
	   Meciar's supporters argued that the Slovak Democratic Coalition,
which drew together five political parties in March, could not be
considered a single political party.
	   This spring, parliament approved a law prohibiting any political
party from gaining seats in parliament unless it had received at
least 5 percent of the vote.
	   It is considered highly unlikely that each of the five parties
that united in the Slovak Democratic Coalition could pass the 5
percent threshold.
	   The government's court case was built on two pieces of evidence:
an Internet document describing the party structure and the fact
the party's name includes the word ``coalition.''
	   ``Thousands of people can read on the Internet that a coalition
agreement exists. We thought that since this is displayed on the
Internet, it must be (a coalition) like that,'' said government
attorney Imrich Majersky.
	   Opposition attorney Ernest Valko said he was ``happy because the
court respected all of our explanations.''
	   The Supreme Court ruled a political party can adopt any name it
wants, as long as no other party has the same name.
	   The opposition party was validly registered as a party March 10,
the court ruled.
	   Opposition leaders fear further attacks from Meciar's party.
	   ``This is only the beginning of the circus that will be made by
the prime minister's party. They will try by all means to stop the
SDK's (Slovak Democratic Coalition's) registration,'' said Jan
Langos, an opposition party leader.

IMF endorses Thai financial plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP)_ The International Monetary Fund welcomed
Thailand's comprehensive package to rescue the country's financial
system that includes taking over two debt-ridden banks and five
finance companies.
	   The IMF's acting managing director, Shigemitsu Sugisaki, said in
a statement Friday the move ``demonstrates the resolve of
Thailand's authorities to pursue economic restructuring in the face
of very difficult domestic and regional conditions.''
	   Sugisaki said the measures were aimed at ensuring ``the solvency
and credibility of the core banking system'' and strengthening
``the basis for the recovery of the economy.''
	   ``The announcement recognizes that the recession and the
regional economic environment warrant forceful and comprehensive
measures,'' Sugisaki said.
	   Thailand's financial sector was shaken last year after a
slowdown in the economy exposed insolvency in companies in many
sectors of business.
	   The central bank's rescue fund, the Financial Institutions
Development Fund, will take over the seven institutions with swaps
of debt for new shares, Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Kitti
Patpongpibul said earlier Friday.
	   In some cases cash will also have to be injected, and at a later
stage the institutions will be merged with others or possibly
offered for sale, the Thai official said.
	   The majority of Thailand's 15 commercial banks have failed to
raise adequate new capital from the private sector after becoming
laden with bad debt.
	   An IMF delegation visited Bangkok recently to negotiate terms of
the latest quarterly installment of a dlrs 17.2 billion fund to
help rescue Thailand's economy.

Cinema attendance in Paris booming
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Cup may have kept movie-goers glued to
their televisions, but cinema attendance in Paris has nevertheless
reached a new national record for the 1990s.
	   The newspaper Le Parisien, citing a report by the National
Institute of Statistics (INSEE) said Friday that cinema attendance
was up 20 percent in the first half of 1998 compared to last year
in the Paris region.
	   Some 45.3 million people went to the cinema in the Paris region
in 1997, in itself the highest total in 12 years. And the figures
have kept increasing.
	   During the month-long World Cup soccer extravaganza, cinemas
were frequently empty as people either stayed at home to watch the
games, or went to bars to watch them on big screens.
	   Experts say the immense popularity of ``Titanic'' and ``Le Diner
des Cons'' (The Idiots' Dinner), a French comedy currently drawing
huge crowds, partially explain the increase.
	   INSEE statistics show that Parisians go to the cinema twice as
often as people living in the provinces. The capital boasts 343
movie theaters with 69,000 seats.
	   INSEE expert Marie-Christine Foret said the increasing
popularity of multi-theater complexes _ offering a variety of
restaurants and shops _ also explains the rise.

Mir crew prepares for replacements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tired after six months on board Mir, the space
station's crew prepared Friday for a rendezvous with their
replacements.
	   ``Our saviors are coming,'' Mir commander Talgat Musabayev joked
during a radio exchange with ground controllers.
	   A Soyuz TM-28 ship, launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in
Kazakstan on Thursday, was adjusting its orbit in anticipation of
docking with Mir at 2:58 p.m. Moscow time (1058 GMT) Saturday.
	   The Soyuz carries a three-man crew consisting of President Boris
Yeltsin's former national security adviser, Yuri Baturin, flight
commander Sergei Avdeyev and engineer Gennady Padalka.
	   Earlier this week, space officials reported trouble with Mir's
automatic docking system but later said the crew fixed it. The
docking system has failed during previous dockings, but the crew
has been able to use manual controls.
	   ``We have everything ready for the docking,'' Deputy Mission
Control chief Viktor Blagov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   After the Soyuz docks, the Mir crew has been promised a
celebratory dinner with alcohol.
	   ``We will let them interrupt communications and won't oversee
them or create any obstacles,'' Blagov said. ``They could drink
some brandy if they have some and I think they do.''
	   The Soyuz flight has been trouble-free so far, although Kazak
officials cut power to the cosmodrome immediately after the launch
because of unpaid bills, disabling a Russian tracking system.
	   Russian space officials quickly switched to other control
stations without losing the track of the Soyuz, the Kommersant
newspaper said Friday.
	   Kazak officials have repeatedly cut power to the Baikonur
cosmodrome, which Russia rents from its Central Asian neighbor. One
recent blackout lasted for two weeks and caused a launch to be
postponed for 10 days.
	   Mir's current crew will return to Earth along with Baturin on
Aug. 25.
	   The new crew is scheduled to stay on Mir until February.
However, Avdeyev, the flight commander, may remain on the orbiter
until June, when the Mir is to be discarded and lowered to Earth.

Former communists apologize for East German repressing Czech
</HEADLINE>
uprising &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The successor party to the former East German
communists apologized Friday for East Germany's role in the
Soviet-led invasion that crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reform
movement in then-Czechoslovakia 30 years ago.
	   In letters sent to both Czech President Vaclav Havel and
Slovakian President Vladimir Meciar, the Party of Democratic
Socialism said it recognized ``the guilt'' that East Germany and
its communist party ``brought upon themselves through their
involvement in the action, which violated international law.''
	   The letters were signed by PDS party chairman Lothar Bisky and
Gregor Gysi, head of the PDS group in parliament.
	   The so-called ``Prague Spring'' in Czechoslovakia in 1968 was
``the last attempt for democratic renewal of genuine socialism,''
the letters said.
	   Soviet-led forces, including troops from former East Germany,
invaded Czechoslovakia on Aug. 21, 1968, to crush the movement led
by then-President Alexander Dubcek, who wanted to liberalize
politics there. He was imprisoned.
	   The PDS letters said East German communist leaders ``wanted an
East German participation'' in crushing the uprising because they
feared it could eventually endanger East Germany's own existence.
	   With German national elections set for Sept. 27, the former
communists are trying to convince voters they are sincere about
accepting Germany's constitutional democracy.
	   In a letter sent to former German President Richard von
Weizsaecker a week ago, the party also apologized for former East
Germany's repression of its citizens during more than 40 years of
authoritarian communist rule.

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Politicians and civic leaders attending
a three week Liberian conference complained of growing lawlessness
and state-sponsored human rights abuses in this battle-scarred West
African country.
	   The participants at the three-week conference _ attended by U.S.
special envoy to Africa Rev. Jesse Jackson _ which ended Thursday
urged President Charles Taylor to form a human rights commission to
monitor crimes allegedly committed by the police and military.
	   Critics have accused Taylor of allowing corruption and filling
his new military force with his ex-rebel supporters, many of whom
are accused of serious abuses during Liberia's seven-year civil war
which ended in 1996.
	   Taylor won a landslide victory in national elections last year.

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nineteen youths jailed in 1994 in
connection with murders that led to the execution of acclaimed
Nigerian playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa remain behind bars in appalling
conditions, an ethnic Ogoni advocacy group said.
	   In a statement, the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni
People (MOSOP) said some of the youths, who are held in overcrowded
snake-infested prison cells in the southeastern city of Port
Harcourt, had developed serious health problems.
	   Families of the detainees were forced to bribe guards to visit
them, the advocacy group said.
	   Saro-Wiwa, an internationally renowned Ogoni activist and
writer, was executed by the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha in 1995
for allegedly inciting murders of four moderate members of his
minority ethnic group during a political rally.
	   The 19 detainees were also accused of involvement in the rally
and subsequent deaths. Saro-Wiwa's execution sparked wide-scale
outrage and the international isolation of Nigeria.
	   The Ogoni group has accused the government and international oil
companies of polluting traditional Ogoni lands and coastal fishing
waters.

	   COTONOU, Benin (AP) _ Leaders of five French-speaking West
African countries have met to discuss the rising tide of conflicts
on the continent and allow tourists easier access to each of the
five states.
	   The presidents of Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger and Ivory
Coast met together Thursday for several hours in Benin's capital
Cotonou to discuss ongoing conflicts in Guinea-Bissau, Angola and
Congo.
	   The leaders also signed an agreement to create new dlrs 50
tourist visas that permit visitors to enter each of the five
countries and travel freely for a period of up to two months.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Eric Anthony hit a solo homer in the bottom of the
fifth inning Friday, helping power the Yakult Swallows to a 5-1
victory over the Central League's front-running Yokohama BayStars.
	   It was the second homer for Anthony, formerly of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, since he joined the Japanese pro baseball in late June.
	   Swallows' starter Kenjiro Kawasaki (12-6) struck out seven,
allowed seven hits and walked two in his sixth complete game this
season.
	   At Nagoya, Hitoshi Teneda doubled home the winning run in the
bottom of the ninth inning as the Chunichi Dragons came from behind
to edge the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 6-5 at home, their fourth victory
in a row.
	   Leo Gomez, formerly of the Chicago Cubs, batted in a run on a
single to tie the game at 5-5 earlier in the ninth.
	   The Dragons are now only three games behind the BayStars.
	   At the Tokyo Dome, the Yomiuri Giants pounded out 17 hits to
crush archrival Hanshin Tigers 9-3.
	   Rookie star Yoshinobu Takahashi hit a tie-breaking two-run
homer, his 14th round-tripper this season, in the bottom of the
third inning. Daisuke Motoki added another run on a solo homer.
	   In Pacific League action, catcher Kenji Yoshitsuru blasted the
winning two-run homer in the top of the 11th inning, giving the
Chiba Lotte Marines a 11-9 victory over the Kintetsu Buffaloes at
Osaka Dome.
	   Yoshitsuru has three homers this season.
	   Phil Clark, formerly of the Boston Red Sox, hit a pair of
two-run homers in two straight at-bats in the bottom of the first
and third innings for the Buffaloes.
	   Second-place Buffaloes were dealt their third straight defeat
and now are 6 1/2 games behind the first-place Nippon Ham Fighters,
who were idle Friday.
	   At Seibu Dome, Kazuo Matsui hit a two-run homer in the bottom of
the sixth inning as the Seibu Lions beat the Orix BlueWave 6-2 at
home, ending the BlueWave's winning streak at four.
	   Kazuhiro Wada cracked a solo homer in the third.

 &UR; Grandson of gambling kingpin wounded in botched kidnapping &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prosecutor and his wife shot &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ Two gunmen on a motorcyle shot and wounded a
government prosecutor and his pregnant wife Friday, one day after
the grandson of one of Macau's original gambling kingpins was
wounded in a shootout with attackers.
	   Police said prosecutor Lourenco Nogueiro and his wife were
walking near a hotel on Taipa island when they were shot. The
gunmen escaped. The motive for the attack was unknown.
	   Nogueiro and his wife were taken to a hospital, where they were
listed in satisfactory condition.
	   On Thursday, Yip Wai-tong, 46, the grandson of the late gambling
tycoon, Yip Hon, was was shot in the abdomen and seriously wounded
on a Macau street. He returned fire with his own handgun,
shattering windows of the attackers' van and driving them off.
	   Police believe the attackers wanted to kidnap Yip.
	   The van was abandoned about 500 meters (yards) away, and police
were looking for the attackers.
	   Macau has struggled with gang violence, much of it connected to
the gambling industry, this year, its last full year under
Portuguese rule. After some 450 years as a Portuguese territory, it
returns to Chinese rule in December 1999.
	   Critics say the territory, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) across
the mouth of the Pearl River from Hong Kong, relies too much on
gambling for its income.
	   Hong Kong newspapers said Yip lives in Hong Kong and runs soft
drink and water distilling companies for his father. They said Yip
had a license to carry a gun.
	   His grandfather was one of Macau's original gambling tycoons. He
died last year at the age of 93. At his funeral, another one of
Macau's gambling top gambling figures, Stanley Ho, referred to Yip
Hon as the ``the God of gambling.''

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy told Americans here
Friday it i11s suspending normal operations and evacuating family
members and non-essential personnel after reports that U.S.
officials were involved in the arrest of several people suspected
of terrorist links.
	   The embassy, in a statement circulated to U.S. citizens, also
urged Americans to avoid travel to Albania and exercise caution if
they must remain.
	   ``Given the recent declarations bi Islamic extremists against
the United States and its citizens and press reports alleging U.S.
government participation in the recent apprehension of several
Islamic activists, it is possible the U.S. Embassy in Tirana,
Albania, could be one of the targets of a terrorist attack,'' the
statement said.
	   ``In light of this information, the U.S. Embassy in Tirana is
temporarily suspending normal operations,'' the statement added.
``The Department of State has ordered the departure of U.S.
personnel in non-essential positions and the families of the
embassy employees.''
	   It urged those remaining to ``review their security practices
and exercise caution.'' The embassy was closed Friday.
	   One day before the bombings at U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, an Arabic language newspaper published in London,
al-Hayat, published a letter from the ``International Islamic Front
for Jihad'' vowing revenge against the United States for the
arrests of several of its members in Albania.
	   Albanian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
four were wanted on terrorist charges in Egypt, and U.S. agents
took them out of the country.
	   On Thursday, the head of the Albanian secret service was quoted
in a Tirana newspaper as saying the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency is operating in Albania, helping rebuild the country's
internal security capability.
	   Fatos Klosi said that relations between his Albanian Secret
Service, or SHIK, and the CIA ``were intensified in the last
months'' and that ``CIA specialists'' were operating in the
country.
	   ``They even have offices in the north,'' he added, referring to
the area near the border with Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, where
the Kosovo Liberation Army maintains sanctuaries.

Russian official: Sea Launch likely to go ahead in November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top Russian space official expressed hope Friday
that the controversy around the Sea Launch commercial rocket
program would be cleared up soon and the first launch would take
place in November.
	   The U.S. State Department has suspended work on the project,
accusing Boeing Co. of providing possibly sensitive information to
Russian and Ukrainian engineers working on it.
	   Both Russian and Boeing officials maintain that none of the
information was classified, and that Boeing simply failed to follow
proper procedures.
	   ``I believe that we shall see the first launch in late
November,'' the head of the Russian Space Agency, Yuri Koptev, was
quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The State Department is investigating whether the disclosures
violated federal law.
	   The suspension was imposed July 27 without public announcement
by either Boeing or the government. It was prompted by Boeing's
admission to the State Department that it failed to obtain the
required U.S. government permission before sharing information with
its partners, RKK-Energiya of Moscow and the Ukrainian company KB
Yuzhnoye/PO.
	   Boeing has a 40 percent stake in Sea Launch, and is overall
project manager, but the technology primarily is that of other
countries.
	   The dlrs 500 million program will use a modified version of the
Soviet SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missile to boost satellites
into space from a platform positioned at the equator.

Islamic opposition wants to scrap Tajikistan's secular status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ A mostly Islamic opposition party
wants to scrap a section of Tajikistan's constitution that
describes the former Soviet republic as a secular state.
	   The United Tajik Opposition called Friday for a public
referendum to decide the issue.
	   ``In Tajikistan there should be no law that under some pretense
forbids or limits political activity and imposes a particular
philosophy on society,'' the statement said.
	   The group also warned that Tajikistan's description as secular `
does not reflect the Tajik people's mentality, which may breed
problems and contradictions.''
	   Tajikistan's government rejected the appeal.
	   The constitution ``shall not be changed, even in a referendum,''
said presidential adviser Khalifbobo Khamidov, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The government and the opposition, which includes Islamic
fundamentalists, signed a peace agreement last year ending a 5-year
civil war. Under the agreement, the government must gradually
incorporate more opposition members into its ranks.
	   However, there are still tensions between the two sides, and
President Emomali Rakhmonov recently tried to strengthen his
control over the opposition in the military by banning soldiers
from growing beards.

Demaci to lead KLA's political wing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Adem Demaci, the toughest political
rival of Kosovo's pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova, said Friday he
was accepting the political leadership of the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   The KLA, which is fighting to secede Kosovo province from
Serbia, refused to join Rugova's negotiating team in peace talks
with the Serbian government.
	   Just hours before Rugova announced his negotiating team
Thursday, the KLA named its own six-member team of ``political
representatives,'' declaring its ``full trust'' in Demaci to lead
the rebel army in ``creating the institutions of Kosovo.''
	   It urged Demaci, who spent 28 years as a political prisoner in
Serbian jails, to leave his Parliamentary Party of Kosovo. On
Friday Demaci accepted the offer.
	   Demaci's acceptance further splits ethnic Albanians between
those supporting the radical militants and those who support
Rugova's policies of peaceful and negotiated secession from Serbia,
the dominant republic of what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   In his public statement to the KLA, Demaci gave three reasons
for accepting. Firstly, the hardline Serbian regime _ that is
acting with ``fire and sword in Kosovo''_ secondly, the belief that
the KLA represents ``the concrete expression of our desire for
freedom,'' and thirdly, that the Kosovo crisis is continuing due to
the ``contradictory interests'' of the United States and the
European countries.
	   ``You have accepted to die,'' Demaci told the members of the
KLA, ``led by our unbreakable desire for freedom.''
	   Thursday's KLA statement hinted at a threat to Rugova for
attempting to negotiate the future of Kosovo without the rebels,
calling on politicians to ``stop the actions of disunity, or our
strike will be ruthless.''
	   Demaci told the Associated Press Friday that he doubts peace
will prevail in Kosovo soon.
	   ``The clashes in Kosovo will continue until the Serbian regime
admits that there is no other solution but Kosovo's independence,''
he said.

Government puts ambulance on standby for pro-democracy leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 2 grafs with quotes from Suu Kyi interview made before
standoff &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military regime said Friday
that an ambulance is on standby at a roadblock where Nobel Peace
Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi was in the third day of a new
standoff over her right to travel outside Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi's party, the opposition National League for Democracy,
has said the government will be responsible for her health if the
deadlock continues. She was stopped Tuesday as she attempted to
travel to Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Yangon, to
meet supporters.
	   Suu Kyi, 53, was stopped at a checkpoint 32 kilometers (19
miles) west of the capital, the same site as three previous
standoffs with the government during the past two months.
	   During an earlier six-day confrontation, Suu Kyi and her party
said they would not accept medical treatment from anyone except her
personal physicians. The government said it was providing her food
and water.
	   After it was over, Suu Kyi said the authorities prevented her
from obtaining food and water and stopped her physician from seeing
her because she attempted to bring her food. She ended up suffering
from a high fever and severe dehydration.
	   A government statement faxed to The Associated Press in Bangkok,
Thailand, said an ambulance had been placed on standby in case Suu
Kyi or 75-year-old Hla Pe, a member of the party's central
executive committee, or their two drivers fell ill.
	   ``There are not many ambulances in Yangon, however, and the
government hopes that Ms. Suu Kyi and her companions will return
home soon so that ambulance and medical staff may be put back to
use helping the truly needy,'' the statement said.
	   Security has reportedly been tight around the area. The
government claimed Friday that ``recent threats of violence have
raised security concerns, making travel there by prominent persons
unadvisable at this time.''
	   Suu Kyi has been battling for more democracy since 1988, when
she rose to prominence during a nationwide uprising against
military rule that was eventually crushed. An estimated 3,000
people died.
	   But her political activities are severely curtailed by the
military, which has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
She has been allowed outside the capital once since her release
from six years of house arrest in 1995, to visit a Buddhist monk.
	   Suu Kyi's latest attempted foray into the provinces appears
intended to raise international pressure on the government ahead of
an Aug. 21 deadline she has set for parliament to be convened.
	   Elections allowed in 1990 were overwhelmingly won by the
opposition, but the military never allowed the parliament to meet.
	   Suu Kyi has prepared for a long standoff, traveling in a van
this time instead of the sedan she used last month. Her party has
expressed fears that the small wooden bridge where it has been
moved could collapse under its weight.
	   ``In order to provide for their comfort and welfare, government
officials have provided a beach umbrella, some garden chairs and a
selection of journals to help Ms. Suu Kyi pass the time,'' the
statement said.
	   A government spokesman said Thursday that Suu Kyi refused to
speak to authorities and the windows of the van were kept rolled
up.
	   In an interview made before the standoff, broadcast this week by
the British Broadcasting Corp., Suu Kyi said she believed the
government would eventually accept it had to negotiate with her.
	   ``The tide of history is with us,'' Suu Kyi said. ``The
situation of the country is such that the military regime can
really do nothing for the country, and the people know that change
is necessary.''

Veteran Egyptian opposition leader dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Mustafa Kamel Mourad, the founder-leader of
a small Egyptian opposition party, died early Friday. He was 70.
	   The Socialist Al-Ahrar Party said Mourad died in hospital in
Cairo after a year-long illness. The statement did not give the
illness or cause of death.
	   A writer of liberal commentaries, Mourad's final column appeared
Friday in the party's mouthpiece, Al-Ahrar, the newspaper he
founded in 1976.
	   The column condemned the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, but warned Washington that the attacks were the
result of ``the oppression and control which the United States
practices against the people'' of the Third World.
	   Mourad was born in Cairo in 1927. After school, he joined the
army and fought in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Continuing his
education as a soldier, he took a degree in military science in
1948 and one in commerce in 1954.
	   A group of military officers led by Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser had
seized power in 1952 and Mourad was appointed to various positions
in the civil service and public sector corporations. These included
spells on the board of directors of textile, cotton and shipping
companies.
	   In 1975, when President Anwar Sadat decided to open up the
political spectrum, Mourad was allowed to found the Socialist
Al-Ahrar Party. The party appealed to right-wing supporters of the
Arab Socialist Union, which until then had been the sole legal
party in Egypt.
	   The following year he founded the party's newspaper, which was
the first opposition paper to be published since the 1952
revolution.
	   Under Mourad's leadership, the party pursued both Islamist and
Nasserite policies. It fought the 1987 elections in alliance with
the Muslim Brotherhood and a third party, winning a combined 60
seats in the 458-seat National Assembly. But it also hired a
well-known Nasserite as editor-in-chief of Al-Ahrar.
	   Currently the party holds one seat in parliament _ oppostion
parties having been reduced to a total of 15 seats in the 1995
elections. The party calls for greater political freedom, worker's
rights, and the abolition of the state of emergency, which has been
in force since Sadat's assassination in 1981.
	   Mourad is survived by his wife and three children.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. efforts to unite Kosovo
Albanians' fragmented leadership suffered a setback Friday when a
prominent hardliner accepted the political leadership of the rebel
force which has refused to join peace talks.
	   On Thursday, the province's leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim
Rugova, announced he had formed a delegation to begin talks with
the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the
future of the rebellious Serbian province. But Rugova failed to
convince the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army to join the team.
	   Rugova's chief rival, Adem Demaci, announced Friday he was
accepting an offer by the KLA to become leader of its political
wing, in effect establishing himself as an alternative leader of
the province's majority Albanian community.
	   Demaci's acceptance further splits ethnic Albanians between
those supporting the radical militants and those who back Rugova's
policies of peaceful and negotiated secession from Serbia, the
dominant republic of what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   Demaci said he accepted the offer because the KLA represents
``the concrete expression of our desire for freedom.'' He said the
crisis is continuing because the Americans and Europeans do not
support independence for Kosovo.
	   ``The clashes in Kosovo will continue until the Serbian regime
admits that there is no other solution but Kosovo's independence,''
Demaci said.
	   Earlier Friday, Rugova told a news conference that peace talks
cannot begin until the Serb-led government halts its military
offensive against the KLA ``in order to create a favorable
atmosphere for the start of the dialogue.''
	   Another influential Kosovo Albanian leader, Mahmut Bakalli, was
more explicit.
	   ``I think we are no closer to real talks,'' said Bakalli, who
took part in talks which broke down in May. ``We must first have a
cease-fire on the ground and enable thousands of refugees return to
their homes.''
	   He said those were ``essential conditions'' which ``cannot be
fulfilled without a direct international military and political
intervention.''
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province in
southern Serbia whose population of 2 million is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian. Serbia is the dominant of two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia.
	   The Americans and Europeans have drawn back from taking a
decision on sending troops to Kosovo, partly because of Russian
opposition and also because they do not want to be drawn into a
Balkan war.
	   But Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the United States
would ``strongly consider some sort of participation'' in a
NATO-led peacekeeping force, if talks between the Albanians and the
government create the right conditions.
	   But the failure of Rugova and his international backers to
convince secessionist rebels to join the talks raises doubts of
whether a cease-fire can be arranged.
	   Milosevic has offered to negotiate autonomy but not
independence, a position supported by the United States and the
Europeans.
	   In Germany, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said the time had come
for ``a serious discussion of an active intervention'' by NATO in
Kosovo. ``We must now finally go on the offensive with the
political debate,'' Ruehe told Bild newspaper.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who for weeks has been struggling
to persuade ethnic Albanian rebels and politicians to stop
squabbling and join forces, said the ongoing violence in Kosovo
made it imperative to start talks immediately _ with or without the
rebels.
	   The ethnic Albanians' five-member team includes mainly disciples
of Rugova, a pacifist supported by one branch of the KLA and
despised by others.
	   Rugova, Hill and European diplomats hope the rebels and other
ethnic Albanian politicians will join negotiations with Milosevic
if they see progress is being made toward autonomy for Kosovo.

Kazakstan, Iran express concern about fighting in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan and
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi expressed concern Friday
over the fighting in northern Afghanistan.
	   ``A broad coalition government should be set up in Afghanistan
to take the interests of all its ethnic minorities into account,''
Kharazi said following a meeting with Nazarbayev in the Kazak
capital, Astana.
	   The fighting in Afghanistan ``can undoubtedly affect the
security of Central Asian countries,'' he said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear that if the
Taliban army gains control of all of Afghanistan, it will entrench
a radical Islamic state and that there will be an influx of
refugees and weapons across their borders.
	   Kharazi also expressed concern about the reported abduction of
11 Iranians, including employees of the Iranian consulate in
Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold of the opposition Northern Alliance,
which recently fell to the Taliban.

Veteran Egyptian opposition leader dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Mustafa Kamel Mourad, the founder-leader of
a small Egyptian opposition party, died early Friday. He was 70.
	   The Socialist Al-Ahrar Party said Mourad died in hospital in
Cairo after a year-long illness. The statement did not give the
illness or cause of death.
	   A writer of liberal commentaries, Mourad's final column appeared
Friday in the party's mouthpiece, Al-Ahrar, the newspaper he
founded in 1976.
	   The column condemned the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, but warned Washington that the attacks were the
result of ``the oppression and control which the United States
practices against the people'' of the Third World.
	   Mourad was born in Cairo in 1927. After school, he joined the
army and fought in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Continuing his
education as a soldier, he took a degree in military science in
1948 and one in commerce in 1954.
	   A group of military officers led by Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser
seized power in 1952. Mourad was appointed to various positions in
the civil service and public sector corporations, including terms
on the board of directors of textile, cotton and shipping
companies.
	   In 1975, when President Anwar Sadat decided to open up the
political spectrum, Mourad was allowed to establish the Socialist
Al-Ahrar Party. The party appealed to right-wing supporters of the
Arab Socialist Union, which until then had been the sole legal
party in Egypt.
	   The following year he founded the party's newspaper, which was
the first opposition paper to be published since the 1952
revolution.
	   Under Mourad's leadership, the party pursued both Islamist and
Nasserite policies. It fought the 1987 elections in alliance with
the Muslim Brotherhood and a third party, winning a combined 60
seats in the 458-seat National Assembly. But it also hired a
well-known Nasserite as editor-in-chief of Al-Ahrar.
	   Currently the party holds one seat in parliament _ oppostion
parties having been reduced to a total of 15 seats in the 1995
elections. The party calls for greater political freedom, worker's
rights, and the abolition of the state of emergency, which has been
in force since Sadat's assassination in 1981.
	   Mourad is survived by his wife and three children.

UNICEF chief deplores recruitment of children in Congo conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Congo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The head of the U.N. Children's Fund on Friday
condemned the recruitment of ``hundreds'' of children as soldiers
in fighting between the government and rebels in Congo.
	   ``UNICEF appeals to both sides of the conflict to renounce
detention of ethnic adversaries and to release all those who have
been detained to date,'' Carol Bellamy said in a statement.
	   Bellamy voiced particular concern over the re-enlistment of more
than 500 former child soldiers who had been demobilized and
prepared for reintegration with families.
	   A group of more than 400 from a transit center in Kisangani and
some 100 in Bukavu were re-enlisted, the agency said. It had been
supporting the demobilization and reintegration program since last
September.
	   UNICEF understands both sides are recruiting children as
soldiers, some as young as 12, spokesman Patrick McCormick said.
	   Bellamy also regretted that this month's hostilities have put a
UNICEF polio vaccination program on hold. The agency says Congo has
the world's highest incidence of polio.
	   The rebellion against President Laurent Kabila began earlier
this month when Tutsi-led rebels closely tied to Rwanda fought
government troops in the capital and opened up fronts in both the
east and west of the country.
	   Many of the rebels were the same soldiers who helped bring
Kabila to power and oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last
year.

Foreign activists will be deported from Myanmar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with more details, quotes, edits throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Moments after sentencing 18 foreign
activists to five years of hard labor Friday for handing out
democracy leaflets, Myanmar's military government said they will be
deported Saturday.
	   The drama of the seven-hour trial was enhanced when immediately
after a judge read out the prison terms, the lights in the Yangon
court room suddenly went out. There was murmuring among the
diplomatic observers, who appeared shocked at the severity of the
sentences.
	   After a few moments delay, the lights came back on and an
official from the Ministry of Home Affairs strode to the front of
the courtroom and read an order reducing the sentences.
	   The order, signed by Home Affairs Minister Tin Hlaing, said the
activists _ six Americans, three Malaysians, three Indonesians,
three Thais, two Filipinos and one Australian _ would be expelled
on the condition they would not violate Myanmar laws again.
	   If they did, he added, they would have to serve out any future
prison terms passed upon them together with the five years from
this offense. He asked diplomats from the activists' home countries
to arrange for their deportations.
	   The defendants, who appeared solemn when the judge read the
original sentence, jumped up, embraced one another, shook hands and
thanked those around them in the courtroom after the deportation
order was announced.
	   They were also embraced by diplomats from their respective
countries who attended the trial in a small concrete courthouse
outside the walls of Insein Prison north of Yangon.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said all 18 detainees would be
leaving Yangon on Saturday for Bangkok. They would spend their last
night in the Myanmar capital in a police guest house.
	   ``We're very pleased to learn that the six Americans will be
reunited with their families,'' said the spokeswoman on condition
of anonymity.
	   ``We feel a sense of relief that our people will be coming out
safely,'' said Kobsak Chutikul, a spokesman for Thailand's Ministry
of Foreign Affairs. ``We also feel the Burmese have demonstrated a
sensitivity to the concerns of the international community, and in
particular its ASEAN neighbors.''
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which ignored
international outcry over Myanmar's human-rights record last year
to make the country a member, has more diplomatic influence with
the ruling generals than Western countries.
	   The activists were detained Sunday, the day after the 10th
anniversary of a failed nationwide democracy uprising, for handing
out small cards to Myanmar citizens telling them the outside world
supported their struggle and to not give up.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. More than 3,000 demonstrators were
gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   The foreigners were charged, after six days of questioning and
investigation, with violating section 5j of the 1950 Emergency
Provision Act.
	   The sweeping law allows for maximum 20-year jail terms for
inciting unrest and disturbing the peace and tranquility of the
state.
	   The reduction in sentences seemed to be helped by a defendant,
Chong Kok Wei, a 27-year-old Malaysian man, who appealed to the
judge.
	   He said he and his colleagues meant no harm to the Myanmar
people, didn't intend to incite unrest and were unaware of the
local laws.
	   The official from the Ministry of Home Affairs then read the
order deporting them.
	   Some observers said the episode appeared pre-planned. The
Myanmar government was caught between trying to discourage foreign
activists from coming and inciting the populace, and souring
relations with foreign countries.
	   Earlier this year, a Myanmar court sentenced a
British-Australian national, James Mawdsley, to five years in
prison for also handing out democracy leaflets.
	   Mawdsley was released after spending about three months in
Insein Prison, where hundreds of political prisoners and violent
criminals are held.
	   A diplomat who visited the American activists Thursday said the
embassies involved were not informed of the trial until Friday
morning.
	   Earlier Friday at a press conference in Bangkok, Thailand,
weeping and angry relatives appealed for the activists' release.
	   They were joined by a U.S. congressman, Rep. Chris Smith,
chairman of the House International Operations and Human Rights
subcommittee, who accused the government of committing a ``public
relations disaster.''
	   Upon learning of the release, Smith, a New Jersey Republican,
said he still wanted to go to Myanmar and engage both the
government and the democratic opposition in a dialogue. The
government has denied him a visa.
	   He also pledged his committee would hold ``full-fledged, serious
hearings on what the international community and the U.S. can do to
promote democracy in Burma.''
	   He urged the activists to continue their campaign, but from
outside Myanmar.
	   Family members felt relief, but were saving the real
celebrations until their loved ones reached Bangkok.
	   ``I can't be happier,'' said Eva Sana, mother of Philippines
activist Ellene Sana. ``Now I can sleep, after not having slept for
many nights.''
	   In Hamilton Township, New Jersey, Jennifer Keegan, Michele's
sister said: ``We were really afraid. ... We have a group going to
see her and we have wanted to count her fingers, toes ... give her
a hug and kisses ...''

Search continues for 13-year-old boy after boat accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMONE, Italy (AP) _ Police using a helicopter and several boats
searched the clear waters of Lake Garda Friday for a 13-year-old
English boy whose father and younger brother drowned in a boating
accident.
	   Sgt. Fabio Volpari, of the paramilitary Carabinieri police, said
the search for Timothy Harris would continue as along as there was
visibility.
	   The bodies of the two British tourists, Richard Harris, and his
son, Luke, 6, were discovered on Thursday, far from the point on
the lake where the family's rented boat capsized during a wind
storm on Wednesday.
	   The mother, Katherine Harris, survived and was being treated in
a hospital for shock.
	   Three members of another family boating with the Harris family
survived.
	   Lake Garda, 125 kilometers (75 miles) west of Milan, is a
popular spot for swimming and boating.

Italian soccer stars questioned in doping investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Del Piero quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ World Cup stars Alessandro Del Piero, Dino
Baggio and Enrico Chiesa were questioned Friday by prosecutors
investigating the alleged use of performance-enhancing substances
in the country's most popular sport.
	   Del Piero, the star-forward of league champion Juventus, was
heard by prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello in Turin.
	   Chiesa and Dino Baggio, of Parma, were questioned by prosecutor
Giovanni Spinosa in Bologna.
	   The three players, summoned as ``people acquainted with the
facts,'' were on Italy's roster at France '98. The Italian team was
eliminated by France in the World Cup quarterfinals.
	   ``It was a normal request for information. I have been heard as
a witness,'' Baggio said as he left the court following one hour of
questioning.
	   Del Piero, one of the biggest names in Italian soccer, said that
he told the Turin prosecutor ``that my physical form is the result
of years of hard work.''
	   ``My concentration (for the upcoming season) has not been upset
... now it is up to my lawyers to take action against the person
who slandered me,'' Del Piero told the ANSA news agency.
	   The Juventus star added that he told Guariniello that he was
unaware of soccer players who may have taken drugs to improve their
performances.
	   Separate investigations in the case, touched off by allegations
by Roma's coach Zdenek Zeman, are being conducted in Rome, Turin
and Bologna.
	   Zeman, who was questioned by Guariniello and by officials of the
Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) earlier this week, denounced in
published interviews the growing use of medicine in Italian soccer.
	   The Czech coach of AS Roma, who said he made his remarks for the
good of soccer, never spoke specifically of doping substances.
	   Zeman particularly drew the ire of soccer dynasty Juventus by
expressing his amazement at the quick muscular development of
current star Del Piero and former star Gianluca Vialli, now
player-coach with the English club Chelsea.
	   Both Del Piero and Vialli said they planned to sue Zeman.
	   Vialli may be questioned by Guariniello on Monday, court sources
said.
	   Meanhile Luciano Nizzola, president of the Italian Soccer
Federation, said the governing body ``can't oppose scientific
progress in soccer.''
	   ``Everything which is not forbidden must be considered
permitted,'' Nizzola was quoted by Italy's largest sports daily,
Gazzetta dello Sport, as saying.
	   ``We can't prevent use of substances which are not forbidden and
which are not dangerous to the health,'' Nizzola said.
	   However, experts of CONI's anti-doping commission suggested an
``overdose'' of medicine could be considered a health hazard.
	   ``Supplements and certain medicines are not included in the
doping lists, but still could harm the athletes,'' said lawyer Ugo
Longo, who heads CONI's own investigation.

France assures Guinea-Bissau's president that alleged report never
</HEADLINE>
existed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ France assured Guinea-Bissau's president
Friday that it had not produced a report accusing him of arms and
drug trafficking, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   An article in the Portuguese daily Diario de Noticias claimed
Thursday that French President Jacques Chirac had commissioned a
report into President Joao Bernardo Vieira's government that
concluded it was riddled with corruption.
	   News of the alleged report produced shock waves in the
government of the tiny West African country that faces similar
charges from a military faction that rebelled on June 7, Lusa said.
	   Vieira's request that the French Embassy in Guinea-Bissau
clarify the allegations prompted Charge d'Affaires Gaston Grelaud
to make a personal visit to the president, Lusa said.
	   Later Friday, French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret told a Paris press conference that ``France solemnly
denies the existence of the alleged inquiry,'' Lusa reported.
	   According to Diario de Noticias, the report was to aid the
government evaluate Guinea-Bissau's membership of the Franc Zone _
an economic accord between France, Monaco and 15 African states,
mostly former French colonies.
	   The newspaper said the report had concluded that Vieira's
resignation would be a possible solution to the former Portuguese
colony's two-month-old conflict.
	   Vieira and rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane agreed to a
ceasefire on July 26, reaffirming their truce at a second round of
talks a week ago. A third round due next week was postponed amid a
debate over who should mediate the talks.

British tourists sentenced for naked escapade among ancient ruins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IRAKLION, Greece (AP) _ Four British tourists arrested for
posing naked at Crete's ancient Minoan palace received seven- and
10-month prison terms Friday, media reports said.
	   The four, identified as Shiva Mahalingam and Mit Kopeha, both
22, Daniel Maher, 26, and Vimal Patel, 23, were arrested Thursday
afternoon in King Minos's palace at the archaeological site of
Knossos on charges of ``causing a scandal by engaging in obscene
acts,'' the reports said. No home towns were available.
	   Two were posing naked in front of a throne believed to have
belonged to King Minos, while the other two took photographs. The
reports did not specify which two were naked.
	   When a guard at the site complained, the tourists flashed their
buttocks at him, the court was reportedly told.
	   Dating from 2600-1100 B.C., the Minoan civilization gave rise to
the myth of the Minotaur. According to the legend, Minos, king of
Knossos, kept the Minotaur, a creature which was half human, half
bull, in a labyrinth. The creature devoured youths and virgins
brought as tributes until it was slayed by the mythical hero
Theseus.
	   The tourists told the court they regretted their actions,
describing them as ``a moment of foolishness,'' local media said.
	   Three of the four were sentenced to 10 months in prison, while
one received a seven month term. They will appeal the sentences on
Monday, and are expected to be released after each paying bail of
200,000 drachma (dlrs 660).

France assures Guinea-Bissau's president that alleged report never

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ France assured Guinea-Bissau's president
Friday that it had not produced a report accusing him of arms and
drug trafficking, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   An article in the Portuguese daily Diario de Noticias claimed
Thursday that French President Jacques Chirac had commissioned a
report into President Joao Bernardo Vieira's government that
concluded it was riddled with corruption.
	   News of the alleged report produced shock waves in the
government of the West African country that faces similar charges
from a military faction that rebelled on June 7, Lusa said.
	   Vieira's request that the French Embassy in Guinea-Bissau
clarify the allegations prompted Charge d'Affaires Gaston Grelaud
to make a personal visit to the president, Lusa said.
	   Later Friday, French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret told a Paris press conference that ``France solemnly
denies the existence of the alleged inquiry,'' Lusa reported.
	   According to Diario de Noticias, the report was to aid the
government evaluate Guinea-Bissau's membership of the Franc Zone _
an economic accord between France, Monaco and 15 African states,
mostly former French colonies.
	   The newspaper said the report had concluded that Vieira's
resignation would be a possible solution to the former Portuguese
colony's two-month-old conflict.
	   Vieira and rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane agreed to a
cease-fire on July 26, reaffirming their truce at a second round of
talks a week ago. A third round due next week was postponed amid a
debate over who should mediate the talks.

Former communists apologize for East Germans repressing Czech

 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ In its latest admission of past sins, the
successor party to the former East German communists apologized
Friday for East Germany's role in the Soviet-led invasion that
crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reform movement in
then-Czechoslovakia 30 years ago.
	   That follows a letter sent to former German President Richard
von Weizsaecker a week ago, in which the Party for Democratic
Socialism apologized for East Germany's repression of its citizens
during more than 40 years of authoritarian communist rule, and
called its break with dictatorship ``irreversible.''
	   What's behind the spate of apologies?
	   With national elections set for Sept. 27, the former communists
are trying to convince voters they are sincere about accepting
Germany's constitutional democracy.
	   Although still backed by around 20 percent of voters in the
economically struggling east, the PDS has almost no support in the
west, where it is treated as a pariah by mainstream parties.
	   Polls show the party getting only about 4 percent of the vote
nationwide in this fall's election _ below the 5 percent threshold
needed for a party to be awarded seats in parliament.
	   Hoping to expand its base, the party plans a major rally in
Cologne on Saturday, and the sudden rush of apologies was seen as
another bid to attract western support.
	   In letters sent to both Czech President Vaclav Havel and
Slovakian Premier Vladimir Meciar, the PDS said it recognized ``the
guilt'' that East Germany and its communist party ``brought upon
themselves through their involvement in the action, which violated
international law.''
	   The so-called ``Prague Spring'' in Czechoslovakia in 1968 was
``the last attempt for democratic renewal of genuine socialism,''
the letters said.
	   Soviet-led forces, including troops from former East Germany,
invaded Czechoslovakia on Aug. 21, 1968, to crush the movement led
by then-President Alexander Dubcek, who wanted to liberalize
politics there. He was imprisoned.
	   The PDS said East German communist leaders ``wanted an East
German participation'' in crushing the uprising because they feared
it could eventually endanger East Germany's own existence.
	   The letters expand on an apology passed in April 1990, shortly
after the fall of the Berlin Wall, by East Germany's first and only
freely elected parliament. That declaration blamed ``fear and a
lack of courage'' for East Germany's participation in the invasion.
	   The letters were signed by PDS party chairman Lothar Bisky and
Gregor Gysi, head of the PDS group in parliament. But some factions
in the party are less apologetic.
	   Sahra Wagenknecht, a leader of the hard-core communist wing,
called the letter to von Weizsaecker ``a gesture of
submissiveness'' that wouldn't help the party with either
westerners or easterners.
	   She complained the letters contradicted the PDS election
platform and were not approved by a party resolution.
	   PDS campaign manager Andre Brie disagreed, however, and told
InfoRadio in Berlin that if the communist wing can't accept them,
``then they show they're in the wrong party.''

Foreign activists will be deported from Myanmar

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Moments after sentencing 18 foreign
activists to five years of hard labor Friday for handing out
democracy leaflets, Myanmar's military government said they will be
deported Saturday.
	   Immediately after a judge read out the prison terms, the lights
in the Yangon court room suddenly went out. After a few moments
delay, the lights came back on and an official from the Ministry of
Home Affairs strode to the front of the courtroom and read an order
reducing the sentences.
	   The order, signed by Home Affairs Minister Tin Hlaing, said the
activists _ six Americans, three Malaysians, three Indonesians,
three Thais, two Filipinos and one Australian _ would be expelled
on the condition they would not violate Myanmar laws again.
	   If they did, he added, they would have to serve out any future
prison terms together with the five years from this offense. He
asked diplomats from the activists' home countries to arrange for
their deportations.
	   The defendants, who appeared solemn when the judge read the
original sentence, jumped up, embraced one another, shook hands and
thanked those around them in the courtroom.
	   They were also embraced by diplomats from their respective
countries who attended the trial in a small concrete courthouse
outside the walls of Insein Prison north of Yangon.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said all 18 detainees would be
leaving Yangon on Saturday for Bangkok. They would spend their last
night in the Myanmar capital in a police guest house.
	   ``We're very pleased to learn that the six Americans will be
reunited with their families,'' said the spokeswoman on condition
of anonymity.
	   ``We feel a sense of relief that our people will be coming out
safely,'' said Kobsak Chutikul, a spokesman for Thailand's Ministry
of Foreign Affairs. ``We also feel the Burmese have demonstrated a
sensitivity to the concerns of the international community, and in
particular its ASEAN neighbors.''
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which ignored
international outcry over Myanmar's human-rights record last year
to make the country a member, has more diplomatic influence with
the ruling generals than Western countries.
	   The activists were detained Sunday, the day after the 10th
anniversary of a failed nationwide democracy uprising, for handing
out small cards to Myanmar citizens telling them the outside world
supported their struggle and to not give up.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in
various guises since 1962. More than 3,000 demonstrators were
gunned down during the 1988 uprising.
	   The foreigners were charged, after six days of questioning and
investigation, with violating section 5j of the 1950 Emergency
Provision Act. The sweeping law allows for maximum 20-year jail
terms for inciting unrest and disturbing the peace and tranquility
of the state.
	   The reduction in sentences seemed to be helped by a defendant,
Chong Kok Wei, a 27-year-old Malaysian man, who said he and his
colleagues meant no harm to the Myanmar people, didn't intend to
incite unrest and were unaware of the local laws.
	   Some observers said the episode appeared pre-planned. The
Myanmar government was caught between trying to discourage foreign
activists from inciting the populace, and souring relations with
foreign countries.
	   Earlier this year, a Myanmar court sentenced a
British-Australian national, James Mawdsley, to five years in
prison for also handing out democracy leaflets. Mawdsley was
released after three months in Insein Prison, which holds hundreds
of political prisoners and violent criminals.
	   A diplomat who visited the American activists Thursday said the
embassies involved were not informed of the trial until Friday
morning.
	   Earlier Friday at a press conference in Bangkok, Thailand,
weeping and angry relatives appealed for the activists' release.
They were joined by a U.S. congressman, Rep. Chris Smith, chairman
of the House International Operations and Human Rights
subcommittee, who accused the government of committing a ``public
relations disaster.''
	   Upon learning of the release, Smith, a New Jersey Republican,
said he still wanted to go to Myanmar and engage both the
government and the democratic opposition in a dialogue. The
government has denied him a visa.
	   He also pledged his committee would hold ``full-fledged, serious
hearings on what the international community and the U.S. can do to
promote democracy in Burma.''
	   He urged the activists to continue their campaign, but from
outside Myanmar.
	   Family members felt relief, but were saving the real
celebrations until their loved ones reached Bangkok.
	   ``I can't be happier,'' said Eva Sana, mother of Philippines
activist Ellene Sana. ``Now I can sleep, after not having slept for
many nights.''
	   In Hamilton Township, New Jersey, Jennifer Keegan, Michele's
sister said: ``We were really afraid. ... We have a group going to
see her and we have wanted to count her fingers, toes ... give her
a hug and kisses ...''
	   Vijay Anand said he hopes to greet his daughter Nisha Anand in
Atlanta this Sunday with a big hug.
	   ``She's been very active for the last four or five years in all
human causes,'' he said. ``No parent likes their children to get in
trouble, but that is the profession she has chosen and I support
her.''
	   Ms. Anand recently graduated from American's School of
International Studies and plans to start graduate work at the
school this fall. Anand said the incident resulted in many
sleepless nights as he tried to stay apprised of what was
happening.
	   ``Over there you are breaking the law, and punishments in a
dictatorship or military government are very harsh,'' he said.
``Right now, I feel much better.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. efforts to unite Kosovo
Albanians' fragmented leadership suffered a setback Friday when a
prominent hardliner accepted the political leadership of the rebel
force which has refused to join peace talks.
	   On Thursday, the province's leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim
Rugova, announced he had formed a delegation to begin talks with
the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the
future of the rebellious Serbian province.
	   But Rugova failed to convince the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
to join the team. Members of the team were all closely allied with
Rugova.
	   Rugova's chief rival, Adem Demaci, announced Friday he was
accepting an offer by the KLA to become leader of its political
wing, in effect establishing himself as an alternative leader of
the province's majority Albanian community.
	   Demaci's acceptance further splits ethnic Albanians between
those supporting the radical militants and those who back Rugova's
policies of peaceful and negotiated secession from Serbia, the
dominant republic of what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   Demaci said he accepted the offer because the KLA represents
``the concrete expression of our desire for freedom.'' He said the
crisis is continuing because the Americans and Europeans do not
support independence for Kosovo.
	   ``The clashes in Kosovo will continue until the Serbian regime
admits that there is no other solution but Kosovo's independence,''
Demaci said.
	   In a joint statement Friday , the three largest opposition
ethnic Albanian parties denounced Rugova for forming the
negotiating team. The parties, of led by Demaci, said Rugova
``ignores all other political forces'' and accused him of
``forgetting ... those who are ... spilling blood,'' meaning the
KLA.
	   The parties said that Rugova's ``illegal'' negotiating team
cannot make any valid agreement with the Yugoslav side ``without
the presence of KLA representatives.''

Police, customs officials fired in sugar import scheme

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Five law enforcement officers were fired
Friday and 13 others are under investigation in a scheme to import
tons of sugar into the country without paying millions of dollars
in customs duties.
	   Three customs and two police officers in the Black Sea port of
Burgas were fired, and 13 customs officers are being investigated
in the case, in which the equivalent of dlrs 28 million in duties
was unpaid, police said.
	   Between 1994 and 1998, some 306,000 tons of brown and refined
sugar were imported through the port of Burgas by a subsidiary of
Multigroup, Bulgaria's largest private holding company. Customs
duties were paid on only part of the shipments, said Kiril Radev,
head of a police unit focusing on organized crime.
	   Burgas is located 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the capital,
Sofia.
	   Plamen Minev, head of Bulgaria's customs office, said officials
from his service and police officers were involved in the affair.
	   No one has been charged yet in the case and the investigation is
continuing, Radev said.
	   The sugar had been processed in a nearby plant owned by the
Multigroup subsidiary Bartex, and then was sold domestically or
exported, Radev said.
	   Multigroup, which owns businesses in various branches of
industry, is run by former members of the communist nomenclatura
and security services.
	   An internal investigation has been launched, Multigroup
officials announced late Friday afternoon.
	   Earlier in the day, customs officials at the Black Sea port of
Varna, 470 kilometers (294 miles) east of Sofia, seized 670
kilograms (1,474 pounds) of cocaine worth an estimated dlrs 55
million.
	   A customs spokesman said the narcotic was found in a cargo
container at the port, but would divulge no other details.
	   Police near Sofia arrested a Bulgarian late Thursday who tried
to sell a Turkish bus driver 3,200 compact discs suspected to be
pirate copies.

Sri Lanka bombs ship suspected of transporting goods to rebels

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's air force bombed and
destroyed a ship manned mostly by an Indian crew that it suspected
was transporting cargo Friday to Tamil Tiger separatists, the
Defense Ministry said.
	   The Tigers said over clandestine radio that the 18 Indians and
four Sri Lankans aboard the Dubai-owned ``Princess Cash'' were in
their custody and would be released soon.
	   The government said the ship ignored repeated warnings to move
away from the coast, but the ship fire guns and missiles at naval
boats and air force planes.
	   ``The location of the ship and conduct of its captain gave
sufficient cause for grave suspicion to the defense authorities
that he was acting in connivance with the LTTE to transport and
deliver dangerous merchandise,'' the military statement said.
	   Indian embassy officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   The Tigers have been fighting government soldiers since 1983 to
carve out a homeland in the north and east for the Tamils, who are
in a minority in Sri Lanka.
	   The ship was carrying 6,000 tons of cement, assorted consumer
goods and motor scooters, according to shipping documents.
	   The ship was sailing close to the shore when it was spotted by
the navy on Wednesday, the statement said.
	   Government guidelines bar ships from sailing closer than 80
kilometers (50 miles) from the shore so that they cannot unload
cargo to the rebels.
	   The ship was chartered by Goodwill Shipping, a Sri Lankan
company, and was sailing from capital Colombo to Point Pedro, the
main port in the Jaffna peninsula, when it was hijacked by the
Tigers off the coast of Mullaittivu,
	   Mullaittivu, 290 kilometers (180 miles) northeast of Colombo, is
the main rebel base since the capture in 1995 of its earlier
headquarters in the northern town of Jaffna.
	   The aircraft also spotted boats suspected to belong to the
Tigers moving to and from the ship, the statement said.
	   The air force bombed the ship 30 minutes after the final
warning.

Yeltsin calls for emergency parliament session on economy

<TEXT>
	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin called on
parliament Friday to hold an emergency session to respond to
Russia's economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin insisted, however, that the economy remained stable,
that the ruble would not be devalued, and that there was no need to
interrupt his monthlong vacation to take charge of the situation.
	   ``At this moment, there is no need for that,'' Yeltsin told
reporters in this ancient Russian capital north of Moscow.
``Moreover, when the president rushes to the Kremlin, everybody
thinks that something is wrong.''
	   Trading on the Russian stock exchange was suspended for about 15
minutes Friday after some stocks rose as much as 20 percent. The
market closed 13.7 percent higher at 115.00 points, after falling
much of the week.
	   Analysts said Friday's rise was due in part to Yeltsin's
comments and in part by the hope that the United States was
patching together a plan to augment the recent financial bailout
announced by international lenders.
	   Yeltsin had a long telephone conversation with U.S. President
Bill Clinton, his office said late Friday, without giving any
details.
	   The ruble was sharply lower. U.S. dollars sold for 6.75 rubles
at one central Moscow exchange point Friday, compared with the
central bank's official rate of 6.2900. Black market traders sold
dollars at 7 rubles.
	   At one SBS bank branch in Moscow, customers said they were
allowed only to withdraw money in rubles, even from accounts that
were established in U.S. dollars. Those who wanted dollars were
told to fill out a form and return in five days.
	   Earlier in the day Yeltsin flew by helicopter to Novgorod from a
resort in the wild Valdai region. He was there to restore the old
name of Veliky Novgorod, or Novgorod the Great, in honor of the
city's 1,140th anniversary next year.
	   Despite having been on vacation since mid-July, the 67-year-old
president had bags under his eyes and his face appeared puffy. He
walked slowly and seemed to have difficulty understanding
reporters' questions about the economic crisis.
	   ``No, we are not going to devalue the ruble,'' Yeltsin insisted,
adding that he thought the government had the economic situation
under control.
	   On arrival, Yeltsin said he saw no need for a special session of
the Duma to consider the remainder of the government's economic
austerity plan.
	   ``I'm not considering this possibility for the moment, as there
is no need,'' Yeltsin said. ``I do not exclude it in the future.''
	   Within an hour, however, he had apparently changed his mind. As
Yeltsin arrived for a tour of a meat factory, his press secretary,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said Yeltsin had signed a decree calling on
the Duma to meet.
	   It appeared that the decree did not invoke Yeltsin's
constitutional right to mandate a Duma meeting, but merely
requested it.
	   The Duma has passed some portions of the government's austerity
plan, which was demanded by international lenders, but recessed for
the summer without passing all of it.
	   Duma leaders had been balking at calling a special session to
reconsider the plan in light of the latest crisis, and there had
been calls for Yeltsin to exercise his constitutional power to call
a session.
	   However, after both Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Yeltsin
pleaded for the session, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said the
Duma probably would convene sometime before Sept. 1. ``We wouldn't
mind,'' he told reporters.

Lebanon beefs up security at Egyptian, Turkish embassies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon has boosted security at the
Egyptian and Turkish embassies in Beirut following the bombing of
two U.S. embassies in Africa, the government said Friday.
	   Security forces set up checkpoints around the Egyptian and
Turkish embassies and posted more guards at the buildings, Lebanese
Foreign Ministry officials said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The steps were taken in response to written requests from the
embassies following the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7. A total of 257
people were killed and nearly 5,000 were injured.
	   Diplomats at the Egyptian and Turkish embassies were not
available for comment Friday.
	   Egypt and Turkey are major allies of the United States. In
addition, Turkey has been criticized by most Arab countries for its
military cooperation agreements with Israel.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Beirut has also tightened its security.
Muslim extremists launched car-bomb attacks on the U.S. embassies
in West and East Beirut in 1983 and 1984 when the city was divided
by the civil war frontlines. The 1983 attack on the West Beirut
embasssy destroyed the building.
	   ``We are in a state of alert, but we can't go into details
concerning security measures,'' said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Maha
Hamdan.

Retiree shoots two people dead in hairdressing salon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTRABE, France (AP) _ A 78-year-old retiree walked into a
hairdressing salon and opened fire with a hunting rifle on Friday,
killing two people and wounding two others, police said.
	   The man, identified as Roger Belusca, left his home at 9.30 a.m.
and crossed the street to the salon where he fired several shots,
killing a 17-year-old assistant and ramming the weapon into an
84-year-old client's face.
	   He then shot the salon's manager in the leg, walked out and shot
dead the owner of the building, a 65-year-old man who was passing
by.
	   Police later found Belusca sitting on the floor of his garage,
with serious facial wounds after trying to shoot himself. He was
arrested. Police said they did not know the motive for the
killings.
	   Friends and neighbors of Belusca said they were stunned.
	   ``He was goodness itself,'' said Francoise Barale, a nurse who
looked after Belusca's wife before she died in 1996. ``He would
never even raise his voice.''
	   Daniele Pitet, mayor of the town of 3,000 people near the south
west city of Toulouse, said Belusca ``was just somebody who
cultivated roses.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. efforts to unite Kosovo
Albanians' fragmented leadership suffered a setback Friday when a
prominent hard-liner accepted the political leadership of the rebel
force that refused to join peace talks.
	   On Thursday, the province's leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim
Rugova, announced he had formed a delegation to begin talks with
the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the
future of the rebellious Serbian province. But Rugova failed to
convince the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army to join the team.
	   Rugova's chief rival, Adem Demaci, announced Friday he was
accepting an offer by the KLA to become leader of its political
wing, in effect establishing himself as an alternative leader of
the province's majority Albanian community.
	   Demaci's acceptance further splits ethnic Albanians between
those supporting the radical militants and those who back Rugova's
policies of peaceful and negotiated secession from Serbia, the
dominant republic of what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   Demaci said he accepted the offer because the KLA represents
``the concrete expression of our desire for freedom.'' He said the
crisis is continuing because the Americans and Europeans do not
support independence for Kosovo.
	   ``The clashes in Kosovo will continue until the Serbian regime
admits that there is no other solution but Kosovo's independence,''
Demaci said.
	   In a joint statement Friday , the three largest opposition
ethnic Albanian parties denounced Rugova for forming the
negotiating team. The parties, led by Demaci, said Rugova ``ignores
all other political forces'' and accused him of ``forgetting ...
those who are ... spilling blood,'' meaning the KLA.
	   The parties said Rugova's ``illegal'' negotiating team cannot
make any valid agreement with the Yugoslav side ``without the
presence of KLA representatives.''
	   Earlier Friday, Rugova, 7th graf pvs.

Second appeal lodged against freezing of Kosovo accounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The lawyer for one of the holders of
a Swiss-based account used to channel funds to ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo Friday said he had appealed a decision by Swiss authorities
to block it.
	   The authorities hadn't given any arguments to justify freezing
the account, Marc Bossonet said in a statement. He said the appeal
has been made to the Swiss supreme court.
	   Bossonet refused to identify his client, one of three Kosovo
Albanian signatories to the account. The three are members of the
Popular Movement of Kosovo, which backs the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   The account is one of two frozen by the Swiss Federal
Prosecutor's Office in July amid suspicions that money contained in
them is used to finance illegal arms trafficking in the troubled
Yugoslav province.
	   Last week, the owner of the other frozen account, the
Geneva-based Kosovo Foundation, appealed to the supreme court to
have the block on its own account lifted.
	   The foundation is run by Xhafer Shatri, a spokesman for the
Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the province's
moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The Kosovo Foundation insists the money in its account has
always been used for humanitarian purposes.
	   The Popular Movement of Kosovo has said its account is also used
to collect cash for humanitarian aid, although a spokesman for the
group has said he doesn't know whether the money is also used to
buy arms.

Marchers protest plans to build nuclear power station in Belarus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ About 30 protesters marched through the
Belarusian capital of Minsk on Friday to protest government plans
to build a nuclear power plant in the former Soviet republic.
	   Waving signs that read ``Chernobyl wasn't enough?'' _ a
reference to the 1986 nuclear power plant disaster in neighboring
Ukraine _ students and scientists also picketed the local Academy
of Sciences building.
	   The rally follows two weeks of protests and marches by
environmentalists from Belarus, Poland, Germany, and Russia at
potential construction sites for the plant across Belarus.
	   Despite government permission, the protesters said they were
periodically harassed by police. Maxim Kapram said a number of
fellow demonstrators were arrested at one protest and kicked out of
the region where the meeting was staged.
	   He also said that police videotaped their march in Minsk, and
two protesters, from Germany and Poland, were detained for alleged
visa violations.

IOC claims IBM demands would bankrupt organizing committee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee claimed Friday
it severed ties with 38-year sponsorship partner IBM because the
technology provider's payment demands would have bankrupted Olympic
organizing committees.
	   IOC marketing director Michael Payne said if IBM's projected
costs were forced onto Salt Lake City, hosts of the 2002 Winter
Olympics, ``it would have bankrupt the organizing committee.''
	   Payne was quoted in the Times newspaper Friday saying IBM had
refused to continue providing technology services for free and had
said it would charge ``hundreds of millions of dollars '' to
provide services for the 2002 games.
	   Payne said the IOC was now looking for a panel of information
technology providers, including a system coordinator and a separate
hardware supplier.
	   IBM, International Business Machines Corp., announced last week
it would cease sponsorship of the Olympic Games after the Sydney
2000 Olympics.
	   IBM spent more than dlrs 100 million to sponsor the 1998 Winter
Games in Nagano, Japan, providing much of the behind-the-scenes
technology for free.
	   But it wanted local Olympic organizing committees to share the
technology costs and after months of negotiations failed to reach a
compromise, IMB decided not to sign a new eight-year deal.
	   IBM executives were upset by an International Olympic Committee
decision to seek a more profitable sponsorship deal for internet
services and sites at upcoming games, a role IBM held in the last
two Olympics, in Nagano and Atlanta.
	   ``The IOC asked for a significant increase in our sponsorship
commitment. We felt that was not commensurate with the marketing
benefits we would receive in return,'' IBM spokeswoman Debbie
Gottheimer said.
	   IBM was one of 11 global sponsors of the Nagano Olympics. Most
paid the IOC more than dlrs 40 million for their sponsorship
packages, but IBM spent roughly twice that by filling the
additional role of technology provider.

Germans secure site in hopes of finding lost Amber Room
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KLAIPEDA, Lithuania (AP) - German treasurer-hunters on Friday
began draining a shallow lagoon off the Lithuanian coast where they
believe panels from Czar Peter the Great's famed Amber Room could
be buried, the Baltic News Service reported.
	   The German team, which has been searching for months for the
priceless panels, was waiting for mine-sweepers to check for
explosives before digging for a cache of mysterious metal detected
just below the sea floor.
	   The actual digging should start no later than Monday, BNS said.
	   The expedition, funded by the German TV company NDR, is taking
place just off a narrow, windswept peninsula near the village of
Preila. They have been searching the area because a wartime
resident had said he saw German soldiers burying mysterious boxes
there.
	   Nazi troops stole the 50 square meters (500 square feet) of
intricately carved amber during the siege of Leningrad, now St.
Petersburg. Germany has contended that the panels were destroyed
during the Soviet Union's bombing of Koenigsberg, now the Russian
enclave of Kaliningrad.
	   But others have claimed the treasure was buried by the Nazis.

Fujimori upbeat on squelching Peru's long border conflict with
</HEADLINE>
Ecuador &QL; 
 &UR; By BILL CORMIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Peru's president said Friday that
he hoped a peace accord with its Andean neighbor Ecuador could be
signed within weeks, stamping out a half-century border conflict
that sparked three shooting wars.
	   On a whirlwind round of South American diplomacy, Alberto
Fujimori sounded upbeat about defusing this week's sudden flare-up
of border tensions that erupted when Peru said some 300 Ecuadorean
troops entered its territory in a ``clear provocation.''
	   Peru subsequently refused to continue talks to end the border
standoff until Ecuador withdraws troops from a disputed zone.
Ecuador maintained it troops are not in Peruvian territory and had
refused to remove them.
	   With Argentinian President Carlos Menem at his side, Fujimori
told a joint news conference in Buenos Aires that it was
``realistic to think that a final accord could be signed in
September.''
	   The optimism followed Fujimori's meetings a day earlier in
Brazil with that country's President Fernando Cardoso, who said
Peru agreed to allow the deployment of peacekeepers on the troubled
border.
	   The border area would not be completely demilitarized, but rival
troops would be separated and neutral peacekeepers will serve as
observers, Fujimori has said.
	   Peru and Ecuador have fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995 over
their disputed border. In the last two, fighting was over some 49
miles (78 kilometers) of unmarked border in remote, mountainous
jungle 560 miles (900 kilometers) north of Lima.
	   The area in question is on the upper eastern slopes of the
Cordillera del Condor mountain range. Peru has historically
considered the eastern slopes within its territory.
	   Fujimori flew to Argentina late Thursday after five hours of
emergency talks with Cardosol. On Friday, Fujimori was headed to
Paraguay to meet with new Ecuadorean President Jamil Mahuad, who
took office Monday and has expressed an interest in negotiating
peace.
	   ``They are going to have a significant encounter,'' said Menem
without elaborating.
	   The latest standoff had cast doubt on the future of
internationally brokered peace talks that had appeared close to
resolving the dispute.
	   Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the United States are guarantors of
a 1942 protocol signed by Ecuador and Peru in Rio de Janeiro. That
treaty was last tested by armed clashes by Peru and Ecuador in
February 1995.
	   Also Friday, Fujimori said he was seeking extradition of two
Peruvian guerrilla suspects arrested in Argentina only hours before
his arrival in Buenos Aires.
	   Local news reports said Interpol detained two 29-year-old
Peruvians, suspected of membership in Peru's leftist Shining Path,
in an area 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Buenos Aires.
	   ``They are not guerrillas, but are members of terrorist
groups,'' Fujimori said. ``In Peru, we make a distinction.''

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ By giving only a muted response to the
latest Iraqi crisis, the Security Council is waiting for Baghdad's
next move _ and whether it violates U.N. agreements by trying to
block weapons inspectors, council diplomats say.
	   Such a violation could prompt a tougher council response and
would further jeopardize Iraq's attempts to have sanctions lifted
when the 15-member council reviews the measures this October.
	   To date, the council has only said Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to
freeze cooperation with the United Nations was ``totally
unacceptable.'' The council was expected to take up the issue again
Monday.
	   Sanctions, which prevent Iraq from freely selling its oil, were
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. They can only be lifted
once weapons inspectors have certified that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
	   If weapons inspectors can't get to sites to certify Iraqi
compliance, sanctions won't be lifted. A more patient, middle
ground reaction from the council would force Iraq to make the next,
conciliatory move if it wants sanctions removed, one Western
diplomat said.
	   On Thursday, council members postponed any formal show of
support for U.N. inspectors, despite letters from top inspectors
who said their work was being undermined by Iraq's decision.
	   Rather than issuing a formal resolution or statement, the
council was considering sending letters of support to Richard
Butler of the U.N. Special Commission, and Mohamed ElBaradei of the
International Atomic Energy Agency. The letters would state that
Iraq's actions were unacceptable, diplomats said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Such letters could give weapons experts the go-ahead to attempt
the kind of inspections suspended last week, diplomats said. If
inspectors are blocked in violation of U.N. agreements, the council
could then take a more aggressive stand.
	   So far, U.N. inspectors haven't tested the Iraqi announcement
and were awaiting word from the council on whether to proceed with
inspections and request Iraqi escorts for visits to new sites, U.N.
officials said. According to Security Council resolutions, the
inspectors can't go out on spot searches without Iraqi escorts.
	   A top Iraqi official at Iraq's U.N. mission said his country's
decision is clear.
	   ``We will not send people to accompany you,'' the official said
Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``If they want to
escalate the situation then yes, this would be the next step.''
	   The relatively muted move of sending letters was also seen as
trying to gain more unity within the council. Russia, China and
France _ all permanent members of the powerful body _ have tended
to be the most sympathetic to Iraq.
	   Already, though, France has indicated its displeasure with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein over ending cooperation with the
inspectors.
	   ``This decision will do a disservice to Iraq's cause,'' the
French Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
	   Washington has the most to gain by a unified council, since it
could more easily justify keeping sanctions in place.
	   The Washington Post reported Friday that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had tried to dissuade Butler from conducting
surprise ``challenge inspections'' in Iraq because the timing
wasn't right.
	   The report would indicate that Washington thought as recently as
this month that it couldn't get the council on its side in the
event of a renewed confrontation. But Butler and U.S. officials at
the State Department and White House said the newspaper story was
false.
	   Butler ``would find it invidious were any attempt made to direct
his operational decisions or to micro-manage the day-to-day work of
the Special Commission,'' a statement from Butler's office said.

Customs officers to get bonus for seizures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The government decided to reward
vigilant customs officers by giving them a cash bonus based on the
value of the merchandise they seize, a customs service official
said Friday.
	   ``I bet the customs officers are already thrilled about this
decision,'' said George Balan, press officer for the Romanian
customs service.
	   Officers can choose to receive either 10 percent of the value of
the goods they seize, or a payment three times their monthly
salaries.
	   Customs officers earn up to dlrs 200 per month.
	   A customs officer recently confiscated dlrs 600,000 in cash, and
his reward was dlrs 100 and a handshake, newspapers reported.
	   Seized goods can be sold at special shops, with the proceeds
going to the customs service.
	   Premier Radu Vasile recently admitted that the underground
economy accounted for 35 percent of Romania's economic activity
last year.
	   Most of the money came from customs tax evasion.
	   Favorite smuggling routes run from the former Soviet Union or
Turkey across Romania to Western Europe.

Second womens Ashes test ends in a draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARROGATE, England (AP) _ The second womens Ashes cricket test
between England and Australia ended in a draw Friday.
	   The Harrogate pitch conceded 999 runs in under four days but
provided the bowlers with little reward, with just 16 wickets
falling in 12 sessions of play.
	   The best-of-three series could now be decided in the next test
after the first two matches have ended in a draw.
	   Australia won the toss and batted first Tuesday, declaring at
306 for three before England replied with 326 for eight to take a
slight first innings lead.
	   The visitors racked up 303 for five in the third innings before
declaring Friday, giving England a target of 283 to win in 45
overs.
	   However, the captains agreed to call stumps early when England
reached 64 without loss and there was no chance of a result.
	   England opener Jan Brittin, who scored a century in the drawn
first test at Guildford, top scored in the match with 167.
	   The Australian top-order also worked on individual batting
averages, with Karen Rolton, Belinda Clark and Joanne Broadbent all
registering half-centuries in both innings.

Russian justice minister wants amnesty for 100,000 prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia justice minister said Friday that 100,000
inmates _ roughly one-tenth of the country's prison population _
could receive amnesties this year.
	   The amnesties, which would have to be approved by parliament,
would be for those convicted of minor crimes, Pavel Krasheninnikov
said at a news conference.
	   Krasheninnikov said he also wants to limit pre-trial detention
to one year to reduce the prison population, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Overcrowding has been blamed for outbreaks of many infectious
diseases in Russian prisons, including tuberculosis.

Relatives happy at Myanmar decision to release foreign activists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CHANGES byline, UPDATES with reaction to sentencing,
deportation order; edits thruout &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The relatives of the 18 foreign
activists tried Friday for handing out pro-democracy leaflets in
Myanmar felt despair when they learned of their harsh sentences,
but joy overhwelmed them when the government announced plans to
free them.
	   A court in Myanmar sentenced the mostly young foreigners to five
years of hard labor on Friday, but the sentences were almost
immediately suspended and they were ordered to leave the country
Saturday.
	   Eva Sana, the mother of Filipino social activist Ellene Sana,
said she was just about ready to collapse when she heard the
initial news of the sentencing Friday evening while eating dinner.
	   ``But 10 minutes later I got the good news and was very happy,''
she said. ``I can't be happier. Now I can sleep, after not having
slept for many nights.''
	   Ellene and another Filipino _ along with six Americans, three
Indonesians, three Malaysians, three Indonesians, and an Australian
_ were arrested Sunday in the Myanmar capital Yangon, where they
had been distributing leaflets urging people to remember the 10th
anniversary of an uprising against military rule and to not give
up. The 1988 protests were bloodily crushed.
	   The military regime of Myanmar _ also called Burma _ has not
grown any more tolerant of dissent since then. The decision to
charge the activists was announced only on the morning of their
trial.
	   Eva Sana wept Friday morning upon learning that a trial would be
held, following days of statements by the Myanmar government that
their fate had not been decided.
	   ``Six days is already too long and too much for these young
people, who are not prepared for this kind of treatment,'' Sana
said.
	   Before news of the trial, a dozen relatives of the activists and
members of human rights groups supporting them were told Friday by
the Myanmar Embassy that their requests for visas would take a week
to process and interviews would be necessary. Normally, visas are
granted in a few hours.
	   After learning the 18 activists were to be deported, Sana said
she didn't want to criticize the Myanmar regime because they might
change their minds about freeing the foreign activists.
	   Greg Vicary, brother of Australian university lecturer Alison
Vicary, was also concerned about the unpredictability of the
Myanmar authorities.
	   ``The situation will not be confirmed until the detainees arrive
in Thailand,'' he said, adding that he was ``hoping and praying for
change'' in Myanmar.
	   Vijay Anand, father of Nisha Anand, said he hopes to greet his
daughter in Atlanta this Sunday with a big hug.
	   ``She's been very active for the last four or five years in all
human causes,'' he said. ``No parent likes their children to get in
trouble, but that is the profession she has chosen and I support
her.''
	   Ms. Anand recently graduated from American's School of
International Studies and plans to start graduate work at the
school this fall. Anand said the incident resulted in many
sleepless nights as he tried to stay apprised of what was
happening.
	   ``Over there you are breaking the law, and punishments in a
dictatorship or military government are very harsh,'' he said.
``Right now, I feel much better.''
	   In Hamilton, New Jersey, a sister of one of the American
detainees, 19-year-old Michele Keegan, said her family had been
``really confident that everything would work out just fine.''
	   ``We had to keep faith in that and faith in our U.S. government
that they would bring them home safely,'' she said. ``We have a
group going to see her and we have wanted to count her fingers,
toes...give her a hug and kisses....''
	   The Keegans' congressman, Republican Christopher Smith, had
flown to Bangkok earlier this week in an effort to help free the
detainees. Smith chairs the House International Operations and
Human Rights subcommittee.
	   Upon learning of the detainees' release Friday night, Smith said
he still wanted to go to Myanmar and engage both the government and
the democratic opposition in a dialogue, even though the government
has not granted him a visa.
	   He also pledged his committee would hold ``full-fledged, serious
hearings on what the international community and the U.S. can do to
promote democracy in Burma.''

Germans secure site in hopes of finding lost Amber Room
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KLAIPEDA, Lithuania (AP) _ German treasure-hunters began
draining a shallow lagoon Friday off the Lithuanian coast where
they believe panels from Czar Peter the Great's famed Amber Room
could be buried, the Baltic News Service reported.
	   The German team, which has been searching for months for the
priceless panels, was waiting for mine-sweepers to check for
explosives before digging for a cache of mysterious metal detected
just below the sea floor.
	   The actual digging should start no later than Monday, BNS said.
	   The expedition, funded by the German TV company NDR, is taking
place just off a narrow, windswept peninsula near the village of
Preila. They have been searching the area because a wartime
resident said he saw German soldiers burying mysterious boxes
there.
	   Nazi troops stole the 50 square meters (500 square feet) of
intricately carved amber during the siege of Leningrad, now St.
Petersburg. Germany has contended the panels were destroyed during
the Soviet Union's bombing of Koenigsberg, now the Russian enclave
of Kaliningrad.
	   But others have claimed the treasure was buried by the Nazis.

U.S. House speaker meets Irish prime minister at end of weeklong
</HEADLINE>
trip &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADARE, Ireland (AP) _ U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich met Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern in this County Limerick tourist town Friday
as the Republican lawmaker's first-ever trip through Ireland drew
to a close.
	   Gingrich spent the past week getting acquainted with one of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's foreign-policy successes _ the Belfast
peace agreement struck by the British and Irish governments and
eight Northern Ireland parties in April.
	   Ahern said Gingrich could also ``take credit for the outcome,''
citing his traditional St. Patrick's Day luncheon in Washington,
which last March brought together key Belfast negotiators.
	   ``We were at a critical and delicate stage in the talks
process,'' Ahern said, but ``all the participants returned to
Ireland from your lunch galvanized to do the deal.''
	   Gingrich said his discussions with politicians in Northern
Ireland _ where the Irish Republican Army and two major pro-British
paramilitary groups are observing cease-fires but refusing to start
disarming as the agreement requires _ had left the prospects for
lasting peace in the balance.
	   ``Ireland is at one of those rare historical moments,'' Gingrich
told Irish national broadcasters RTE. ``My message to the political
and paramilitary leaders has been: Do they want to posture, or do
they want to progress?''
	   The agreement, Ahern said, ``represents a recognition of another
central lesson in our history _ that any attempt by one tradition
in Ireland to dominate the other is doomed to failure.''
	   The deal requires Protestant and Catholic politicians to govern
Northern Ireland together in a new 12-member administration and
108-member legislative Assembly. The legislature, elected in June
but with no powers yet, is expected to be addressed by Clinton when
he visits Belfast on Sept. 3.
	   Northern Ireland has been governed directly by the British
government since 1972, when a previous Protestant-dominated
parliament was abolished.
	   Gingrich spent much of his final day visiting American-run
computer firms in southwest Ireland. He planned to fly back to
Washington on Saturday from the region's Shannon airport.
	   Ahern said more than 500 U.S. firms operate branch plants in the
Irish Republic, providing ``the cornerstone'' of the Irish
Republic's economic growth rate of 7.5 percent, the best in western
Europe.

Burton leads at halfway, King bogeys first four in a 77
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Burton taking outright lead, later scores &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Brandie Burton, winner of the
Du Maurier Classic two weeks ago, carded a 2-over 74 but moved into
the halfway lead in the windswept Women's British Open Friday with
not a single player level or below par after 36 holes.
	   Burton goes into Saturday's third round at 1-over on 145 with a
1-stroke lead over fellow American Leslie Spalding.
	   A bogey at eight and double bogey at nine wiped out Burton's
claim to be the only player left under par and briefly cost her the
outright lead. But she birdied the par-5 11th to regain a 1-stroke
advantage.
	   Spalding, who only gained the draw as an alternate, made a
2-under 70 for 146 and second place. One of her four birdies
included a 60-foot putt.
	   Wendy Ward, winner of the Hawaiian Ladies Open in February,
carded a 71 for a 3-under halfway total of 147. She is tied with
Scotland's Janice Moodie and England's Suzanne Strudwick, who both
made level par 72s.
	   Se Ri Pak, winner of two majors and two more tournaments in this
her rookie season on the U.S. Tour, stands seven off the lead after
a second ronnd 74 which included her first birdie of the
championship.
	   Co-leader overnight after surviving the wind and rain, Betsy
King bogeyed the first four holes in calmer, kinder conditions for
a 5-over 77 and slipped to three off the lead.
	   One of only two players to produce sub-par rounds on Thursday,
King twice had to hack out of the rough after pulling her tee shots
off the narrow fairways of the Royal Lytham course.
	   ``I was relieved to make the first par,'' said the American, who
followed it with the first of her two birdies and wound up 4 over
at 148 for two rounds.
	   ``It was a little frustrating but I have just got to stay
patient,'' King said after her 77. ``I have managed by game pretty
well so far.''
	   King was co-leader with Burton, winner of the Du Maurier Classic
at Windsor Ontario, two weeks ago, after they each carded 1-under
71s in far worse playing conditions Thursday.
	   When the field went out Friday, the strong winds blowing in from
the Irish Sea had dropped to a breeze and there was no rain in the
early stages when King started her second round.
	   ``The course is playing hard but it's not impossible,'' she
said. ``It's very demanding. The bunkers are such a penalty and if
you drive into the long stuff you're in trouble.
	   ``I'm not an expert at bump and run but I sure know how to hit
it out of bunkers.''
	   At the par 3, 197-yard first, King missed the green, chipped to
10 feet and rolled the putt wide. Her second shot at the second hit
a greenside bunker and she missed from 15 feet for a bogey 5.
	   She drove into the long rough at the third, couldn't reach the
green with her second shot, had to make a 15-foot putt for par and
it lipped out.
	   King found the thick rough again from the fourth tee, had to
hack the ball onto the fairway and made a bogey 5 after missing a
10-foot putt.
	   She blamed herself for hitting drives into the long rough, which
was still wet and sticking from Thursday's rain.
	   ``I had to get out of that junk three times,'' she said. ``Even
though the wind was better I didn't hit the ball as well as
yesterday and I didn't make the putts.''
	   Defending titlist Karrie Webb of Australia, who carded a 76 on
Thursday, made the same score in the calmer conditions for eight
over while long-hitter Laura Davies made her second 79 in a row
and, at 14 over, had to wait to see if she had made the cut.

Teenager dies after Britons' yacht crashes with speedboat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A Greek teenager was killed Friday when a
yacht with two Britons on board crashed with the speedboat she was
in off the coast of the Ionian island of Meganisi near Lefkada
Friday, the merchant marine ministry said.
	   Maria Konidari, 17, was killed in the crash. Her cousin
Evangelia Konidari, also 17, was seriously injured and was
airlifted to a hospital in the western port of Patra, the ministry
said.
	   Lefkada authorities arrested John Williams, 56, from Britain,
and his 55-year old wife after their sailing yacht allegedly rammed
a speedboat with five people on board.
	   The home towns of the Britons and the name of Williams' wife
were not immediately available.
	   The speedboat was apparently traveling at a low speed, the
ministry added.
	   None of the other three people on board the speedboat were
injured.

German tourist confesses to igniting fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A German tourist confessed to shooting a
flare that started a wildfire on an Adriatic island, police
reported Friday.
	   The 44-year-old German citizen, identified only by his initials
G.J.M, admitted late Thursday that he shot the flare from his speed
boat as he drifted along the island of Zlarin with his wife and
another German couple.
	   The fire was extinguished soon after it began Wednesday. The
group then was detained by police after two eyewitnesses connected
them to the blaze.
	   They were released a short time later, but police confiscated
their passports to ensure that they attend a hearing next week.
	   The man faces a fine and deportation from the country.
	   Dozens of homes have been razed and two people killed in more
than 200 forest and brush fires that have swept through southern
Croatia in the past two weeks. Most of the fires were sparked by
natural causes.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. efforts to unite Kosovo
Albanians' fragmented leadership suffered a setback Friday when a
prominent hardliner accepted the political leadership of the rebel
force which has refused to join peace talks.
	   The province's leading Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova,
announced Thursday he had formed a delegation to begin talks with
the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the
future of the rebellious Serbian province.
	   But Rugova failed to convince the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
to join the team. Members of the team were all closely allied with
Rugova.
	   Rugova's chief rival, Adem Demaci, announced Friday he was
accepting an offer by the KLA to become leader of its political
wing, in effect establishing himself as an alternative leader of
the province's majority Albanian community.
	   Demaci's acceptance further splits ethnic Albanians between
those supporting the radical militants and those who back Rugova's
policies of peaceful and negotiated secession from Serbia, the
dominant republic of what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   Demaci said he accepted the offer because the KLA represents
``the concrete expression of our desire for freedom.'' He said the
crisis is continuing because the Americans and Europeans do not
support independence for Kosovo.
	   ``The clashes in Kosovo will continue until the Serbian regime
admits that there is no other solution but Kosovo's independence,''
said Demaci, who spent 28 years as a political prisoner in Yugoslav
jails.
	   In a joint statement Friday , the three largest opposition
ethnic Albanian parties also denounced Rugova for forming the
negotiating team.
	   The parties, one of them led by Demaci, accused Rugova of
``forgetting ... those who are ... spilling blood,'' meaning the
KLA. They said Rugova's ``illegal'' team could not reach any
binding agreement ``without the presence of KLA representatives.''
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province in
southern Serbia whose population of 2 million is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian. Serbia is the dominant of two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia.
	   Earlier Friday, Rugova told a news conference that peace talks
cannot begin until the Serb-led government halts its military
offensive against the KLA ``in order to create a favorable
atmosphere for the start of the dialogue.''
	   Rugova also called on the United States and European powers to
provide protection so that tens of thousands of refugees displaced
by the fighting could return to their homes.
	   Austria's ambassador to Yugoslavia, Wolfgang Petritsch, warned
Friday that the refugees must return within ``a few weeks'' in
order to harvest crops or the province would face a ``humanitarian
catastrophe.''
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, a spokesman for the U.N. relief agency,
Kris Janowski, said about 500 people fled Thursday from Kosovo into
Albania, the first largescale movement across the border since Serb
forces cut escape routes two months ago.
	   Janowski said the refugees were fleeing fighting around the KLA
border stronghold of Junik. Serb forces have sealed off the area.
	   ``The crossing seems to be the result of intense fighting in the
Junik area,'' Janowski said. ``It's still very risky to cross _ I
guess it depends on the stakes.'' The refugees said many thousands
remained in the hills, according to Janowski.

Amnesty accuses Rwandan, Congo fighters of atrocities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Amnesty International on Friday accused
the opponents in Congo's 11-day rebellion of provoking and covering
up civilian massacres and ethnic killings in the troubled central
African country.
	   The rights group urged the international community to pressure
the combatants to respect human rights.
	   Tutsi-led rebels and allied Rwandan soldiers reportedly carried
out summary executions of government troops at Kavumu, near Bukavu
in Congo's eastern Kivu region, and reports of civilian massacres
had emerged from the rebel-held town of Uvira about 120 kilometers
(75 miles) to the south, Amnesty said in a statement.
	   Radios and communication equipment had been confiscated from
from civilians and humanitarian groups by the opposition fighters
in the Kivu region.
	   ``Witnesses are being prevented from revealing human rights
abuses, thereby keeping the international in the dark about
atrocities being committed,'' the rights group said.
	   The cover-up was similar to one hatched by Kabila's own rebel
group during the 1996-97 rebel war against the longstanding
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, the rights group said. Many of the
fighters who helped Kabila to power in that rebellion have since
taken up arms against him.
	   Kabila accuses Rwandan and Ugandan troops of leading the latest
uprising. Both countries deny involvement.
	   Amnesty repeated claims that Congo's government had arbitrarily
arrested hundreds of people _ including many Tutsi civilians _ in
the capital of Kinshasa. Some may have been killed.
	   ``These people have been taken away to unknown destinations by
members of the security forces and their lives are at risk, amid
reports that some may already have been killed,'' the Amnesty
report said.
	   The government has repeatedly condoned ethnic attacks against
Tutsis with broadcasts on state radio urging civilians to
``massacre'' people with ``long noses, who are tall and slim and
want to dominate us.''
	   Sharp, thin features are often associated with Tutsis, a
minority group in Congo and Rwanda.
	   ``Inflamatory statements by Congolese government officials
inciting the population to violence against unarmed civilians will
escalate the human rights crisis in Congo,'' Amnesty said.
	   The rights group urged neighboring countries to allow refugees
fleeing the fighting to enter their country.

Kazakstan, Iran express concern about fighting in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian defense minister's comments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan and
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi expressed concern Friday
over the fighting in northern Afghanistan.
	   ``A broad coalition government should be set up in Afghanistan
to take the interests of all its ethnic minorities into account,''
Kharazi said following a meeting with Nazarbayev in the Kazak
capital, Astana.
	   The fighting in Afghanistan ``can undoubtedly affect the
security of Central Asian countries,'' he said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear that if the
Taliban army gains control of all of Afghanistan, it will entrench
a radical Islamic state and that there will be an influx of
refugees and weapons across their borders.
	   However, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Friday he
saw no danger of Taliban fighters crossing into the former Soviet
republics.
	   The situation in Afghanistan is ``complex but controllable,'' he
said, according to Interfax.
	   Kharazi also expressed concern about the reported abduction of
11 Iranians, including employees of the Iranian consulate in
Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold of the opposition Northern Alliance,
which recently fell to the Taliban.

Austrian diplomat warns of humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The Austrian ambassador to Yugoslavia
warned Friday that a humanitarian disaster was imminent if refugees
could not begin returning to Kosovo.
	   Speaking to the Austria Press Agency, Wolfgang Petritsch said
the situation in Kosovo was worsening, even in areas that haven't
been hit by clashes between Serb security forces and rebel
Albanians in the Kosovo Liberation Army who are fighting for
independence.
	   Austria, as current president of the European Union, is working
together with the U.N. refugee agency and other international aid
organizations to develop a pilot project for returning some of the
more than 231,000 refugees to their homes, APA said.
	   Such a project would require international leaders to pressure
both sides into cooperating, Petritsch told APA. He also predicted
that if returns didn't begin within a couple of weeks, with the
coming of cooler autumn weather the situation would reach
catastrophic proportions.

	   KLAIPEDA, Lithuania (AP) - German treasure-hunters on Friday
began draining a shallow lagoon off the Lithuanian coast where they
believe panels from Czar Peter the Great's famed Amber Room could
be buried, the Baltic News Service reported.
	   The German team, which has been searching for months for the
priceless panels, was waiting for mine-sweepers to check for
explosives before digging for a cache of mysterious metal detected
just below the sea floor.
	   The actual digging should start no later than Monday, BNS said.
	   The expedition, funded by the German TV company NDR, is taking
place just off a narrow, windswept peninsula near the village of
Preila. They have been searching the area because a wartime
resident had said he saw German soldiers burying mysterious boxes
there.
	   Nazi troops stole the 50 square meters (500 square feet) of
intricately carved amber during the siege of Leningrad, now St.
Petersburg. Germany has contended that the panels were destroyed
during the Soviet Union's bombing of Koenigsberg, now the Russian
enclave of Kaliningrad.
	   But others have claimed the treasure was buried by the Nazis.

<TEXT>
	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin called on
parliament Friday to hold an emergency session to respond to
Russia's economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin insisted, however, that the economy remained stable,
that the ruble would not be devalued, and that there was no need to
interrupt his monthlong vacation to take charge of the situation.
	   ``At this moment, there is no need for that,'' Yeltsin told
reporters in this ancient Russian capital north of Moscow.
``Moreover, when the president rushes to the Kremlin, everybody
thinks that something is wrong.''
	   But Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, Russia's liaison with
international lending organizations, will cut short his vacation
and return to the capital on Saturday, the Interfax news agency
reported. Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin was to return from
vacation Friday night.
	   Trading on the Russian stock exchange was suspended for about 15
minutes Friday after some stocks rose as much as 20 percent. The
market closed 13.7 percent higher at 115.00 points, after falling
much of the week.
	   Analysts said Friday's rise was due in part to Yeltsin's
comments and in part by the hope that the United States was
patching together a plan to augment the recent financial bailout
announced by international lenders.
	   Yeltsin had a 40-minute telephone conversation with U.S.
President Bill Clinton, his office said late Friday. Clinton
expressed support for Yeltsin's efforts in handling the present
crisis, Interfax said.
	   The ruble closed sharply lower. U.S. dollars sold for 6.75
rubles at one central Moscow exchange point Friday, compared with
the central bank's official rate of 6.2900. Black market traders
sold dollars at 7 rubles.
	   At one SBS bank branch in Moscow, customers said they were
allowed only to withdraw money in rubles, even from accounts that
were established in U.S. dollars. Those who wanted dollars were
told to fill out a form and return in five days.
	   Earlier in the day Yeltsin flew by helicopter to Novgorod to
restore its old name of Veliky Novgorod, or Novgorod the Great, in
honor of the city's 1,140th anniversary next year.
	   Despite having been on vacation since mid-July, the 67-year-old
president had bags under his eyes and his face appeared puffy. He
walked slowly and seemed to have difficulty understanding
reporters' questions about the economic crisis.
	   ``No, we are not going to devalue the ruble,'' Yeltsin insisted,
adding that he thought the government had the economic situation
under control.
	   On arrival, Yeltsin said he saw no need for a special session of
the Duma to consider the remainder of the government's economic
austerity plan.
	   ``I'm not considering this possibility for the moment, as there
is no need,'' Yeltsin said. ``I do not exclude it in the future.''
	   Within an hour, however, he had apparently changed his mind. As
Yeltsin arrived for a tour of a meat factory, his press secretary,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said Yeltsin had signed a decree calling on
the Duma to meet.
	   The Duma has passed some portions of the government's austerity
plan, which was demanded by international lenders, but recessed for
the summer without passing all of it.
	   Duma leaders had been balking at calling a special session to
reconsider the plan in light of the latest crisis, and there had
been calls for Yeltsin to exercise his constitutional power to call
a session.
	   However, after both Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Yeltsin
pleaded for the session, Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said the
Duma would likely convene on Sept. 1-2.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov also hinted that the Duma
would meet. ``We wouldn't mind,'' he told reporters.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Nine badly charred bodies lie in cold
storage at morgues, still unclaimed a week after the worst attack
on a U.S. Embassy. Joseph Owino can't tell if his missing brother
is among them. ``I really can't stand it, the waiting, the not
knowing,'' he said.
	   The not knowing has just begun. The FBI says it will take at
least another month to finish examining the scenes of the bombings
at embassies in Kenya and Tanzania Aug. 7 that killed 257 people,
including a dozen Americans, and injured more than 5,500.
	   So, too, has begun the sorrow. The rubble next to the Nairobi
embassy, once a bustling office building on a busy downtown street,
has become an impromptu shrine.
	   On Friday, a group of Kenyan women wept and prayed there.
Christian and Muslim lawmakers, in a show of unity and grief, laid
a huge wreath of red and white roses. A Vatican envoy offered his
prayers _ and ringing condemnation of terrorism.
	   ``We must find another way of living together on this earth.
Look at it: It is so beautiful,'' said Cardinal Jozef Tomko, the
head of the Vatican missionary service. ``Why this? Why?''
	   Nearby, an FBI team labored over debris with rakes, continuing
their search for evidence.
	   The FBI says it has 215 agents, lab examiners, evidence
technicians, computer specialists, photographers and translators in
Kenya and Tanzania, and a British forensic team was to join them
shortly.
	   Assistant FBI Director Thomas Pickard said Thursday in
Washington that his agents have 700 interviews to conduct in
Nairobi and 200 in Dar es Salaam. The on-site inquiry will take at
least a month, he said.
	   U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, meanwhile, donated on Friday
equipment used in the rescue to the Kenya government saying, ``The
disaster is over, the pain is not.''
	   She also announced that the State Department lifted a warning
against travel to Kenya. The move was warmly welcomed by the Kenya
Tourist Board. Tourism is vital to this East African nation's
economy and the warning had generated a lot of ill will.
	   Bushnell said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's planned
visit next week ``will show the world that the United States and
important Americans are not afraid to come to Kenya.'' Albright
also will visit Tanzania.
	   In Dar es Salaam, where 10 Africans were killed, acting U.S.
Ambassador John Lange raised the flag at the embassy's temporary
headquarters Friday in a house across the road from the Indian
Ocean.
	   The house is almost hidden from view by a high security wall
that is now topped by barbed wire.
	   At a somber memorial service in Kenya, families and friends
remembered 13 people _ half the staff of an insurance broker _
killed in the collapse of a building next to the embassy.
	   ``We are wondering how Nairobi could have become a Beirut, a
Belfast,'' banker Sam Kamau said in a mournful eulogy.
	   Outside of All Saints Cathedral, in a grassy park, Owino, 34,
sought news from volunteers at a Red Cross post about his older
brother, Eliah Ngito Owino.
	   The 41-year-old payroll clerk was in his office on the fourth
floor of Ufundi Cooperative House when the bomb detonated behind
the adjacent embassy, according to a co-worker who survived because
he ran out on an errand.
	   Learning from a relative that Eliah failed to return from work,
Owino drove 260 kilometers (160 miles) southeast from Kisumu where
he works for a power company to Nairobi.
	   There, he found his brother's two children, Biko, 9, and
Michelle, 7, whose mother died just last month, at home alone with
the maid. ``They didn't seem to know what was happening,'' Owino
said.
	   On Sunday he began a grim tour of morgues and hospitals. ``The
bodies were terrible. I couldn't find my brother.''
	   Each day he returned, dreading what he might learn. On
Wednesday, he finally went to the site and his heart sank at the
destruction.
	   At the city morgue are three bodies so badly charred that
they're not recognizable as male or female.
	   ``I don't want to believe that one of them is his,'' Owino said.
``Up to now, I am still hoping.''

Kabila's whereabouts uncertain; rebels push for Kinshasa

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Where's Laurent Kabila? With his capital
in disarray over what many fear will be the fall of Kinshasa to
advancing rebels, even the president's own advisers on Friday
weren't sure.
	   One senior Kabila adviser told The Associated Press the
embattled Congolese leader had fled Kinshasa. Another aide said he
was in the capital and holed up in the Presidential Palace.
	   Kabila has not been seen in public since early this week, when
he appeared meeting new army recruits on a state-television
broadcast.
	   About the only thing certain in Kinshasa is that gossip and
rumors are spurring a muffled sense of panic.
	   ``Only god knows what's going to happen if the rebels arrive,''
said shop owner Mbala Nsiala. ``We hear so many stories, but nobody
knows what's going on.''
	   An army of Tutsi rebels, Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted
troops from Kabila's army _ the same people who helped Kabila oust
longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997 _ is marching toward
Kinshasa from Congo's western coastline in what may usher in the
inglorious end of Kabila's turbulent 14-month rule.
	   Western diplomats and rebel spokesmen on Thursday said the
insurgent forces had captured the town of Inga, about 200
kilometers (135 miles) from the capital, where the primary power
transformer for Kinshasa is located.
	   The electricity supply was severed on Thursday and remained off
in Kinshasa until the early Friday afternoon, when it was restored
to some parts of the city. It was unclear where the electricity was
coming from, but Kinshasa has a second power source in the town of
Nzongo.
	   Thousands of people packed sidewalk shops and markets to buy
extra provisions and bottled water, anticipating what many fear is
the coming fall of the capital to the rebels.
	   ``This is the end,'' said Jean-Pierre Mwenge, standing amid a
crowd of people searching for transport out of the city. ``Now I'm
alone and this will be the end.''
	   Asked where he would go, Mwenge just shrugged.
	   Others tried to go about their business as normal.
	   ``The rebels are here today, maybe we'll have to run tomorrow,''
said Jean Mboyo. ``We must wait to see.''
	   With rifles at the ready, edgy government soldiers _ some
clearly drunk and angry _ roamed crowded neighborhoods, checking
papers and at times extracting arbitrary ``fees'' from shop owners.
	   Truckloads of loyalist troops in khaki uniforms rumbled through
the city's main streets and a military helicopter buzzed overhead.
	   Several foreign journalists and photographers were detained and
later released after trying to speak with people in the city or
take photographs.
	   With water cut off by the electricity outage, groups of women
trod back and forth to the shores of the Congo River and its
tributaries to fill basins with brown, polluted water for their
families.
	   The power outage also silenced state-controlled television and
radio _ though state radio had returned intermittently by
afternoon. No newspapers were published Friday.
	   Amid a rush of people trying to withdraw money, banks throughout
the city closed Friday to avoid a drain on reserves.
	   The rebellion began earlier this month when Tutsi-led rebels
closely tied to Rwanda fought government troops in the capital and
opened up fronts in both the east and west of this central African
nation.
	   Congo accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of masterminding the
uprising. Both countries vehemently deny involvement.
	   Congo's relations with its former allies have been deteriorating
throughout Kabila's rule, and last month he expelled Rwandan
soldiers. Uganda and Rwanda have been angered by the Congolese
president's failure to contain attacks on their territory by
renegade groups based in eastern Congo.
	   While Kabila was warmly welcomed last year by Congolese
civilians disgusted with the excesses of Mobutu, he made little
progress toward rebuilding the country. Instead, many Congolese
became increasingly disenchanted as the economy continued to
stumble, political activity was outlawed and journalists and
opposition leaders were imprisoned.
	   The rebels have latched onto that discontent and on Thursday
reportedly claimed to have seized control of one-third of the
country.
	   Kabila, meanwhile, sacked his new military commander Celestin
Kifwa _ the president's brother-in-law.
	   Kabila appointed Kifwa last month after firing James Kabari, a
Rwandan commander who had been a close ally of Kabila's during his
war against Mobutu.
	   Kabari, also known in Rwanda as Kabarere, has since joined the
rebel movement and was reportedly leading the push toward Kinshasa
from the west.
	   In the western fighting, the rebels said some of their troops
had advanced as far as Kasangalu, 30 kilometers (18 miles)
southwest of the capital.
	   Fearing violence could break out in the capital, the United
States was preparing for the emergency evacuation of its citizens
and foreign airlines _ including Belgian, South African and
Ethiopian carriers _ stopped service to Kinshasa.
	   A French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said France sent a plane
to Kinshasa to pick up its nationals wishing to leave while Germany
also strongly advised its citizens to depart.
	   A primary exit route across the Congo River to Brazzaville, the
capital of neighboring Republic of Congo, was closed days ago with
all traffic across the water stopped.
	   In the United States, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said two
Marine amphibious warships had been dispatched to the Atlantic
waters off Congo in case they are needed to evacuate U.S. citizens.
	   It will take nine or ten days for the ships to reach Congo,
Bacon said.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli platoon commander and two soldiers
were expelled from their elite unit after a Lebanese guerrilla
managed to slip into their heavily fortified post and escape alive,
the army said Friday.
	   The incident in south Lebanon had caused an uproar in the
Israeli military, with the chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz,
calling it a ``a grave operational failure.''
	   In addition to the two expulsions, letters were being placed in
the files of three senior officers _ a lieutenant colonel, a
colonel and a brigadier general _ criticizing them for failing to
adequately prepare the paratroopers for their mission.
	   The infiltration occurred Sunday when a fighter from the
Hezbollah guerrilla force made his way in broad daylight into an
Israeli-held position in Israel's self-declared security zone.
	   According to the army's account, he encountered a paratrooper,
apparently at close quarters, and the two grappled. Another soldier
shot and wounded the guerrilla, who threw down his assault rifle
and escaped.
	   The army spokesman's office said it was decided after an inquiry
that the two soldiers and their platoon commander _ normally a
second lieutenant _ would no longer be allowed to serve as combat
paratroopers.
	   In Israel, service in elite combat units can be a springboard to
a successful civilian career.

IMF endorses Thai financial plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP)_ The International Monetary Fund welcomed
Thailand's comprehensive package to rescue the country's financial
system that includes taking over two debt-ridden banks and five
finance companies.
	   The IMF's acting managing director, Shigemitsu Sugisaki, said in
a statement Friday the move ``demonstrates the resolve of
Thailand's authorities to pursue economic restructuring in the face
of very difficult domestic and regional conditions.''
	   Sugisaki said the measures were aimed at ensuring ``the solvency
and credibility of the core banking system'' and strengthening
``the basis for the recovery of the economy.''
	   ``The announcement recognizes that the recession and the
regional economic environment warrant forceful and comprehensive
measures,'' Sugisaki said.
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn said his organization
strongly supports the program and is impressed with its
comprehensiveness.
	   In a statement Friday, Wolfensohn said the measures ``will
strengthen the confidence of the international community in
Thailand's economic prospects ... and help revive growth.'' Bank
experts helped design the plan, he said, and the organization will
continue to provide advice and financial support to Thailand.
	   Thailand's financial sector was shaken last year after a
slowdown in the economy exposed insolvency in companies in many
sectors of business.
	   The central bank's rescue fund, the Financial Institutions
Development Fund, will take over the seven institutions with swaps
of debt for new shares, Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Kitti
Patpongpibul said earlier Friday.
	   In some cases cash will also have to be injected, and at a later
stage the institutions will be merged with others or possibly
offered for sale, the Thai official said.
	   The majority of Thailand's 15 commercial banks have failed to
raise adequate new capital from the private sector after becoming
laden with bad debt.
	   An IMF delegation visited Bangkok recently to negotiate terms of
the latest quarterly installment of a dlrs 17.2 billion fund to
help rescue Thailand's economy.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ She's a bright preschooler, independent,
concerned about her friends and great with language. He's the same
age, but not very smart, and he snatches toys from other kids and
acts impulsively.
	   They're quite different now, but a new study suggests that both
may be at risk for depression as young adults.
	   In particular, the study suggests intelligence is ``a mixed
blessing for some girls,'' said researcher Per Gjerde.
	   The study, presented Friday at the annual meeting of the
American Psychological Association, has followed about 100
participants from preschool years through age 23 in an attempt to
find early-childhood roots for adult depression.
	   The findings suggest the pathway may be much more complex for
girls than boys, said Gjerde, of the University of California at
Santa Cruz.
	   Intelligence probably doesn't raise the risk of depression by
itself, Gjerde said. Rather, ``in some of these smart preschool
girls, there are certain vulnerabilities that we don't understand
very well, and we are now trying to map.''
	   Participants in Gjerde's study were tracked for personality,
intelligence and depressive symptoms periodically from ages 4 to
23, through reports by nursery school teachers and by tests they
took themselves. About two-thirds of the subjects were
European-American, and about a quarter were black.
	   The study showed that preschool boys who ended up showing
chronic depressive symptoms at age 23 tended to be impulsive and
aggressive and have trouble getting along with peers. It also
indicated that while high intelligence was related to a greater
risk of later depression in girls, boys showed just the opposite.
	   Gjerde found that about one-fifth of the girls followed a
puzzling course during the study.
	   ``They seem to start out very well,'' he said. ``They seem
intelligent, they seem to get along well with other people,'' and
show concern for others.
	   The shift comes in early adolescence, he said, when they
suddenly seem unable to handle stress and their relations with
other people deteriorate.
	   Why? Maybe intelligence teams up with sensitivity to others to
make them unusually aware of their problems and those of other
people, he said. If they become overinvolved in the problems of
others, it might drag down their mood, he said.
	   Carolyn Zahn-Waxler of the U.S. National Institute of Mental
Health, who didn't participate in Gjerde's study, agreed that if a
girl is extremely sensitive to others' needs and what other people
think of her, it can set her up for depression later in life.
	   Zahn-Waxler, who studies children at risk for mood disorders,
said she also doubted intelligence itself raises a girl's risk for
later depression. Rather, she said, ``it may increase the risk when
you're already the type of girl who worries a lot about things,
including relationships, and tends to be somewhat introspective and
ruminative.''

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The U.S. embassy in Bern was evacuated
and the surrounding area sealed off for more than two hours Friday
after an anonymous threat was received.
	   Bern city police said embassy staff received a telephone call
shortly before 4 p.m. local time (1400 GMT).
	   The female caller, speaking in French, said that ``something
would happen'' an hour later, according to police.
	   Staff immediately alerted the police, who evacuated the building
in the Kirchenfeld district of the Swiss capital.
	   A neighboring swimming bath and a large surrounding area were
also evacuated for security reasons. Local inhabitants were told
not to leave their homes.
	   ``In the meantime, security officials of the city police
searched the building and checked cars parked in the area. The
search produced no results and so, after an hour's wait, the
all-clear was given shortly after 6 p.m. (1600 GMT),'' a police
statement said.
	   It added that the background to the call will be in
investigated.
	   ``I suspect it was a bad joke,'' Sebastian Bentz, a Bern city
security official, told Swiss radio. Although the call was vague,
police had to conclude that it was a bomb threat, he added.
	   Police officials said the threat had to be taken seriously after
the recent bombings of U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar-Es-Salaam.
	   An official at the U.S. embassy declined to make any comment
after the building was reopened.
	   The Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office was also alerted and
collaborated in the police search.

Former judges, prosecutors may be punished for communist
</HEADLINE>
collaboration &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Justice Minister Hanna Suchocka said
Friday the government will review files of 2,500 retired judges and
prosecutors to determine if they collaborated with the communist
system more than four decades ago.
	   Suchocka said a special Justice Ministry team will check the
files of judges and prosecutors active from 1944-56.
	   Any official found to have collaborated with the Soviet or
Polish secret police would be stripped of bonuses from the
communist era, such as early retirement packages or extra money
approved by communist authorities and still being paid, she said.
	   Families of proven collaborators who have died also would be
stripped of the extra money, Suchocka said.
	   Under pressure from communist officials strengthening their
power in the 1940s and 1950s, many judges and prosecutors pushed
for and passed unfair verdicts _ often the death penalty _ on
thousands of opposition figures.
	   Suchocka announced the review after meeting with the heads of
Poland's top judicial bodies _ the Supreme Administrative Court,
the Supreme Court, the National Court Board and the Constitutional
Tribunal.
	   The review comes under a new law covering the court system that
takes effect Saturday as part of Poland's efforts to reform
lingering vestiges of Soviet-dominated communist rule.
	   Parliament passed the law in December, sparking a dispute
between legislators and President Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former
communist, who argued it violated the principal of judicial
independence.
	   Kwasniewski asked the Constitutional Tribunal, which checks if
new laws follow the Polish constitution, to review the issue in
February.
	   The tribunal approved the provision stripping former
collaborators of retirement bonuses and other rewards, but rejected
a provision that called for firing collaborators still working.
	   Under the new law, regular pensions would continue to be paid.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Peru's president said Friday that
he hoped a peace accord with its Andean neighbor Ecuador could be
signed within weeks, stamping out a half-century border conflict
makred by shooting wars.
	   On a whirlwind round of South American diplomacy, Alberto
Fujimori sounded upbeat about defusing this week's sudden flare-up
of border tensions that erupted when Peru said some 300 Ecuadorean
troops entered its territory in a ``clear provocation.''
	   Peru subsequently refused to continue talks to end the border
standoff until Ecuador withdraws troops from a disputed zone.
Ecuador maintained it troops are not in Peruvian territory and had
refused to remove them.
	   With Argentinian President Carlos Menem at his side, Fujimori
told a joint news conference in Buenos Aires that it was
``realistic to think that a final accord could be signed in
September.''
	   The optimism followed Fujimori's meetings a day earlier in
Brazil with that country's President Fernando Cardoso, who said
Peru agreed to allow the deployment of peacekeepers on the troubled
border.
	   The border area would not be completely demilitarized, but rival
troops would be separated and neutral peacekeepers will serve as
observers, Fujimori has said.
	   The conflict dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador fought a war
along their Pacific coast at a time when their jungle border went
undefined.
	   In 1942, after Peru won, the two sides signed the Rio Protocol
establishing the 1,088-mile (1,700-km border). The United States,
Brazil, Argentina and Chile acted as guarantors of the treaty.
	   But with 49 miles (78 kilometers) of border left to mark,
Ecuador declared the protocol partially inapplicable, freezing the
process. Since then, Peru and Ecuador have fought wars in 1981 and
1995 over the stretch of unmarked border in largely remote and
unpopulated mountain jungle.
	   The area in question is on the upper eastern slopes of the
Cordillera del Condor mountain range some 560 miles (900 kms) north
of Lima. Peru has historically considered the eastern slopes within
its territory.
	   Fujimori flew to Argentina late Thursday after five hours of
emergency talks with Cardosol. On Friday, Fujimori was headed to
Paraguay to meet with new Ecuadorean President Jamil Mahuad, who
took office Monday and has expressed an interest in negotiating
peace.
	   ``They are going to have a significant encounter,'' said Menem
without elaborating.
	   The latest standoff had cast doubt on the future of
internationally brokered peace talks that had appeared close to
resolving the dispute.
	   Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the United States are guarantors of
a 1942 protocol signed by Ecuador and Peru in Rio de Janeiro. That
treaty was last tested by armed clashes by Peru and Ecuador in
February 1995.
	   Also Friday, Fujimori said he was seeking extradition of two
Peruvian guerrilla suspects arrested in Argentina only hours before
his arrival in Buenos Aires.
	   Local news reports said Interpol detained two 29-year-old
Peruvians, suspected of membership in Peru's leftist Shining Path,
in an area 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Buenos Aires.
	   ``They are not guerrillas, but are members of terrorist
groups,'' Fujimori said. ``In Peru, we make a distinction.''

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Where's Laurent Kabila? With his capital
in disarray over what many fear will be the fall of Kinshasa to
advancing rebels, even the president's own advisers on Friday
weren't sure.
	   One senior Kabila adviser told The Associated Press the
embattled Congolese leader had fled Kinshasa. Another aide said he
was in the capital and holed up in the Presidential Palace.
	   Kabila has not been seen in public since early this week, when
he appeared meeting new army recruits on a state-television
broadcast.
	   About the only thing certain in Kinshasa is that gossip and
rumors are spurring a muffled sense of panic.
	   ``Only god knows what's going to happen if the rebels arrive,''
said shop owner Mbala Nsiala. ``We hear so many stories, but nobody
knows what's going on.''
	   An army of Tutsi rebels, Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted
troops from Kabila's army _ the same people who helped Kabila oust
longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997 _ is marching toward
Kinshasa from Congo's western coastline in what may usher in the
inglorious end of Kabila's turbulent 14-month rule.
	   Bizima Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who has defected
to the rebel side, said Friday that rebel troops had captured the
Congo River port of Matadi, 170 miles (270 kilometers) southwest of
the capital.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Nine badly charred bodies lie in cold
storage at morgues, still unclaimed a week after the worst attack
on a U.S. Embassy. Joseph Owino can't tell if his missing brother
is among them. ``I really can't stand it, the waiting, the not
knowing,'' he said.
	   The not knowing has just begun. The FBI says it will take at
least another month to finish examining the scenes of the bombings
at embassies in Kenya and Tanzania Aug. 7 that killed 257 people,
including a dozen Americans, and injured more than 5,500.
	   So, too, has begun the sorrow. The rubble next to the Nairobi
embassy, once a bustling office building on a busy downtown street,
has become an impromptu shrine.
	   On Friday, a group of Kenyan women wept and prayed there.
Christian and Muslim lawmakers, in a show of unity and grief, laid
a huge wreath of red and white roses. A Vatican envoy offered his
prayers _ and ringing condemnation of terrorism.
	   ``We must find another way of living together on this earth.
Look at it: It is so beautiful,'' said Cardinal Jozef Tomko, the
head of the Vatican missionary service. ``Why this? Why?''
	   Nearby, an FBI team labored over debris with rakes, continuing
their search for evidence.
	   The FBI says it has 215 agents, lab examiners, evidence
technicians, computer specialists, photographers and translators in
Kenya and Tanzania, and a British forensic team was to join them
shortly.
	   Assistant FBI Director Thomas Pickard said Thursday in
Washington that his agents have 700 interviews to conduct in
Nairobi and 200 in Dar es Salaam. The on-site inquiry will take at
least a month, he said.
	   U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, meanwhile, donated on Friday
equipment used in the rescue to the Kenya government saying, ``The
disaster is over, the pain is not.''
	   She also announced that the State Department lifted a warning
against travel to Kenya. The move was warmly welcomed by the Kenya
Tourist Board. Tourism is vital to this East African nation's
economy and the warning had generated a lot of ill will.
	   Bushnell said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's planned
visit this weekend ``will show the world that the United States and
important Americans are not afraid to come to Kenya.'' Albright
also will visit Tanzania.
	   In Dar es Salaam, where 10 Africans were killed, acting U.S.
Ambassador John Lange raised the flag at the embassy's temporary
headquarters Friday in a house across the road from the Indian
Ocean.
	   The house is almost hidden from view by a high security wall
that is now topped by barbed wire.
	   At a somber memorial service in Kenya, families and friends
remembered 13 people _ half the staff of an insurance broker _
killed in the collapse of a building next to the embassy.
	   ``We are wondering how Nairobi could have become a Beirut, a
Belfast,'' banker Sam Kamau said in a mournful eulogy.
	   Outside of All Saints Cathedral, in a grassy park, Owino, 34,
sought news from volunteers at a Red Cross post about his older
brother, Elijah Ngito Owino.
	   The 41-year-old payroll clerk was in his office on the fourth
floor of Ufundi Cooperative House when the bomb detonated behind
the adjacent embassy, according to a co-worker who survived because
he ran out on an errand.
	   Learning from a relative that Elijah failed to return from work,
Owino drove 260 kilometers (160 miles) southeast from Kisumu where
he works for a power company to Nairobi.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy told Americans here
Friday it is suspending normal operations and evacuating family
members and non-essential personnel after reports that U.S.
officials were involved in the arrest of several people suspected
of terrorist links.
	   The embassy, in a statement circulated to U.S. citizens, also
urged Americans to avoid travel to Albania and exercise caution if
they must remain.
	   ``Given the recent declarations by Islamic extremists against
the United States and its citizens and press reports alleging U.S.
government participation in the recent apprehension of several
Islamic activists, it is possible the U.S. Embassy in Tirana,
Albania, could be one of the targets of a terrorist attack,'' the
statement said.
	   ``In light of this information, the U.S. Embassy in Tirana is
temporarily suspending normal operations,'' the statement added.
``The Department of State has ordered the departure of U.S.
personnel in non-essential positions and the families of the
embassy employees.''
	   It urged those remaining to ``review their security practices
and exercise caution.'' The embassy was closed Friday.
	   The announcement was made three days before more than 1,000 U.S.
Marines are to take part in a week-long NATO military exercise in
Albania, in part to show neighboring Yugoslavia that the alliance
can respond forcefully to the crisis in neighboring Kosovo.
	   One day before the bombings at U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, an Arabic language newspaper published in London,
al-Hayat, published a letter from the ``International Islamic Front
for Jihad'' vowing revenge against the United States for the
arrests of several of its members in Albania.
	   Albanian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
four were wanted on terrorist charges in Egypt, and U.S. agents
took them out of the country.
	   On Thursday, the head of the Albanian secret service was quoted
in a Tirana newspaper as saying the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency is operating in Albania, helping rebuild the country's
internal security capability.
	   Fatos Klosi said that relations between his Albanian Secret
Service, or SHIK, and the CIA ``were intensified in the last
months'' and that ``CIA specialists'' were operating in the
country.
	   ``They even have offices in the north,'' he added, referring to
the area near the border with Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, where
the Kosovo Liberation Army maintains sanctuaries.

	   HARROGATE, England (AP) _ The second womens Ashes cricket test
between England and Australia ended in a draw Friday.
	   The Harrogate pitch conceded 999 runs in under four days but
provided the bowlers with little reward, with just 16 wickets
falling in 12 sessions of play.
	   The best-of-three series could now be decided in the next test
starting at Wocester on Aug. 29 after the first two matches have
ended in a draw.
	   Australia won the toss and batted first Tuesday, declaring at
306 for three before England replied with 326 for eight to take a
slight first innings lead.
	   The visitors racked up 303 for five in the third innings before
declaring Friday, giving England a target of 283 to win in 45
overs.
	   However, the captains agreed to call stumps early when England
reached 64 without loss and rain stopped play.
	   England opener Jan Brittin, who scored a century in the drawn
first test at Guildford, top scored in the match with 167.
	   The Australian top-order also worked on individual batting
averages, with Karen Rolton, Belinda Clark and Joanne Broadbent all
registering half-centuries in both innings.

Muted Iraqi response could pave the way for tougher action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 17th graf to ADD that report fuels Iraqi claims that
Butler is U.S. puppet; Picks up 18th graf pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ By giving only a muted response to the
latest Iraqi crisis, the Security Council is waiting for Baghdad's
next move _ and whether it violates U.N. agreements by trying to
block weapons inspectors, council diplomats say.
	   Such a violation could prompt a tougher council response and
would further jeopardize Iraq's attempts to have sanctions lifted
when the 15-member council reviews the measures this October.
	   To date, the council has only said Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to
freeze cooperation with the United Nations was ``totally
unacceptable.'' The council was expected to take up the issue again
Monday.
	   Sanctions, which prevent Iraq from freely selling its oil, were
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. They can only be lifted
once weapons inspectors have certified that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
	   If weapons inspectors can't get to sites to certify Iraqi
compliance, sanctions won't be lifted. A more patient, middle
ground reaction from the council would force Iraq to make the next,
conciliatory move if it wants sanctions removed, one Western
diplomat said.
	   On Thursday, council members postponed any formal show of
support for U.N. inspectors, despite letters from top inspectors
who said their work was being undermined by Iraq's decision.
	   Rather than issuing a formal resolution or statement, the
council was considering sending letters of support to Richard
Butler of the U.N. Special Commission, and Mohamed ElBaradei of the
International Atomic Energy Agency. The letters would state that
Iraq's actions were unacceptable, diplomats said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Such letters could give weapons experts the go-ahead to attempt
the kind of inspections suspended last week, diplomats said. If
inspectors are blocked in violation of U.N. agreements, the council
could then take a more aggressive stand.
	   So far, U.N. inspectors haven't tested the Iraqi announcement
and were awaiting word from the council on whether to proceed with
inspections and request Iraqi escorts for visits to new sites, U.N.
officials said. According to Security Council resolutions, the
inspectors can't go out on spot searches without Iraqi escorts.
	   A top Iraqi official at Iraq's U.N. mission said his country's
decision is clear.
	   ``We will not send people to accompany you,'' the official said
Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``If they want to
escalate the situation then yes, this would be the next step.''
	   The relatively muted move of sending letters was also seen as
trying to gain more unity within the council. Russia, China and
France _ all permanent members of the powerful body _ have tended
to be the most sympathetic to Iraq.
	   Already, though, France has indicated its displeasure with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein over ending cooperation with the
inspectors.
	   ``This decision will do a disservice to Iraq's cause,'' the
French Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
	   Washington has the most to gain by a unified council, since it
could more easily justify keeping sanctions in place.
	   The Washington Post reported Friday that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright had tried to dissuade Butler from conducting
surprise ``challenge inspections'' in Iraq because the timing
wasn't right.
	   The report would indicate that Washington thought as recently as
this month that it couldn't get the council on its side in the
event of a renewed confrontation and also could fuel Iraqi
allegations that Butler is acting as Washington's puppet at the
United Nations.
	   But Butler and U.S. officials at the State Department and White
House said the newspaper story was false.
	   Butler ``would find it invidious were any attempt made to direct
his operational decisions or to micro-manage the day-to-day work of
the Special Commission,'' a statement from Butler's office said.

U.S. secretary general says decision not made on new coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW with USSF secretary general saying no decision made. &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The list of candidates for the U.S. national
team head coach's job has been ``tentatively narrowed'' to two
candidates, but a decision has not been made, U.S. Soccer
Federation secretary general Hank Steinbrecher said Friday.
	   Steinbrecher, reached on vacation in San Diego, would not
identify either candidate, but did say the original field of four:
Portugal's Carlos Queiroz, Brazil's Carlos Alberto Parreira, former
U.S. coach Bora Milutinovic and D.C. United's Bruce Arena, had been
cut in half.
	   ``Reports of Bruce's hiring are greatly exaggerated,''
Steinbrecher said. ``Our decision as of 2 a.m. (PDT, Friday) has
not been made.''
	   Steinbrecher made the comments in response to published reports
in USA Today and the Washington Post on Friday, quoting
unidentified sources, that Arena was either the leading candidate
or that USSF president Alan Rothenberg had planned to offer him the
job.
	   Having served the maximum two four-year terms, Rothenberg must
relinquish his post as president Aug. 22.
	   ``Alan would like to do this under his watch,'' Steinbrecher
said.
	   However, if no decision is reached, the decision would fall to
Rothenberg's successor, either Larry Monaco or Dr. Bob Contiguglia,
one of which will be elected Aug. 22.
	   Steinbrecher said both have been updated almost daily on the
search for the replacement to Steve Sampson, who resigned following
the United States' first-round elimination from the World Cup.

<TEXT>
	   IRAKLION, Greece (AP) _ Four British tourists arrested for
posing semi-naked at Crete's ancient Minoan palace received seven-
and 10-month prison terms Friday, media reports said.
	   The four, identified as Shiva Mahalingam and Mit Kopeha, both
22, Daniel Maher, 26, and Vimal Patel, 23, were arrested Thursday
afternoon in King Minos's palace at the archaeological site of
Knossos on charges of ``causing a scandal by engaging in obscene
acts,'' the reports said. No home towns were available.
	   Two pulled their trousers down and flashed their buttocks in an
ancient palace believed to have belonged to King Minos, while
another took photographs. The reports did not specify which two
were committed the act.
	   Dating from 2600-1100 B.C., the Minoan civilization gave rise to
the myth of the Minotaur. According to the legend, Minos, king of
Knossos, kept the Minotaur, a creature which was half human, half
bull, in a labyrinth. The creature devoured youths and virgins
brought as tributes until it was slayed by the mythical hero
Theseus.
	   The tourists told the court they regretted their actions,
describing them as a prank. ``We didn't mean to insult anyone,''
one of the four told television reporters while covering his face.
	   Three of the four were sentenced to 10 months in prison, while
one received a seven month term. They will appeal the sentences on
Monday, and are expected to be released after each paying bail of
200,000 drachma (dlrs 660).

 &UR; German TV crew expelled from Yugoslavia

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three journalists working for German
public television were expelled from Yugoslavia Friday for
allegedly reporting a ``non-existent'' Serb attack on a Kosovo
Albanian stronghold.
	   The police said two Germans, Friedhelm Brebeck and Armin
Eberhard, and an Austrian, Stefan Irran, will be banned from
returning to Yugoslavia for two years. All three were working for
Germany's public TV station, ARD.
	   The German ambassador in Belgrade has lodged a protest with the
Yugoslav foreign ministry.
	   On Aug. 13, the three reportedly filmed ``a staged and
non-existent (Serb) police attack, with civilian casualties '' on
Junik, a besieged ethnic Albanian militant stronghold on the border
with Albania state-run Tanjug news agency said.
	   ``With this, they maliciously tried to make a difficult
situation in this part of the Republic of Serbia even worse, and
thus have violated the laws and hospitality of our country,'' said
a police statement, carried by Tanjug.
	   Last Tuesday, another German Journalist _ Eric Rathfelder who
was reporting for the Berlin daily, Tageszeitung, or taz, and the
Austrian daily Die Presse _ was also expelled from Yugoslavia for
writing about alleged mass graves in Kosovo, where Serbian security
forces have been battling Albanian secessionists.

Rains trigger landslide in Himalayans; 42 dead, 54 missing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RAISES death toll to 42 from 27, reduces number still
missing. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Heavy rains triggered landslides in a
mountainous region popular with religious tourists, killing at
least 42 people, hundreds of animals and destroying several houses
and shops, an official said Friday.
	   Fifty-four others were missing in the Ukhimutt neighborhood of
the Garhwal region of the Himalayas, 300 kilometers (185 miles)
northeast of New Delhi after torrential rains since Tuesday swept
away houses, knocked down telephone and electricity poles and
blocked roads, said Lalitmohan Upreti, a top administration
official.
	   The deaths occurred Wednesday.
	   Army and paramilitary soldiers dug out 15 more bodies Friday
from the mud and slush, raising the total death toll to 42, Upreti
said. Rescue work was hampered by continous downpour and blocked
roads, he said in a telephone interview.
	   All eight houses of Raulake village were completely destroyed,
he said.
	   The area is near Rudraprayag, one of the most important
pilgrimage centers of the Hindus and close to a region ravaged by
an earthquake in 1991, which left 341 people dead.
	   All of the dead were area residents. There were no casualties
among pilgrims.

India's government transfers key officials apparently to satisfy
</HEADLINE>
maverick partner &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The right-wing government transferred
key Finance Ministry officials Friday, apparently to mollify a
maverick politician who has threatened to topple the minority
coalition.
	   Notable among the transfers were those of Revenue Secretary N.K.
Singh, one of the top three Finance Ministry officials, whose
department is investigating cases of corruption and foreign
exchange violations of a southern politician whose support is
crucial for the survival of the government.
	   Singh was moved to the prime minister's office, where he will no
longer deal with the cases.
	   Jayaram Jayalalitha, whose Tamil regional group is one of the 19
parites in the governing coalition, has repeatedly threatened to
pull out of the government over several local issues. She has not
carried out her threat so far.
	   But she has ensured that many officials investigating corruption
cases against her were transferred to innocuous departments.
	   On Thursday, Jayalalitha announced she would stay in Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government after nearly all the 30
lawmakers supporting her warned against the move. But they
permitted her to take whatever decision she wants later.
	   Minutes after the meeting, Vajpayee moved the chief investigator
of her cases to the transport department, saying his expertise was
wanted there.
	   However, the government gave no reason for the latest transfers.
	   Another key official transferred Friday night was Montek Singh
Ahluwalia, who as finance secretary helped design and implement the
economic reforms introduced in 1991. Ahluwalia held the job even
when three other governments came to power for varying lengths of
time since 1996.
	   Ahluwalia will now be a member of the Planning Commission, which
decides the broad policy for India's growth.

Kazakstan, Iran express concern about fighting in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin comments, phone calls. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan and
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi expressed concern Friday
over the fighting in northern Afghanistan.
	   ``A broad coalition government should be set up in Afghanistan
to take the interests of all its ethnic minorities into account,''
Kharazi said following a meeting with Nazarbayev in the Kazak
capital, Astana.
	   The fighting in Afghanistan ``can undoubtedly affect the
security of Central Asian countries,'' he said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The former Soviet republics in Central Asia fear that if the
Taliban army gains control of all of Afghanistan, it will entrench
a radical Islamic state and that there will be an influx of
refugees and weapons across their borders.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin said during a trip to the
northwestern city of Novgorod on Friday that Russia and two Central
Asian countries, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, had agreed to cooperate
and ``raise a barrier to the Taliban'' by strengthening those
countries' borders with Afghanistan.
	   After a phone call with Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov,
Yeltsin said the two countries agreed that Taliban movements ``pose
a real threat to the Commonwealth of Independent States' southern
borders,'' according to Interfax.
	   Yeltsin also had a similar conversation Friday night with Uzbek
President Islam Karimov, his press service said.
	   However, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Friday he
saw no danger of Taliban fighters crossing into the former Soviet
republics.
	   The situation in Afghanistan is ``complex but controllable,'' he
said, according to Interfax.
	   Kharazi, the Iranian foreign minister, expressed concern about
the reported abduction of 11 Iranians, including employees of the
Iranian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, the stronghold of the
opposition Northern Alliance, which recently fell to the Taliban.

Guatemalan army delivering information on officers linked to
</HEADLINE>
bishop's death &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ The Guatemalan army will hand over to
investigators information about two military officers allegedly
linked to the April slaying of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi,
the defense minister announced Friday.
	   Gen. Hector Mario Barrios declined to give the names of the two
men, but local newspapers identified them as Capt. Byron Miguel
Limz Oliva and his father, retired Col. Byron Disrael Lima Estrada.
	   Last month, an official from the church's Human Rights Office of
the Archbishop claimed two military men were involved in the
slaying.
	   Gerardi was bludgeoned to death in his garage on April 26, two
days after delivering a report blaming the military and death
squads for most of the deaths in Guatemala's 36-year civil war,
which ended in 1996.
	   Police have arrested a fellow priest and a church cook.
	   Barrios stressed the army is committed to helping investigators
solve the case and rejects unsubstantiated allegations of military
involvement.
	   ``We reiterate that the armed forces are the ones most
interested in clearing up the murder of Monsignor Gerardi,'' he
told reporters.

Sri Lanka beat South Africa by 57 runs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with result
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Sri Lanka, inspired by a captain's
innings by Arjuna Ranatunga and a brilliant spell of bowling by
Pramodaya Wickramasinghe, beat South Africa by 57 runs in the
triangular limited-overs series opener at Trent Bridge Friday.
	   South Africa, chasing Sri Lanka's 258 to win, never quite
recovered from 32 for four and was finally bowled out for 201 in 49
overs.
	   Pat Symcox, sent in as a pinch-hitter at 30 for three, ended up
top scoring for the Proteas with a watchful 58 off 87 balls. When
he was dismissed in the 39th over, he took with him any hopes of an
unlikely win.
	   South Africa, having bowled well to contain a runaway Sri Lanka
innings, collapsed either side of a 100-run sixth wicket stand
between Symcox and Jonty Rhodes (54).
	   Running brilliantly between the wicket, the pair hit the century
partnership off 97 balls. Both fell to catches in the deep as Sri
Lanka secured the first points of the three-way series.
	   The pair had come together with the side struggling on 66 for
five to rescue the innings. But the South African innings fell into
disaray after Symcox's departure, losing four wickets for 12 runs.
	   Aravinda de Silva, standing in for an injured Ranatunga,
switched his bowlers around intelligently, and never let the South
African batting line up settle down.
	   Ranatunga, took a painful blow on his right knee during his
58-run knock and didn't take the field during the South African
innings.
	   He is expected to be fit for Sunday's match against England at
Lord's.
	   Man-of-the-match and birthday boy, Wickramasinghe, began the
South African slide with the second ball of the innings by forcing
veteran opener Gary Kirsten (0) to play onto his stumps.
	   He added the wickets of Jacques Kallis (6) and Mike Rindel (18)
before finishing with 3-20 in seven overs, a career-best effort in
his 94th match.
	   Off cutter Kumara Dharmasena chipped in with three important
wickets _ Symcox, Rhodes and Donald _ to finish with 3-41 in 10
overs.
	   Rhodes, South Africa's inform batsman, scored his runs off 49
balls inclusive of four boundaries.
	   Earlier Sri Lanka, sent into bat, looked set to score 300 after
reaching 150 off 25 overs for the loss of three wickets.
	   But Sri Lanka lost its last five wickets for 34 runs.
	   After the openers _ Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana _
had hit 85 off 72 balls, the leatherhunt was arrested with the
introduction of fast bowler Allan Donald and seamer Kallis.
	   Kallis struck with the first ball, forcing Kaluwitharana (33) to
sky a catch. Allan Donald accounted for the two dangermen,
Jayasuriya (36) and de Silva (12), in the space of six balls.
	   The Sri Lankan total was built around a crafty 80-run stand for
the fourth wicket between Marvan Atapattu (40) and Ranatunga, who
came in with the side in a spot of bother at 102 for three.
	   Ranatunga's innings included just two boundaries. He was
eventually run out, beaten by a Kirsten through from the square leg
boundary going for the second run.
	   Pollock, who took most of the early caning, conceding 20 runs in
his first overs, took 3-11 in 13 balls in his third and final spell
to finish with 3-54.
	   During the early onslaught, South Africa could nothing to stop
Jayasuriya and Kaluwitharana as they smashed nine boundaries
between them to bring up the 50 in 35 balls.
	   Jayasuriya, one of the explosive opening batsmen in one-day
cricket, passed fit after damaging a hand, provided the day's
exhilarating batting until Donald removed him.
	   Skipper Hansie Cronje took 2-29 while Donald, 2-40.

Ethnic party pulls out of Pakistan's governing coalition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Pakistan-Violence. &QL; 
 &UR; By ZAHID HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ The ethnic party that dominates
violence-plagued Karachi pulled out of Pakistan's federal governing
coalition Friday, saying the government hasn't done enough to bring
peace to the port city that is the country's financial hub.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif can continue to govern without the
Mohajir Qaumi Movement, but the party's withdrawal _ which came on
independence day _ will weaken his already shaky position. It comes
after a series of blows to Sharif that are emboldening his longtime
rival, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
	   The government did not immediately comment on MQM's withdrawal.
	   Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party drew 20,000 people to a rally
Friday in Karachi, where speakers criticized Sharif for failing to
quell Karachi's violence and demanded he step down in favor of a
government of national unity. It was the biggest rally in Karachi
since Sharif took power after March 1997 elections.
	   ``The federal government has a responsibility and has failed to
provide security to the people,'' MQM spokesman Kunwar Khalid Yunas
told The Associated Press.
	   Two days ago, nine MQM party members were killed by gunmen who
sprayed a crowd sitting in a park. The MQM blamed a breakaway
faction with whom it has been locked in a power struggle.
	   The MQM, which represents Muslims who came to Pakistan from
India, has called a citywide strike Saturday to protest the
killings. Gunmen fired shots into the air and cars were set afire
Friday night in the unrest that is often a prelude to political
strikes in Karachi.
	   Also Friday, unidentified gunmen attacked a Karachi school,
wounding at least seven children attending independence
celebrations.
	   More than 500 people have been killed in Karachi's political,
ethnic and sectarian violence this year, compared with about 400 in
1997.
	   The escalating violence is just one of the challenges facing
Sharif:
	   _Pakistan's relations with its giant neighbor India are at one
of the lowest points in their 51-year histories following a series
of tit-for-tat nuclear weapons tests by both nations in May. Peace
talks between Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atoll Binary failed
last month.
	   _International anti-nuclear economic sanctions have pushed the
already weak Pakistani economy to the brink of bankruptcy.
	   _Sharif's opponents are harnessing popular resentment over his
proposal to build a huge dam on the Indus River. Electricity
generated from the dam will power Pakistan's most populous province
of Punjab, Sharif's home province. But it could flood hundreds of
acres (hectares) of farm land in Northwest Frontier Province, and
dry up irrigation water in Sindh.
	   MQM spokesman Yunas said his party was also considering pulling
out of the local government in Sindh, the province that includes
Karachi. The Sindh government, which is led by Sharif's party,
would fall without MQM.
	   The MQM is the third largest party in the 217-member national
assembly with 13 seats, after Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League with
134 and Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party with 19. Bhutto's party
has the most seats _ 37 _ in the Sindh assembly, but several
smaller parties, including the PML with 18 and the MQM with 28 _
have joined to keep her from power in her home province.
	   The MQM has accused Bhutto of killing its members in a crackdown
on Karachi violence before her government was toppled in 1996 on
charges of corruption and misrule.

 &UR; German TV crew expelled from Yugoslavia
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from ARD crew member

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A three-men crew belonging to German
public television was expelled from Yugoslavia Friday for allegedly
reporting a ``non-existent'' Serb attack on a Kosovo Albanian
stronghold.
	   The police said two Germans, Friedhelm Brebeck and Armin
Eberhard, and an Austrian, Stefan Irran, will be banned from
returning to Yugoslavia for two years. All three were working for
Germany's public TV station, ARD.
	   On Aug. 13, the three reportedly filmed ``a staged and
non-existent (Serb) police attack, with civilian casualties '' on
Junik, a besieged ethnic Albanian militant stronghold on the border
with Albania state-run Tanjug news agency said.
	   ``With this, they maliciously tried to make a difficult
situation in this part of the Republic of Serbia even worse, and
thus have violated the laws and hospitality of our country,'' said
a police statement, carried by Tanjug.
	   An ARD crew member, who demanded anonymity for his own security,
told The Associated Press that the ARD team managed to get into
Junik on Thursday, which has been besieged by Serb forces for over
two weeks.
	   ``They found the village totally empty,'' he said. ``On their
return, they were detained for over four hours by the Yugoslav
military.''
	   ``The military impounded the camera and took a look at the
footage. They were in shock to see that they have been besieging an
empty village for so long,'' he added. The claim could not be
independently confirmed.
	   ``Brebeck wasn't in Junik at all. He stayed in Pristina,'' he
said. ``On the footage they saw a burning house and accused the
crew of setting it ablaze for staging purposes.''
	   He said that the three were expelled via neighboring Macedonia.
	   Last Tuesday, another German Journalist _ Eric Rathfelder who
was reporting for the Berlin daily, Tageszeitung, or taz, and the
Austrian daily Die Presse _ was also expelled from Yugoslavia for
writing about alleged mass graves in Kosovo, where Serbian security
forces have been battling Albanian secessionists.

India accuses Pakistani intelligence officials of kidnapping
</HEADLINE>
embassy official &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Amid escalating tension, India on Friday
accused Pakistani intelligence officials of kidnapping an embassy
official and his son in Islamabad.
	   Ajay Gupta, who works in India's embassy in Islamabad, was asked
to become an informer during the one hour he was held with his
3-year-old son Monday, according to a Foreign Office statement in
New Delhi.
	   The officials also threatened to kidnap his wife and harm his
son, the statement said.
	   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry refused to comment.
	   The Indian government said the behavior of the intelligence
officials was ``highly reprehensible'' and violated diplomatic
procedures.
	   New Delhi asked Islamabad to immediately investigate the
incident and punish the guilty. It urged Pakistan to ensure the
safety of Indian embassy officials in Islamabd and to ``stop such
incidents that vitiate the atmosphere of our bilateral relations.''
	   Neighboring India and Pakistan have frequently expelled each
other's diplomats in the past, accusing them of spying.
	   In the last two weeks, relations have deteriorated, with army
soldiers exchanging mortar and gun fire across their disputed
frontier, killing and wounding hundreds of people and destroying
several houses.
	   Relations worsened in May when India conducted five underground
nuclear tests and Islamabad retaliated with six of its own tests.
	   Attempts by their prime ministers to reopen dialogue on the
disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir failed when they met
briefly in Colombo, Sri Lanka, last month.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over
Kashmir, now divided between them.
	   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming militants in
India-held Kashmir to fight its proxy war. Pakistan says it only
gives them moral support.

Suspect, witnesses united in probe of attacked policeman

	   BETHUNE, France (AP) _ A judge investigating an attack on a
French policeman during the World Cup held a face-to-face meeting
Friday between a German suspect and two witnesses.
	   The witnesses, a French policeman and an Australian tourist, say
they saw Karl-Heinz Elschner attack 44-year-old Daniel Nivel, who
was hit on the head with an iron bar, and fell into a six-week
coma.
	   They were questioned by Judge Cecile Ramonatxo for almost five
hours.
	   Nivel was attacked shortly after a June 21 World Cup match
between Germany and Yugoslavia in the northern town of Lens. He
left hospital on Wednesday and was transferred to a military
hospital where he will undergo physical therapy.
	   Doctors say that although his condition has improved since
waking from a coma earlier this month, Nivel still cannot talk and
has difficulties understanding.
	   As well as Elschner, four other suspects are in custody in
Germany, facing charges of attempted murder, causing serious bodily
harm, and disturbing the peace.
	   Elschner's lawyer, Eric Dupond-Moretti, said Friday's hearing
proved his client's innocence, claiming that the witnesses had
wrongly testified that Elschner wore an earring, had tattoos, and a
scar on his left cheek.

Teen-aged batsman joins seasoned cricket team for winter tour
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CRAIG COZIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Trinidad and Tobago's 19-year-old
batsman Darren Ganga is the only newcomer in a 16-member West
Indies squad for their five-Test winter tour of South Africa
beginning in November.
	   The team was announced by chairman of selectors Mike Findlay at
a news conference at Sherbourne Centre here Friday.
	   Ganga earns his spot after an encouraging 1998 regional season
in the President's Cup, including a maiden first-class century
against Barbados.
	   ``He is a well organized batsman, very mature for his age,''
said skipper Brian Lara, also Ganga's captain for Trinidad and
Tobago. ``He is an investment for the future and even if he doesn't
play any of the Tests, I'm sure he'll return in January a better
batsman.''
	   Lara is in charge for his second major series, following his
team's impressive 3-1 victory over England at home four months ago.
Guyanese all-rounder Carl Hooper remains vice captain. The batting
revolves around Lara and Hooper with much also expected of the
exciting new opening combination of Philo Wallace and Clayton
Lambert.
	   Wallace and Lambert lashed the England attack in the final two
Tests of the series after replacing the failing pair of Stuart
Williams and Sherwin Campbell. Williams pips his one-time partner
Campbell as the third opener in the squad.
	   Campbell is likely to be entrusted with the leadership of the
West Indies ``A'' team to visit India later this year. Findlay said
the ``A'' team will be announced when arrangements for that tour
have been finalized.
	   The bowling again is pace biased, led by the durable pair of
Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose. Former captain Walsh, who turns
36 before the tour begins, is one away from breaking his coach
Malcolm Marshall's West Indies record of 376 Test wickets. Ambrose,
35 next month and third among West Indians with 337 wickets, is in
his 11th year as a Test player and remains the spearhead of the
attack.
	   Ambrose and Walsh are supported by the promising trio of
Franklyn Rose, Nixon McLean and Mervyn Dillon. There is no room for
the out-of-form Ian Bishop, a stalwart of 43 Tests with 161
wickets.
	   Leg-spinner Dinanath Ramnarine, who impressed in his first two
Tests against England in the Caribbean earlier this year, is the
only specialist slow bowler in the team.
	   Ridley Jacobs and Junior Murray are left to battle for the
wicket-keeper's spot. Jacobs has yet to play a Test but shone when
chosen to replace an injured Murray in the one-day series against
England. Murray aims to reclaim his No. 1 status which saw him
appear in 29 Tests since his debut in 1992-93 in Australia.
	   The selectors also chose a 14-man limited overs squad for the
ICC one-day tournament in Bangladesh preceding the South Africa
trip.
	   Experienced all-rounders Phil Simmons and Keith Arthurton retain
the places they held in a 4-1 trouncing of England in the
Caribbean. Leg-spinner Rawl Lewis and slow left-armer Neil
McGarrell are the other two selected for Bangladesh not making the
South African tour.
	   Squad of 16 for South Africa: Brian Lara (captain), Carl Hooper
(vice captain), Jimmy Adams, Curtly Ambrose, Shivnarine
Chanderpaul, Mervyn Dillon, Darren Ganga, Ridley Jacobs, Clayton
Lambert, Nixon McLean, Junior Murray, Dinanath Ramnarine, Franklyn
Rose, Philo Wallace, Courtney Walsh, Stuart Williams.
	   Squad of 14 for Bangladesh: Brian Lara (captain), Carl Hooper
(vice captain), Curtly Ambrose, Keith Arthurton, Shivnarine
Chanderpaul, Mervyn Dillon, Ridley Jacobs, Clayton Lambert, Rawl
Lewis, Neil McGarrell, Nixon McLean, Phil Simmons, Philo Wallace,
Stuart Williams. Coach: Malcolm Marshall. Manager: Clive Lloyd.
Physiotherapist: Dennis Waight.

West Indies confident facing South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CRAIG COZIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Chairman of West Indies cricket
selectors, Mike Findlay, said Friday his team's success against
England four months ago should give it confidence ahead of the
winter tour of South Africa.
	   ``We are encouraged by the success of the team which defeated
England in both the Test and one-day international series here in
the Caribbean earlier this year,'' Findlay said after announcing
the 16-member squad to tour South Africa from November. ``Those
successes have since been magnified with England's defeat of South
Africa last week.''
	   The West Indies downed England 3-1 in the six-Test series and
4-1 in the limited overs contest in April, while England bounced
back to beat South Africa 2-1 in their five-Test rubber last week.
	   ``That result has placed the forthcoming West Indies vs. South
Africa series in greater focus,'' Findlay added. ``With the West
Indies scheduled to oppose Australia at home early in 1999, and the
World Cup to be played in England from May next year, the nine
months between October this year and June 1999 could be a very
exciting period for West Indies cricket.''
	   But Findlay also warned of a current drought of talent.
	   ``We have selected what, in our opinion, are the best possible
teams having given very careful consideration to the ability,
performance, discipline, attitude and commitment of the available
talent, which appears to be dwindling in quality,'' he said.
	   The West Indies compete in the ICC Knockout Tournament in
Bangladesh in late October before beginning their five-Test tour of
South Africa on Nov. 10.
	   Squad of 16 for South Africa: Brian Lara (captain), Carl Hooper
(vice captain), Jimmy Adams, Curtly Ambrose, Shivnarine
Chanderpaul, Mervyn Dillon, Darren Ganga, Ridley Jacobs, Clayton
Lambert, Nixon McLean, Junior Murray, Dinanath Ramnarine, Franklyn
Rose, Philo Wallace, Courtney Walsh, Stuart Williams.

More crosses erected at Auschwitz despite church opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Conservative Catholics have erected 10
more wooden crosses next to the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz
despite calls by Catholic church officials for them to stop.
	   The new crosses were set up overnight before a Mass celebrated
Friday at Auschwitz in memory of Maksymilian Kolbe, a Catholic
priest who took the place of an Auschwitz prisoner and was killed
by the Nazis in 1941.
	   Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the nation's top Catholic figure, and
other clergymen called this week for conservative Catholics to stop
putting up more crosses next to an eight-meter (26-foot) cross in a
small field next to Auschwitz.
	   The large cross, used in a 1979 Mass celebrated by Pope John
Paul II near Auschwitz, was set up in 1988 where 152 Poles were
killed by the Nazis.
	   Jewish groups want the large cross removed, saying it is visible
from inside Auschwitz and stains the memory of more than 1 million
Jews killed at Auschwitz and nearby Birkenau death camp.
	   The controversy has escalated in recent weeks, with conservative
Catholics inspired by religious activist Kazimierz Switon
constructing dozens more smaller crosses near the large papal
cross.
	   Israel's government-funded Yad Vashem Holocaust museum formally
protested to the Polish government, which said it was seeking a
compromise but called for tolerance for religious symbols near
Auschwitz.
	   At Friday's Mass at Auschwitz, Bishop Tadeusz Rakoczy called for
a halt to ``all actions that have nothing to do with the cross but
are conducted in its shadow.''
	   Referring to the people erecting the crosses, he said
``religious feelings and patriotic sensitivity cannot become a
neurosis or a blind stupidity that prevents dialogue.''
	   Poland's church leaders are scheduled to meet later in August to
discuss the issue.

	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Fred Funk birdied three of his first
six holes and moved within a stroke of Tiger Woods atop the U.S.
PGA Championship leaderboard on Friday.
	   Funk was at 3-under, joining Fiji's Vijay Singh a shot behind
Woods as play continued under nearly perfect conditions for a
second straight day in the season's final major championship.
	   Funk, who was critical of the attention given Woods when the
young star's appearance at the B.C. Open overshadowed Funk's
victory there in 1996, started the day at even par but birdied the
first, fourth and sixth holes.
	   Singh birdied three of his first four holes to also move into
contention. Both players shot 70 on Thursday.
	   Woods was to tee off later Friday.

Americans warned against travel to east European country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ All except essential workers at the U.S.
Embassy in Albania have been ordered to leave and the State
Department warned Americans not to travel in the east European
country.
	   The department said in a statement Friday that Albania could be
among the targets of a terrorist attack. The U.S. Embassy in Tirana
will provide only emergency services, the announcement said.
	   The department cited ``recent declarations by Islamic extremists
against the United States and its citizens.'' Embassy workers in
``non-emergency'' jobs were ordered to depart, as were dependents.

Over-par Burton leads by one, Davies misses cut

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ An 18-under-par winner of a
major, the Du Maurier Classic two weeks ago, Brandie Burton was the
halfway leader of the Women's British Open Friday at 1-over.
	   The 26-year-old American carded a 2-over 74 at windswept Lytham
St. Annes for a two-round score of 145 and leads countrywoman
Leslie Spalding by one with three players a further stroke behind.
	   Laura Davies, winner in 1986 of a tournament she considers the
most important in the world, won't be back Saturday. She missed the
cut by one stroke after her second 79 left her 14 over.
	   Even Burton's round had its alarms.
	   A bogey at eight followed by double bogey at nine, where she was
plugged in one bunker and then landed in another, meant that Burton
finally had to let go of her status as the only player under par.
She also momentarily lost the outright lead until a 12-foot birdie
putt at 11 nosed her in front again.
	   ``If there is a positive thing it's that, having made bogey at
eight and double bogey at nine, I was able to hang in there and
keep pedalling away,'' Burton said.
	   ``I knew that something like this was going to happen on a golf
course like this and in these windy conditions and you've got to
just roll with the punches.
	   ``I managed to really keep my head which is really important on
this golf course.''
	   Spalding, who only gained the draw as an alternate, rolled in a
60-foot putt for a birdie two at the 158-yard ninth and then
birdied 11, 13 and 14 on the way to her 2-under 70.
	   ``It's my first time here and I'm really thrilled,'' said
Spalding, who holed birdie putts from 10, 15 and 20 feet. ``I like
the tough conditions and I like the wind.
	   ``I feel my game is on the way up,'' said Spalding, whose best
finish on the U.S. Tour is a share of 20th at the Big Apple Classic
at New Rochelle in July.
	   Wendy Ward, who won the Hawaiian Ladies Open in February for her
second Tour victory, carded a 71 for a 3-under halfway total of
147. She is tied with Scotland's Janice Moodie and England's
Suzanne Strudwick, who both made level par 72s.
	   Betsy King, tied for the lead with Burton after the opening
round, bogeyed the first four holes for a 5-over 77 and slipped to
three off the lead.
	   She twice had to hack out of the long rough after pulling her
tee shots off the narrow fairways of the Royal Lytham course.
	   ``I was relieved to make the first par,'' said the American, who
followed it with the first of her two birdies and wound up 4 over
at 148 for two rounds.
	   Se Ri Pak, winner of two majors and two more tournaments in this
her rookie season on the U.S. Tour, stands seven off the lead after
a second ronnd 74 which included her first birdie of the
championship.
	   The 20-year-old Korean, tipped to become one of the greats of
women's golf after such as impact in her first season, pitched to
eight feet at the 320-yard par-4 10th and rolled in the putt to end
a run of 27 holes with no birdies but eight bogeys.
	   ``Yes, my first birdie,'' she said with a broad grin. ``Today
everything got better a little bit.''
	   Defending titlist Karrie Webb of Australia failed to improve on
a first round 76 and is eight strokes off the lead. At last year's
British Open at sunny Sunningdale she scored a championship record
low 19 under 269 and tied the mark for the biggest winning margin,
eight strokes.

UN investigating staffers who lost trust of high commissioner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency, under fire from
reports accusing it of financial mismanagement, is investigating
staffers who ``don't deserve the trust'' of the agency's
leadership, a U.N. spokesman said Friday.
	   Spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt wouldn't name the staffers or say
what they were being investigated for. No one has been suspended
pending the investigation, but he said such action is possible.
	   Beginning last month, the London-based Financial Times reported
that its research and an independent auditors' report highlighted
``serious failings'' in UNHCR's financial management that cost
millions of dollars in wasted spending. The report alleged
management incompetence, dubious accounting and possibly fraud.
	   The newspaper accused UNHCR staffers in Bosnia of bloating
expense reports and staffers in Africa of failing to refund aid
money disbursed but not spent.
	   ``Those people don't deserve _ because of their actions _ the
trust of the high commissioner,'' Brandt said.
	   After the investigations are completed, ``whatever correctives
are required will be introduced and will be made,'' he said.
	   He repeated that Secretary-General Kofi Annan had full
confidence in UNHCR chief Sadako Ogata of Japan.

Tajiks say arrests expected in killings of U.N. observers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Officials in Tajikistan said Friday they have
identified the killers of three United Nations observers and are
trying to arrest them.
	   Tajik Vice Premier Abdurakhmon Azimov made the comments to
Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Takemi, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Takemi and two others Japanese officials were in the former
Soviet republic in Central Asia seeking information about the
investigation into the killings.
	   Three U.N. military observers and their Tajik translator were
shot at point-blank range while on patrol in eastern Tajikistan in
July.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the killings, but Tajik
President Emomali Rakhmonov has called the killers ``traitors'' of
the Tajik people and suggested opposition fighters were involved.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor
last year's peace deal that ended five years of civil war.

West Indies confident facing South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CRAIG COZIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ West Indies cricket selectors
chairman Mike Findlay said Friday his team's success against
England four months ago should give it confidence ahead of a winter
tour of South Africa.
	   ``We are encouraged by the success of the team which defeated
England in both the test and one-day international series here in
the Caribbean earlier this year,'' Findlay said after announcing
the 16-member squad to tour South Africa from November.
	   ``Those successes have since been magnified with England's
defeat of South Africa last week.''
	   The West Indies beat England 3-1 in the six-test series and 4-1
in the limited-overs contest in April, while England bounced back
to beat South Africa 2-1 in their five-test series last week.
	   ``That result has placed the forthcoming West Indies vs. South
Africa series in greater focus,'' Findlay added. ``With the West
Indies scheduled to oppose Australia at home early in 1999, and the
World Cup to be played in England from May next year, the nine
months between October this year and June 1999 could be a very
exciting period for West Indies cricket.''
	   But Findlay also warned of a current drought of talent.
	   ``We have selected what, in our opinion, are the best possible
teams having given very careful consideration to the ability,
performance, discipline, attitude and commitment of the available
talent, which appears to be dwindling in quality,'' he said.
	   The West Indies will compete in the ICC Knockout Tournament in
Bangladesh in late October before beginning their five-Test tour of
South Africa on Nov. 10.

	   Key figures and groups involved in Congo's unrest:
	   _President Laurent Kabila: Swept to power last year after his
forces toppled longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Relied on
Rwandan Tutsi soldiers and Banyamulenge Tutsis for support during
the rebellion. Now accuses Rwanda and its Ugandan allies of trying
to oust him.
	   _Rwandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame: Widely
believed to be responsible for masterminding the rebellion that put
Kabila in power.
	   _Banyamulenge ethnic group: Congolese Tutsis who are among the
lead players in the current uprising. Based predominantly in the
east, they are closely tied to Rwandan Tutsis.
	   _Rwandan Tutsis: Ethnic group leading Rwanda's government.
Kabila ordered all Rwandan soldiers out of the country last month,
setting the stage for the latest rebellion.
	   _ Jean-Pierre Ondekane: Chief rebel commander. Served in the
armed forces under Mobutu but later switched sides and fought for
Kabila, who appointed him head of the country's largest brigade two
months ago. He has turned against Kabila, saying the president is
corrupt and a poor leader.
	   _Arthur Z'Ahidi Ngoma: Former UNESCO official and veteran
opposition politician briefly jailed by Kabila's government.
Reportedly chosen as a leader by rebels and opposition politicians
in the eastern town of Goma.
	   _Rwandan Col. James Kabari: Rwandan officer who helped Kabila's
forces to power, he became Congo's army chief of staff until Kabila
replaced him last month. Kabari, also known as Kabarere, is accused
of hijacking a plane earlier this month to open a second rebel
front in western Congo.

China confronted on Tibet at meeting on religious freedom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ China told an international conference
Friday that Tibetan Buddhists have full religious freedom, but the
claim was harshly denounced by a Tibetan activist.
	   After having assured the conference that Buddhists enjoy full
religious freedom in Tibet, the Chinese delegation was confronted
by 23-year-old Tenzin Chokey who claimed Buddhist monks are being
forced into exile.
	   Chokey said Chinese ``re-education groups'' travel around Tibet
visiting buddhist monasteries to demand that monks and nuns
renounce the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader.
	   ``I ask: Is it freedom of religion when somebody decides for me
who my spiritual leader is to be?'' Chokey said, according to the
Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   About 200 Jews, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and
representatives of other major religions are taking part in the
four-day conference.
	   Before the conference it was agreed that the Tibetans would not
be able to take the rostrum, a decision that one of the leaders of
the official Chinese buddhist organization, Hai Jing, commended in
his speech.
	   But after the Chinese speech, the chairman, Oslo's Lutheran
bishop Gunnar Staalsett, asked Chokey to present her version.
	   Chokey also demanded to know what has happened to the 6-year-old
boy whom the Dalai Lama appointed in 1995 to be the 11th Panchen
Lama - the second-most important Tibetan religious leader.
	   The boy disappeared without a trace a few days after he was
appointed, and half a year later China appointed another Panchen
Lama without consulting with Dalai Lama.

	   IRAKLION, Greece (AP) _ Four British tourists accused of posing
semi-naked at Crete's ancient Minoan palace received seven- and
10-month prison terms Friday, media reports said.
	   The four, identified as Shiva Mahalingam and Mit Kopeha, both
22, Daniel Maher, 26, and Vimal Patel, 23, were arrested Thursday
afternoon in King Minos's palace at the archaeological site of
Knossos on charges of ``causing a scandal by engaging in obscene
acts,'' the television reports said. No home towns were available.
	   Two pulled their trousers down and flashed their buttocks in an
ancient palace believed to have belonged to King Minos, while
another took photographs.
	   Several television channels, including the privately owned Mega
channel, showed photos of the two men standing on columnd with
their backs to the camera and their pants pulled down.
	   The reports did not specify which two committed the act.
	   Dating from 2600-1100 B.C., the Minoan civilization gave rise to
the myth of the Minotaur. According to the legend, Minos, king of
Knossos, kept the Minotaur, a creature which was half human, half
bull, in a labyrinth. The creature devoured youths and virgins
brought as tributes until it was slayed by the mythical hero
Theseus.
	   The tourists told the court in Iraklion that they regretted
their actions, describing them as a prank. ``We didn't mean to
insult anyone,'' one of the four told television reporters while
covering his face.
	   Three of the four were sentenced to 10 months in prison, while
one received a seven month term. They will appeal the sentences on
Monday, and are expected to be released after each paying bail of
200,000 drachma (dlrs 660).

Last hopes of finding mining accident survivors dashed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Fragile hopes of finding 10 men trapped
in a mining accident four weeks ago, were dashed Friday when rescue
teams drilling into the last cavern where the victims may have
taken refuge found it filled with water.
	   Alfred Zechling, spokesman for the rescue team in told the
Austria Press Agency, a camera lowered 164 meters (yards) down
through a shaft into the cavern hit against mud and water. We must
draw the conclusion, he said, that none of the victims could have
survived.
	   The 10 men were themselves part of a rescue team which was sent
into the mine in Lassing, 190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of
Vienna, on July 17 when a landslide buried their colleague, Georg
Hainzl. But a second, stronger mudslide trapped them in the
collapsed mine, too and officials declared there was no chance
anyone survived.
	   On July 26, however, Hainzl was found alive and in relatively
good condition despite his ordeal. Rescue efforts intensified, but
were plagued by a series of breakdowns and equipment failures.
	   Still, residents of the small town held on to the hope that a
survivor would be found.
	   ``This hope was still there, but it was very, very slim,'' said
Zechling.
	   Late Friday, Zechling and his team telephoned each of the
victims' families to tell them it was no longer possible anyone
could have survived.

	   CLIFTON, Virginia (AP) _ Unhappy with the poor quality of a set
of plastic shelves she had bought for her school locker, Rachel
Kurtis didn't get mad. She got inventive.
	   Kurtis designed a sturdier, pre-assembled set and called it
``Lockerpal.'' The project got her a grade of A+ on her Invention
Convention school assignment. It also got her patent number
5746331.
	   Rachel, now a veteran of the entrepreneurial process at age 13,
received her patent last month. It gives her exclusive rights to
manufacture and sell her shelves in any size and with any material
for the next 20 years.
	   Five of Rachel's young friends already bought sets for dlrs 20
apiece, and her older brother got one free. She said she didn't do
any marketing while waiting for the patent.
	   ``Now, I'm probably going to blab,'' she said Sunday, thinking
about the 400 potential buyers among her fellow students at Flint
Hill School.
	   It takes about three hours for Rachel to make one set of the
shelves, which fold up and are held in place by what she calls a
``stop bar.'' She plans to stockpile them this summer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Use the information from the story to answer the following true
and false questions:
	   _____ 1. ``Lockerpal'' is a ready-to-use set of shelves that
fits inside a school locker.
	   _____ 2. Rachel Kurtis' clever invention is made of plastic.
	   _____ 3. The 13-year-old created the sturdy (well-built) locker
shelves as part of a school assignment.
	   _____ 4. It takes Rachel about three hours to build one set of
the fold-up shelves.
	   _____ 5. According to the article, the young entrepreneur
(business person) paid dlrs 20 for her patent number 5746331.
	   _____ 6. The fifth-grader's patent only allows her to construct
``Lockerpal'' in one size.
	   _____ 7. While waiting for the patent, Rachel made no effort to
sell her invention to her classmates.
	   _____ 8. The Virginia inventor has already sold dlrs 100 worth
of locker shelves to her friends.
	   _____ 9. Because Rachel's brother wrote an advertisement for
``Lockerpal,'' she gave him one free.
	   _____ 10. The Invention Convention plans to give a set of
shelves to students who earn an A on their next class project.
	   _____ BONUS: After reading the story, you can guess that it is
unusual for someone so young to be issued a patent.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CUT THE CLUTTER:
	   Imagine that you need to fit the items listed below into your
school locker. Draw a picture of the inside of the locker and
include a set of shelves. Show how you would organize the space
using your version of ``Lockerpal.'' How about adding a few hooks?

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A telephoned bomb threat forced
the evacuation of the U.S. consulate in Rio on Friday, but the call
was a hoax, diplomatic officials said.
	   ``The consulate took the appropriate measures, but there was no
bomb,'' U.S. embassy press spokesman Terry Davidson said by phone
from Brasilia, the capital.
	   An operator took the anonymous call warning that a bomb would
explode, and employees evacuated the white concrete building in
downtown Rio, a consular aide said.
	   Marine guards at the consulate searched the building and found
nothing, said the aide, who asked not to be identified. After about
an hour, employees went back to work.
	   Security has been stepped up at U.S. embassies and consulates
around the world in the wake of last week's bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania, which killed at least 257 people.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Guatemalan judge has ordered prison
terms of 30 years each for three people who led a mob to lynch five
suspected robbers last October in northern Guatemala.
	   The three _ Teresa Miranda Lopez, Bonifacio Perez Jiguan and
Jose Lopez Temaj _ were found responsible for leading local
residents to take the five men out of a jail and to a soccer field,
where they were burned alive.
	   Judge Gustavo Fuentes Escobar handed down the prison sentences
Thursday in San Marcos, 140 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of
Guatemala City.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The United States has warned Brazil that
plans to re-equip its federal police with dlrs 359 million worth of
French products without putting the contract for bid could
jeopardize U.S. investments in this country.
	   The warning is contained in a May 19 letter from the U.S.
Department of Commerce published Friday by the Folha de Sao Paulo
newspaper, which reported that Brazil is planning to buy
French-made products ranging from helicopters to calculators.
	   Signed by David L. Aaron, Under Secretary for International
Trade, the letter said that perceptions that Brazil would
``conclude contracts with French suppliers ... without an
international tender process.
	   ``Such perceptions complicate our mutual efforts to encourage
U.S. companies to invest in Brazil,'' the letter added.
	   The U.S. Embassy confirmed the authenticity of the letter but
refrained from further comment.
	   Brazil's Justice Ministry, to which the Federal Police is
subordinated, was not available for immediate comment.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Seven former Guatemalan rebels who spent 7
1/2 years in Mexican prisons on weapons charges asked a court
Friday to pardon them from serving the remainder of their terms.
	   The former rebels of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary
Unity, known by its Spanish acronym URNG, left Mexico in July to
complete their sentences in Guatemala.
	   Lawyer Hector Aqueche, however, told a Guatemala City appeals
court on Friday that his clients are eligible for amnesty under the
1996 National Reconciliation law enacted at the end of Guatemala's
36-year civil war.
	   Mexican authorities arrested the men in October 1992 on charges
of carrying illegal weapons into Mexico. They were ordered to serve
10 to 17 years in prison.
	   Since returning to Guatemala, the men have been at a private
health center for medical care.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Children playing in the streets of Juarez
reported a sickening smell coming from a parked car, where police
then found the bodies of three men _ apparently victims of a drug
battle in the U.S.-Mexico border city, media reported Friday.
	   The car, a black 1998 Ford Thunderbird without license plates,
had been parked for about three days.
	   The body of Daniel Ramirez Rodriguez, 39, a rancher from Morelos
state, and two other men were discovered Thursday. They apparently
had been tortured and strangled to death, Mexico City newspapers
reported.
	   With the deaths, there have been at least 25 murders this year
in Juarez, an industrial city of just over 1 million people across
from El Paso, Texas.
	   Police say most of the slayings are connected to the drug trade
which flourishes along the border.
	   Last week, the bodies of four men who had been installing radio
communications equipment for the state attorney general's office
were found along roads near Juarez. There have been no arrests in
the case.

Britain advises nationals to leave Congo

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Ministry of Defense saying it has put commando unit on
standby graf 4

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Foreign Office on Friday urged all British
subjects to leave the Congo immediately.
	   ``Some cargo and commercial flights are still operating. British
nationals should contact our embassy immediately to seek advice on
departure arrangements,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   ``Our embassy remains open at present but cannot guarantee the
safety of British nationals.''
	   As part of ``prudent contingency planning,'' the Ministry of
Defense said Friday it had put a commando company based in
southwest England on immediate notice to leave for the British
military base on Ascension Island in the mid-Atlantic in readiness
for a possible evacuation of British nationals out of the Congo.

Rebel commander says little resistance to his rebellion

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Less than two months after President Laurent
Kabila named him to lead Congo's most important brigade,
Jean-Pierre Ondekane turned his troops against his
commander-in-chief.
	   It took the 36-year-old Ondekane only two weeks to mastermind
the takeover of eastern Congo, then airlift rebel troops more than
1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) across the vast nation in a pincer
movement against the capital, Kinshasa.
	   ``We're meeting very little resistance,'' said the easygoing
rebel commander, veteran of the rebellion that toppled longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and put Kabila in power.
	   ``Last time, we went from Goma to Kinshasa on foot. This time,
we fly.''
	   The October 1996-May 1997 rebellion in the former Zaire mustered
widespread popular support because of the general disgust over
three decades of Mobutu's nepotism, corruption and despotic rule.
	   This time, most of the support comes from disgruntled soldiers
and officers, and the movement looks more like a coup than a
rebellion. Civilians don't appear to be involved, the military is
in control and Congolese citizens are ambivalent about its success.
	   Ondekane, a solidly built soldier, says he he had no plans to
take power, unlike Kabila, who tried throughout the 1970s to
overthrow the government.
	   ``I have no political ambitions. I'm a military man, and I will
remain a military man,'' he said. ``There will be elections after
we liberate the country. We don't want a dictatorship any longer.''
	   In addition to the 16,130 men Ondekane commanded in the 10th
Brigade, another 15,000 have pledged their loyalty to the
rebellion. The commander said he can also count on the support of
30,000 Mai-Mai warriors from tribes in northeastern Congo.
	   Ondekane doesn't fit the image of a Congolese military man. He
is a devout Protestant in a country of mostly Roman Catholics and
followers of traditional religions. He has a penchant for playing
pool, doesn't drink and is a stickler for discipline.
	   The rebels are former soldiers and officers of the Zairean Armed
Forces who, like Ondekane, once served under Mobutu but now feel
marginalized and let down by Kabila.
	   ``Kabila mistook the state for his family business,'' Ondekane
said. ``He put his brother in-law to head the army. His son (Joseph
Kabila) is supposed to be our commander, although he never served
in the army.''
	   ``Since the liberation two years ago, this army never ate
breakfast,'' the solidy built soldier said. ``I've taken in people
who had been abandoned for eight months; I clothed them, I armed
them, and now they're heading toward Kinshasa.''
	   He did not answer questions about where he got the money to feed
and pay them.
	   Rwanda, although it strongly denies any involvement in the
revolt, is believed to be providing some troops and logistical
support.
	   Many of the latest rebels are soldiers who fought against
Kabila's forces. After Kabila defeated them, they retreated into
the forests of the northeastern Masisi region until they were
summoned to fight Kabila once more.
	   A short distance outside Goma in the foothills of volcanic
mountains, 900 men from the 108th Ngongo Battalion broke into
cheers as Ondekane lectured them in Swahili before they took off
for Matadi, Congo's principal port, which is located southwest of
Kinshasa.
	   Ondekane said his troops include ethnic Tutsis from eastern Kivu
region as well as members of tribes from Eastern Kasai and Katanga
regions. Kabila is from Katanga; Ondekane is from Equatoria region,
which was Mobutu's home. His officers are mostly older men who
served under Mobutu.
	   Most still wear their faded old camouflage uniforms.
	   While the rebellion against Mobutu attracted young fighters, the
revolt against Kabila is drawing more seasoned soldiers.
	   Ondekane rose through the ranks in Katanga region and became a
company commander in Fizi on Lake Tanganyika.
	   During the last rebellion he was based in Lubumbashi, where he
was in charge of logistics. The unit he commanded captured
Kinshasa's Ndolo airport in April 1997, bringing the rebellion to
an end.
	   ``We're not fighting to take power, we're fighting to liberate
the country,'' he said. ``We're soldiers, not politicians.''

Champion Lens held 1-1; Lyon hits Toulouse for six
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Defending champion Lens continued its poor start to
the new season, only managing a 1-1 draw against newly-promoted
Lorient on Friday. In other action, Lyon thrashed Toulouse 6-1.
	   Lens, who will represent France this year in the Champions'
League after surprisingly winning the title last season, started
the match positively, but left alarming gaps at the back and
Lorient hit the post after just one minute.
	   Lens opened the scoring after 39 minutes when Stephane Dalmat
latched onto a loose ball and curled a shot into the corner of the
net from the edge of the area for his second goal of the season.
	   But the lead was short-lived, with Ali Bouafia scoring after 51
minutes after finding space between two defenders and slotting home
from 10 meters (yards).
	   Lens has now played two matches and only picked up one point,
after losing the season opener last week against Toulouse.
	   However, Toulouse's winning streak came to an end in emphatic
style with a 6-1 mauling by Lyon, who scored five goals in the
second half.
	   Alain Caveglia scored twice, and Marco Grassi, Frederic Kanoute,
Jacek Bak and Kash Dhorasoo were also on target. Vladimir Petrovic
got a late consolation goal for the visitors.
	   Lyon dominated the match with midfield playmaker Vikash Dhorasoo
particularly impressive. Although the home side was only one goal
up at half-time, the score was put beyond doubt with two goals
within three minutes of the re-start.
	   The result sent Lyon to the top of the standings, with four
points.
	   The remaining matches of the second round will be played
Saturday.

China confronted on Tibet at meeting on religious freedom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ China told an international conference
Friday that Tibetan Buddhists have full religious freedom, but the
claim was harshly denounced by a Tibetan activist.
	   After having assured the conference that Buddhists enjoy full
religious freedom in Tibet, the Chinese delegation was confronted
by 23-year-old Tenzin Chokey, who claimed Buddhist monks are being
forced into exile.
	   Chokey said Chinese ``re-education groups'' travel around Tibet
visiting Buddhist monasteries to demand that monks and nuns
renounce the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader.
	   ``I ask: Is it freedom of religion when somebody decides for me
who my spiritual leader is to be?'' Chokey said, according to the
Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   About 200 Jews, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and
representatives of other religions are taking part in the four-day
conference.
	   Before the conference it was agreed that the Tibetans would not
be able to take the rostrum, a decision that one of the leaders of
the official Chinese buddhist organization, Hai Jing, commended in
his speech.
	   But after the Chinese speech, the chairman, Oslo's Lutheran
bishop Gunnar Staalsett, asked Chokey to present her version.
	   Chokey also demanded to know what has happened to the 6-year-old
boy whom the Dalai Lama appointed in 1995 to be the 11th Panchen
Lama _ the second-most important Tibetan religious leader.
	   The boy disappeared without a trace a few days after he was
appointed, and half a year later China appointed another Panchen
Lama without consulting with Dalai Lama.

Major lessons for Woods at PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Woods opening play &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Tiger Woods was still on the practice
green when his lead evaporated Friday in the PGA Championship.
	   Vijay Singh made five birdies on the front side to shoot a 30
and take temporary possession of the lead under ideal conditions at
Sahalee Country Club.
	   Woods, who shot a 66 on Thursday, was still an hour away from
teeing off in the second round when Singh sank a birdie putt on the
ninth hole to move to 5-under for the tournament, a stroke ahead of
Woods. Sing was still at 5-under through 15 holes.
	   Once he started play, Woods had a good chance to get to 5-under
himself but missed a 5-footer (1.5 meters) for birdie on the second
hole to remain a shot back.
	   Another stroke back was Colin Montgomerie, who had a shot at
matching the course record Woods set the day before but had to
settle for a 67 after making bogey on the 18th hole from the rough.
	   Steve Elkington, the 1995 champion, was at 2-under-138 after his
second straight 69.
	   Woods showed Thursday he learned that one round doesn't make a
tournament, refusing to get too excited even after shooting 66 to
take a two-stroke lead over eight others after the first round.
	   With perfect weather continuing Friday and birdies beginning to
come in bunches at tree-lined Sahalee, it appeared Woods had the
right attitude.
	   ``I'm not going to put any more pressure on myself because I am
near the lead right now,'' Woods said. ``With three days to go,
it's an eternity. You just have to go out there and hold your own
for three more days.''
	   Woods did more than hold his own on opening day under the
towering trees. With the driver stuck firmly in his bag, he turned
to his putter to sink six putts of 15 feet (4 1/2 meters) or
longer.
	   By his own admission, it wasn't a great ball-striking day. But
with only 27 putts needed to navigate the slick greens of Sahalee,
the irons can be a little off.
	   After a bogey on the first hole and an adventurous iron shot on
the second, it seemed almost easy for Woods, who capped his round
with a 35-foot downhiller for birdie on the par-3 17th.
	   Not far from his mind where the lessons learned at last month's
British Open, where after leading with a 65 in the first round he
followed with a 77.
	   ``I know how difficult it is to win a major,'' Woods said. ``At
Augusta I was fortunate enough to play 63 straight holes where my
game was pretty much right on. And it was _ trust me _ a lot of
fun. But it has taught me how difficult it is to win.''
	   On a day when several players made a run at the lead, only to
fall back on the back nine, Woods posted his score before many in
the 150-player field had even teed off.
	   By the time they struggled in, there were eight golfers at 68,
including Glen Day, who was 5-under at one point before taking a
double bogey on the par-4 15th.
	   ``They don't pay you for leading on Thursday,'' Day said.
	   Among those clustered two shots back was Billy Andrade, the
ninth alternate who got in only after Steve Jones withdrew
following the sudden death of a close friend. Also at 68 was Paul
Azinger and Craig Stadler, who was at 3-under before three-putting
the final hole.
	   Masters and British Open winner Mark O'Meara, trying to become
the first to win three majors since Ben Hogan 45 years ago, bogeyed
two of the first three holes before recovering for a 69 that left
him three back.
	   ``I kept myself in the ball game,'' O'Meara said. ``I saw on the
leaderboard that Tiger shot 4-under and had a super round. But I
expected him to play well.''
	   With just the hint of a breeze wafting through the firs and
cedars that line the fairways of the course, conditions couldn't
have been any better.
	   ``Since the greens are so perfect, you just need to set the ball
on the line,'' Woods said. ``It's going to go in the hole and you
start walking.''
	   However, not everyone thrived.
	   John Daly took a triple-bogey 7 on the final hole to shoot 80,
while David Duval and U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen both had 76s.
	   Woods, who has won only once in the United States this year,
didn't look like much like a contender when he pushed a 2-iron off
the first tee into the right rough, then hacked an 8-iron out to
make bogey.

Steroids used for asthma and allergy relief may slow growth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of children with asthma
and allergies find relief, even lifesaving treatment, from inhaled
steroids. Now studies are finding the drugs also may slow some
children's growth, and doctors are wrestling with what to tell
parents.
	   There's no proof that these children will be shorter adults _
their growth could catch up. Research simply hasn't lasted long
enough to tell, or to predict that even if final height is stunted,
that it would be more than, say, an inch.
	   The drugs are critical to many children _ they have
revolutionized asthma care _ so nobody wants youngsters to stop
taking them.
	   But at the urging of lung specialists, more children than ever
before are inhaling the medicines, starting at younger ages and
lasting throughout childhood. The Food and Drug Administration is
struggling with how to explain the possible side effect without
unduly alarming people. It also wants to find out exactly how big a
concern it really is.
	   ``We in no way are trying to frighten clinicians or parents,''
stressed Dr. John Jenkins, FDA's pulmonary drugs chief. The goal is
``to promote the safest use of these drugs.''
	   The FDA wants to put a warning label on the inhaled steroids,
saying they may temporarily slow children's growth, that long-term
effects aren't known, and that pediatricians should carefully chart
every child patient's growth.
	   The agency also is debating how to make manufacturers determine
the lowest effective dose of each drug, because lower doses should
mean less risk.
	   At issue are corticosteroids. They come in a pill form that, if
taken for long periods of time, is widely known to stunt growth and
cause other side effects.
	   But newer versions that are inhaled or squirted up the nose _
sold under a variety of brand names including Beconase, Flonase,
Pulmicort and Flovent _ cause fewer side effects because most of
the medicine travels straight to the lungs or nasal passages, not
through the whole body.
	   They control inflammation in patients with asthma or allergic
rhinitis. Most importantly, they can prevent damage to the airways
that worsens asthma.
	   But new studies show the medicines also can slow children's
growth, the FDA told an advisory committee of lung and growth
experts last month.
	   Children treated for a year were, on average, about half an inch
shorter than expected. A few children, more sensitive to the drugs,
were about an inch shorter, Dr. David Allen of the University of
Wisconsin told the panel.
	   Half an inch doesn't sound like much, Allen acknowledged. Once
children hit puberty, they might experience a growth surge and
catch up. But the studies didn't last long enough to tell, or to
know if years of treatment starting at early ages would slow growth
more.
	   Whether the effect is worth worrying about is controversial
among doctors.
	   Manufacturers argue it's just a short-term blip.
	   ``There's little evidence these drugs actually stunt growth,''
said Dr. Tushar Shah of Glaxo Wellcome Inc., which makes several of
the products. He said Glaxo's data show its Flovent brand may not
even cause the short-term growth loss of older competitors.
	   The FDA says there's no proof that one inhaled steroid is better
than another.

Stuttgart beats Dortmund to open Bundesliga season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ VfB Stuttgart spoiled Michael Skibbe's coaching
debut Friday by beating Borussia Dortmund 2-1 as the Bundesliga
opened its 35th season.
	   Skibbe, 32, without coaching experience at a major side, had
been a surprise choice to replace Nevio Scala and lead the 1997
Champions Cup winner back to the top.
	   But Dortmund, which fell to 10th last year, proved disorganized
on defense and harmless on offense against fellow title favorite
Stuttgart with a rebuilt lineup.
	   The Ruhr Valley team let both Jens Keller in the ninth minute
and Yugoslavian midfielder Kristijan Djordjevic in the 18th slip in
for easy short-distance goals.
	   Bachirou Salou, one of several players signed by Dortmund to
rejuvenate the side, put his club back in the game with his shot
six minutes before the half.
	   ``To win your opening match against a side like Dortmund is a
perfect start,'' said Winnie Schafer, who also coached his first
match for Stuttgart.
	   Salou's goal was one of the few chances earned by Dortmund,
although the lineup can call on both of the playmakers on Germany's
national team, Andy Moeller and Thomas Haessler.
	   MSV Duisburg also beat Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1, dampening the
return of one of the Bundesliga's founding clubs after a year of
relegation to the second division.
	   Thomas Hoersen shot the gamewinner in the 49th minute after
failing to score in 59 matches for previous club Moenchengladbach.
	   Hoersen also set up Uwe Spies' goal in the 17th minute, while
Thomas Sobotzik seized on a defender's mistake to equalize eight
minutes later.
	   There are six games scheduled for Saturday, led by VfL Wolfsburg
against Bayern Munich, the almost unanimious choice among the
league's coaches to sweep the title.

Greenpeace appeals to Mexico to block radioactive waste dump in

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ On the 15th anniversary of a treaty
protecting the Mexico-U.S. border, an international environmental
group asked Mexico's president to help block the construction of a
radioactive waste dump in Texas only 20 miles (30 kilometers) from
Mexican soil.
	   Alejandro Calvillo, director of Greenpeace Mexico, said Friday
that the proposed Sierra Blanca low-level waste dump is exactly the
kind of project that former U.S. President Ronald Reagan and
Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid intended to prevent when they
signed the treaty on Aug. 14, 1983.
	   ``If this accord is violated we could have an avalanche of
similar projects,'' Calvillo said at the gates of the presidential
residence, where he delivered a letter addressed to President
Ernesto Zedillo. ``And this could be the end of many other accords,
too.''
	   The secretary of the environment, who speaks for the president
on the Sierra Blanca matter, has said Mexico opposes the proposed
dump and has sent a diplomatic letter to Washington urging the
federal government to intervene and block the plans. There was no
new comment Friday.
	   The 1983 treaty protects a zone stretching 60 miles (100
kilometers) on either side of the U.S.-Mexican border, committing
both governments to avoid projects that affect the other side of
the border.
	   Sierra Blanca was proposed as a dump site for low-level
radioactive waste from dismantled nuclear power plants, factories,
hospitals and universities. The 500-acre (200- hectare) site would
hold 1.8 million cubic feet (0.5 million cubic meters) of waste for
30 years.
	   On July 29, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure
letting Maine and Vermont ship low-level radioactive waste to the
dump site in exchange for payments of dlrs 25 million each to
Texas. The Senate and President Bill Clinton also need to approve
before the measure becomes law.
	   Calvillo said the dangers of the dump would extend into northern
Mexico, putting Mexicans along the border at higher risk for
cancer. He also said a geological fault line runs through the area,
making the dump site prone to earthquakes.
	   He called the proposal ``environmental racism,'' saying the site
was chosen because the only people who live in the area are poor
Mexican immigrants who have little political or economic clout.
	   ``This is discriminatory politics,'' he said, ``with waste from
the Canadian border being sent down to the Mexican border.''

Jamaica advances to second round by defeating Guatemala
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARACAIBO, Venezuela (AP) _ Jamaica advanced to the second round
of soccer competition at the Central American and Caribbean Games
with a 4-0 victory over Guatemala Friday.
	   Winston Griffiths scored at 6 and 37 minutes, Damion Powell at
20 and Ray Powell at 38 to ensure the victory.
	   The Jamaicans took advantage of hot mid-day temperatures that
affected the Guatemalans.
	   A Guatemalan coach complained about the scheduling.
	   ``I am not asking for an advantage, but nor do I want my rivals
to have one,'' said Daniel Romeo, whose team played a few minutes
after noon, when temperatures surpassed 40 degrees Celsius (105
degrees F).
	   ``The Colombia and Venezuela teams played at night and Guatemala
had the torture of the heat and the change of site. We traveled in
a bus with no air conditioning. It's not fair,'' said Romeo.
	   Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago advanced from Group A and
Mexico and El Salvador advanced from Group C.
	   In Group B, Jamaica finished the round with six points. Costa
Rica has already qualified for the second round with six points
after two games and still faces Colombia, which has yet to gain a
point.
	   The two best third-place teams will also advance to the next
round, which begins Sunday.

Last hopes of finding mining accident survivors dashed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The last hope of finding 10 men trapped
in a mining accident four weeks ago were dashed Friday when rescue
teams found the last cavern where the victims may have taken refuge
instead filled with water.
	   Alfred Zechling, spokesman for the rescue team told the Austria
Press Agency that a camera lowered 165 meters (180 yards) through a
shaft into the cavern hit mud and water. We must draw the
conclusion, he said, that none of the victims could have survived.
	   The 10 men were themselves part of a rescue team sent into the
mine in Lassing, 190 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Vienna, on
July 17 after a landslide buried their colleague, Georg Hainzl. But
a second, stronger mudslide trapped them in the collapsed mine, too
and officials declared there was no chance that anyone had
survived.
	   On July 26, however, Hainzl was found alive and in relatively
good condition despite his ordeal. Rescue efforts intensified, but
were plagued by a series of breakdowns and equipment failures.
	   Still, residents of the small town held on to the hope that a
survivor would be found.
	   ``This hope was still there, but it was very, very slim,'' said
Zechling.
	   Late Friday, Zechling and his team telephoned each of the
victims' families to tell them it was no longer possible anyone
could have survived.

Canada's Commonwealth Games Association apologizes for French

slight &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The Commonwealth Games Association of Canada
officially apologized Friday _ in both official languages _ for
holding an English-only news conference to announce Canada's team
for the upcoming Commonwealth Games.
	   The gaffe occurred Thursday, when no French was used during a
news conference presenting swimmer Marianne Limpert as Canada's
flagbearer for the Games next month in Malaysia.
	   ``It was a mistake and we apologize,'' chef de mission Margie
Schuett said in a written statement. ``It will not happen again.''
	   The Canadian Olympic Association was criticized for a similar
language faux pas at a team function prior to the start of the
Winter Olympics in Nagano.
	   While most of the anglophone media ignored the latest slight,
French-language newspapers in Ontario and Quebec gave the story
prominent play.
	   ``Forgotten Again,'' read a headline on the front page of
Montreal's La Presse sports section.
	   Canada is sending 277 athletes to compete in 18 sports for the
Sept. 11-21 Games in Kuala Lumpur.

until sanctions relief in sight and charging that newspaper report
shows Washington has too much influence over UN inspectors; EDITS

 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A report that the United States persuaded
the chief U.N. weapons inspector to suspend surprise searches in
Iraq is proof that Washington has too much influence over the
inspection program, Iraq's U.N. ambassador said Friday.
	   ``This is why Iraq has requested in the past ... that there
should be a major change in the whole infrastructure,'' of the U.N.
Special Commission, Nizar Hamdoon said in an interview with CNN.
	   His comments came as the United States and UNSCOM disputed a
report in The Washington Post that said that U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright persuaded UNSCOM chief Richard Butler to
halt surprise searches because Washington wanted to avoid a new
crisis with Baghdad.
	   The report fueled Iraqi claims that Butler was acting as
Washington's puppet. If true, it also would indicate that
Washington thought as recently as this month that it didn't have
enough support in the U.N. Security Council for a strong reaction
in the event of a renewed confrontation over inspections.
	   The council's reaction to the latest crisis with Iraq _
Baghdad's Aug. 5 decision to freeze cooperation with the United
Nations _ has been relatively muted. The wait-and-see approach is
seen as an apparent attempt to force Baghdad to make the next move
while allowing the United States and Britain time to muster more
support for a harder line.
	   Council members are also awaiting the outcome of meetings in
Baghdad between the U.N. chief's envoy, Prakash Shah, and Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. In a meeting Thursday, Shah urged Aziz
to cooperate with inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has
destroyed its banned weapons before sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, which prevent Iraq from freely selling its oil,
were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Hamdoon said U.N. weapons experts won't be allowed to conduct
searches in Iraq until Baghdad sees speedy work towards the lifting
of sanctions.
	   ``Unless we are convinced about that I don't see why and how
Iraq will be changing its position,'' Hamdoon said. ``The
cooperation on the inspections will resume only when Iraq's demands
are met.''

Not speaking English can be illegal
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Not speaking English in America can be
inconvenient. But a Cuban-born truck driver had no idea driving and
not speaking English could be illegal.
	   ``I'm stunned. I got a ticket for not speaking English,'' said
Spanish-speaking trucker Rogelio Campos on Friday. He was at the
wheel of a dump truck in Westchester County when he was issued the
summons last month.
	   The 61-year-old driver must now appear in court to answer the
charge _ through a translator.
	   A police officer stopped him July 16 at an intersection in
Yonkers and handed him the ticket, citing an obscure federal
regulation requiring drivers of some commercial vehicles to ``read
and speak the English language sufficiently.''
	   ``I got my commercial driver's license after passing a test in
Spanish, and now they say I can't drive because I don't speak
English?'' he asked, speaking in Spanish from a cell phone in his
truck at a construction site in Rye, New York.
	   However, while written state tests are given in foreign
languages, Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations requires
language proficiency. The regulation applies to drivers of trucks
weighing more than 10,000 pounds (4,550 kilos), including hazardous
material carters and buses, according to the Federal Highway
Administration in Washington.
	   The rarely enforced code is meant to insure that drivers of
potentially dangerous vehicles ``can read road signs, and respond
to officials,'' said David Goettee, an agency transportation
specialist.
	   Fernando Mateo, vice president of San Mateo Construction, of
Irvington, New York, which has employed Campos for five years, said
he was in ``a 22-foot (6.6-meter) truck carrying stones _ broken
cement from the sidewalks we repair.''
	   And he's still driving the 12,000-pound (5,450-kilo) truck.
	   ``It's unconstitutional to fire a man for not speaking
English,'' insists Mateo.
	   Campos, who immigrated to the United States from Cuba in 1984
and speaks broken English, agreed: ``That's discrimination.''
	   His case has drawn the attention of Rep. Jose Serrano, D-Bronx,
who plans to lobby members of Congress to try to repeal the law.
	   ``This is the classic immigrant story, a man works hard and pays
taxes _ and you give him a ticket because he can't converse to the
extent you want him to?''
	   Under the same law, the state of Utah is planning to crack down
on Polish-speaking truck drivers, said Goettee, who conceded that
it's a touchy issue.
	   ``What is the balance between public safety and personal
equity?'' he asked. ``It's not an easy subject in a multi-ethnic
society.''
	   Officer Chris Melvin of the Yonkers police had stopped Campos'
truck because the vehicle did not display markings identifying the
company name _ which is also a violation of the law.
	   Campos was also issued a summons for not being able to produce a
``medical'' card proving he was fit to drive a large vehicle.
	   He is to appear in Yonkers city court on Sept. 9 to answer the
charges, punishable by fines to be determined by a judge.
	   The immigrant will bring along the summons on which the officer
had scribbled: ``Unable to speak English.''

<TEXT>
	   MARACAIBO, Venezuela (AP) _ The Puerto Rico men's team and the
Dominican Republic women's team posted easy victories Friday in the
basketball tournament at the Central American and Caribbean Games.
	   Puerto Rico remained unbeaten after two games by rolling over
Barbados 91-68. In the women's division, the Dominican Republic
defeated Honduras 92-60.
	   The Puerto Rico men were led by 18 points each from Cristian
Dalmau and Fernando Ortiz, dominating the second half.
	   ``We are going to surprise those in Puerto Rico who say this is
a poor team that's no good,'' said Puerto Rico coach Raymond
Dalmau. ``I believe we have a good group.''
	   In another game Friday, the U.S. Virgin Islands defeated
Honduras 69-58, virtually eliminating Honduras, which now has three
losses. Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands meet Saturday.
	   The Dominican women improved their mark to 4-1 with their win
and will play for a gold medal against Cuba.

Egyptian exile says Albanians have arrested a 5th militant

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Albanian authorities have detained
another alleged Egyptian militant and may have already repatriated
him, a leading Egyptian exile said in London Friday.
	   In Tirana, the Albanian police said they had not arrested such a
person.
	   ``Ahmed Ismail Osman was arrested yesterday as he was walking in
a street in Tirana,'' Yasser Tawfiq el-Siri told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview. El-Siri heads the Islamic
Observation Center in London.
	   The Albanian authorities reportedly arrested four alleged
Egyptian militants in June and deported them to Egypt.
	   El-Siri told the AP that his organization fears that Osman, 32,
who is married to an Albanian woman and has a son, has already been
handed over to the Egyptian authorities.
	   El-Siri said Osman was sentenced to death in absentia by an
Egyptian military court for taking part in 1993 attempted
assassination of then Prime Minister Atef Sedki.
	   El-Siri himself was sentenced to death in absentia in the same
trial.
	   El-Siri said his group has appealed to Amnesty International,
Human Rights Watch and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to
prevent Osman's deportation.
	   Earlier this month, the London-based Arabic-language newspaper
Al-Hayat published a letter from a group calling itself the
International Islamic Front for Jihad. The letter vowed to avenge
the deportation of the four alleged militants to Egypt and accused
the United States of assisting their return to Cairo.
	   The next day car-bombs exploded outside the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania, killing 257 people and injuring about 5,000.
The timing led to speculation that the letter and bombings were
linked, but no tie has been established.
	   Egypt has neither commented on the reported repatriations nor
confirmed that the four are in its custody.
	   Albania too has made no official comment on the case. But
Albanian sources told the AP in Tirana that the four alleged
militants had been spirited out of the country by U.S. agents.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the sources said the four
men were wanted for the 1993 assassination of Rifaat el-Mahgoub,
the speaker of the Egyptian parliament, and an abortive attempt to
blow up the Khan el-Khalili market in Cairo several years later.

Brash strategy drives Daly from PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNE H. FREEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Wash. (AP) _ John Daly doesn't care if he's staring at
a forest of fir trees or a fairway barely wide enough to make a
good bike trail.
	   He wants to use his driver.
	   And he promised to give his driver a big workout during the PGA
Championship at tight and testy Salahee Country Club.
	   Big mistake. The woods have echoed with the sounds of caroming
golf balls.
	   Daly, who failed to make the cut at 12-over-par 152 on Friday,
wouldn't discuss his brash but foolish strategy. For two days he
turned down requests for an explanation.
	   Partner Wayne Grady said Daly was playing as if he were on an
open course with fairways 60 yards (55 meters) wide.
	   ``No man can play a course like this the way he is playing it,''
Grady said. ``He had no chance. It's obviously not the way to play
around here. It's impossible.''
	   Daly can't even be trusted when he says he he'll keep his driver
in the bag. He said he'd do that at the U.S. Open at tight Olympic
Club in San Francisco. Then he went out and sprayed drives all over
and finished 53rd.
	   Daly had an adventuresome 10-over 80 on his opening round at
Sahalee, including a triple-bogey 7 on the last hole for a 41 on
the back nine. He finished with a 72 on the second day of forsaking
prudent play.
	   The crowd is with Daly, no matter the damage to the trees.
	   ``Go, John, give it a rip,'' a spectator yelled.
	   Playing partner Al Geiberger called it a ``reckless game.'' He
said ``fans want him to go far it but they have no clue.''
	   What's fun for the spectator can hurt Daly's chances for winning
tournaments. He has missed six cuts and been disqualified once this
year. He shot 6-over at the Masters, 17-over at the U.S. Open and
11-over at the British Open. He has tied for fourth twice in two
PGA Tour tournaments.
	   More is expected from the 32-year-old who won the 1991 PGA
Championship and the 1995 British Open.
	   Daly, a self-admitted alcoholic, has been sober for 17 months.
But he has yet to rid himself of another addiction _ his driver.
	   He won't leave it in the closet when the fairways or ``firways'
as they call them at the PGA, are about as wide as a closet.
	   Big-hitter Tiger Woods finally got the message. He's been using
irons off the tees this week and the results speak volumes on the
way this exacting course should be played.
	   Is Daly happy playing poorly but giving the crowd 300-yard
(275-meter) thrills?
	   He didn't look happy Friday as he chain-smoked and drank diet
soda. Daly's weight has soared, his midrift hanging over his belt.
He barely acknowledged the adoring crowd, giving a half-hearted
hand wave.
	   ``The way he plays makes it fun for the fans,'' Geiberger said.
``But it looked like he got disinterested after he made a few
bogeys.''
	   For this tournament, Daly gave away his titanium head driver to
a spectator during a practice round and brought out a new Calloway
steel head driver, which won't be on the market until October.
	   ``Believe it or not, but I hit the steel head farther,'' Daly
said on Wednesday, when he was willing to talk about the new
Galloway product. ``I'm hitting it so good I plan to hit it on
every hole this week.''
	   No driver was made for Sahalee. And Daly again paid for not
accepting that fact.

Tyson's turnabout leaves New Jersey bewildered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Friday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Unpredictable Mike Tyson once
again has left the boxing world bewildered.
	   This time, it's because of a surprising last-minute decision to
give up his bid for a New Jersey boxing license in favor of
returning to Nevada.
	   The Star-Ledger of Newark, citing unidentified sources, said
state Athletic Control Board members were leaning toward denying
Tyson a license, so he withdrew his application the night before
the vote.
	   The 32-year-old Tyson hasn't fought since biting Evander
Holyfield's ears during a title fight at Las Vegas last year.
Nevada regulators revoked his license and fined him dlrs 3 million,
leaving him eligible to apply for a new license after a year.
	   But he chose to apply in New Jersey instead, prompting criticism
from many boxing people who said he should have returned to the
scene of the bite to seek his redemption.
	   The Athletic Control Board heard more than three hours of
testimony from Tyson and his supporters July 29, but delayed a
decision. They were to render one Friday, but Tyson's lawyer
announced late Thursday that he had withdrawn the application and
would seek a Nevada license.
	   ``We were in shock. No one here has any idea why he did what he
did,'' said Donald Tremblay, a publicist for boxing promoter Main
Events.
	   The Star-Ledger reported that board chairman Gerard Gormley and
board member Gary Shaw _ the two who were to vote _ were deadlocked
on whether to grant the license, and that the ``yes'' vote for
Tyson was shaky.
	   The two may have felt pressured because of anti-Tyson comments
made by Gormley's brother, state Sen. William Gormley, and another
lawmaker, the newspaper said.
	   Sen. Gormley, who said earlier in the week that Tyson shouldn't
be licensed, defended his comments Friday.
	   Asked if they might have swayed board members, he said: ``I
don't know. The whole world got to see the comments. I was asked my
opinion and I voiced it.''
	   Board members weren't available Friday. Telephone messages left
for Shaw and for Gerard Gormley at the board's office were not
returned. Shaw did not return a call to his home and Gormley's home
telephone rang unanswered.
	   Asked if it was possible that someone told Tyson's camp the
license was a longshot, a spokesman for state Attorney General
Peter Verniero said no decision had been made.
	   ``There was never a vote,'' Roger Shatzkin said. ``The vote was
scheduled for this morning. They would have deliberated, voted and
made it public in the session.''
	   For New Jersey officials, the withdrawal may have been the best
outcome to the bizarre saga.
	   On the one hand, it extricated them from publicly endorsing the
man who served a three-year prison term for rape, bit an opponent
twice and used profanity in front of regulators at a hearing. On
the other, it saved them from turning down boxing's biggest draw,
who stood to make millions _ for himself, Atlantic City casinos and
the state _ by staging his comeback fight here.
	   Gov. Christie Whitman was confident there was no leak to Tyson.
She was not ``overly excited by the thought of his fighting here,''
but didn't say so until Friday because she didn't want to prejudice
the debate.
	   As for the revenue lost from a potential Tyson fight: ``Money
isn't everything in life,'' she said.
	   As for the cross-country move, ``Coming here is the right thing
to do, and we'll have a fair hearing,'' said Marc Ratner, executive
director of the Nevada Athletic Commission. No date has been set
for a hearing in Nevada.

Tyson-Holyfield ref might have made a mistake, too
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER JR. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The referee whose action led to Mike Tyson's
banishment from boxing for biting Evander Holyfield's ears now
applauds the fighter's decision to go back to the ``scene of the
crime'' to try and get his license back.
	   ``I'll say this for Mike Tyson, he did the right thing when he
withdrew his application (to New Jersey) and went back to Nevada,''
Mills Lane said Friday. ``He should go back to Nevada and face the
music. They'll make him answer some tough questions. He's going to
have to stand there and take it.''
	   Tyson withdrew his application to New Jersey Thursday and
applied to the Nevada State Athletic Commission, which revoked his
license and fined him dlrs 3 million for his actions in the third
round of his rematch with Holyfield June 28, 1997, in the MGM Grand
at Las Vegas.
	   ``He paid a big price,'' said Lane, who signed autographs at the
Original All Star Cafe in midtown Manhattan, where he appeared to
promote his book, ``Let's Get It On,'' and his syndicated
television series, ``Judge Mills Lane,'' which debuts Monday.
	   Lane also said, ``Maybe I was wrong,'' when asked if he should
have disqualified Tyson after the former undisputed heavyweight
champion bit a piece off of Holyfield's right ear, rather than wait
until Tyson bit the left ear.
	   ``You can make a hell of a case for that,'' said Lane, a former
Nevada district attorney and district judge in Reno. ``There are
people who said I should have stopped it then. I can't say they're
wrong.''
	   Following a delay of four minutes after Tyson bit Holyfield's
right ear, the fight resumed, then Tyson was disqualified after he
bit the left ear.
	   ``It worked out for the best, he disqualified himself,'' Lane
said of Tyson messing up his chance to fight on.
	   Lane declined to comment on whether he thought Tyson would get a
license.
	   Tyson became eligible to apply for a license July 9, but he and
his advisers chose to apply in New Jersey rather than Nevada,
touching off another controversy.
	   Lane is certain of one thing. ``There's no question the bite put
me where I am now,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov reached the
semifinals of the ATP Championship Friday, beating his doubles
partner, Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic, 6-4, 6-4.
	   Kafelnikov, who is ranked 10th in the world and seeded seventh
in the tournament, improved his record against Vacek to 10-3.
	   Kafelnikov, who will face either Patrick Rafter of Australia or
Petr Korda of the Czech Republic in the semis, set the tone for his
victory by breaking Vacek's serve at love in the first game.
	   ``Once he was broken, I felt it was a lot easier,'' Kafelnikov
said. ``It definitely set the pace for myself, and it was the kind
of pace I wanted.''
	   Kafelnikov owns career records of 3-0 over Rafter and 7-2
against Korda.
	   ``It's very important when you go against an opponent to feel
like you almost can't lose,'' he said. ``It gives you some extra
confidence. You feel like if you play your regular game, you have a
good shot at winning.''
	   In another quarterfinal, Sweden's Magnus Larsson downed
compatriot Thomas Johansson 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).
	   It was Larsson's 10th consecutive win over a countryman. His
last loss to a Swede was in February 1996 to Thomas Enqvist.
	   Larsson, ranked 37th in the world, went ahead 5-4 in the first
set after Johansson, who is ranked 38th, lost his serve by
committing consecutive unforced backhand errors.
	   Larsson held serve at love to win the first set, and both
players recorded a break on the way to the second-set tiebreaker.
Larsson took a 3-2 lead on a forehand winner, followed by two
service winners to go ahead 5-2, then forced Johansson into
consecutive missed forehands to close out the match.

Reporter wounded in Kosovo undergoes emergency surgery in Tirana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A reporter critically wounded in Kosovo
was flown Friday by helicopter to Tirana where he underwent
emergency surgery, Ilir Cano, the Albanian deputy interior
minister, said.
	   The reporter was identified as Ivan Dikar, 24, and was believed
to be German, but his nationality and other details could not be
immediately clarified.
	   According to sketchy information available late Friday in the
Albanian capital, Dikar was hit by a sniper in Kosovo near the
Albanian border.
	   The reporter, said to have been in a life-threatening condition,
was loaded onto a mule and taken across the Yugoslav-Albanian
border by members of the underground Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Upon arrival in Tropoja, an Albanian town near the border, he
was flown aboard a government helicopter to Tirana, Cano said.
	   He was being operated on for serious injuries, and it was
unclear if he would survive, hospital sources were reported as
saying. No other details were released late Friday.

London gentleman's club sells Winnie's copyright to Disney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A London gentleman's club that owns the rights to
Winnie the Pooh said it agreed Friday to sell the copyright to the
Walt Disney Corp. to use for 20 years.
	   Members of the Garrick Club said that they had turned down the
chance to pocket a windfall of about 40,000 pounds (dlrs 60,000)
each from the sale, and instead decided that the money would be
split between providing for the club's upkeep, and a charitable
trust.
	   ``What we've agreed is that a charitable trust will be set up,
if this money comes through from the Disney organization,'' said
John Gale, adding, ``I can't imagine a situation where the club,
which is an honorable institution, would vote to give themselves a
windfall. I would be appalled,'' said Gale.
	   Claudia Peters, a spokesman for Disney, said that the talks over
the rights to Winnie were ``ongoing'' and refused to make any
further statement.
	   About 400 members of the central London club, established in
1831 as a meeting place for actors, writers and politicians, met to
discuss the issue lunchtime Friday. Prince Charles is one of about
1,000 members of the club, although he was not present at the
meeting.
	   Winnie's author, A.A. Milne, left the rights to the honey-loving
bear and his friends to five beneficiaries: the Garrick Club;
exclusive Westminster School; The Royal Literary Fund; his own
family and that of illustrator EH Shepard.
	   Press Association, a British news agency, reported that the Walt
Disney Corp. already owns the rights to all A.A. Milne's works and
characters until 2006, but wants to secure them a new offer until
2026. Disney currently pays each of the beneficiaries about 2
million pounds (dlrs 3.2 million) per year for using Milne's works,
Press Association said.

Clinton reviews options, all of them grim
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to add analysis tag &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QC; 
 &UR; By RON FOURNIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Political Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Tell all. Tell little. Tell nothing. Tell them
what was said before _ or tell them something new. No matter what
President Bill Clinton tells the grand jury under oath Monday, the
political and personal risks are breathtaking.
	   More than six months after promising information ``sooner rather
than later'' and two weeks after pledging to answer questions
``completely and truthfully,'' Clinton is deciding how much to
reveal about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He has many
options, none pleasant.
	   It all boils down to this: Did he have ``sexual relations'' with
Ms. Lewinsky and try to cover it up? Under oath in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case, Clinton answered no. Now prosecutors want
to know if that was perjury, and whether he tried to obstruct
justice.
	   Clinton, three lawyers and his wife _ the core of his insulated
decision-making team _ will spend the weekend assessing his
choices. Before making a final decision, the group will learn as
much as they can about public opinion, the mood of Congress and the
evidence against him.
	   One option is another flat denial. If he never had sex with the
former White House intern, Clinton could rebut Ms. Lewinsky's
testimony.
	   He runs the risk, though, of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
giving Congress a formidable case for impeachment. And another
denial might not sit well with the American public: While most
voters tell pollsters they believe Clinton has lied and they still
support him, a majority of Americans also say perjury before the
grand jury would be grounds for impeachment.
	   Clinton can't survive without support of the American public.
	   Many of the president's most loyal supporters, including top
advisers, also are convinced he had some sort of intimate
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Democrats in Congress are privately
telling the White House that Clinton needs to come clean.
	   ``We're running out of patience with denials for the sake of
delay,'' said one senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   On the other end of the options scale is a full confession with
presidential testimony about every intimate detail. Close Clinton
advisers, though not privy to the truth about the relationship, say
they suspect a no-holds-barred admission would turn voters against
the president.
	   Clinton can't forget that he looked directly into TV cameras
Jan. 26, wagged his finger and declared, ``I did not have sexual
relations with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.''
	   Some variation on a final option _ a classic Clinton ``third
way'' _ appears to be the most talked about potential strategy
inside and outside the president's inner circle. It calls for
Clinton to pick and choose what questions he answers.
	   One close confidant involved in preparing the president's
testimony urged Clinton early in the week to tell the grand jury
that he did not commit perjury or obstruct justice _ but refuse to
answer questions about his sex life.
	   That strategy has evolved in recent day, mainly because Clinton
doesn't think the public or Congress will accept any sort of
denial, according to a second adviser also involved in preparations
for Monday.
	   Clinton is said to be leaning toward a risky no-details
scenario: Acknowledge some sort of personal relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, possibly even sexual. He could argue that he told the
truth in the Paula Jones lawsuit when he denied a sexual
relationship based on a one-paragraph definition of sex provided by
Mrs. Jones' lawyers.
	   Clinton would refuse to give specific or graphic details,
arguing it was a private matter that is not the business of
prosecutors. ``It's between me, my wife and my maker,'' is how one
adviser summarized Clinton's stance under the scenario.
	   This would be explosive.
	   Personally: Nobody can predict the impact this would have on
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has stood by her man and said she
believes his denials. Though she is engrossed in his legal and
political strategy sessions, confidants doubt that the president
has told Mrs. Clinton everything about his relationship with the
ex-intern.
	   Legally, Starr could ask the courts to compel Clinton's
testimony. The president could be held in contempt.
	   But sources on both sides of the dispute say Starr considers
this Clinton's last chance to testify; he would submit his case to
Congress no matter what the president says or doesn't say.
	   Politically, the question would be whether the public could
stomach Clinton even implying that he had a sexual relationship
with ``that woman.'' And what of his promise to answer questions
``completely?''
	   Would the public make him pay for the lies?
	   Independent pollster Andrew Kohut says nobody knows for sure.
``They're willing to cut him a lot of slack if he makes the right
gestures,'' Kohut said.
	   ``Fine,'' said Republican consultant Ralph Reed. ``But you'd
still have a very embarrassing revelation 70 days before a national
election and a president hounded by scandal and governing almost as
a one-armed, veto president. I don't think that's a very good
position to call your best option.''
	   But it may be the best Clinton can do _ both in his testimony
and during a nationally televised address afterward _ when he looks
into the cameras again and tells.

Black Christ turns white after restoration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EL BARCO DE AVILA, Spain (AP) _ Restorers working at a small
Gothic church in central Spain have decided that a rare figure of a
black Jesus Christ is actually a white one.
	   The 13th-century wood image in Barco de Avila, 100 miles (170
kilometers) west of Madrid, is worshipped by pilgrims throughout
the mountainous Castilian region.
	   Mayor Agustin Gonzalez said Friday that the cleaning showed that
the figure originally depicted a white Jesus on the cross, and had
been darkened over the years by smoke from votive candles that
worshippers placed in front of it, he said.
	   The town council plans to display the image of the whitened
Christ in a side chapel of the Nuestra Senora de la Asuncion
church, Gonzalez said.
	   ``There will be more people visiting the Christ, especially the
people of the village, to convince themselves of the change,'' he
predicted.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ A 14-year-old Brazilian boy who was
expelled because of bad behavior returned to school and shot his
prinicipal, police said Friday.
	   The boy was expelled from school Thursday, and then returned
later in the day to shot Antonio Carlos Soares twice in the
stomach, said detective Luiz Raposu.
	   Soares was in serious condition at a local hospital, Raposu
said.
	   The boy, whom police would not identify because of his age,
fled. He later went to a police station Friday with his mother to
turn himself in, said Raposu.
	   Police did not say what misbehavior prompted the expulsion, but
radio reports said he regularly refused to obey teachers and his
performance was poor.
	   ``The happened in a part of town where it is not unusual for
youths to carry arms, but this is the first time that a teacher has
been shot,'' Raposu said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) _ Police in the Mexican resort city of
Puerto Escondido have arrested a restaurant owner for allegedly
arranging the machete-slaying of her boyfriend, a real estate
investor from Northern Ireland, officials said Friday.
	   Gemina Alvarez Robles, 24, had fled Oaxaca state after two men
hacked Roderick Peace to death on May 5, 1997.
	   She returned to Puerto Escondido this week and was arrested
Wednesday.
	   Peace was killed after arriving at a property that Alvarez told
him was for sale, police said.
	   Investigators suspect she intended to seize his money after she
was killed.
	   Robles has not yet entered a plea.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ Costa Rica's postal system fired 80
workers _ 8 percent of the work force _ for corruption on Friday,
saying they had stolen money and goods from packages.
	   Ricardo Toledo, president of Costa Rica's Mail and Telegraph
company, said the firings are the result of increased vigilance
since the postal system's administrative system passed from public
to private hands in May.
	   ``Now that Mail and Telegraph is a private company, we can use
labor law to fire employees who commit irregularities,'' he said.
In Costa Rica, it's more difficult to fire public employees than
private-sector workers.
	   After the firings, the postal system had 920 employees.
	   ---- &QC; 
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A U.S. Coast Guard patrol boat acting on
a Colombian tip intercepted a speedboat carrying more than a ton of
cocaine early Friday off the Caribbean coast and arrested four men,
authorities said.
	   A Colombian frigate sighted the drug-laden vessel, which had
dual 300-horsepower engines, around dawn in the Gulf of Uraba. It
was seized in international waters, said Vice Adm. Jairo Cardona,
commander of Colombia's Atlantic Fleet.
	   The route on which it was discovered is popular with traffickers
who haul cocaine from Colombia, the world's leading producer, to
Central American waystations. Most of the drug then enters the
United States by land.
	   Before they were caught, the traffickers managed to throw some
of the cocaine overboard, but guardsmen recovered 21 bags of
between 25 and 30 kilos each, Cardona said. The suspects, the boat
and the cocaine were handed over to Colombian authorities.
	   Under a maritime agreement signed last year, the United States
and Colombia work together on the high sease to intercept
suspicious boats and planes.

Singh, Montgomerie take early lead at PGA

 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Vijay Singh and Colin Montgomerie
know the pain of coming close at the PGA Championship. On Friday,
they gave themselves a chance for something better.
	   Singh made five birdies on the first nine holes and finished
with a 4-under-par 66, matching the course record at Sahalee
Country Club that Tiger Woods set the day before. At 136, Singh had
the early lead after two cautious rounds.
	   Right behind was Montgomerie, in pursuit of his first major
championship and in contention for the first time since he lost by
one stroke to Ernie Els at the U.S. Open last year.
	   Montgomerie made three key par saves for a 67 and was at 137
with Scott Gump, who got to 5 under for the tournament until
consecutive bogeys on the back nine. Gump shot 69.
	   ``The key to winning a major is you need to peak at the right
time,'' Singh said. ``I played well last week and I'm playing well
again. All I need to do is go out there and do what I did today.''
	   As Woods proved early in his round Friday, that's not always
easy.
	   He left the driver in his bag once again, but that wasn't the
problem. Woods missed a 5-foot (1.5-meter) birdie putt on the
second hole, three-putted on No. 4 and took another bogey after
hitting his 3-wood into the rough on the 480-yard (437-meter) par-4
sixth.
	   He made the turn at 2 under and was slowly losing ground.
	   Singh, who has won five times on the PGA Tour and 18 other
tournaments around the world, was a relative unknown at the PGA in
1993 when he finished two strokes out of a playoff in a tie for
fourth.
	   He is more seasoned now, and expects to be able to handle the
weekend pressure.
	   ``My head is more level,'' Singh said. ``I'm used to the crowd
and the competition.''
	   Singh's only lapses were missing the green on the par-5 11th
with a 9-iron and hitting into the bunker on the par-3 17th, the
only two bogeys in an otherwise steady performance.
	   Montgomerie took a different route, holding his round together
with superb par saves on three consecutive holes on the front _
from the edge of the cart path on No. 6, from the bunker on No. 7
and with a putt on No. 8 after missing the green to the right.
	   ``There's always a key hole in the round that keeps the momentum
rolling along, and No. 6 was the hole,'' Montgomerie said.
	   Montgomerie, who came to Seattle two days early to work with
short-game guru Dave Pelz, made three birdie putts on the back
nine, but stumbled to a bogey on No. 18 by missing the fairway.
	   Steve Elkington, whose season has been held back by sinus
surgery and spinal meningitis, shot his second round of 69 and was
at 138, two strokes behind Singh.
	   Frank Lickliter shot 71 and David Frost had a 69; both were at
139. Of the early starters, no one else was under par through two
rounds. Phil Mickelson took a double bogey on the par-5 second hole
but still managed a 70 and was at even-par 140.
	   Paul Azinger needed a birdie-birdie finish to salvage a 73 and
was at 141, along with Fred Funk and Scott Hoch.
	   ``I'm due for some good luck, and some good golf,'' said
Elkington, who beat Montgomerie in a playoff in the 1995 PGA at
Riviera.
	   Elkington's picture, along with other past champions, is on a
banner hanging from the tented roof in the interview room, which
caught Montgomerie's attention.
	   ``You've annoyed me because there's a picture of Steve Elkington
up there,'' the Scotsman said, joking.
	   But the majors are no laughing matter. At 35, Montgomerie says
he has eight competitive years left. And despite leading the
European tour money list a record five years in a row, he knows his
career will not be complete without a major.
	   ``I haven't come over here to finish second,'' said Montgomerie,
who has done just that in three previous majors. ``The hardest
thing to do is get into contention. We'll go from there.''
	   Sahalee played a little bit faster than Thursday, when only 23
players broke par. Woods and several of 44 players within four
shots of him went off in the afternoon, when the greens began to
get firmer and faster.
	   But some of the early starters struggled.
	   Hometown hero Fred Couples shot 71 and was likely to miss the
cut at 5-over 145, along with British Open runner-up Brian Watts.
	   John Daly recovered from his 80 to shoot 72, but missed the cut.

Hingis beats Serena Williams
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Friday's early action &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANHATTAN BEACH, California (AP) _ Martina Hingis, motivated by
some brash words from Richard Williams, beat Serena Williams 6-4,
6-1 on Friday in the quarterfinals of the Acura Classic.
	   The world's No. 1 player saw Richard Williams, the father and
coach of teen sensations Venus and Serena, on television Tuesday
night saying how he wanted Hingis and Serena to play here.
	   ``I think Serena would kick her butt going and coming,'' the
elder Williams said.
	   Hingis giggled at the comment, part of which was bleeped because
of an expletive.
	   ``I don't think she did it,'' the 17-year-old Swiss player said
after advancing to Saturday's semifinals against No. 3 seed Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario at Manhattan Country Club.
	   Sanchez Vicario ended the dream run of Elena Tatarkova of
Ukraine with a 6-3, 6-3 victory. Tatarkova, ranked 63rd in the
world, got into the main draw as a lucky loser when Mary Pierce
withdrew because of injury.
	   Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport, winner of two straight
tournaments in California, met No. 8 seed Natasha Zvereva in the
night match.
	   The Williams sisters and their father have irritated some
players on the WTA Tour with their gamesmanship and brash remarks.
Hingis didn't blame Serena for her father's comment, saying she
gets along with her better than she does with Venus.
	   ``When she's alone, I like her. She's a nice girl, but the
people around her sometimes talk too much,'' Hingis said, singling
out Richard Williams.
	   ``Sometimes he should watch his mouth. I think they're going to
be a little bit quiet now.''
	   The youngest Williams stayed out of the fray, telling reporters
to ask her father about his comment.
	   Hingis needed three sets to beat Williams in their only other
meeting at the Lipton Championships in March, but Williams offered
little resistance Friday.
	   ``She's very aggressive from the first point on, but only for
two shots,'' Hingis said. ``She's got a great serve and a nice
return, but then she slows down.''
	   With Venus watching from the front row, 16-year-old Serena
converted just one of seven break points in the match. Venus
skipped the tournament because of a knee injury.

De Ferran takes provisional pole for CART race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ELKHART LAKE, Wisconsin (AP) _ Gil de Ferran's love for Road
America might finally be requited this weekend.
	   With 19 racers breaking the track record, de Ferran turned in
the fastest lap in provisional qualifying for the Texaco-Havoline
200 on Friday.
	   The Brazilian driver, who hasn't won since July 1996, turned in
a record lap of 145.055 mph (232.088 kmph) on the 4-mile
(6.5-kilometer), 14-turn road course to take the provisional pole
for Sunday's race.
	   Everybody will have another chance on Saturday to better their
position in the final round of time trials, including Greg Moore,
whose fourth-place finish was nullified because his chassis failed
to meet the 2-inch ground clearance rule.
	   ``The track has a nice flow to it,'' de Ferran said, struggling
to describe his love for the layout. ``It's hard to explain what
flow is, but you keep momentum going all the way through the lap,
even though there are some slow turns. It's what I call an
old-fashioned race track. There's not many tracks like Road America
anymore.''
	   It was love at first site for de Ferran, who drives a
Reynard-Honda for Derrike Walker, when he first saw the track in
1995.
	   But he's never won here. He finished third at the track last
year and can't think of a better place to get his first pole of the
season and fifth of his career.
	   ``It's been a while,'' he said.
	   A year ago, it was Mauricio Gugelmin who had the best lap,
setting a qualifying record of 143.342 mph (229.347 kmph) on the
big, fast track.
	   Gugelmin had a terrible time Friday. He blew the engine in his
Reynard Mercedes-Benz during the morning practice and had a misfire
in his backup. He and Moore were the only ones out of 28 racers not
to earn a qualifying time.
	   ``There's not much to say. It was just a bad day,'' Gugelmin
said. ``You have to expect days like this once in a while.''
	   The last thing anyone expected was to see Gugelmin missing out
on the fun, though.
	   Dario Franchitti, chasing his third pole in four races, was
second at 144.801 mph (231.682 kmph), followed by three-time winner
Michael Andretti at 144.619 (231.390 kmph).
	   ``It's unbelievable how fast we're going,'' Andretti said.
``Some of these corners are crazy.''
	   ``With the heavy rains here during the past week, the track has
been washed clean and is rather slippery,'' said Moore.
	   Andre Ribeiro of Marlboro Team Penske fractured his left fibula
after he spun his Penske Mercedes-Benz into the gravel during the
first qualifying session. His status for Sunday's race was
undetermined, but surgery wasn't planned and he wasn't placed in a
cast. Ribeiro had the ninth-fastest time.
	   Five drivers were off the track at the end of the first
qualifying session and de Ferran nearly joined them, skidding into
gravel as he rounded the last turn and saw Moore, Adrian Fernandez
and Jimmy Vasser parked on the side.
	   ``The track requires that you run very little downforce to go
fast and you have these very heavy braking areas, and the car
slides quite a bit around here,'' de Ferran said. ``And it's very,
very easy to make a mistake.''
	   Defending champion Alex Zanardi, who drove off the track last
week at Mid-Ohio, twice went off the road course in practice
Friday.
	   Zanardi received a record fine of dlrs 50,000 for taking
unjustifiable risks at Mid-Ohio last week. His driving caused
Andretti to spin end-over-end in a spectacular crash that remained
the talk of the circuit Friday.
	   ``There's a lucky man sitting next to me,'' Franchitti said.
``That was one of the scariest things I've ever watched, I tell
you. I think the drivers meeting tomorrow, that should be an
interesting one.''
	   Andretti said he's put last week behind him but can't seem to
shake his misfortune.
	   ``Again, it just seems like all year long, I'm always in the
wrong place at the wrong time,'' he said. ``We had a very quick lap
going on the last lap and Al Unser Jr. came out of the pits. And he
tried to get out of the way, but by then it was too late and I lost
about four-tenths on my last lap.''

Pen poised, governor awaits bill to authorize plebiscite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A bill authorizing a vote on Puerto
Rico's political status, including the option of applying for
statehood, did not make it to the governor's desk for signing
Friday afternoon.
	   But Gov. Pedro Rossello promised that the bill, approved late
Thursday by the Puerto Rico Legislature and being prepared Friday
for signing, will not languish on his desk.
	   ``It has not been received in La Fortaleza (the governor's
mansion), but as soon as I receive it I'm ready to sign it,'' said
the pro-statehood governor, who called for the plebiscite on July
25, the 100th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Puerto Rico in
the Spanish-American War.
	   The bill approved by the Legislature calls for voters to choose
among four status options: the current commonwealth status,
statehood, independence or free association. The plebiscite is
scheduled for Dec. 13.
	   A bill in the U.S. Congress to authorize a vote was passed in
the House by one vote in March, but a similar measure is stalled in
the Senate.

Congress to examine government spending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ For the first time in recent Mexican history,
an opposition-dominated congress will review federal outlays to see
if the money was spent correctly, a congressional committee
announced Friday.
	   The congressional review, to begin later this month, marks an
end to unchecked decades in which the government could exceed its
budget and make broad use of secret spending accounts.
	   Ricardo Garcia Sainz, chairman of the budget committee in the
lower house of congress said the government's 1997 spending
included the discretional use of more than dlrs 4 billion to bail
out the state-run Foreign Trade Bank.
	   ``There is no doubt it will be one of the issues to be analyzed,
because of its effects as well as its legal basis and
consequences,'' Garcia Sainz said.
	   Congress will hold about 15 hearings over a period of about 10
weeks this fall to review the 1997 budget, with representatives of
about 30 government ministries and state-run companies to be
summoned by Congress.
	   The first is scheduled for August 25, in which two Finance
Undersecretaries and Mexico's Revenue Service Director will appear
before the committee.
	   Congress will also summon representatives of other ministries,
the state-run oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos, the Federal
Attorney General, and the Mexican Social Security Institute.
	   ``We intend to fully carry out our constitutional
responsibility,'' Garcia Sainz said. ``It is an extremely important
task, and a basic responsibility'' of congress.
	   The lower house of Congress, where the ruling party lost its
majority last year, has exclusive authority to approve the federal
budget and supervise government spending.
	   Following landmark elections in July 1997, the opposition
wrested control of the lower house from the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, and took control of key congressional
commissions.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell again Friday after another early
rally fizzled, extending a month-long plunge from record highs to
10 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average surrendered an early
97-point gain and finished 34.50 points _ or 0.4 percent _ lower at
8,425.00, its lowest close since late February and 9.8 percent
below July 17's peak of 9,337.97. The early downturn came despite
big rallies in Moscow and Hong Kong after several days of steep
declines. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Persistent doubts about Russia's economy sent
currency traders to the safety of the dollar Friday, pushing the
U.S. currency up strongly against the German mark and the Japanese
yen. The dollar jumped more than a yen despite intervention threats
by an influential Japanese finance official. The dollar rose 1 1/2
pfennigs against the German mark. In late New York trading, the
dollar was quoted at 146.35 yen, up from 145.16 late Thursday. It
also was trading at 1.8014 marks, up from 1.7855 marks. (US-DOLLAR)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The General Motors strikes propelled the worst
back-to-back declines in the U.S. industrial production in nearly
eight years while drought pushed up food prices in July. Prices
charged by producers such as factories and food-processing plants
rose 0.2, driven by a drought-induced jump in vegetable prices, the
Labor Department said Friday. ``With Asia down for the count and
much of the rest of the world wobbling, this comes as no
surprise,'' said economist Oscar Gonzalez of John Hancock in
Boston. ``This means U.S. consumers will continue to benefit from
low inflation.'' Meanwhile, the GM strikes caused production at
factories, mines and utilities to fall 0.6 percent last month, the
second consecutive decline, the Federal Reserve said. With the 1.1
percent plunge in June, it was the worst two-month drop since
November-December 1990, at the start of the last recession.
(US-ECONOMY)
	   NOVGOROD, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin called on
parliament Friday to hold an emergency session to respond to
Russia's economic crisis. Yeltsin insisted, however, that the
economy remained stable, that the ruble would not be devalued, and
that there was no need to interrupt his monthlong vacation to take
charge of the situation. But Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais,
Russia's liaison with international lending organizations, will cut
short his vacation and return to the capital on Saturday, the
Interfax news agency reported. Trading on the Russian stock
exchange was suspended for about 15 minutes Friday after some
stocks rose as much as 20 percent. The market closed 13.7 percent
higher at 115.00 points, after falling much of the week.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton received assurances
from President Boris Yeltsin on Friday that Russia is taking the
necessary steps to weather its latest economic crisis, Clinton's
spokesman said. The Russian president and Clinton spoke for about
40 minutes, said president spokesman Mike McCurry. They did not
discuss whether a new aid package from the West would be needed, he
said. ``This was not a phone call about money. It was a phone call
about doing the things necessary'' to stabilize an economy that has
been struggling, McCurry said. (US-RUSSIA)
	   WASHINGTON (AP)_ The International Monetary Fund welcomed
Thailand's comprehensive package to rescue the country's financial
system that includes taking over two debt-ridden banks and five
finance companies. The IMF's acting managing director, Shigemitsu
Sugisaki, said in a statement Friday the move ``demonstrates the
resolve of Thailand's authorities to pursue economic restructuring
in the face of very difficult domestic and regional conditions.''
Sugisaki said the measures were aimed at ensuring ``the solvency
and credibility of the core banking system'' and strengthening
``the basis for the recovery of the economy.'' World Bank President
James Wolfensohn said his organization strongly supports the
program and is impressed with its comprehensiveness. (IMF-THAILAND)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KINSHASA, Congo _ With an army of his former allies pressing
toward the Congolese capital, President Laurent Kabila has
disappeared from view, leaving the city's residents to wonder what
will happen next. One senior Kabila adviser told The Associated
Press that the embattled Congolese leader had fled. Another aide
said he was in the capital, holed up in the Presidential Palace.
Kabila has not been seen in public since early this week, when he
appeared meeting new army recruits on a state-television broadcast.
An army of Tutsi rebels, Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted troops
from Kabila's army _ the same people who helped him oust longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997 _ is marching toward Kinshasa
from Congo's western coastline, seeking to end Kabila's turbulent
14-month rule. (CONGO)
	   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The FBI says it will take at least another
month to finish examining the scenes of the Aug. 7 bombings at U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people and injured
more than 5,500. The FBI says it has 215 agents, lab examiners,
evidence technicians, computer specialists, photographers and
translators in Kenya and Tanzania, and a British forensic team was
to join them shortly. Assistant FBI Director Thomas Pickard said
Thursday in Washington that his agents have 700 interviews to
conduct in Nairobi and 200 in Dar es Salaam. The on-site inquiry
will take at least a month, he said. The rubble next to the Nairobi
embassy, once a bustling office building on a busy downtown street,
has become an impromptu shrine, where Christian and Muslim
lawmakers, in a show of unity and grief, placed a huge wreath of
red and white roses. (EMBASSY BOMBINGS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ A prominent Kosovo Albanian politician
has agreed to lead the political wing of the separatist rebel force
that has refused to join peace talks, hampering efforts to unite
the province's fragmented politicians. Adem Demaci announced Friday
he was accepting an offer by the Kosovo Liberation Army to become
leader of its political wing, widening the split between ethnic
Albanians supporting the militants and those who back peaceful and
negotiated secession from Serbia. The move in effect establishes
Demaci as an alternative leader to moderate Ibrahim Rugova, who on
Thursday announced he had formed a delegation to begin talks with
the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the
future of the rebellious Serbian province. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government is planning
to deport 18 foreign activists Saturday, who were sentenced to five
years of hard labor Friday for handing out democracy leaflets. An
official from the Ministry of Home Affairs reduced Friday's
verdict, saying the activists _ six Americans, three Malaysians,
three Indonesians, three Thais, two Filipinos and one Australian _
would be expelled on the condition they would not violate Myanmar
laws again. If they did, he added, they would have to serve out any
future prison terms together with the five years from this offense.
A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said all 18 detainees would leave Yangon
on Saturday for Bangkok. (MYANMAR-FOREIGNERS)
	   BERLIN (AP) _ In its latest admission of past sins, the
successor party to the former East German communists apologized
Friday for East Germany's role in the Soviet-led invasion that
crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reform movement in
then-Czechoslovakia 30 years ago. In letters sent to both Czech
President Vaclav Havel and Slovakian Premier Vladimir Meciar, the
PDS said it recognized ``the guilt'' that East Germany and its
communist party ``brought upon themselves through their involvement
in the action, which violated international law.'' The so-called
``Prague Spring'' in Czechoslovakia in 1968 was ``the last attempt
for democratic renewal of genuine socialism,'' the letters said.
Last week, the Party for Democratic Socialism apologized for East
Germany's repression of its citizens during more than 40 years of
authoritarian communist rule. The spate of apologies come ahead of
national elections set for Sept. 27, in which the former communists
are trying to persuade voters they are sincere about accepting
Germany's constitutional democracy. (GERMANY-PRAGUE SPRING)

Schett, de Swardt advance to semifinals in BostonCup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLESLEY, Massachusetts (AP) _ Seventh-seeded Barbara Schett of
Austria stunned top-seeded Amanda Coetzer of South Africa 6-7
(3-7), 6-4, 6-1 to highlight an afternoon of upsets in the
BostonCup on Friday.
	   The second seed, Anke Huber of Germany, also fell, a 6-3, 7-6
(7-4) victim of Amanda de Swardt of South Africa.
	   The winners advance to Saturday's semifinals.
	   Schett rallied after failing to convert a set point on her serve
in the opening set. She controlled the action from the baseline
after that, forcing Coetzer into erratic play.
	   ``I played more aggressively in the last two sets,'' Schett
said. ``This was the most important win of my career.''
	   Schett's victory over Coetzer, the eighth-ranked player in the
world, ensures Schett a seed in the U.S. Open, which begins in
three weeks.
	   Coetzer lost the fifth game of the second set with a double
fault, and her serve-and-volley game, usually one of the best,
wasn't a factor. Schett played with increasing confidence, ripping
powerful forehand winners past the tourney's top seed.
	   Huber, meanwhile, showed lingering effects of foot surgery in
April. De Swardt returned serve effectively to capture the
first-set tiebreaker and then simply outplayed the second seed to
win the next set. This was Huber's second tournament since the
surgery.
	   ``I thought the layoff hurt her,'' de Swardt said. ``I've seen
her play much better than this.''
	   Lisa Raymond, the third seed, defeated eighth-seeded Corina
Morariu, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 in the final match of the afternoon.

Burton leads despite bogey trouble
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Brandie Burton saw her tee shot
plugged so deep in a fairway bunker she could only play out of it
in the wrong direction.
	   She hit her next shot across the green and found more sand. Her
bunker shot landed to 10 feet (3 meters) and she missed the putt
for double bogey which followed a bogey at the previous hole.
	   Burton's troubles at eight and nine meant that the winner of the
Du Maurier Classic two weeks ago, where she wound up 18 under par,
managed only a 2-over 74 Friday for a 1-over total of 145 at the
Women's British Open.
	   Yet she still led the tournament at halfway.
	   With not a single player level or below par, Burton held a
1-stroke lead over fellow American Leslie Spalding with three
players a further shot behind.
	   ``If there is a positive thing it's that, having made bogey at
eight and double bogey at nine, I was able to hang in there and
keep pedalling away,'' Burton said.
	   ``I knew that something like this was going to happen on a golf
course like this and in these windy conditions and you've got to
just roll with the punches.
	   ``I managed to really keep my head which is really important on
this golf course.''
	   The two bogeys meant she temporarily lost the outright lead but
a 12-foot (3 1/2 meters) birdie putt at 11 put her back in front
again.
	   Betsy King, who shared the lead with Burton after the opening
round, slipped to three shots back after a 77 which included bogeys
at each of the first four holes.
	   That opened the door for Spalding to make a move into second.
	   The American, who only gained the draw as an alternate, rolled
in a 60-foot (18-meter) putt for a birdie two at the 158-yard
(144-meter) ninth and then birdied 11, 13 and 14 on the way to her
2-under 70.
	   ``It's my first time here and I'm really thrilled,'' said
Spalding, who holed three birdie putts. ``I like the tough
conditions and I like the wind.
	   ``I feel my game is on the way up,'' said Spalding, whose best
finish on the U.S. Tour is a share of 20th at the Big Apple Classic
at New Rochelle in July.
	   Wendy Ward, who won the Hawaiian Ladies Open in February for her
second Tour victory, carded a 71 for a 3-under halfway total of
147. She was tied with Scotland's Janice Moodie and England's
Suzanne Strudwick, who both made level par 72s.
	   Laura Davies, winner in 1986 of a tournament she considers the
most important in the world, went home early. She missed the cut by
one stroke after 79 left her 14 over.

responded with a standing ovation.
	   For Spadea, the defeat ended an impressive week. He beat
eighth-ranked Richard Krajicek on Thursday and No. 9 Andre Agassi
on Wednesday.
	   It was the first time Spadea has beaten top-10 players back to
back in the same tournament. He said those matches took a toll on
his performance against Sampras.
	   ``I didn't feel like I was getting any rhythm against his serve
_ or even any exercise,'' Spadea said. ``I just felt heavy on my
feet.''
	   Earlier Friday, Australian Patrick Rafter reeled off three
consecutive points, the first two on service breaks, to beat Petr
Korda in a second-set tiebreaker and move into the semifinals with
a 6-4, 7-6 (10-8) victory.
	   The fifth-seeded Rafter, who is ranked No. 3 in the world and is
the reigning U.S. Open champion, will meet Russia's Yevgeny
Kafelnikov in one of Saturday's semifinal matches.
	   Rafter fell behind 8-7 in the tiebreaker before drawing even by
passing Korda with a backhand down the deuce-court line.
	   Rafter set up match point by forcing Korda, the world's No. 4
player and the tournament's third seed, into hitting a forehand
wide before unleashing a 112 mph serve that Korda backhanded into
the net.
	   Rafter felt good about avoiding a third set.
	   ``I felt a little tired, but I don't know how he would have
pulled it off either. But I still would have battled,'' he said.
	   Kafelnikov earned his semifinal berth with a 6-4, 6-4 victory
over unseeded Daniel Vacek, ranked No. 53 in the world.
	   The 10th-ranked Kafelnikov, who is seeded seventh in the
tournament, improved his career record against Vacek, his doubles
partner from the Czech Republic, to 10-3. He is 3-0 against Rafter.
	   ``It's very important when you go against an opponent to feel
like you almost can't lose,'' he said. ``It gives you some extra
confidence. You feel like if you play your regular game, you have a
good shot at winning.''
	   In Friday's first quarterfinal matchup of two unseeded players,
Sweden's Magnus Larsson continued his two-year domination of his
countrymen and moved into the semifinals with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-2)
victory over Thomas Johansson.
	   ``I can't remember the last time I lost to a Swede,'' said
Larsson, who became the seventh player from Sweden to reach the ATP
semifinals since 1979 by recording his 10th consecutive victory
over a Swede. His last loss to a Swedish player was in February
1996 to Thomas Enqvist.
	   Larsson, ranked 37th in the world, went ahead 5-4 in the first
set after Johansson, ranked 38th, lost his serve by committing
consecutive unforced backhand errors.
	   Larsson held serve at love to win the first set, and both
players recorded a break on the way to the second-set tiebreaker.
Larsson took a 3-2 lead on a forehand winner, followed by two
service winners to go ahead 5-2 and then forced Johansson into
back-to-back missed forehands to close out the match.
	   ``I thought I was so-so,'' Larsson said. ``I got a little better
at the end. I only had one really bad game when I lost my serve. I
just tried to make him play a lot of balls, and you always have to
serve well.''

Pen poised, governor awaits bill to authorize plebiscite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A bill authorizing a vote on Puerto
Rico's political status, including the option of applying for U.S.
statehood, did not make it to the governor's desk for signing
Friday afternoon.
	   But Gov. Pedro Rossello promised that the bill, approved late
Thursday by the Puerto Rico Legislature and being prepared Friday
for signing, will not languish on his desk.
	   ``It has not been received in La Fortaleza (the governor's
mansion), but as soon as I receive it I'm ready to sign it,'' said
the pro-statehood governor, who called for the plebiscite on July
25, the 100th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Puerto Rico in
the Spanish-American War.
	   The bill approved by Puerto Rico's legislature would let voters
choose among four options: the current status as a U.S.
commonwealth, statehood, independence or free association. The
plebiscite is scheduled for Dec. 13.
	   A bill in the U.S. Congress to authorize a vote was passed in
the House by one vote in March, but a similar measure is stalled in
the Senate.

Grieving Appleby a big winner this week
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM COUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Stuart Appleby's first tournament
since his tragedy was a victory.
	   No, Appleby didn't win the PGA Championship. Far from it. He
didn't even make the cut. To the fans at the Sahalee Country Club
on Thursday and Friday, it didn't matter.
	   They poured their hearts and their applause out to him.
	   When he chipped in for a birdie from 40 feet in the 18th hole,
Appleby raised his putter and the crowd roared.
	   ``Renay got a lot of recognition this week,'' Appleby said after
his 3-over-par 73 for a 36-hole total of 150. ``It helped me, too.
I'm in the process of trying to get on the horse again.''
	   Still grieving after his wife, Renay, was crushed to death
between two cars at a London train station last month, the
27-year-old Australian came out of seclusion to play golf this
week.
	   In memory of his late wife, Appleby wore a necklace with
``Renay'' on it. Even when Appleby putted for bogeys, the fans
cheered for him and he soaked it in in appreciation.
	   ``It's very nice to know that the people are there for you,'' he
said.
	   Robert Allenby, a fellow Australian who made the cut with a 140
total, said Appleby showed a lot of courage by playing this week.
	   ``I think it's the best thing he's done,'' Allenby said.
``Sooner or later, he had to face it. This is where he belongs, the
golf course.''
	   Allenby said Appleby's next challenge will be when he returns to
the couple's ``dream house'' in Orlando, Fla., for the first time.
	   ``Stuart is planning on keeping it,'' he said. ``He wants to
keep it for the memories.''
	   Appleby would rather be playing golf this weekend instead of
having more time to think about his life without Renay.
	   ``I'm not glad it's over,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; TREE TRAUMA: &LR;  Frank Lickliter has never seen so many trees in
his life. It's enough to give a PGA Tour player nightmares.
	   Lickliter, 29, shot a 71 Friday to go with his first-round 68
for a 139 score. Still, he knows Sahalee will get him if he's not
careful because of its narrow fairways that are lined with trees.
	   It's been hard for Lickliter to sleep this week.
	   ``The trees are taller than the fairways are wide,'' he said.
``That's all you're looking at sometimes. They're right there in
front of you. You notice 'em.''
	   Lickliter said it's not his nature to play conservatively. So he
has to keep reminding himself that all those trees in Redmond are
the enemy.
	   ``I like hitting 'em at the green,'' he said.
	   Playing in his first PGA Championship, Lickliter is looking for
his first PGA Tour victory. He won the 1995 Utah Classic on the
Nike tour.
	   ``I'm extremely happy where I'm sitting,'' Lickliter said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; MAYFAIR MOOD: &LR;  After winning the Buick Open and dlrs 324,000
last week, Billy Mayfair wondered how he'd play in the PGA
Championship this week.
	   ``Last week, everybody was patting me on the back,'' he said.
``The hardest thing to do after you win is to make the cut. After
that, you can just be free-wheeling.''
	   At Grand Blanc, Michigan, last week, Mayfair was 17-under-par
(271) for his fifth PGA Tour title. He also won the Nissan Open
this year.
	   At Sahalee, he made the cut with rounds of 73 and 67 for 140.
	   He said he thinks he's playing some of the best golf of his
life.
	   ``I know what my golf swing and putting are doing,'' he said.
``Now it's just a matter of getting rested up.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GEIBERGER HISTORY: &LR;  Al and Brent Geiberger became the first
father and son to play in the PGA Championship this week. Son
Brent, 30, talked his dad, 60, into playing in his first PGA
Championship since 1985.
	   ``It was a fun week,'' Al said.
	   Huh?
	   How can you have fun when you shoot 81 and 77, 18-over-par?
	   ``Now I know why I'm on the senior tour,'' said Al, who won the
PGA Championship in 1966. ``These guys are tough.''
	   So is the Sahalee course, which took its toll of Geiberger's
game.
	   ``I went through my miseries out there,'' he said with a grin.

Stockton, Canizares lead First of America Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADA, Michigan (AP) _ Dave Stockton and Spain's Jose Maria
Canizares shot 5-under-par 67s on Friday to share the first-round
lead in the Senior PGA Tour's First of America Classic.
	   Stockton, the 1996 winner, birdied five of his final 11 holes.
	   ``It was nothing special on the front,'' said Stockton, who
played the four par-3s in 3-under. ``I missed more shots than
normal. The key to the round was the par-3s and how I played eight
and nine.''
	   After playing the first seven holes in even par, Stockton
birdied the par-3 eighth and par-4 ninth.
	   ``After the ninth hole, I really didn't miss a shot,'' Stockton
said. ``I narrowed my stance with the driver on the back nine and
it really helped.''
	   Stockton, 56, a 14-time winner on the senior tour, made a
25-foot (8-meter) birdie putt on No. 16.
	   ``The course obviously is playing pretty tough because there are
not that many guys that far under par,'' Stockton said. ``With
these greens, if you don't get it close you have a hard time
two-putting. I missed a few putts that I was surprised to miss.
There is room for improvement.''
	   Canizares, who tied for ninth last year, matched Stockton with
six birdies and a bogey on the Egypt Valley Country Club course.
	   ``All my life I wanted to play in America, now I'll stay here, I
like it. I think this is the best tour in the world,'' he said. ``I
like this golf course, for me it is a much better golf course for
my game.''
	   Dana Quigley, Bruce Summerhays and George Archer were a stroke
back at 68, and Tom Shaw and Mike McCullough shot 69s. Jim Dent,
Jim Colbert, John Mahaffey and Babe Hiskey opened with 70s.
	   Summerhays said he took advantage of a lesson from Stockton last
week during the Coldwell Banker Burnet Classic at Coon Rapids,
Minn.
	   ``My left heel was coming way up off the ground when I hit my
driver and Dave asked me if he could give me some advice,''
Summerhays said. ``He told me what was happening and on my next
shot that problem was taken care of.
	   ``He wants to beat you at your best. A guy who is willing to
help should be at the top of the leader board. Good guys do win
occasionally.''
	   Defending champion Gil Morgan opened with a 72. Morgan has five
victories this year to match Hale Irwin for the tour lead. Irwin
skipped the tournament to play in the PGA Championship.

Prince Charles more popular, although royals still out of touch,
</HEADLINE>
poll reports

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A year after his former wife Princess Diana died,
Prince Charles is becoming more popular with ordinary Britons, The
Guardian newspaper reported Saturday in an opinion poll.
	   The liberal broadsheet newspaper said that 54 percent of Britons
questioned for the poll thought Charles would make a good king,
compared with 40 percent who were asked the question in October
1997, two months after Diana's Aug. 31 death in a Paris car crash.
	   However, the newspaper also reported that 28 percent of Britons
thought their country would be better off without the monarchy, and
that support for the royals has not yet recovered to 1994 levels.
Then, 70 percent of Britons thought the country would be worse off
without the royals. A small majority, 52 percent, now believe that,
while 20 percent are undecided.
	   The Guardian said that polling company ICM interviewed a random
sample of 1,203 adults by telephone between Aug. 7 and 9 for the
poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.
Saturday's findings were compared with similar polls published in
the newspaper in previous years.
	   The poll also showed that there is no longer majority opposition
to the idea of Charles marrying his companion, Camilla Parker
Bowles. While 55 percent were against the idea in October 1997, 46
percent of those asked in The Guardian's poll Saturday were still
opposed. The newspaper said that 35 percent of people now said that
Charles should marry her.
	   While Charles' popularity has increased, the royal family en
mass was still seen as having little in common with the majority of
Britons.
	   The newspaper said that the while 79 percent of Britain thought
the royals out of touch with ordinary people in the aftermath of
Diana's funeral in September, 69 percent of respondents to the poll
still thought the same.

Bombings probe pushes ahead; Kenyans still in shock

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The investigation to unmask the mystery
bombers in East Africa entered a second week Saturday without firm
answers, leaving Kenyans still mourning the dead and wondering how
their capital could have become ``another Beirut.''
	   The FBI says it will take another month or more to finish
examining the scenes of the Aug. 7 bombings at U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania that killed 257 people and injured more than
5,500.
	   In the shadow of the bombed embassy in Nairobi, not far from a
mound of memorial bouquets that cast their work in poignant
perspective, helmeted investigators continued poking through rubble
while others pored over evidence in tents nearby.
	   A British forensic team was on the way to aid the FBI's 215
agents, lab examiners, evidence technicians, computer specialists,
photographers and translators in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the two
bomb-hit capitals.
	   Police are working on new leads they hope will enable them to
trace the vehicle used in the bombing _ reportedly a yellow pickup
truck or van _ which local reports say was apparently bought
locally shortly before the attack.
	   Investigators have declined to discuss specifics of the probe.
But employees at one Nairobi car dealership said Friday that police
had called in the firm's owner for questioning the previous day as
they tried to find out about the bombers. What he said was not
immediately known.
	   Nine badly charred bodies still lie in cold storage at morgues,
unclaimed more than a week after the deadliest attack on a U.S.
embassy. Memorial services for others are still being held.
	   At a somber service Friday in Nairobi, which suffered 247
bombing deaths, families and friends remembered 13 people killed in
the collapse of a building next to the embassy. They comprised half
the staff of an insurance brokerage.
	   ``We are wondering how Nairobi could have become a Beirut, a
Belfast,'' banker Sam Kamau said in a mournful eulogy.
	   In a procession of grief, relatives and friends of the dead each
carried a bouquet of pink carnations with a single flickering
candle.
	   ``They were caught in a conflict they didn't know about,'' said
Kamau, representing friends and clients of the dead. ``We ask,
`Why?'''
	   Before the ceremony, mourners expressed anger and bewilderment
at the devastating toll on Kenya for what presumably was an act of
political terrorism against the United States.
	   ``Fight the enemy on its own territory,'' said George Kariuki,
an insurance broker.
	   There is some anger at the United States, both for allegedly not
moving swiftly enough to rescue victims _ all but 12 of them
Kenyans _ and for warning Americans against traveling to Kenya.
	   The travel advisory, which would have dealt a serious blow to
Kenya's tourism industry, was lifted late Thursday after Kenyan
protests. And on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
announced she will leave Sunday for the two East African capitals,
a trip that amounts to a show of support.
	   Albright's visit, said Prudence Bushnell, the U.S. ambassador to
Kenya, ``will show the world that the United States and important
Americans are not afraid to come to Kenya.''

Singh, Montgomerie take early lead at PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with O'Meara one stroke back after
11 holes, Faxon at 3-under and Woods at 1-under. Will be UPDATED
when Faxon and Woods finish &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Vijay Singh and Colin Montgomerie
know the pain of coming close in the PGA Championship. On Friday,
they gave themselves another chance.
	   Singh made five birdies on the first nine holes and finished
with a 4-under-par 66, matching the course record that Tiger Woods
set the day before. He was at 136 after two cautious rounds at
Sahalee Country Club.
	   Right behind was Montgomerie, in pursuit of his first major
championship and in contention for the first time since he lost by
one stroke to Ernie Els in the U.S. Open last year.
	   Montgomerie made three key par saves for a 67 and was at 137
with Scott Gump, who broke par for the second straight day at 69.
	   Closing fast was Mark O'Meara, undaunted by the pressure of
trying to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win
three majors in one season.
	   Just like he did in winning the Masters and the British Open,
the 41-year-old O'Meara just plugged along until making a thrilling
move that thrust him to 3-under, one off the lead.
	   He turned bogey into birdie by chipping in at No. 6, averted
another bogey at the par-3 ninth by chipping from the base of a
tree to within six feet (1.8 meters) and making the putt, and then
really set Sahalee screaming at No. 11.
	   O'Meara threaded the ``goal post'' trees guarding the par-5
green with a 3-iron, then holed a 15-footer (4 1/2 meters) from
just on the fringe for eagle that drew him within one stroke of
Singh with seven holes to play.
	   Brad Faxon, one of the best putters on the PGA Tour, birdied
three straight holes starting at No. 2 and was at 3-under with two
holes to play.
	   Davis Love III, trying to become the first PGA champion to
defend his title since Denny Shute in 1937, made birdie at No. 11
to get to 2-under.
	   ``The key to winning a major is you need to peak at the right
time,'' Singh said. ``I played well last week and I'm playing well
again. All I need to do is go out there and do what I did today.''
	   As Woods proved early in his round Friday, that's not always
easy.
	   He left the driver in his bag once again, but that wasn't the
problem. Woods missed a short birdie putt on the second hole,
three-putted on No. 4 and took another bogey after hitting his
3-wood into the rough on the par-4 sixth.
	   After making seven birdies in the first round, Woods was still
looking for his first one Friday. He had another three-putt bogey
on No. 15 and was at 1-under.
	   Singh, who has won five times on the PGA Tour and 18 other
tournaments around the world, was a relative unknown in the PGA in
1993 when he finished two strokes out of a playoff in a tie for
fourth.
	   Singh's only lapses were missing the green on the par-5 11th
with a 9-iron and hitting into the bunker on the par-3 17th, the
only two bogeys in an otherwise steady performance.
	   Montgomerie took a different route, holding his round together
with superb par saves on three consecutive holes on the front _
from the edge of the cart path on No. 6, from the bunker on No. 7
and with a 30-foot (9-meter) putt on No. 8 after missing the green
to the right.
	   Montgomerie, who came to Seattle two days early to work with
short-game guru Dave Pelz, made three birdie putts on the back
nine, but stumbled to a bogey on No. 18 by missing the fairway.
	   Steve Elkington, whose season has been held back by sinus
surgery and spinal meningitis, shot his second round of 69 and was
at 138, along with Andrew Magee.
	   Frank Lickliter shot 71 and David Frost had a 69; both were at
139. Of the early starters, no one else was under par through two
rounds. Phil Mickelson took a double bogey on the par-5 second hole
but still managed a 70 and was at even-par 140.
	   Paul Azinger needed a birdie-birdie finish to salvage a 73 and
was at 141, along with Fred Funk and Scott Hoch.
	   Sahalee played a little bit faster than Thursday, when only 23
players broke par. Woods and several of 44 players within four
shots of him went off in the afternoon, when the greens began to
get firmer and faster.
	   Tom Watson went out in 40 and was at 7-over through 12 holes and
headed for another missed cut at a major. It would be the first
time in his Hall of Fame career that Watson failed to play the
weekend at a major.
	   David Duval, the leading money-winner on the PGA Tour, was
10-over through 13 holes and also was headed home early. His worst
finish in a major this year was a tie for 11th in the British Open.
	   Some of the early starters also struggled.
	   Hometown hero Fred Couples shot 71 and was in jeopardy of
missing the cut at 5-over 145, as was British Open runner-up Brian
Watts.
	   John Daly recovered from his 80 to shoot 72, but missed the cut.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The decision of a prominent Albanian
politician to lead the political wing of the Kosovo Liberation Army
has widened the split between the rebel organization and the
longtime leader of the province's ethnic Albanians.
	   Adem Demci, chief rival of Albania's leading politician, Ibrahim
Rugova, announced his acceptance Friday after Rugova failed to
persuade the KLA to join his team. By doing so, Demaci in effect
established himself as an alternative leader of the province's
majority Albanian community.
	   Rugova is supported by the U.S. and other international leaders,
who view him as the best choice to bring the bloody conflict
between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   On Thursday, Rugova raised hopes that a political solution was
in sight, when he announced a delegation to begin talks with the
government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   But the KLA, who demand independence, accused Rugova Friday of
``forgetting ... those who are ... spilling blood,'' meaning
themselves. They said Rugova's ``illegal'' team could not reach any
binding agreement ``without the presence of KLA representatives.''
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province in
southern Serbia whose population of 2 million is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian. Serbia is the dominant of two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia.
	   In neighboring Albania, the government welcomed Rugova's
negotiating team as a contribution towards ``solving the Kosovo
situation through negotiations,'' but also acknowledged that they
could not work without cooperation from the KLA.
	   ``At the same time, we stress the importance and the necessity
that all Albanians factors unite their efforts to end the Kosovo
crises,'' Sokol Gjoka, spokesman for the Albanian foreign ministry
told state-run television late Friday.
	   Earlier Friday, Rugova told a news conference that peace talks
cannot begin until the Serb-led government halts its military
offensive against the KLA ``in order to create a favorable
atmosphere for the start of the dialogue.''
	   Reports out of Albania indicated fighting continued in areas
around Decani, near the Yugoslav border. Gen. Kudesi Lama,
commander of Albanian forces on the border was quoted by state-run
television saying, ``especially in the last days, the situation at
the border is very tense. Serbs are continuing their
provocations.''
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, a spokesman for the U.N. relief agency,
Kris Janowski, said about 500 people fled Thursday from Kosovo into
Albania, the first large-scale movement across the border since
Serb forces cut escape routes two months ago.
	   Janowski said the refugees were fleeing fighting around the KLA
border stronghold of Junik. Serb forces have sealed off the area.

Rebels push for Kinshasa while Kabila disappears from view

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With an army of his former allies
pressing toward the capital, Congolese President Laurent Kabila has
disappeared from view, leaving residents to stock their and wonder
what will happen next.
	   ``Only God knows what's going to happen if the rebels arrive,''
shop owner Mbala Nsiala said Friday. ``We hear so many stories, but
nobody knows what's going on.''
	   Thousands of people jammed sidewalk shops and markets Friday to
buy extra food and bottled water as gossip and rumors spurred fears
that Kinshasa could fall soon.
	   But whether _ or when _ that could happen was far from clear.
The rebels precise positions could not be confirmed Friday and even
Kabila's whereabouts were unknown. One senior adviser said he had
fled Kinshasa while another said he was back in the city and having
a normal workday at the Presidential Palace.
	   The president has not been seen in public since early this week,
when he met army recruits on a state television broadcast.
	   An army of Tutsi rebels, Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted
Congolese troops _ the same people who helped Kabila oust longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997 _ is marching toward Kinshasa
from Congo's western coastline in what could end Kabila's turbulent
15-month rule. The same forces already control a number of cities
in the east of the country.
	   The rebellion has fueled a surge in anti-Tutsi violence in
Kinshasa.
	   With rifles at the ready, edgy government soldiers _ some
clearly drunk _ roamed crowded neighborhoods, checking papers and
at times extracting arbitrary ``fees'' from shop owners.
	   Trucks full of loyalist troops in khaki uniforms rumbled through
Kinshasa's streets and a military helicopter buzzed overhead.
	   The rebellion began earlier this month when Tutsi-led rebels
closely tied to Rwanda fought government troops in the capital and
opened up fronts in both the east and west of Congo, formerly known
as Zaire.
	   The rebels said some of their troops had advanced as far as
Kasangalu, 20 miles (30 kilometers) southwest of the capital.
	   Bizima Karaha, the Congolese foreign minister who defected to
the rebels, said Friday that rebel troops had captured the Congo
River port of Matadi, 170 miles (275 kilometers) southwest of the
capital.
	   On Thursday, the insurgents reportedly took Inga, about 135
miles (215 kilometers) away, where the primary power transformer
for the capital is located.
	   The electricity supply was severed and remained off in Kinshasa
until Friday afternoon, when it was partially restored. It was
unclear where the electricity was coming from, but Kinshasa has a
second power source in the town of Nzongo.
	   The outage silenced state-controlled television and radio _
though state radio returned intermittently by afternoon. No
newspapers were published and banks were closed.
	   ``This is the end,'' said Jean-Pierre Mwenge, standing amid a
crowd of people searching for a way out of the city. ``Now I'm
alone and this will be the end.''
	   A primary exit route across the Congo River to Brazzaville, the
capital of neighboring Republic of Congo, was closed days ago.
	   Fearing violence in the capital, the United States was preparing
for the emergency evacuation of its citizens, sending two Marine
warships to the Atlantic waters off Congo. It will take up to 10
days for them to arrive.
	   Foreign airlines _ including Belgian, South African and
Ethiopian carriers _ stopped service to Kinshasa.
	   Congo accuses neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of masterminding the
uprising. Both countries deny involvement.
	   Congo's relations with its former allies have been deteriorating
throughout Kabila's rule, and last month he expelled Rwandan
soldiers. Uganda and Rwanda have been angered by the Congolese
president's failure to contain attacks on their territory by
renegade groups based in eastern Congo.
	   While Kabila was warmly welcomed last year by Congolese
civilians disgusted with the corrupt excesses of Mobutu, he made
little progress toward rebuilding the country. Instead, many
Congolese became increasingly disenchanted as the economy continued
to stumble, opposition political activity was outlawed and
journalists and opposition leaders were imprisoned.
	   The rebels have latched on to that discontent and on Thursday
reportedly claimed to have seized control of one-third of the
country.

A weighty _ and pricey _ look at England's Crown Jewels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY191 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It took eight art historians and gemologists 15
years to write ``The Crown Jewels: The History of the Coronation
Regalia,'' and each copy retails for as much as a small gem _ about
dlrs 1,600.
	   The limited-edition, two-volume set comes in a red slipcase and
weighs nearly 40 pounds (18 kilograms). It is 1,200 pages _ with
400 pictures _ about the Crown Jewels of England, used at every
coronation of a British monarch for 300 years.
	   Two million visitors view the jewels each year at the Tower of
London.
	   ``The Crown Jewels have never been catalogued before, although
there have been thousands of publications about them in various
languages,'' said Claude Blair, editor of the book and former
keeper of metalwork at the Victoria and Albert Museum. ``We've put
down the entire history of the coronation in England and examined
every piece in the Jewel House and put in the legends as well _ and
there are plenty of those.''
	   One piece, the royal scepter, contains the 516-carat Star of
Africa, cut from the 3,106-carat Cullinan, the biggest diamond ever
found. Legend has it that mine chairman Thomas Cullinan sent it to
King Edward VII from South Africa in the early 1900s by parcel
post.
	   ``I know the Royal Mail was very reliable in those days,'' said
Shirley Bury, who helped catalog the jewels, ``but I have my doubts
about that.''
	   England has had kings and crowns from Anglo-Saxon times,
centuries before the foundation of the ``modern'' dynasty by
William the Conqueror in 1066. The first record of a coronation is
from 785 for Egferth, King of Mercia.
	   But after the Civil War and execution of King Charles I in 1649,
the victorious Puritans of Oliver Cromwell eliminated one possible
encouragement to a royalist revival by breaking up the items that
made up the Crown Jewels, melting the plate and selling the gems.
	   The present-day treasures date only from the restoration of the
monarchy in 1660, except for a medieval spoon that apparently
survived because it was considered worthless.
	   There are 11 crowns and diadems, four scepters, two orbs, three
rings, bracelets, spurs, a rod, a staff, an ampulla and six swords.
	   There also are maces, trumpets and banners, and lots of gold and
silver plate for post-coronation banquets.
	   The Imperial State Crown alone, worn by Queen Elizabeth II to
open each new session of Parliament, contains 2,785 diamonds, 277
pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds and five rubies. The Queen's
Crown made for Queen Alexandra in 1901 has 3,688 diamonds.
	   To catalog the jewels, Blair's team could work in the Tower of
London only during the two weeks of the year the Jewel House closes
for cleaning.
	   ``It was pretty scary doing it under guard,'' said Mrs. Bury, a
jewelry expert. ``I was surprised by how many diamonds there are
and how often the crowns were remade for the varying shapes of
heads. A crown, after all, is really a hat which has to fit.''
	   The Stationery Office, the book's publisher, limited it to just
650 sets. It will be available Oct. 29.
	   One thing the book doesn't include is value estimates for the
gems.
	   ``The largest gems are worth millions in themselves,'' he said.
``But their association with the Crown Jewels gives them a
dimension of fantasy in money terms.''

Giant Columbus statue has Puerto Ricans scratching their heads

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ To advocates, it could be Puerto
Rico's Statue of Liberty: a gigantic sculpture welcoming your
tired, your sunburned, your cruise ship passengers yearning to
spend freely.
	   To doubters, it's a hideous hunk of metal _ too heavy for the
sandy peninsula that is supposed to be its home and just plain too
ugly.
	   For better or worse, the 351-foot (107-meter) bronze statue of
Christopher Columbus that has been rejected by at least five U.S.
cities soon may find a home in the Bay of San Juan.
	   Sculptor Zurab Tsereteli's creation shows the explorer at the
wheel of a tiny ship with three billowing sails behind him.
	   At twice the height of Lady Liberty, it would be the tallest
structure in this U.S. territory.
	   ``It's going to be a real tourist attraction, something to
identify Puerto Rico by,'' said Jesus Velez, spokesman of Catano,
the suburb where the statue would be located.
	   Catano Mayor Edwin Rivera claims the statue is worth the dlrs 20
million it would cost to erect because it would bring jobs to ease
the country's 10 percent unemployment. He traveled to Moscow this
week to organize shipment of the statue, which was being given to
Puerto Rico as a gift.
	   It was originally built in 1991 to mark the 500th anniversary of
Columbus' 1492 arrival in the New World. But it has been rejected
by New York; Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; Miami and Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, for reasons ranging from its cost to its appearance.
	   The Federal Aviation Administration, meanwhile, is doubtful
about its proposed location two miles from an airport that has
10,000 flights a month.
	   In March, the FAA told planners the statue would threaten
airplanes on final approach because it was 183 feet (56 meters) too
high. The administration has yet to rule on the new site, several
hundred yards (meters) west, and on Rivera's plans to mount lasers
on the structure.
	   While the statue is historically appropriate because Columbus
landed in Puerto Rico in 1493, some residents are less than
thrilled with Tsereteli's depiction of the explorer.
	   They complain the arms are too long, the head too small and the
explorer's pose _ one hand raised in a sort of stiff-armed greeting
_ makes him look ridiculous.
	   ``Call it `From Russia with Ugh,' '' opined The Baltimore Sun
when the statue was offered to that city.
	   Tsereteli's work long has inspired such reactions. The
sculptor's 400-foot-high (120- meter-high) World War II memorial
obelisk is called ``the roach on a pin'' because the goddess of
victory on top is too small to be recognized.
	   Tsereteli, Russia's best-known sculptor, also did a 310-foot
(95-meter) statue of Peter the Great that was unveiled along the
Moscow River for the city's 850th anniversary celebrations last
year. That statue survived a bombing attempt during construction
and also was roundly criticized.
	   Then there is the cost of erecting the huge statue. Community
activists already are unhappy that Rivera is building a nine-story,
dlrs 7 million city hall while its 32,500 residents suffer frequent
sewer breaks that leak raw waste directly into the bay.
	   ``Those (tourists) will have to put clothespins on their
noses,'' said Rosa Hilda Ramos, an environmental activist. ``There
are better ways to spend dlrs 20 million.''
	   Others warn that the proposed site, Esperanza Park, is a spit of
dumped sand that might not hold the statue's 600 tons.
	   If one of Puerto Rico's infrequent earthquakes hits, ``that
peninsula would be like liquid,'' said Juan Rosario Maldonado of
the environmentalist group Mision Industrial.
	   Velez said a survey showed the land was safe, but he did not
have a copy of the study.
	   Still, some Catano residents hope their monument will energize
the local economy and provide an additional attraction to the
nearby Bacardi rum distillery.
	   ``You just wait _ we'll have people coming from Russia to see
it,'' said Rafael Rodriguez, 36, a worker at Esperanza Park.

Gump in contention at PGA Championship

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Wash. (AP) _ Scott Gump lives just outside the gates of
the famed Isleworth Country Club in Orlando where Mark O'Meara, Lee
Janzen, and Tiger Woods, among others, play.
	   It's golf's high-rent district where O'Meara has his British
Open and Masters trophies from this year and Janzen has his U.S.
Open trophy.
	   Woods also has a replica trophy from the Masters he won two
years ago.
	   Gump jumped into contention in the PGA Championship on Friday
with a 1-under-par 69 and stands at 3-under 137 for 36 holes.
	   Gump fits the profile of the last nine out of 10 PGA
Championship winners who were players seeking and capturing their
first major victory.
	   Gump won two Nike Tour events and finished second three weeks
ago in the Quad City Classic. He is trying to come out of nowhere
to win the tournament like Jeff Sluman did in 1988. It's Gump's
first major of the year.
	   A course like Sahalee Country Club with its narrow fairways is
heaven for the straight-driving Gump, who is sixth on the PGA Tour
in driving accuracy.
	   ``I'm hitting fairways and greens, just doing my thing,'' Gump
said. ``I guess it can get kind of boring. It's the same old stuff
for me.''
	   Gump played collegiately at the University of Miami and reached
the semifinals of the U.S. Amateur in 1987. It was a tournament
eventually won by Billy Mayfair.
	   Gump said the pressure of a weekend in a major will be stern but
he can think of at least one event that made him tighter.
	   ``It was after I lost my tour (Nike) card and I had to qualify
again,'' Gump said. ``Now that's pressure. If I'm playing well, not
much is going to bother me. If I'm playing poorly, I'm more
frustrated from playing good or bad than I am where I am.''
	   Gump said he can call on his experience at Quad City to help.
	   ``Finishing second in Moline is really going to give me a lot of
confidence,'' he said. ``That was fun for me. I missed by one shot.
Steve Jones beat me. And we were doing the whole press thing.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Roy Lassiter scored twice as D.C. United
advanced to the final of the CONCACAF Champions Cup, beating Leon
of Mexico 2-0 Friday night.
	   Lassiter, who had four goals in Tuesday's 8-0 quarterfinal win
over Joe Public of Trinidad and Tobago, has 22 goals in his last 26
league and cup games.
	   United, which plays Toluca of Mexico or Saprissa of Costa Rica
on Sunday for the championship, is trying to become the first
American club to win the annual tournament, which features the top
teams from last season in the top leagues of North and Central
America and the Caribbean.
	   Lassiter scored in the 10th and 61st minutes for D.C. United,
the Major League Soccer champion in 1996 and '97.
	   The first goal was set up by Jaime Moreno's nifty pass. Moreno
drew two defenders along the left sideline before slotting the ball
to Lassiter, alone at the far post.
	   His second score came after Angel David Comizzo tried to make a
sliding stop as Lassiter dribbled into the penalty area. Lassiter
jumped over the goalkeeper, then beat a defender trying to cover
the open net.
	   Players had to be restrained from fighting in the first half and
again in the 92nd minute.

	   President Bill Clinton will become the first president to
testify in a criminal investigation of his own conduct, but other
presidents have given testimony in criminal matters:
	   In 1990, former President Ronald Reagan testified for the
defense in the Iran-Contra trial of his former national security
adviser, John Poindexter. Poindexter was convicted on five felony
counts, but the convictions were later overturned on appeal.
	   While in office, President Gerald Ford gave a videotaped
deposition in the trial of Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, who was
convicted in 1975 of trying to assassinate him.
	   President Jimmy Carter twice testified on videotape. He
testified in 1978 for the prosecution in a federal gambling
conspiracy case against Georgia state Sen. Culver Kidd, who was
acquitted and in a grand jury investigation of fugitive financier
Robert Vesco.
	   The first attempt to obtain testimony from a sitting president
in a criminal trial was made by Aaron Burr, who stood trial in 1807
on charges of treason.
	   Burr sought to force a court appearance by then-President Thomas
Jefferson, under whom Burr had served as vice president during
Jefferson's first term. Jefferson was ordered to appear by Chief
Justice John Marshall, who presided at the trial. But Jefferson
eventually avoided the appearance after releasing information Burr
sought.

London gentleman's club sells Winnie's copyright to Disney

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix coding &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A London gentleman's club that owns the rights to
Winnie the Pooh said it agreed Friday to sell the copyright to the
Walt Disney Corp. to use for 20 years.
	   Members of the Garrick Club said that they had turned down the
chance to pocket a windfall of about 40,000 pounds (dlrs 60,000)
each from the sale, and instead decided that the money would be
split between providing for the club's upkeep, and a charitable
trust.
	   ``What we've agreed is that a charitable trust will be set up,
if this money comes through from the Disney organization,'' said
John Gale, adding, ``I can't imagine a situation where the club,
which is an honorable institution, would vote to give themselves a
windfall. I would be appalled,'' said Gale.
	   Claudia Peters, a spokesman for Disney, said that the talks over
the rights to Winnie were ``ongoing'' and refused to make any
further statement.
	   About 400 members of the central London club, established in
1831 as a meeting place for actors, writers and politicians, met to
discuss the issue lunchtime Friday. Prince Charles is one of about
1,000 members of the club, although he was not present at the
meeting.
	   Winnie's author, A.A. Milne, left the rights to the honey-loving
bear and his friends to five beneficiaries: the Garrick Club;
exclusive Westminster School; The Royal Literary Fund; his own
family and that of illustrator EH Shepard.
	   Press Association, a British news agency, reported that the Walt
Disney Corp. already owns the rights to all A.A. Milne's works and
characters until 2006, but wants to secure them a new offer until
2026. Disney currently pays each of the beneficiaries about 2
million pounds (dlrs 3.2 million) per year for using Milne's works,
Press Association said.

50 years after amateur triumph, Hall of Famer returns to Lytham

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Same old clubhouse. Same old
pounding wind. Same old driving rain.
	   Louise Suggs, one of the LPGA original Hall of Famers, returned
to Lytham St. Annes 50 years after she won the British Amateur
Championship to see that virtually nothing had changed.
	   The day after some of the top players of the '90s yielded to the
wind and rainy conditions and came up with scores in the high 70s
and low 80s, Suggs said they should have been here when she played
in 1948.
	   ``The weather was really worse when we played here than it was
yesterday afternoon,'' she said Friday.
	   ``I spoke to a golf historian here who said it was the worst
weather he had ever seen for a tournament. And we had to play 36
holes each day. It was two matches a day for six days.
	   ``I've never been so tired in my life.''
	   Suggs said she was invited back by the Royal Lytham and St.
Annes club to mark the 50th anniversary of her amateur championship
victory. She recalled beating Scotland's Jean Donald 2 up.
	   ``I remember my second shot at the (par 4) 13th hole. There was
a strong crosswind so I aimed my shot 50 yards (46 meters) to the
right and the wind blew it straight into the hole.
	   ``I had hit first and a gentleman said that the ball had gone
into the hole. Jean was ready to hit hers and she needed it for a
half and she almost did hole it.''
	   Suggs said she recognized the 100-year-old clubhouse as soon as
she saw it and then checked out the course.
	   ``They've changed a couple of the holes and removed a few
trees,'' she said. ``But coming back here brings back so many
memories.''
	   Now approaching her 75th birthday, Suggs, who won the U.S.
Amateur Championship in 1947, the British version in '48 and, after
turning pro, the U.S. Open in '49 and '52, retired after her last
title victory in 1962.
	   She says she rarely plays now but prefers to teach golf at
Cloister, a club at Sea Island, Georgia.
	   ``If they had 14 hole golf course I could make it,'' she said.
	   Suggs, who had 50 career victories as a pro including eight
majors, was one of the first four players inducted into the Hall of
Fame in 1951. The others were Patty Berg, Betty Jameson and Babe
Didrikson Zaharias.
	   She began playing with wooden shafts as well as clubheads and
recalled that she played the first few tournaments with a set of
clubs that didn't match.
	   Suggs said that modern day players gain a big advantage from the
technology that produces top-quality clubs.
	   ``They are not really shot makers like we were,'' she said.
``They just stand up, hit the ball and go chase it.''
	   Suggs recalled that when the U.S. Curtis Cup team sailed to
England in 1948, the players responded to an invitation from their
hosts by bringing chocolate, instant coffee, tins of ham, sugar
cubes and a gross of nylon stockings, items in short supply in
post-war Britain.
	   ``I remember offering someone some chewing gum,'' she said.
``They hadn't seen it before.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Stricker finishing at 137; quote from Love; will
be updated when Day finishes his round &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ The second round of the PGA
Championship turned into a second chance for Vijay Singh and Colin
Montgomerie.
	   Both of them know the pain of coming close to winning their
first major. By keeping it straight and simple at Sahalee Country
Club, both of them got into contention once again Friday.
	   Singh made five birdies on the first nine holes and matched the
course record that Tiger Woods set the day before, a 4-under-par 66
that put him at 136 going into the weekend.
	   ``Each year you play, you gain a little more experience, a lot
more know-how to handle a situation like I'm in now,'' said Singh,
who came up two strokes short of a playoff in the 1993 PGA
Championship.
	   Right behind him was Montgomerie, in pursuit of his first major
championship and in contention for the first time since he lost by
one stroke to Ernie Els in the U.S. Open last year.
	   He made three key par saves in a round of 67 that put him at
137, along with Scott Gump and Steve Stricker.
	   ``I haven't come over here to finish second,'' said Montgomerie,
who has done just that in three previous majors. ``The hardest
thing to do is get into contention. We'll go from there.''
	   The high, heavenly ground of Sahalee was full of high hopes for
a couple of players chasing history.
	   Davis Love III is trying to become the only repeat winner since
the PGA went to stroke play in 1958 and the first since Denny Shute
in 1937. He worked his way into the hunt with a 68 that put him
just two strokes back at 138, along with Tiger Woods, Brad Faxon,
Andrew Magee and former PGA champion Steve Elkington.
	   And never count out Mark O'Meara, undaunted by the pressure of
trying to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win
three majors in one season.
	   Just like he did in winning the Masters and the British Open,
the 41-year-old O'Meara just plugged along until making a thrilling
move that thrust him to 3-under, one off the lead.
	   Woods couldn't hold a first-round lead for the second straight
major. He followed a 65 in the British Open with a 73. And one day
after making seven birdies at Sahalee, he didn't get his first
until the 16th.
	   ``I made a lot of putts just to hang in there,'' Woods said.
``I'm only two back, and that's perfect. That's where I need to
be.''
	   Stricker became only the fourth player to reach 5-under at
Sahalee, but it didn't last long. After four birdies on the first
seven holes on the back nine gave him the lead, he took double
bogey at No. 17.
	   Glen Day followed four straight bogeys with two straight birdies
to get to 2-under with two holes to play.
	   As Woods proved early in his round Friday, that's not always
easy.
	   He left the driver in his bag once again, but that wasn't the
problem. Woods missed a birdie putt on the second hole,
three-putted on No. 4 and took another bogey after hitting his
3-wood into the rough on the par-4 sixth.
	   Woods took 34 putts on Friday, after needing 27 the day before.
	   Singh, who has won five times on the PGA Tour and 18 other times
around the world, was a relative unknown in the PGA in 1993 when he
finished out of the playoff at Inverness, which Paul Azinger won
over Greg Norman.
	   Singh's only lapses were missing the green on the par-5 11th
with a 9-iron and hitting into the bunker on the par-3 17th, the
only two bogeys in an otherwise steady performance.
	   Montgomerie took a different route, holding his round together
with superb par saves on three consecutive holes on the front _
from the edge of the cart path on No. 6, from the bunker on No. 7
and with a putt on No. 8 after missing the green to the right.
	   The group at 139 included Frank Lickliter, David Frost and John
Cook. No one else was under par with about 36 players still on the
course.
	   Phil Mickelson took a double bogey on the par-5 second hole but
still managed a 70 and was at even-par 140. Paul Azinger needed a
birdie-birdie finish to salvage a 73 and was at 141, along with
Fred Funk and Scott Hoch.
	   Tom Watson shot 76 and missed the cut at 148. It was the first
time in his Hall of Fame career that Watson went through a year
without making the cut in a major.
	   David Duval, the leading money-winner on the PGA Tour, also shot
78 and was headed home early. His worst finish in a major this year
was a tie for 11th in the British Open.
	   Justin Leonard, who had failed to break par just once in 13
previous PGA Championship rounds, followed a triple bogey with a
double bogey, shot 77 and missed the cut.

Love reaches for the driver, a bad move at Sahalee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Davis Love III had just sunk a long
birdie putt on the 14th hole to get within a shot of the lead and
the defending PGA champion was pumped.
	   Reaching into his bag on the 15th tee he pulled out the driver
he hadn't used since the sixth hole.
	   Bad move at Sahalee Country Club.
	   Six strokes later, Love's ball had finally escaped the woods and
found itself in the bottom of the hole. But the lead that was so
tantalizingly close Friday had slipped away, at least for another
day.
	   ``I just made a terrible swing,'' Love said. ``The last driver I
hit was on the sixth hole and it's hard to hit any big clubs after
hitting irons off the tee so long.''
	   Love would come back to sink a birdie putt on the 17th hole and
save par from the rough on 18. It was enough for a 68 that got him
to 2-under for the tournament, but not enough to catch leader Vijay
Singh.
	   Still, Love was anything but unhappy after putting himself in
position for a weekend run at his second PGA Championship.
	   ``It's a good spot to be in,'' he said of his position two shots
out of the lead. ``I feel very fortunate to be in the tournament. I
survived yesterday and came back today to play a lot better.''
	   Love, whose emotional victory last year at Winged Foot was the
first major championship of a 13-year pro career, shot only two
strokes better than his opening-round 70. But there was a world of
difference between the way the two rounds were shot.
	   Love was coming out of shots all day Thursday and had to
scramble around the course to salvage his round. He and his caddie
_ brother Mark _ went to the driving range afterward and Love
finally figured out what swing adjustment he had to make.
	   ``I only hit five or six bad shots today and I'd be lying if I
said I hit five or six good shots yesterday,'' Love said. ``There
was a world of difference in the way I played.''
	   One of those bad shots came on the 15th tee, when Love took out
the driver, then hit a huge slice into the monstrous trees that
line the fairways at Sahalee.
	   Not only did the ball go into the woods, it rolled to a stop in
a bush beneath one of the trees and Love had to take an unplayable
lie and a penalty stroke. He managed to hit a wedge near the green,
but couldn't get up and down and made double bogey-6.
	   Some players, like Tiger Woods, didn't use their drivers all day
on the narrow fairways. Love had planned all along to use his on
the second, sixth and 15th holes.
	   ``I would do it again,'' he said. ``I just made a terrible
swing. Those were the swings I made yesterday, just coming out of
the ball.''
	   The mistake was a rare one on a day when Love was beginning to
feel the confidence of playing in a major championship after
already having won one.
	   ``I feel like I'm a little more comfortable with the situation
of playing in a major championship,'' he said. ``I just keep trying
to remember the way I played last year and I think good things will
happen.''

Chinese president rallies nation to fight floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ All Chinese must rally to fight summer floods
that have affected one-fifth of the Chinese population, leaving
millions homeless, President Jiang Zemin said in remarks carried
Saturday by state media.
	   Jiang, who traveled to flood zones earlier in the week, warned
that the floods were reaching a crucial stage and that carelessness
could cause huge losses, the newspaper China Daily said.
	   With millions stranded on sweltering dikes along the raging
Yangtze River, with little shelter, clean water or food, Jiang
urged flood workers to guard against the spread of diseases and
prevent crime.
	   ``People must wade through waist high water to go about their
daily life,'' the Red Cross reported from one flood-hit province.
	   Already, 10,000 medical teams are handing out food, water
purification tablets and medical supplies and evacuating people in
flooded areas.
	   But shortages of funds are delaying relief efforts, the Red
Cross said. It appealed urgently for money to provide food, water
purification tablets and medical supplies to one million people.
	   It also warned that the floods threaten efforts to control snail
fever in some areas and said outbreaks of this tropical disease may
increase.
	   Xinhua reported Friday that this year's floods had killed 625
people in Hunan, one of the worst-hit provinces along the Yangtze.
Nationwide, the death toll from summer flooding stands at more than
2,000.
	   Meanwhile, state radio reported that Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress and former premier, had traveled to
northeastern China to view flood relief efforts there.
	   One million civilians and soldiers were mobilized for ``a
round-the-clock fight'' against the worst-ever floods on the Nen
and Songhua rivers, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   A major levee protecting China's largest oil field in
northeastern Heilongjiang, which borders Russia, gave way Friday,
forcing the closure of some wells, Xinhua reported.
	   More than 200,000 people were fighting flooding in Daqing, a
city of 2.34 million people and home of the field that produced
half of China's oil output last year, it said.
	   But a lack of manpower forced the abandonment of efforts to
repair the levee that collapsed some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from
the city center, forcing the evacuation of some 20,000 people.
Workers were building a barrier near the oil field to protect it
from the floods, the report added.
	   To the west, along the Nen River in Inner Mongolia, 113,600
people remained stranded by floods that began August 8 and left
414,000 people homeless, Xinhua reported.
	   Floods and landslides have been reported from many areas of
China, as a rain belt swells rivers across China.

Schett, de Swardt advance to semifinals in BostonCup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new grafs 3-5 to include Saturday's semifinal
matchups &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLESLEY, Massachusetts (AP) _ Seventh-seeded Barbara Schett of
Austria stunned top seed Amanda Coetzer of South Africa 6-7 (3-7),
6-4, 6-1 to highlight an afternoon of upsets at the BostonCup on
Friday.
	   The second seed also fell as Mariaan de Swardt of South Africa
dropped Anke Huber of Germany 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
	   Schett advances to Saturday's semifinals where she will play
Cary Black of Zimbabwe. Black defeated Elena Likhovtseva of Russia
on Friday evening 1-6, 6-1, 6-2, winning the final five games of
the second set and coverting two breaks in the final set.
	   De Swardt advances to play Lisa Raymond, the highest remaining
seed at No. 3.
	   Schett rallied after failing to convert a set point on her serve
in the opening set. She controlled the action from the baseline
after that, forcing Coetzer into erratic play.
	   ``I played more aggressively in the last two sets,'' Schett
said. ``This was the most important win of my career.''
	   Schett's victory over Coetzer, the eighth-ranked player in the
world, ensures Schett a seed in the U.S. Open, which begins in
three weeks.
	   Meanwhile, in the other upset, Huber showed lingering effects of
her foot surgery in April. De Swardt returned serve effectively to
capture the first-set tiebreaker and then simply outplayed the
second seed to win the next set. This was Huber's second tournament
since the surgery.
	   Raymond, the third seed, defeated eighth-seeded Corina Morariu,
7-6 (7-5), 6-2 in the final match of the afternoon.
	   In doubles action Friday, de Swardt and Mary Joe Fernandez
topped Naoko Kuimuta and Nana Mijagi 6-1, 7-6.

Inquiry to recommend general be tried over kidnappings, report says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Single name for Wiranto is correct

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An armed forces inquiry will recommend
that an army general, who is the son-in-law of former President
Suharto, be court-martialled over the kidnapping and torture of
political activists, news reports said Saturday.
	   A seven-member military panel questioned Lt. Gen. Prabowo
Subianto behind closed doors this week about the abductions of
dozens of anti-Suharto activists in the months before his
father-in-law quit in May amid riots and protests.
	   Human rights activists have accused top military brass of
ordering the abductions.
	   Prabowo rose fast through the ranks while Suharto was in power,
but his career suddenly stalled when the former leader ended his
32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Prabowo, 46, has since been the target of numerous allegations
of wrongdoing, the most serious relating to the abductions that
were allegedly carried out by troops under his command in
Indonesia's special forces, known as Kopassus.
	   ``We'll recommend that Prabowo be court-martialled,'' the head
of the inquiry and military chief of staff, Gen. Subagyo
Hadisiswoyo, was quoted as saying by the Jakarta Post.
	   However, Subagyo said the military's top commander, Gen.
Wiranto, who is also defense minister, must make the ultimate
decision on whether Prabowo should be subjected to a military
trial.
	   Many regard Wiranto and Prabowo as longtime rivals within
Indonesia's politically powerful armed forces.
	   It is not clear what charges might be filed.
	   Investigators have already arrested 10 special forces troops,
alleging they were involved in the kidnapping of more than two
dozen activists in 1997 and earlier this year. Fourteen people
remain missing. Many fear they are dead.
	   Those that have been released said they were abducted, tortured
and questioned about their political activities. Prabowo was in
charge of the special forces at the time.
	   On Wednesday, Subagyo said that during testimony to the inquiry,
known as an honor council, Prabowo had repeated an earlier pledge
to take responsibility for the kidnappings if his troops were found
guilty.
	   Without elaborating, Subagyo said that Prabowo had admitted that
he ``wrongly analyzed'' military procedures.
	   Prabowo has been suspended from duty pending the outcome of the
investigation.

Singh looking for redemption at PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Day at 139 &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ The second round of the PGA
Championship turned into a second chance for Vijay Singh and Colin
Montgomerie.
	   Both of them know the pain of coming close to winning their
first major. By keeping it straight and simple at Sahalee Country
Club, both of them got into contention once again Friday.
	   Singh made five birdies on the first nine holes and matched the
course record that Tiger Woods set the day before, a 4-under-par 66
that put him at 136 going into the weekend.
	   ``Each year you play, you gain a little more experience, a lot
more know-how to handle a situation like I'm in now,'' said Singh,
who came up two strokes short of a playoff in the 1993 PGA
Championship.
	   Right behind him was Montgomerie, in pursuit of his first major
championship and in contention for the first time since he lost by
one stroke to Ernie Els in the U.S. Open last year.
	   He made three key par saves in a round of 67 that put him at
137, along with Scott Gump and Steve Stricker.
	   ``I haven't come over here to finish second,'' said Montgomerie,
who has done just that in three previous majors. ``The hardest
thing to do is get into contention. We'll go from there.''
	   The high, heavenly ground of Sahalee was full of high hopes for
a couple of players chasing history.
	   Davis Love III is trying to become the only repeat winner since
the PGA went to stroke play in 1958 and the first since Denny Shute
in 1937. He worked his way into the hunt with a 68 that put him
just two strokes back at 138, along with Tiger Woods, Brad Faxon,
Andrew Magee and former PGA champion Steve Elkington.
	   And never count out Mark O'Meara, undaunted by the pressure of
trying to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win
three majors in one season.
	   Just like he did in winning the Masters and the British Open,
the 41-year-old O'Meara just plugged along until making a thrilling
move that thrust him to 3-under, one off the lead.
	   Woods couldn't hold a first-round lead for the second straight
major. He followed a 65 in the British Open with a 73. And one day
after making seven birdies at Sahalee, he didn't get his first
until the 16th.
	   ``I made a lot of putts just to hang in there,'' Woods said.
``I'm only two back, and that's perfect. That's where I need to
be.''
	   Stricker became only the fourth player to reach 5-under at
Sahalee, but it didn't last long. After four birdies on the first
seven holes on the back nine gave him the lead, he took double
bogey at No. 17.
	   Glen Day followed four straight bogeys with two straight birdies
to get to 2-under with two holes to play.
	   As Woods proved early in his round Friday, that's not always
easy.
	   He left the driver in his bag once again, but that wasn't the
problem. Woods missed a birdie putt on the second hole,
three-putted on No. 4 and took another bogey after hitting his
3-wood into the rough on the par-4 sixth.
	   Woods took 34 putts on Friday, after needing 27 the day before.
	   Singh, who has won five times on the PGA Tour and 18 other times
around the world, was a relative unknown in the PGA in 1993 when he
finished out of the playoff at Inverness, which Paul Azinger won
over Greg Norman.
	   Singh's only lapses were missing the green on the par-5 11th
with a 9-iron and hitting into the bunker on the par-3 17th, the
only two bogeys in an otherwise steady performance.
	   Montgomerie took a different route, holding his round together
with superb par saves on three consecutive holes on the front _
from the edge of the cart path on No. 6, from the bunker on No. 7
and with a putt on No. 8 after missing the green to the right.
	   The group at 139 included Frank Lickliter, David Frost and John
Cook and Glen Day. No one else was under par with about 36 players
still on the course.
	   Phil Mickelson took a double bogey on the par-5 second hole but
still managed a 70 and was at even-par 140. Paul Azinger needed a
birdie-birdie finish to salvage a 73 and was at 141, along with
Fred Funk and Scott Hoch.
	   Tom Watson shot 76 and missed the cut at 148. It was the first
time in his Hall of Fame career that Watson went through a year
without making the cut in a major.
	   David Duval, the leading money-winner on the PGA Tour, also shot
78 and was headed home early. His worst finish in a major this year
was a tie for 11th in the British Open.
	   Justin Leonard, who had failed to break par just once in 13
previous PGA Championship rounds, followed a triple bogey with a
double bogey, shot 77 and missed the cut.

	   ``Of course, I'm very happy,'' said Ellene Sana, 36, a social
activist from the Philippines. ``I didn't want to stay there any
longer.''
	   The activists were convicted in a one-day trial Friday before a
judge of violating an Emergency Provisions Act dating from 1950 and
sentenced to five years' hard labor.
	   The catch-all law has been used to sentence hundreds of
political prisoners to terms as long as 20 years.
	   Almost immediately, though, government officials announced that
their sentence was reduced and they would be deported Saturday.
They spent their last night in Myanmar in a police guest house.
	   The activists included six Americans, three Indonesians, three
Malaysians, three Thais, two Philippines citizens and an
Australian.

What's causing Russia's financial crisis?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ When it comes to financial markets, perception is
reality. And the perception among investors that Russia's economy
is in trouble is helping to generate the very crisis they fear.
	   For the last several months, investors have been pulling out of
Russian stocks and bonds in hordes, and the few who remained seem
to be losing their nerve.
	   The Russian stock market has been volatile in recent days. Sharp
drops in share prices forced trading to be suspended twice this
week, and a similarly sharp rebound on Friday _ ending up nearly 14
percent _ also caused a 15-minute break.
	   Moreover, rumors of bank defaults have begun to spread despite
Central Bank denials, and the ruble continued to drop.
	   The stock market remains at about half its previous value, and
talk of a ruble devaluation has reached a fever pitch despite
repeated denials from the government.
	   ``No, we are not going to devalue the ruble,'' President Boris
Yeltsin said on a visit to the northern city of Novgorod.
	   His assurances are important because ultimately, analysts say,
the crisis is mostly psychological _ a crisis of confidence more
than cash.
	   ``The main burden right now is managing the psychological
atmosphere,'' said Alan Rousso, director of the Moscow office of
the Carnegie Endowment, a U.S.-based think tank.
	   As banks and other depositors lose confidence in Russia, they
are shifting their assets into dollars and forcing the government
to buy back rubles using its foreign currency reserves.
	   If and when the government decides it cannot keep depleting its
reserves to buy rubles, the price of the ruble will fall, or
devalue, compared with other currencies. And that would raise
prices and spur inflation.
	   ``If the market's confidence doesn't return soon, the government
will be forced to consider devaluation,'' said Inna Francis, an
analyst with Moscow's United Financial Group.
	   Many analysts point out that Russia's underlying economic
indicators have not changed since last year, when investor
enthusiasm spurred the stock market to new heights, making it the
world's best performer.
	   Francis provides a stark example of the change in mood: Last
July, when the government faced a 40 percent revenue shortfall, the
stock market was soaring. This July, when the shortfall was only 10
percent, the stock market sank.
	   ``It's all a matter of sentiment,'' she says.
	   So what's causing this summer's panic?
	   Russia faces a number of serious economic travails, and no
single problem can be considered the cause of the crisis. But
cumulatively, they are enough to make investors nervous, especially
in the wake of last year's Asian crisis.
	   Among the factors:
	   _ Oil prices. The crisis was touched off several months ago by a
steep drop in world prices for oil, which is Russia's major export
and source of hard currency earnings.
	   _ Central Bank reserves. The Central Bank has dlrs 17 billion in
reserves, bolstered by a recent multibillion dollar International
Monetary Fund loan. Some analysts say that is enough to defend the
ruble for weeks or months, but it is not clear whether it will be
too little for the long term.
	   _ Federal budget deficit. The collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991 left Russia without a tax collection system, and the
government has had trouble putting one in place. As a result, the
government has struggled to find cash to pay salaries, bonds and
make loan payments.
	   _ Short-term debt. The government borrowed heavily following the
Soviet collapse, and many of those debts are now coming due. The
government has to pay them in dollars, which further strains its
reserves.
	   _ Long-term economic growth. The Russian economy posted its
first post-Soviet growth last year, and before the crisis,
indications were that the growth would continue. But Russia has
been unable to build up much of its own industry, making it heavily
dependent on consumer imports and vulnerable to price fluctuations
for its exports, especially oil.
	   The government is taking every measure it can think of to raise
cash and reassure investors. It can't do anything about oil prices,
but it is tightening tax collection and making its debt payments on
time.
	   But ultimately, investor confidence is as much a matter of
feeling as fact.
	   ``The government has done all it can to address the crisis,''
says Rousso. ``Unfortunately, the outcome depends on sentiments
over which the government has little control.''

Mexican police arrest German accused in European cocaine ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Acting on a German extradition request,
police in the Caribbean coast town of Playa de Carmen Thursday
arrested a German man accused of establishing a European cocaine
distribution ring.
	   The man, Otto Alexander Nesnidal, 35, allegedly purchased
cocaine in Mexico and sold it in Germany and Austria, feeding a
continent-wide distribution network, the Attorney General's Office
said in a press statement.
	   Nesnidal allegedly centered his Mexican operations in Playa de
Carmen, a beach town about 40 miles (65 kms) south of Cancun. He
was taken to a Mexico City prison to await extradition proceedings.

Six policemen in Mexican border city arrested in kidnapping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Six officers of a specialized police group in
Ciudad Juarez were arrested Friday after they were identified by a
woman they allegedly kidnapped and demanded a dlrs 10,000 ransom
for her release.
	   The woman was allegedly kidnapped and held by the policemen for
five hours inside a patrol car in Ciudad Juarez, just south of El
Paso, Texas, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   The 22-year-old victim, who was not identified, told prosecutors
the police threatened to charge her with drug possession unless her
family paid the ransom.
	   The police officers, members of the city's Eastern Tactical
Force, were arrested by a special anti-kidnapping squad as they
waited for the ransom money.

Thousands march in three Honduran cities against economic policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ About 20,000 union supporters
staged marches in three Honduran cities Friday to protest tax
increases implemented by President Carlos Flores Facusse.
	   Carrying placards and chanting slogans in favor of a general
wage hike, the protesters marched past lines of anti-riot police in
the cities of Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba.
	   ``This is the peaceful but forceful action by the unions ...
later we will adopt extreme measures to achieve our goals,'' said
Daniel Duron, a march organizer.
	   Duron mentioned road blockades and takeovers of government
offices as possible future tactics in the protest, which was
organized by the General Workers' Center and leftist Unitary
Workers Confederation, both labor federations.
	   Flores Facusse recently increased sales taxes from seven to 12
percent, in a bid to trim the country's dlrs 200 million budget
deficit and dlrs 4.2 billion foreign debt.

Bryant wins 1-meter springboard, Dumais leads 3-meter competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Katie Beth Bryant won the 1-meter springboard in
the U.S. Diving Summer Nationals on Friday night, giving the
Louisiana State University recruit a sweep of the spring and summer
championships.
	   Bryant, of Moultrie, took the lead on the fourth of five dives
at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center, and held off Jennifer Dixon by
3.18 points. Bryant and Dixon will represent the United States in
the World Diving Cup in January at Wellington, New Zealand.
	   ``This was such a surprise. I am so excited,'' said Bryant, who
grew up in Chatham, Ill., but moved to Georgia to train during high
school. ``I feel like I'm speechless, and that never happens.''
	   Bryant scored 58.32 points on her fourth dive, an inward 1 1/2
somersault, and added 49.14 points in her final dive, a reverse 1
1/2 somersault with 1 1/2 twists.
	   Dixon, 23, said the silver medal was the highlight of her
career.
	   ``I've been trying for this for 18 years,'' she said. ``I
couldn't be more excited.''
	   Erica Sorgi, 16, finished third, 5.16 points behind Bryant.
	   In the men's 3-meter springboard, Chris Devine edged P.J. Bogart
by 0.03 points to take the top seeding in Saturday's final.
	   Troy Dumais, by virtue of executing the most semifinal attempts
with highest degrees of difficulty, will carry the most points into
the final.
	   Dumais has 239.46 points, followed by Bogart with 225.36, and
David Pichler with 214.65. Devine is fourth with 214.38.
	   ``I gave away a little on my first two voluntaries,'' said
Devine, Penn State's 3-meter gold medalist in the 1994 Big Ten
Championships. ``That right there probably cost me 15-20 points.''
	   Devine said his best dives were his second and last of the
quarterfinal. He scored 73.44 points on a forward 2 1/2 somersault
with two twists and, four dives later, got 63 points on a reverse 3
1/2 somersault.
	   The fourth dive of the quarterfinal was pivotal for Devine,
Bogart and Pichler, all of whom secured the first three places and
never relinquished their standings.
	   But Bogart said his first dive of the semis was his best. He was
awarded one score of 9.0 and three of 8.5 on the forward 1 1/2
somersault.
	   ``I'm happy I'm not the leader,'' Bogart said. ``I like to kind
of hang in the back.''
	   Pichler, a 1996 Olympian who is making a comeback at age 29, got
four 8.0s on his last dive of the quarterfinal _ a reverse 1 1/2
somersault with 3 1/2 twists and a 3.3 difficulty rating.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Roy Lassiter scored twice as D.C. United
advanced to the final of the CONCACAF Champions Cup, beating Leon
of Mexico 2-0 Friday night.
	   In the second semifinal, Mexican League champion Toluca beat
Saprissa of Costa Rica 3-2 on penalty kicks after the two teams
tied 1-1 in regulation.
	   Lassiter, who had four goals in Tuesday's 8-0 quarterfinal win
over Joe Public of Trinidad and Tobago, has 22 goals in his last 26
league and cup games.
	   United, which plays Toluca on Sunday for the championship, is
trying to become the first American club to win the annual
tournament, which features the top teams from last season in the
top leagues of North and Central America and the Caribbean.
	   Lassiter scored in the 10th and 61st minutes for D.C. United,
the Major League Soccer champion in 1996 and '97.
	   The first goal was set up by Jaime Moreno's nifty pass. Moreno
drew two defenders along the left sideline before slotting the ball
to Lassiter, alone at the far post.
	   His second score came after Angel David Comizzo tried to make a
sliding stop as Lassiter dribbled into the penalty area. Lassiter
jumped over the goalkeeper, then beat a defender trying to cover
the open net.
	   Players had to be restrained from fighting in the first half and
again in the 92nd minute.
	   In the second game, Toluca goalkeeper Hernan Cristante, a 90th
minute substitute, saved three of the five penalty kicks he faced.
	   Jose Manuel Abundis, Rafael Garcia and Fabian Estay scored on
penalty kicks for Toluca.
	   Toluca's first score came on an own goal in the 31st minute.
	   Saprissa defender Victor Cordero tried to clear the ball with
his head, but put it past keeper Erick Lonnis.
	   Cordero atoned for the error with an assist on Alejandro
Sequiera's goal in the 59th minute.

John McEnroe advances to semifinals of the Citibank Champions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PURCHASE, New York (AP) _ John McEnroe rallied in the second-set
tiebreak Friday to defeat Mikael Pernfors 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) and
advance to the semifinals of the Citibank Champions senior tennis
tournament.
	   It was the first time McEnroe and Pernfors had met since the
1990 Australian Open, when McEnroe was defaulted while trailing
6-1, 4-6, 7-5, 2-4.
	   This time, McEnroe controlled his temper and the match, breezing
through the opening set before squandering a 4-2 lead in the
second.
	   ``I choked a little bit in the second set,'' McEnroe said. ``I
could see him coming in and I guess I tried to thread the needle a
little too closely. But I feel like I'm improving. I'm serving
well. I feel good.''
	   The second-seeded McEnroe will face Tim Wilkison in Saturday
night's semifinals. Wilkison advanced Friday with a 6-1, 6-1
drubbing of Peter Fleming, McEnroe's one-time doubles partner.
	   ``He just kept me back on the baseline and on my heels the whole
time,'' Pernfors said of McEnroe. ``I didn't feel like I was
controlling anything during that match.''
	   The other semifinal will pit John Lloyd against Mansour Bahrami.
Lloyd advanced when top-seeded Jimmy Connors pulled out of their
quarterfinal match with a foot injury. Bahrami captured the last
semifinal spot when he beat Andes Gomez 5-7, 6-2, 10-3 Champions
Tiebreak.
	   The Citibank Champions is the sixth event on the 1998-99 Nuveen
Tour and the ninth event on the ATP Tour-sanctioned worldwide
senior tennis circuit.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Eighteen foreign activists jailed by
the military junta in Myanmar for distributing anti-government
leaflets were expelled from that country Saturday and arrived in
Bangkok, where several relatives were waiting.
	   ``Of course, I'm very happy,'' said Ellene Sana, 36, a social
activist from the Philippines. ``I didn't want to stay there any
longer.''
	   The activists were convicted in a one-day trial Friday before a
judge of violating an Emergency Provisions Act dating from 1950 and
sentenced to five years' hard labor.
	   The catchall law has been used to sentence hundreds of political
prisoners to terms as long as 20 years in Myanmar, also known as
Burma.
	   Almost immediately after sentencing, Myanmar officials announced
that the sentence was suspended and they would be deported
Saturday. They spent their last night in Myanmar in a police guest
house.
	   The activists included six Americans, three Indonesians, three
Malaysians, three Thais, two Philippines citizens and an
Australian.
	   Family members, fellow activists and U.S. Congressman Chris
Smith, chairman of the House International Operations and Human
Rights subcommittee, congratulated each other as they waited at the
Bangkok airport's VIP lounge for the Myanmar Airways flight.
	   A banner hung in the lounge read ``Welcome Home, Democracy
Heroes.'' Relatives carried bouquets of flowers.
	   Smith, a New Jersey Republican, had traveled to Bangkok to press
for the release of the activists in the neighboring country, but he
was denied a visa to enter Myanmar.
	   One of the activists, Michele Keegan, 19, of Hamilton Township,
New Jersey, is his constituent.
	   The activists were whisked off to a news conference as they
arrived. Their family members shrieked with joy as they appeared in
the lounge.
	   The activists, who belong to overseas groups opposed to
Myanmar's government, had entered the country as tourists last week
ahead of the 10th anniversary of a nationwide uprising against
military rule.
	   The uprising resulted in a change of leadership, but the
military retained power and the demonstrations were eventually
crushed with bullets and bayonets. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   Last Sunday, the activists passed out small leaflets in
different parts of Yangon, the Myanmar capital, urging people to
remember the uprising and not give up their hope for human rights
and democracy. Myanmar's people were calm on the anniversary.
	   An organization working with the activists announced the
campaign well before they were to even try to leave the country,
but claimed that their arrest and the attendant bad publicity for
the government was not a goal.
	   The activists were arrested _ Myanmar's capital swarms with
security agents _ and questioned for the next six days at various
police facilities. The government accused them of trying to incite
unrest.
	   Diplomatic pressure built from most of their home countries for
their release. Some acknowledged that Myanmar's laws had been
broken and the activists knew the risks they took, while others
said that there was no crime handing out pieces of paper.
	   The detainees ranged in age from 19 to 51 and included students,
social activists, academics, lawyers and a businessmen.
	   Diplomats were caught by surprise Friday when the activists were
suddenly put on trial in a concrete courtroom just outside the
walls of Insein Prison, where hundreds of political prisoners are
kept.
	   The trial, open to some diplomats and journalists, was only the
second public trial in 10 years. There was no jury, and diplomatic
observers believed the outcome was scripted in advance.
	   The activists were warned that if they return to Myanmar and
violate the laws again, they will serve the five-year suspended
term plus any new prison sentence they incur.
	   The campaign to hand out leaflets is part of an attempt by
Myanmar's pro-democracy opposition, led by Nobel laureate Aung San
Suu Kyi, to bring pressure on the government to meet her Aug. 21
deadline for the military to convene a parliament elected in 1990.
	   The opposition overwhelmingly won the elections, but the
government never recognized the result. The military has ruled
Myanmar since 1962.
