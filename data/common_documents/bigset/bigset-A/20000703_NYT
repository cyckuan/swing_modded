WHEN SCHOOL ARE WIRED, BUT TEACHERS AREN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ariz., N.Y.)   By AMY HARMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The teachers who gathered Thursday in Room 313 at
Public School 122 in Astoria, Queens, for the first day of a
workshop called ``Introduction to the Internet'' were model
students. They studied their list of vocabulary terms like ``home
page'' and ``modem.'' They raised their hands. And when the leader
asked a question, they tried to answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we get from one place to another on the Internet?''
asked Doreen Rose, a technology specialist for the Board of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a mouse?'' ventured one elementary school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clicking?'' suggested another.
</P>
<P>
   The correct answer was ``hypertext links,'' and if some
fidgeting occurred during the subsequent explanation, Rose was not
inclined to send anyone to the principal. It was, after all, their
first day of summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration praises the growing number of
wired schools and computer classrooms, many teachers say they are
frustrated by their own inability to put their new tools to good
use. And with scant time given to training during the school year,
thousands of educators around the country are using their time off
this summer to confront what they see as their greatest deficiency:
technology literacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I work with the kids when I don't have the background
myself?'' said Lorraine Attias, a fifth-grade teacher in Astoria
who regarded the four computers that appeared in her classroom last
year with a mixture of fear and longing. ``A year ago I knew
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Attias has since taken several courses with Rose, for which she
gets credits toward a raise, and her class now uses computer
software to produce a monthly newsletter. But some educators say
the smattering of official training combined with voluntary
seminars is not enough to ensure that the promise of applying
information technology to learning _ and the billions spent on it
so far _ will be realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing lots of schools where they have the equipment,
and very frequently it's either underused or not used at all,''
said Vicki Rafel, a vice president of the National PTA. ``We see it
in the rural areas and inner cities but also in the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   That, it seems, is largely because teachers do not know what to
do with it. A study last year by Market Data Retrieval, an
educational research company, found that 61 percent of the
elementary and secondary teachers surveyed felt either ``not at all
prepared'' or only ``somewhat prepared'' to integrate technology
into classroom instruction.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, which recorded 1,576 responses to a
questionnaire mailed to 9,000 elementary and secondary school
teachers, those with 11 or more hours of technology training in the
previous year were far more likely to use technology in the
classroom than teachers who got less. About one-fourth of the
teachers said they had received no technology training during the
previous year. The average number of hours of instruction was five.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Clinton administration awarded $75 million in
grants to train new teachers in technology. And Linda Roberts, the
director of the Office of Education Technology for the U.S.
Department of Education, said that as the teaching work force
turned over, there would be a natural rise in the level of
technology proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger teachers that are coming into our schools have
already grown up with the technology,'' Roberts said. ``They seem
to be able to more quickly appropriate it and find applications
that can support their teaching in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the 3 million teachers in the nation's public schools
seek to assimilate the alien machines materializing in their
classrooms, there is also a mounting debate about how, what or
whether to teach the teachers. If teachers are going to spend their
own time learning how to use computers, they are going to have to
first believe that doing so is worthwhile. Not all are convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers do not change the thinking process,'' said Claire
Dusek, a history teacher at El Dorado High School, east of
Sacramento, who is the recipient of a technology grant under
California's ``digital high school'' program. She sees the primary
value of teaching technology as pragmatic: to get jobs when they
graduate, her students need to know how to use programs like
PowerPoint, Microsoft's program for business presentations.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it may simply be a question of conquering their own
pride. ``It's intimidating,'' said Michelle Finnegan, who is
preparing this summer to teach for the first time in a wired school
next year, Springfield Gardens High School in Queens. ``We're
teachers, so we're supposed to know what we're doing. With this, we
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, students know more than their teachers when it comes to
computers. The key, said Attias of Astoria, is to let them help.
``A lot of times I'll say, `Oh my God, what did I do?' and they'll
say, `You have to do THIS,' '' she said. ``I'm not embarrassed by
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Radecki, a fifth-grade teacher in Coolidge, Ariz.,
said some teachers in her rural district had chosen not to apply
for a grant that would have given them computers and training.
``What has concerned me is the teachers at my school who are
threatened by it so they don't want to do it,'' she said.

ROLF MAGENER, GERMAN ESCAPEE, DIES AT 89 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tales of daring escapes by Allied soldiers from a stalag or
Colditz Castle have been told many a time in print and action
movies. But Rolf Magener, a German business executive who died on
June 3, was known for an escape from the other side, from a remote
British internment camp in northern India.
</P>
<P>
   Magener died in Heidelberg, his hometown. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   His successful four-month, 1,500-mile flight across India to
Japanese lines in Burma entailed derring-do, cunning and
perseverance. He was helped by the fluent British English he had
acquired while studying industrial management in Exeter, England,
and the ambiguous attitude of many Indians toward the war and
representatives of the Raj, their British overlord.
</P>
<P>
   He chronicled the experience in a book ``Prisoner's Bluff''
(Dutton, 1955). A German edition appeared as ``Not a Chance _ The
True Story of a Daredevil Escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Odessa to a German father and Russian mother, he grew up
in Germany and studied industrial management. Part of his training
was in Exeter, England, where he became fluent in the Queen's
English.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935 he was employed by the I.G. Farben chemical concern,
which sent him in 1938 to join its operations in East Asia and
India. The following year he was interned as an enemy alien.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944 he found himself with 1,500 other foreigners in a camp
at Dehra Dun in the Himalayan foothills, near the Nepalese border.
He and a friend, Heins von Have, plotted to break out and teamed up
with five other Germans with the same idea, among them Heinrich
Harrer, a well-known mountaineer.
</P>
<P>
   Their scheme was risky, but it worked. Magener and von Have did
what they could to dress and look like British officers, complete
with pith helmets and swagger sticks. The others tried to look like
Indians, darkening their skin and donning work clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The party cut through a fence into a passageway to a Gurkha
guard post. They passed as two officers leading a wire repair crew;
Magener even showed the guards ``plans'' he had drawn up for the
``work detail.'' The seven disappeared along a path in the jungle,
ran and soon split up.
</P>
<P>
   Harrer, disguised as an Indian, headed straight for Tibet, where
he became the tutor and a confidant of the current Dalai Lama. His
adventures were recorded in his ``Seven Years in Tibet'' (1953,
paper 1997, Tarcher/Putnam).
</P>
<P>
   The hostile climate and terrain quickly showed Magener and von
Have that they could not travel as fugitives. Both businessmen,
they had sufficient cash and the disguises, prompting them to hide
in the open, and they reached Calcutta by train.
</P>
<P>
   Versed in the language and mannerisms of the British upper
class, they took a chance and joined the real officers in their
compartments and dining car, keeping the conversation to a minimum.
Despite a few close calls, the impersonations worked as well in
Calcutta, where they dined with British and American guests at the
most exclusive club and could employ the right swear words at the
right time and put Indian officials in their places.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of their odyssey was the hardest as they approached the
uncertain battle lines in Burma. In the guise of Swiss businessmen,
they proceeded by train, river steamer and sampan and on foot until
they ran into a Japanese patrol in the insect-infested jungle.
Their would-be rescuers concluded that they were spies and handed
them over to the dreaded Kempetei military police.
</P>
<P>
   They spent two uncomfortable months being interrogated before
they were flown to Tokyo and the relative safety of the German
Embassy. There Magener met and married Doris von Behlin, whose
mother was English and who was working for the German air attache.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was briefly detained once again by the invading
Americans. Finally back in Germany, Magener eventually became an
executive at the chemical giant BASF and played a major role in its
international expansion.
</P>
<P>
   An Anglophile, he was posted to Britain soon after he joined
BASF in 1957. He and his wife kept an apartment in London even
after that assignment ended and collected English paintings and
furniture there.
</P>
<P>
   His wife survives. von Have died in 1995, and Harrer is living
in Liechtenstein.

AZEVEDO HAS COME A LONG WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. _ The first time Tony Azevedo met some of
the veterans of U.S. Olympic water polo, long-time Long Beachers
like Chi Kridell, Robert Lynn and Kyle Kopp, he was a 7-year-old
pool rat they used to abuse for the fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than 10 years ago. His dad Ricardo, now the coach
of Long Beach State's men's and women's water polo teams, was
coaching the junior national team, and Tony would follow pop from
pool to pool and get underfoot as much as possible, because that's
what 7-year-olds do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to lock me up in the ball cage,'' said the former
Long Beach Wilson High School standout, ``and poke sticks at me.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade-plus later, some things haven't changed. After Sunday's
title game in the UPS International Cup at the U.S. National
Aquatic Center in Los Alamitos, the youngest player in U.S.
national team history was handed the rather unimposing second-place
trophy and told to hang on to it.
</P>
<P>
   As a photographer tried to get the players to take a team
picture, Lynn kept good-naturedly hazing Azevedo from behind. As a
reporter tried to talk to Azevedo as he walked into the team's
locker room, his teammates literally swept him up and carried him
into the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he's still being abused, but is no longer underfoot.
He's one of several reasons why the U.S. Olympic water polo team is
considered a medal candidate for the 2000 Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster who dominated the Moore League and California
Interscholastic Federation Southern Section for four seasons
(1996-99) joined the national team in 1999 and has quickly earned
his place on the team. He's almost a full generation younger than
some of the thirtysomethings on the team, like goalkeeper Dan
Hackett, two-meter man Chris Humbert and ex-49er Kopp, but one
wouldn't know it from his play in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's 4-3 title-game loss to Yugoslavia, Azevedo had two
shots hit the crossbar and two others just miss their mark. In a
9-8 loss to the same team earlier in the tournament, he scored two
goals and his last-second shot for a tie caught the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony had a great tournament,'' said U.S. Olympic coach John
Vargas. ``He continues to get better. (His age) hasn't been a
difficulty at all. He's a very good, smart player with great
physical skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his quickness not his physical quickness, but his
mental quickness. That's what gives him his edge. And he's just
starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Azevedo is a respectful 18-year-old who defers to his elders.
It's still special for him to remember when he watched guys like
Kopp and Humbert with awe. But his thoughts now are focused on what
he can do to help the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a great experience, a lot of fun,'' said
Azevedo. ``Being part of this team with these guys, I've learned
how to become an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to places like Brazil, Canada, Australia, Croatia and
France can be fun, but he wouldn't be the first teen-ager to chafe
at the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great about Tony for three reasons,'' said his dad.
``One, he played almost the whole game today, so the coaches trust
him. Two, he's adjusted to playing with older players, and they
like him enough to take him under their wing. I can't tell you how
proud that makes me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three, he's being surrounded now, by the press, by kids, by
European professional teams that want to recruit him and he's
smiling, having a good time, and doesn't forget he's part of a
team. He's taking it all in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition this week in Los Alamitos wasn't just a light
tune-up, either. Yugoslavia, Italy, Croatia and Australia are all
Olympic bound, and Yugoslavia is considered the co-favorite for the
gold medal with Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it like this,'' said Ricardo Azevedo. ``There are
eight players on that team (Yugoslavia) that just played on the
club that won the European Championship. That's like the (Lakers)
arriving after just winning the NBA title.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Yugoslavia treated two-meter Humbert like The Perfect
Storm treated the Andrea Gail. Every time the ball went in to
Humbert, it was followed by six Yugoslavian hands. The one goal
Humbert managed was a sensational backhand, back-to-the-net,
head-submerged shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played pretty great,'' said Tony Azevedo. ``You've played
good defense when you hold Yugoslavia to four goals. We just had a
few guys join the team, too.'' Kopp and Humbert also just returned
from European play.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. water polo team has been measuring itself against
Yugoslavia forever. Yugoslavia beat the U.S. in the gold medal game
of the 1984 and 1988 Olympics. In 1991, the U.S. beat Yugoslavia
for its first-ever FINA World Cup title, and also posted big
international wins over them in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to train against them,'' said Vargas. ``They've always
been a great training partner. They've always had a very solid,
fundamental program. In the last few years, I'd like to think
they've learned some things from us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, like pay attention to the 7-year-olds hanging around the
pool. &QL;

Hobbled Sampras must watch his step
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Like its reigning six-time male champion,
Pete Sampras, what they're calling the millennium Wimbledon hobbled
through the first week troubled but, by and large, unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was a boycott by a couple of incensed Spaniards
over their seedings, which didn't correspond to their rankings. But
neither Alex Corretja nor Albert Costa would be missed in any way.
Their refusing to play as a show of protest simply saved them from
having to lose badly on a surface that consistently has bedeviled
them.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, of course, they got seeded where they did.
Grass-court tennis is not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The London weather has been as gray and gloomy as ever, but the
sporadic rain showers have been mostly a minor nuisance. Tennis'
most meteorologically challenged fortnight resumes today on
schedule, if not completely according to plan. Actually, this
tournament might have profited from some fortuitously timed
precipitation, saving Pistol Pete, inarguably Wimbledon's man of
the millennium, from an early demise.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from an ``acute'' case of tendinitis in his lower left
leg just above the ankle, Sampras was supposed to go on Centre
Court last against Justin Gimelstob on Friday. But two drawn-out
matches preceded theirs, and when a late-afternoon drizzle set in,
tournament referee Alan Mills didn't hesitate to tell Pete he could
take it to the house.
</P>
<P>
   See, Wimbledon doesn't want to lose Sampras any more than
Sampras wants to lose at Wimbledon, where his record 13th Grand
Slam title is most likely to be obtained.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-hour respite wouldn't keep Sampras from dropping his
first set to the clumsy lummox Gimelstob in shockingly out-of-sorts
fashion, but he recovered to win easily, and Sunday's scheduled day
of rest bought him further healing time. He is, nonetheless, not in
good form, or humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what it is _ an injury,'' Sampras said of his condition.
``It hurts. It's a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas Borkman, his fourth-round obstacle, would normally be
considered no more than a minor speed bump for a guy whose record
here since the start of his first championship run in 1993 is an
astounding 50-1. As it happens, though, the 28-year-old journeyman
Swede is in both good form and humor. He hasn't come close to
surrendering a set.
</P>
<P>
   But should Sampras play the role of the whale and swallow Jonah,
uh, Jonas, his load lightens considerably. Another Swede,
ninth-seeded Thomas Enqvist, is at present the only seeded player
left between Sampras and Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
   There have been an inordinate number of upsets _ more than half
the seeds have been banished, including both French Open champions,
Gustavo Kuerten and Mary Pierce _ but the major marquee names _
Sampras, Andre Agassi, Tim Henman, Patrick Rafter, the Williams
sisters and Martina Hingis foremost among them _ are hanging on.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a manner of speaking, Anna Kournikova remains among us,
too. Her sultry jog bra ads are everywhere, even on ubiquitous
rolling billboards trolling outside the gates along Church Road,
although she is personally long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, if looks could play tennis
</P>
<P>
   Damir Dokic, alas, isn't gone. Tennis' latest father from hell,
a fellow who, at his worst, gives drunken louts everywhere a bad
name, was afforded a second chance by the Wimbledon authorities
despite launching a tirade on the sacred grounds during which he
called the women's tour ``fascist'' and, for emphasis, destroyed a
reporter's mobile phone by snatching it and smashing it on the
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Dokic was treated leniently because he offered his
American Express gold card to pay for the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Damir was escorted from the premises, but he has been given
permission to return for daughter Jelena's remaining matches as
long as he behaves. Happily oblivious to her father's boorish
behavior, the talented young woman could reach the final because of
the muddled state of her part of the draw.
</P>
<P>
   With defending champion Lindsay Davenport scuffling because of a
bad back, Dokic's half is wide-open, providing the long-thwarted
trio of Monica Seles, Jennifer Capriati and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario
with opportunities each might have believed had passed her by.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, No. 1 seed Martina Hingis probably will have
to go through Venus and Serena Williams consecutively to make it to
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all of England clings to its slim hope that this
finally will be the year for Henman. When 65 former champions and
singles finalists convened at Centre Court to be recognized on
People's Saturday, the oldest among them was the last British male
to have played in the singles final.
</P>
<P>
   Bunny Austin, who got there in 1938, is 94.

<P>
   ``How do you say the name?'' Sal Carr asked as he eased the
motorboat through the Marine Basin Marina in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
Saturday evening and out into Gravesend Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bat'kivshchyna,'' Taras Szczur said. ``Bat-keev-SHIYN-a.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr, a marina tenant who had agreed to take Szczur, the OpSail
2000 liaison to the schooner Bat'kivshchyna, on a reconnaissance
ride around the harbor, tuned the radio to Channel 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ummm, Bak-ta-chinn-ee,'' he called out to every vessel within
50 miles. ``Ukraine ship. Are you out there? Ukraine sail, are you
out there? Are you out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Carr released the talk button. ``They don't have a cell phone?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually they did. But it wasn't on. Or it wasn't working. Or _
come to think of it, Szczur (pronounced shoor) recalled, ``They
were asking me for a battery charger right before they left
Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter. The Bat'kivshchyna would arrive. The captain,
Dmytro Biriukovich, would make sure of it. He had never lost faith,
not when the ship ran aground in the Dnieper River a few days into
the trip and lost a big chunk of its keel, as well as a toilet. Nor
when storms in the Mediterranean shredded the mainsail.
</P>
<P>
   Nor when the ship lost satellite phone service near Spain, nor
when the radio gave up the ghost somewhere in the Atlantic,
triggering a two-week oceanwide search by the Coast Guard. Nor when
a mysterious problem, either with the winds or with reading the
instructions for the Global Positioning System, caused the
Bat'kivshchyna to miss the opening parade of OpSail 2000 in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, by about 1,400 miles and end up in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's normal seaman problem,'' the captain, a courtly,
63-year-old in spotless whites and a skipper's hat, had said on
Wednesday as he stood on the deck in Baltimore. ``I don't like to
explain, `Oh, how it was hard, wah wah wah.' I found this way. I
have found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's grand Parade of Sail through New York Harbor will
feature hundreds of the most imposing vessels on the planet, from a
371-foot Chilean barkentine to President Clinton's aircraft
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Bat'kivshchyna, the official, if utterly
unfunded, representative of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   A floating testament to either the indomitability of the human
spirit or the primacy of Murphy's Law, the Bat'kivshchyna, a
90-foot metal-hulled former fishing trawler dipped in cement and
topped with two masts, left Kiev on April 7 with a crew of 15,
counting the captain's wife and 14-year-old grandson. How it made
it across the Atlantic is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``In yachting life,'' Biriukovich (beer-yoo-KOH-vich), a retired
civil engineer, had philosophized in Baltimore, ``some days bad and
some days good. We forget bad and remember good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bat'kivshchyna left Baltimore Thursday for a 200-mile run to
New York, a hop and a skip for a ship that had already covered
8,000 miles as the albatross flies. But though it was expected in
Brooklyn midday Saturday afternoon, there was still no sign of it
on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Kellogg, the captain's son-in-law, and (to his frequent
chagrin these last three months) the Bat'kivshchyna's one-man land
crew, was hardly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it is with them,'' said Kellogg, 46. ``Everything
is ``Don't worry, be happy.' My father-in-law and his Jamaican
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When OpSail's organizers were putting the event together, they
sent invitations to dozens of foreign governments. In January they
began getting calls from a man who wanted to teach the world about
the wonders of Ukraine from aboard a boat he had built called
Bat'kivshchyna. (It means ``motherland.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know they existed,'' said Alma Viator, OpSail 2000's
director of international and government affairs. ``They were not
on my radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   At least she has a radar screen. The Bat'kivshchyna had no
radar, virtually no communication equipment, and no corporation or
nonprofit foundation willing to sponsor it. Asking the Ukrainian
government for a handout was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many problems now in our country,'' Biriukovich said.
``We must give assistance, not ask for it.''
</P>
<P>
   After several months and a trip to the United States, he had
raised about $5,500, mostly from OpSail itself, about a tenth of
what a voyage of this magnitude typically costs. (Donors and
sponsors may send e-mail messages to Cfue(at)webtv.net.)
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, the Bat'kivshchyna turns into a floating gift
shop when it hits port, doing a brisk business in ``McLenin''
T-shirts, fake fur hats, hand-lacquered refrigerator magnets, and
nesting wooden dolls of President Clinton containing Monica
Lewinsky containing Paula Jones containing the first lady
containing a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cash flow problems, the Ukrainians found the State
Department leery of issuing entry visas, given the many Ukrainians
who come here as visitors and forget to leave.
</P>
<P>
   But Biriukovich was not to be deterred. On April 7, to a hero's
sendoff and much news media attention, the Bat'kivshchyna set sail
from Kiev, the first boat of the season to test the ice-clogged
Dnieper River. The next day, Biriukovich's house was burglarized.
</P>
<P>
   On Day 7, the boat slammed aground when the helmsman fell asleep
at the wheel. Minus a piece of its keel, Bat'kivshchyna soldiered
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks not so pretty,'' a crew member, Sergei Sklonchak,
said of the black-hulled gaff-rigged boat, ``but it is very strong.
It has big, heavy metal body. Like a tank.''
</P>
<P>
   The mishaps continued. There was a near-international incident
in Turkey, after the Ukrainian Coast Guard sank a Turkish fishing
ship it said had been poaching in Ukraine waters, and the Turks
vowed revenge. Keen to avoid Turkish gunfire, the Bat'kivshchyna
slipped through the Bosporus in the dead of night. There were
storms in the Mediterranean so severe that a crew member jumped
ship in Cadiz, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Now the communication problems began. The ship's satellite phone
stopped working after the phone company was sold and the customers
were not automatically switched over. And on May 13, shortly after
the ship transmitted a position 250 miles west of the Canary
Islands, the radio went dead.
</P>
<P>
   The seafaring community feared the worst. The Coast Guard sent
search planes clear to Africa. The first in a series of OpSail
events opened in San Juan, Puerto Rico, without the Bat'kivshchyna.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-Atlantic, Biriukovich, cut off from the world, made a
decision. The seas were freakishly calm, and he was running low on
fuel. He would skip Puerto Rico and Miami and make a beeline for
Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the official story. Several crew members said
that in fact, someone on board had set the Global Positioning
System to take a reading off a European satellite rather than off
an U.S. satellite, with potentially disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we went to the south,'' said Katya Dorivchekno, 21,
the only woman in the crew other than the captain's wife, Nina.
``When we met another ship and we took coordinates from him, he
told us that we were 1,000 miles north. There was some joking that
we will go to Greenlandia and that we will see some icebergs.'' On
June 6, navigating without radar in heavy fog, the Bat'kivshchyna
pulled into Norfolk. It was either 17 days late for the start of
OpSail or eight days early for the festivities in Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   It did not matter. They were an immediate hit, and Virginians
fell over themselves to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore brought more of the same. People gave the crew with
coolers of beer, cartons of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Bat'kivshchyna pulled anchor. Late Sunday
afternoon, Kellogg said he suspected that the captain was doing
some more discovering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if he was just sailing around the
harbor looking at New York City,'' Kellogg said. ``That's something
my mother-in-law always wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then at 6:20 p.m. Sunday, the sky-blue and wheat-yellow
Ukrainian flag appeared above the waters of Gravesend Bay. The
Bat'kivshchyna had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Biriukovich, looking very refreshed, explained that he and the
crew had stayed with friends in Chesapeake City, Md., for two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not in a hurry,'' he said. ``We have breakfast and we
have lunch and we have dinner there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful,'' he added, giving two thumbs up.

YUGOSLAVIA BEATS U.S. TO WIN UPS CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE MINARD  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. _ Everything was in place Sunday afternoon
at the UPS International Cup. Capacity crowd, close game between
two world powers, an exciting finish.
</P>
<P>
   So after the Yugoslavian national team edged Team USA 4-3 in the
championship game before an overflow crowd at the U.S. National
Aquatic Center in Los Alamitos, why was U.S. national team coach
John Vargas smiling?
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing those guys (Yugoslavia) is such a tremendous learning
experience. Considering that we've added four players in the last
week and a half, I'm ecstatic about where we're at,'' said Vargas.
``Our effort was excellent. We're making great strides.''
</P>
<P>
   The powerful Yugoslavian team, Olympic gold medalists in 1984
and 1988, owed its second one-goal victory over the U.S. in three
days to an aggressive defense and the standout play of goalie
Aleksandar Sostar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (U.S.) have a strong team, we respect them. But our goal
is to win a gold medal, and we feel like we have a good chance to
do that,'' said Sostar, who was named the Outstanding Goalie of the
six-team tournament.
</P>
<P>
   For three periods Sunday, it was Sostar and his defense that
dominated the action.
</P>
<P>
   A conservatively played first period was scoreless until
Yugoslavia's Dejan Slavic followed a bar-out by 2-meter man Viktor
Jelenic at 1:33 to make it 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was even tighter, with the defenses
dominating. U.S. 2-meter man Chris Humbert had a couple of good
shots, and Tony Azevedo hit the crossbar with a shot from four
meters.
</P>
<P>
   On the initial possession of the third period, Kyle Kopp had the
ball stolen and, on the Yugoslavian counterattack, driver Jugoslav
Vasovic beat U.S. goalie Dan Hackett from the left side to make it
2-0 with 6:07 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, after the U.S. wasted a 6-on-5 opportunity,
Kopp was ejected, and Predrag Zimonjic made the man advantage
count, beating Hackett from four meters to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the final period, the U.S. got its offense going. With
a man advantage, Chris Oeding beat Sostar high to cut the deficit
to 3-1 with 5:56 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   That's when things got interesting.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, Zimonjic was called for a 2-meter penalty,
giving the U.S. a penalty shot. But Eric Wigo's shot was stuffed by
Sostar, and the Yugoslavians dodged a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   After holding on their next possession, the Americans cut the
lead to 3-2 when Wigo took a pass from Gavin Arroyo and scored at
4:08.
</P>
<P>
   On the U.S. team's next possession, Veljko Uskokovic was
whistled for an infraction, and the U.S. had a man advantage. But
Wigo's pass for Humbert was stolen by Petar Trbojevic, and
Uskokovic scored on the ensuing counterattack to make it 4-2 with
2:20.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. had a breath left, though. Humbert's backhand from two
meters closed the gap to 4-3, but Azevedo's shot was blocked on
their next possession, and with the clock winding down, Humbert was
whistled for a foul with 35 seconds left, giving Yugoslavia a fresh
shot clock, which they ran out for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Asked afterward if he thought this might be a preview of the
Olympic final in Sydney, Vargas smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'd take that in a second,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
</P>
<P>
   CROATIA 7, AUSTRALIA 5: The strong Croatian team (4-2), which
lost only to the U.S. and Yugoslavia, downed the Aussies (2-3-1)
for third place.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY 9, TEAM UPS 1: The Italians (3-3), fresh off their
physical loss to the U.S. on Saturday, took out their frustrations
on Team UPS (0-6) for fifth place. &QL;

 &HT;    Eds: Tops with PRI conceding Fox victory.
 &HT;    930&AMP;add. With MEXICO-CARTER.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Opposition candidate Vicente Fox won a historic
presidential election victory Sunday that will usher in a new
political era for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the nation, President Ernesto Zedillo
acknowledged that his Institutional Revolutionary Party's 71-year
grip on power was ending.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary information from electoral officials is ``sufficient
to know that the next president of Mexico will be Vicente Fox,''
Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we demonstrated that our democracy is mature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said he had called Fox and assured him of a
``transparent'' transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida, the PRI's presidential candidate, said:
``The citizens have made a decision that we should respect, and
I'll set the example myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a towering and charismatic businessman who turned 58
Sunday, delivered a virtual victory speech earlier at the
headquarters of his National Action Party (PAN).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through a moment of transition to a new political
state in a peaceful and stable and tranquil manner,'' he said. ``We
have to congratulate ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI conceded with only 9 percent of polling places
reporting, most of them in urban areas where Fox is strongest. He
led 48.3 percent to 31.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, a nationwide poll for the leading Televisa
television station found Fox winning 44 percent to 38 percent for
Labastida. A third candidate, leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, had 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Polls by other television outlets and the Democracy Watch group
also showed Fox leading by six or more percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of the capital began to fill with Fox supporters
celebrating his victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that the era of the dinosaurs is over,'' said
a jubilant Sonia Suarez, 26, an electrical engineer in Mexico City,
referring to the pejorative name often employed for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's victory ends an era of one-party rule that is all that a
vast majority of Mexicans has ever known. The populist and agrarian
PRI would give way to a pro-business party that is urban-oriented
and inclined to let markets do more of what government has done in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls also showed PAN winning governorships in two
states, Morelos and Guanajuato, and the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party holding on to the mayor's office in Mexico City's
federal district, the country's political heart.
</P>
<P>
   No results were available for the two houses of the nation's
Congress, also at stake Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate indications of widespread election
fraud. Though Mexico is notorious for electoral corruption, the PRI
had promised the vote would be free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of angry would-be voters who didn't get to
cast ballots for president at special voting stations set up for
people who had recently moved or were in transit.
</P>
<P>
   Although election officials estimated that more than 99 percent
of all voting stations opened _ the best record ever for Mexico _
voters were enraged when special stations that could stock only a
limited number of ballots by law ran short.
</P>
<P>
   In the sprawling Mexico City working-class suburb of Ixtapaluca
in the state of Mexico, voters started shouting to cast votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't fair!'' said police officer Marco Hernandez, 23,
who was standing in a long line when officials said only 300
ballots were left out of 750 available for voters who had moved
since getting their voting credentials. Asked who he wanted to vote
for, Hernandez wrote on a piece of paper: ``I want change.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 58 million people were eligible to vote in the election,
which followed the most hotly contested and passionate campaign
season in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida faced a strong charight Alliance for Change. Fox and
Labastida were neck-and-neck in many pre-election opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters said change was a prime motive for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election has been the most publicized in the history of
Mexico, and most of us want change,'' said street vendor Alfonso
Garrido, 53, who voted for Fox in Ecatepec, a city near the capital
where almost 1 million voters reside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always voted for the PRI before, but the truth is, I'm tired
of poverty and I hope that Fox, if he wins, will fulfill his
promises,'' said Garrido.
</P>
<P>
   But many other voters said they preferred to stick with the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to let Fox win. I don't like his pompous
attitude,'' said Patricia Arias, 36, an Ixtapaluca housewife who
voted for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   But her sister, Edith Arias, 37, with whom she walked arm in
arm, voted for Cardenas because ``he cares about working people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ramirez, 67, also voted for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think all three candidates put together can really
change much,'' he said. ``The PRI is part of society. It dominates
everything. The opposition could create problems.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same voting station, housewife Amapola Mendez voted with
her 2-year-old clinging to her leg. ``A lot of older people think
there will never be change,'' she said, explaining that she voted
for Fox. ``But many younger people are looking at other political
parties now.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an awning set up on Juarez Street in Ixtapaluca, people
crowded around tables stacked with color-coded ballots supervised
by a election officials and two people who counted votes and posted
results before shipping them to a district office.
</P>
<P>
   Each official was supposed to be selected by lottery and trained
by Mexico's independent Federal Elections Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Voters showed their photo ID voting credentials to these
officials, who matched them against a registration list that also
contained photos. Voters were given ballots to mark and instructed
to go into booths with curtains. Then they deposited the ballots in
color-coded boxes for federal elections and state and local races.
</P>
<P>
   Political parties were allowed to have two representatives per
table, but on Juarez Street, like other parts of the country, there
were complaints that too many PRI representatives wearing pins were
standing around or sitting at the tables.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, five women wearing PRI pins were crowded around
one table on Juarez Street, silently observing voters as they
approached to get their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Manuel Solorzano, a PAN representative, said he was filing
a complaint because some PRI members had been substituted at the
last minute as vote counters at one table.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, ``for the first time ever, we are seeing
an election where the government isn't sticking its hands in.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Valle de Chalco, another state of Mexico area where PRI
loyalty tends to run strong, people trickled into voting precincts
along with stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, heavy rains flooded out hundreds from their
homes. Federal aid arrived and the government paid many families
almost $1,000 in disaster relief. But many said the help was
inadequate and slow to come.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many here were bent on backing the party of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the party of my parents _ even my grandparents,'' said
housewife Rosa Maria Perez, 35. The ruling party ``gives us
security. I still don't have confidence in the other parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting PRI is family-bound duty, explained Patricia Sanchez
Pacheco, 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother got her papers to become a PRI activist 25 years
ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other parties don't have experience to govern a country,''
said her sister, Hortencia Sanchez Pacheco.
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters gave their votes to the PRI because it came
through in ways that count _ bags of cement, sand and aluminum
scrap for roofs for their neighborhood, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago we started receiving the help,'' said Hortencia
Sanchez, carefully minding her step on a street of rocks and
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this staunch PRI town, there was opposition _ and
indignation _ at the PRI's campaign classic campaign gifts for
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a bucket and a T-shirt, they want our vote? Forget it,''
said one voter who declined to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big gap between what the PRI says and what it
does,'' said electrician Juan Jesus Moreno, 43, who voted for
Cardenas, just as he did in 1994 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can Labastida talk about computers and English classes for
Mexicans (a campaign proposal) when we don't have enough to eat?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   A reliable den of PRI support, Valle de Chalco sports monuments
to former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's government public
works project, Solidarity. The program paved roads, put in drainage
and electricity and built basketball courts in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But the June sewage flood may have provoked a lower turnout for
the PRI than in previous elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems there was a bit of anger and apathy out there among
people for the way the government handled the disaster,'' said
Arturo Morales Torres, a local resident.

CHALLENGER SAYS HE SEES BIG MARGIN IN MEXICO ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (REWRITES with updates thruout) 
By JULIA PRESTON  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Vicente Fox, the rough-spoken rancher and
businessman who galvanized a maverick grass-roots presidential
campaign, proclaimed Sunday night that he was on his way to a
decisive election victory over the political party that has ruled
Mexico for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the polls closed, Fox told elated followers at his
party headquarters that surveys of voters and early official
returns showed that he was leading by a ``broad margin'' over
Francisco Labastida of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the candidate of the National Action Party, or PAN, stopped
short of declaring outright triumph, then gave what amounted to a
victory speech anyway, in effect staking his claim to the
presidency and challenging the PRI to concede defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the moment of democracy, the moment of change that our
country has so desired,'' he said. He praised the federal elections
authorities for conducting national balloting that finished
``without an important or notable stain.''
</P>
<P>
   Four rapid tallies based on a sample of the results from the
ballot boxes all showed Fox ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The four tallies, which were contracted by the Chamber of the
Industry of Radio and Television, included one by Labastida's own
pollster, the Pearson firm. That count showed Fox winning over
Labastida by 40 percent to 35 percent. The narrowest margin among
the four polls was reported by ACNielsen, the market research
company, which gave Fox a victory by 39 percent to 36 percent for
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's followers immediately began to pour out into the streets
of Mexico City, honking the horns of their cars in celebration and
wrapping total strangers in joyous embraces.
</P>
<P>
   At Labastida's headquarters, several young supporters started to
cry when the television reported the results of the first polls.
The huge plaza at the center of the PRI compound, many times the
scene of tumultuous rallies, was empty. A few PRI supporters walked
dejectedly across its vast empty expanse, furling their PRI banners
into tight rolls as they walked out to the street.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's aides said he would not make a statement until after
the official elections agency released more substantial results.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday evening, Fox immediately offered
reconciliation to Labastida. ``It was a very combative process, but
I open my arms to him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also reached out with unusual warmth to the United States,
which had been the chief adversary of many PRI presidents. ``We are
not only neighbors and partners, but we have a common destiny,''
said Fox, who was once the chief executive officer of Coca-Cola in
Mexico. ``I know we are going to do many great things together. I
want to work intensely with the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's big lead in the voter surveys took all of Mexico by
surprise. The final polls before the election had showed him in a
neck-and-neck race with Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Fox's followers' reacted first with disbelief and then
delight. The vast majority of them have never lived in a Mexico
that was not governed by and totally dominated by the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a very important step in our struggle to become a
democratic country,` said Francisco Barrio, a leading PAN
politician who is a former governor of the northern border state of
Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   With a note of astonishment he said: ``Now our party has become
the strongest and most important one in Mexico. We got more votes
than the PRI did today.''
</P>
<P>
   The streets around the Angel of Independence, the winged statue
on a tall pedestal in downtown Mexico City that is this country's
most distinctive monument, became a rollicking fiesta of thousands
of cheering, weeping, dancing Fox supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, eager voters lined up at polling stations _
often waiting for hours in punishing heat _ for their chance to
take part in an election that offered a choice between the
country's familiar but tainted ruling party and a chance for
something different.
</P>
<P>
   The elections Sunday were the most open ever held here, and the
balloting was generally orderly, though marred in several states by
reported pressure on voters from the governing party, which has a
history of fraud, and disorganization that blocked many thousands
of people from casting ballots.
</P>
<P>
   After a fierce campaign that filled the television and other
media as never before, many voters said they made their decision
only in recent days, suggesting that the undecided, who were as
much as 19 percent of the total in the most recent polls, would
determine the day.
</P>
<P>
   In many neighborhoods that long were PRI strongholds, and among
working class Mexicans who were its most loyal followers, one theme
was recurrent: Mexico had to do something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a change, and I have been asking myself, when
is it going to happen?'' said Gustavo Sanchez, a 32-year-old auto
mechanic in Ecatepec, a huge proletarian suburb of Mexico City
where the PRI was once invincible. ``Our leaders need to know that
if they don't do the job right, we're going to get rid of them.''

</P>
<P>
   At mid-afternoon, Jose Woldenberg, the president of the Federal
Elections Institute, which is running the election, reported that
only 13 of 113,423 polling places nationwide had failed to open
because of organizational problems, a record.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the presidential race, Mexicans also voted for the
Senate, with 128 seats, and all 500 seats in the Congress, and to
elect two state governors and the mayor of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 p.m., Felipe Bravo Mena, the president of PAN, declared
that the party had won the governor's race in the central state of
Morelos, beating the PRI by 54 percent to 28 percent. Before the
election, the polls showed that that race was close. Fox's
candidate also swept the governor's race in his home state of
Guanajuato by 59 percent to the PRI's 31 percent, Bravo Mena said.
</P>
<P>
   Televisa's early polls also showed that Andres Manuel Lopez
Obrador, from the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, was
ahead in the contest for Mexico City mayor. That had been expected,
but the trend was going much more heavily against the PRI than had
been foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the candidate of the Party of the
Democratic Revolution in the presidential contest, had refused to
unite with Fox, and late Sunday evening conceded defeat by his
conservative opposition rival.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, voting in a public school near his
official residence, said, ``There's strong participation, a lot of
enthusiasm and great calm throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Things were not calm, however, in the main square of the city of
Puebla, in central Mexico, where thousands of people lined up for
long hours at a special polling place set up for Mexicans who were
not in their home towns on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Before the polls opened, hundreds of army soldiers and
policemen, mostly in civilian clothes, crowded to the front of the
line at the one special station for out-of-town voters in Puebla's
crowded plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Since the special station had only 750 ballots to be given out,
many voters realized, after waiting for hours in line, that they
were not going to be able to vote. As the line stretched for six
blocks out of the plaza, angry and frustrated people began to
suspect that the PRI was pulling one of the election tricks for
which it was notorious in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraud! Fraud!'' the voters chanted as tensions mounted, ebbed
and mounted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the PRI again,'' said Maria Guadalupe Corona Moreno, a
28-year-old manager of a textile factory from the state of
Guanajuato who was in Puebla on business. ``I've been waiting to
cast my vote for years,'' she said, waving her voter card, ``and
now it turns out this is just a piece of trash.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI voters in Puebla were also furious about being left out.
``Where is the democracy?'' asked Maria Teresa Inclan Perez, who
said she supported the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   The special polling stations were set up for Mexicans who would
not appear on local rolls because they went to vote in places
different from where they registered. In regular polling places,
Mexicans were given ballots after matching their voter card with a
photograph against a list that included both their name and
picture. But because of restrictions in the campaign laws, only 715
special polling places were set up nationwide, with only 750
ballots each.
</P>
<P>
   In Iztapalapa, a vast working class borough of Mexico City,
dozens of policemen also pushed into the front of the line at one
special polling place. The situation grew tense as voters behind
them realized that they were probably being squeezed out of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The voting Sunday was monitored by no fewer than 38,433 Mexican
observers and 860 foreigners. Everywhere they went, observers found
voters thrilled about being part of what felt like a bona fide
democratic exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was saying that this time their vote really
matters,'' said Pamela S. Falk, a law professor from the City
University of New York.

PROFILES IN PRESSURE, OR THE ABSENCE OF IT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Calif., Mont.)   (With 6TH-GRADE-PRESSURES) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
   ATLANTA _ Like so many children across the country, Aliyyah
Abdur-Rahman and Tajah Muhammad hope to grow up to be professional
athletes. But in addition to the typical pressures, the girls,
African-Americans from devout Muslim families, wear head scarves
while they practice and play.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And there are games during Ramadan, a month when Muslims fast
from sunrise to sundown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running up and down the court and we can't drink
anything,'' Tajah said. ``I love the religion. I just wish we
didn't have to cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliyyah and Tajah, best friends who held hands as they chatted
at the Clara Mohammed Elementary School, are as concerned about
tests and college admission as their counterparts in secular
schools. But they are also struggling to learn Arabic, and to win
weekly plaudits for exhibiting what the school calls Islamic
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we're Muslim, they don't want us to get off the straight
path,'' Aliyyah explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all these earthly things to do _ like basketball
practice and soccer practice,'' she continued. ``Sometimes when I
get home, I'm so exhausted. We have this devil, Satan, Shaitan. He
whispers in my ear. He tells me just lay down, lay down.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliyyah wants to play in the WNBA, then be a chiropractor and a
lawyer _ and the first black woman president. Tajah plans to be a
professional soccer player, but not before she attends Duke
University. ``That's the school I have my destination focus on,''
she said. Both girls have a mix of A's and B's on their report
cards and are constantly trying to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to go to college,'' Tajah said. ``Because my
sister and my brother, I want to replace them, because they didn't
do too well in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliyyah, meanwhile, is jealous of her brother's straight A's and
top marks in Islamic character.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one in the family who always gets the attention _ I
want some of that, too,'' she said. ``My parents always say,
`Aliyyah, don't go down in your grade-point average, because it's
going to hurt you in life.' They tell me every day.''
</P>

   SAN CARLOS, Calif. _ It's hard enough to weather sixth-grade
under ideal circumstances, let alone hobbled by cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   What consoles Casey Fowler, 13, whose twisted gait draws
occasional titters from his classmates, is that he was not supposed
to make it to school at all _ but he has become a strong student at
the San Carlos Charter Learning Center, a '60s-tinged experimental
public school 25 miles south of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Born 12 weeks early, at 2 pounds, 4 ounces, Casey was given
little prospect of a normal life, because his brain had been
deprived of oxygen during birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told when he was a year old that he was seriously
retarded,'' said his mother, Debbie. ``That the only job he'd get
would be stacking boxes at Macy's.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fowler quit her nursing job to work full time on physical
and musical therapy with Casey to ease the symptoms of his
condition, which causes slow muscle development and muddled speech.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Casey's mind blossom _ by age 2 he had the
concentration to watch ``The Wizard of Oz'' in its entirety _ but
he pushed himself to ride a bike and skate. Though he has the
running ability of a 5-year-old, Casey played basketball in the
Redwood City Police Athletic League this year on a team that was
coached by his father, Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made a shot yet,'' he said. ``I get close. It
bounced off the rim two times.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Casey's shaky gait and hands make him an easy target for
teasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called a retard,'' Casey told a visitor. But an
11-year-old classmate cut him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already been through this a million times before, in
class,'' the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   Casey just looked away.
</P>
<P>
   With an encyclopedic knowledge of movies and strong grades in
English, Casey hopes to attend UCLA film school to train as a
director or screenwriter or producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky,'' Casey said. ``Other people have it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   _ JACQUES STEINBERG
</P>
<P>
   BLOOMFIELD, Mont. _ Pressure? To Kirk and Brady Boese, it is a
word missing from their sixth-grade vocabulary list.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeses, towheaded twins, are the only sixth-graders at the
Bloomfield School in the Montana plains, 247 miles from the
Billings airport and 27 from the nearest McDonald's. Since
kindergarten, their classroom has been the same white clapboard
building, shared this year with 11 other children, ages 6 to 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year in school, I was just a lot more relaxed,'' said
Brady, who is older but smaller than his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixth-grade is easier,'' Kirk agreed. ``There's so little
changes in Bloomfield. We haven't even moved our desks.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kirk and Brady, who are 12, this was the year Dad _ who also
went to Bloomfield _ taught them to hunt, for white-tailed deer,
and let them drive the pickup around the 2,000-acre wheat farm.
They rarely have homework, leaving afternoons a carefree mix of
shooting hoops and tidying their collection of Minnesota Twins and
Timberwolves paraphernalia. Friday and Saturday nights, they go
golfing.
</P>
<P>
   As for peer pressure, well, they don't really have peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not really an oddball,'' Brady explained. ``If you
play basketball and you're good at it, you fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, though, the Boeses plan to commute 20 miles to a
school in Richey, the nearest town, so they can play sports. There,
they'll be part of a class of six.
</P>
<P>
   Both Boese boys are good students, but their only thoughts of
college come when watching NCAA games on satellite television.
Cedric Boese, their father, has warned the twins that the farm
could never support two families _ they will have to seek other
jobs, probably somewhere else. Still, the boys' musings on the
future are vague and childlike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just see different places,'' Brady shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of just cows and dogs,'' Kirk added.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the ocean again,'' Brady said. ``Instead of just
farmland.''

 THE TIGHTROPE WOMEN WALK In PUBLIC LIFE  
 By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Images of women, selected at random (OK, not totally
at random) from recent newspaper and television accounts:
</P>
<P>
   A reprint of recipes for Tipper Gore's Ginger Snaps and Laura
Bush's Texas Governor's Mansion Cowboy Cookies, as originally run
in Family Circle.
</P>
<P>
   A news story about Jeanine Pirro, the district attorney of
Westchester, seeing her career in ruins after her husband's
conviction for tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that women are increasingly comfortable wearing less in
the office.
</P>
<P>
   A feature story about a bosom lift, accompanied by assessments
of the varying virtues of push-up bras.
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt on WNBC-TV from an amateur video, which seemed to
show that among the many women terrified by marauding men in
Central Park after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, two or
three women enjoyed displaying various parts of their anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   And so on.
</P>
<P>
   What is wrong with these pictures? Just about everything. It is
a sad fact that still, not only do men not know what women want,
women don't know, either. A broad generalization, of course. Many
women know just what they want.
</P>
<P>
   But oh, what society does to us. What we do to ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   This comes to mind now because recently, speaking at Baruch
College, Geraldine Ferraro said, as she has before, that she was
subjected to some of the scrutiny she endured as the Democratic
vice-presidential candidate in 1984 only because she is a woman.
Just as Hillary Rodham Clinton has said that a woman has a more
difficult time running for office than a man does.
</P>
<P>
   These assertions are difficult to refute. It is still true that
strong men are assertive; strong women are strident. Thoughtful men
are flexible; thoughtful women are indecisive. It is still true
that a female candidate is suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more complicated than stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro wasn't quite ready for prime time. She delayed releasing
her income tax returns (a result of her accountant's diligence, she
now says), made things worse for herself by acting as if probing
questions were invasions of privacy and was simply unprepared for
the onslaught of critical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro was not only a victim of her husband's financial games,
but also a beneficiary, who, trial testimony suggested, knew or
should have known about the schemes to defraud the government of
more than $400,000 by deducting the family's personal expenses as
business write-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants it both ways. She wants to be judged for her own
accomplishments. But she piggybacks on her husband's career, was
his fierce defender and, having never run for political office
before, is trying to start near the top in a state not her own.
</P>
<P>
   There is pattern here, of women in public life seeing themselves
as both independent and victimized; as speechmaker and cookie
baker; aggressor and martyr. Of course they do. They don't live in
isolation.
</P>
<P>
   In the very public profession of politics, whose practitioners
(male and female) are subject to intense scrutiny by the opposition
and the news media, women still have to fight deeply ingrained
stereotypes. Unfair. As Ferraro noted, if a female politician has
children, she's accused of neglecting them, and if she is single,
she should expect rumors that she is a lesbian. Clinton was never
more popular than when she was a victim. Another cliche _ woman as
victim.
</P>
<P>
   But women contribute to their own stereotyping: Ferraro saying
that her husband handled all the family finances. Or Clinton and
Pirro ``standing by'' their men.
</P>
<P>
   Which is it, independent woman or loyal wife? Thing is, society
forces women in public life to be both. Most play along, and not
just in public life.
</P>
<P>
   Of course some women respond eagerly to marketers of push-up
bras. Or think they can get away with wearing revealing clothes in
the corporate suite. Or even assume it's fine to bare all in
public. And still have careers outside the home and still be taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice indeed if women could do as they wished.
Imagine for a moment the average female politician being as
routinely unimpressive as the average male politician. Or a woman
in public office confessing to marital infidelity and remaining
popular. Someday. Maybe when a woman in politics concedes that she
buys her ginger snaps.

EDITORIAL: GOVERNOR RYAN'S BRAVE EXAMPLE  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Texas)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 3:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Ryan says he never expected the national attention
he has received for declaring a moratorium on the death penalty in
Illinois. Ryan found himself in the media spotlight recently as a
counterexample to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who was presiding
over his 135th execution in five years. Ryan is by no one's
description a maverick. A pharmacist by training, he has spent
nearly 30 years in state politics, first as a member of the
Illinois Legislature, then as the Republican leader and speaker of
the House, then for two terms as lieutenant governor and two terms
as secretary of state, until he won election as governor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has single-handedly instigated a new national debate on
capital punishment by acting on conscience when faced with
statistical evidence that innocent people stand a very real chance
of being executed in Illinois. Since 1977, 13 inmates on death row
in that state have been exonerated compared with 12 executed. A
series in The Chicago Tribune found that of 260 capital cases that
had been appealed, fully half have been reversed for a new trial or
sentencing hearing. In more than 30 cases, the lawyers representing
death row inmates were disbarred or suspended. New research
nationwide has found that nearly 70 percent of capital cases that
were fully reviewed were found to have reversible errors.
</P>
<P>
   By being the first governor to impose a moratorium on
executions, Ryan has made it politically acceptable for
conservative Republicans and Democrats alike to rethink capital
punishment and how it is carried out. Many politicians have avoided
the issue for fear of being called soft on crime. The situation in
Illinois has caused even some prominent conservatives like the
evangelist Pat Robertson to question the fairness of this system.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan himself has long been a death penalty supporter. But given
the record of mistakes, he says, ``we have no choice but to try to
fix'' the system. He has appointed a commission to examine the
administration of the death penalty and to make recommendations for
change. He has set no deadline for the commission's work and
recently said that the moratorium would stand indefinitely unless
the commission could give him a ``100 percent guarantee'' that the
system could be made fair and just.
</P>
<P>
   That high standard calls into question the record of other death
penalty states. For death penalty supporters like Bush and Vice
President Al Gore, Ryan's cautious approach is a rebuke to their
own blindness to the system's mistakes. He has instructed the
nation on the only morally coherent position for supporters of
capital punishment to take, and that is that no execution can go
forward when there is abundant evidence that innocent people have
been put on death row.
</P>
<P>
   This page opposes the death penalty on a variety of
humanitarian, egalitarian, constitutional and moral principles. But
even those who do not share those principles ought to concede, as
Ryan has, that it is legally indefensible to execute a single
innocent person. That means, by our lights, that capital punishment
can never be acceptable as standard national practice for a
practical, legal reason as well as for the reasons of principle
listed above. For as Ryan has pointed out, our national experience
has shown that no system of investigations and trials can be so
perfect, so free of human error or flawed evidence or mistaken
identity as to guarantee that innocent people will not be executed.

EDITORIAL: SUMMER ON THE WING  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 3:
</P>
<P>
   At first light, about 4 a.m., the bats begin fluttering at the
roof ridge, slipping into the house through a bat-stained crack
between clapboards. It is just enough noise to wake me up, and for
a moment I lie there, watching the dark shapes against the false
dawn outside. The bats nest somewhere in the ceiling above my head,
just beyond a layer of Sheetrock and insulation, and that is
somehow satisfying, like having a chicken coop in the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   It is pleasant to pretend that wildness stops at the front door
in the country, but it really doesn't. In April, I started seeds
under a lamp in the basement, and when the seedlings were just
ready to be pricked out and potted on, the mice one night grazed
them down to bare stubs. A fox took a seat in the driveway the
other morning and looked at the kitchen as if he expected to come
in.
</P>
<P>
   At night, flying insects clatter and whir against the screen of
a lighted window, and sometimes the bats pick them off the screen,
their wings just brushing it as they fly past. It comes as a
surprise to realize once again how full the night is with insects
in late June. When you drive at night, moths come flaring into the
headlights like stones skipped down the highway. Last week I walked
down to the mailbox long after dark, and out in the open, where the
darkness lessened, I saw an atmosphere full of insects drifting
past, like the metropolitan scene in a science fiction movie, with
airborne traffic vectoring this way and that. Twice in the past
week I found the corpse of a luna moth on the ground. It seemed
less like the remains of a personal moth-death than the wreck of a
pale-green, iridescent, freight-carrying kite. As full as the air
is of insects, it is that full of insect-eaters, too.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as I can tell, no one is eating the slugs. We try
very hard not to. We wash the lettuce from the garden three or four
times, picking carefully over each leaf before we spin it dry.
Somehow the profusion of slugs this year is emblematic of the damp,
dark weather that has clung to this small farm since April. Slugs
are a kind of animate precipitation, aqueous sloths. The garden is
flecked with them in early morning, and after you have tossed a few
of them into the nettle-patch, the revulsion they cause dies away,
until one turns up on the salad plate.
</P>
<P>
   What we are missing here, in this kingdom of airborne bugs, is
barn swallows. I don't know where they are. The barn is ready and
waiting. There are open pastures, and there are horses. There is an
overhead wire to perch on and gape at the world from. We don't
spray, and we don't knock down swallow nests. So where are the
birds? Phoebes take bugs on the wing, and so do the few tree
swallows who live around here, and of course the bats. But it is
not the same. Some quality about this place, some aspect of its
rusticity, will not be official until the barn swallows move in. &QL;

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 3:
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of 58 Chinese immigrants found suffocated in an
airless container truck at the port of Dover, England, last month,
provided stark witness to the rising global traffic in people who
illegally cross borders and whole continents in search of a better
life. The Chinese immigrants reportedly traveled for four months by
way of Russia and Central Europe to get from their home in China's
Fujian province to England. They represented only a tiny part of
the flow of millions making dangerous journeys to distant lands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, 10 Chinese immigrants died trying to swim to shore when
the Golden Venture, a ship carrying nearly 300 immigrants from
southern China, ran aground off Queens. In 1995, 18 Sri Lankans
were found dead in a container truck in Hungary. In 1998, seven
Mexicans died in the California desert, abandoned by smugglers.
Reports of these catastrophes, however, have not discouraged other
people from migrating.
</P>
<P>
   The trade in illegal migration is growing partly because more
countries have tightened legal avenues for immigration, as has
happened in Europe. The fall of the Berlin Wall is often cited as a
factor because it opened Central and Eastern Europe as migration
routes. But there are few reliable statistics in this field, and
even categorizing criminal activities can be difficult since the
illegal transport of people can vary from individuals paying
smugglers to help them cross borders to individuals who are
kidnapped or trapped into slavery by traffickers for the sex
industry. The common characteristic is that all of the trade
operates underground, with victims who are in no position to report
abuse. Evidence that the industry exists tends to surface only when
smuggled migrants are found dead, or when those in bondage manage
to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative estimates suggest that some 700,000 women and
children are illegally transported for sexual and labor
exploitation each year, with at least 50,000 brought into the
United States. The total number of migrants smuggled across borders
is more than 4 million a year worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The International Organization for Migration estimates that
roughly 400,000 people are smuggled into Western Europe alone each
year. Smuggling into the United States has also increased. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service has found that illegal
border crossers are relying more heavily on smugglers, and that the
number of smuggled people apprehended has risen from 138,000 in
1997 to 247,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting this trade is extremely difficult, in part because
governments know so little about these cross-border enterprises.
Even with the arrest of the Dutch truck driver and several others
in connection with the Dover case, there is scant information about
that operation. Still, it is clear the smugglers had to be part of
a sophisticated, highly flexible network that could manage the trip
across two continents. Their profits are high. Chinese migrants are
thought to pay at least $25,000 to be smuggled to Europe. The
global trade is believed to be worth more than $7 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Not much can be done in the short term to deal with the main
factors, poverty and persecution, that lie at the root of these sad
migrations. Nor can any single country combat transnational
trafficking by itself. It will take the cooperation of countries
that are part of migration pipelines in both investigations and
prosecutions. The European Union, in the wake of the deaths in
Dover, may well be pushed to consider a common asylum policy. Many
countries need to enact anti-trafficking laws. Much more also needs
to be done to help victims of this trade, who could, if protected,
testify against traffickers.

Braves top Mets, leave Shea with NL East lead intact
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DAVID BARRON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tom Glavine's seven strong innings and Javy Lopez's
two home runs Sunday gave the Atlanta Braves a 10-2 victory over
the Mets and a split of their four-game series at Shea Stadium,
ensuring the only entity to exit this holiday weekend in the red
was the New York Police Department's overtime fund.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred officers _ the NYPD will neither confirm nor
deny numbers _ were on duty for a fourth day to stand watch over
Atlanta reliever John Rocker, who didn't pitch for a third day in a
row. Rocker, who is nursing an injured thumb, said he could have
pitched, but he wasn't needed as the Braves gave Glavine a 7-0 lead
through four innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' departure frees up police to stand watch over
Independence Day weekend activities that will include an appearance
by President Clinton, a parade along the Hudson River of 27 tall
ships and an armada of 70,000 private boats around Manhattan.
Police estimate 28,800 officers will be on duty Tuesday, a total
that puts even Rocker to shame.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the Braves and Mets can get back to a sense
of normalcy, too. Rocker pitched a 1-2-3 inning in a Braves
victory; he went out to dinner with his girlfriend, Staci Sutton,
the daughter of Braves announcer Don Sutton; he didn't ride the
subway; and aside from a daily chorus of boos from the Shea crowd,
he escaped his return to New York unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of my mind, I thought something might happen,''
said Atlanta outfielder Brian Jordan. ``New York did a great job
with security, and the fans were really studious. They love their
Mets, and they showed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to Glavine's work and Lopez's two solo homers,
Atlanta cooled off, at least for a day, a Mets team that had won
nine of 10 games. The Mets, however, broke even with a team they
have not beaten in a series since September 1998. After pulling
within a game of Atlanta in the National League East with
back-to-back wins, the Mets remain two games back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything was lost this weekend,'' Mets manager
Bobby Valentine said. ``We came in with a pretty hot streak,
knowing that streak would come to an end. We went 2-2. That's
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the added security, the weekend had something of a
festive air. Pitcher Mike Hampton and several other Mets players
brought their children onto the field before Saturday's game, and
New York outfielder Derek Bell tooled through the clubhouse on a
borrowed NYPD bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, meanwhile, had cause to celebrate with the birth of
Larry Wayne Jones III, born to third baseman Chipper Jones and his
wife, Sharon, on Friday night. Jones took a private plane to
Atlanta for the birth, flew back to New York and played Saturday on
two hours' sleep before sitting out Sunday's game with flu-like
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big boy,'' Jones said of the new arrival. ``He was 9
pounds, 14 ounces, 21 inches. I saw him and said, `Holy smoke. He's
bigger than the fish hanging on my wall.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their booing of Rocker, New York fans had even more to
cheer about with the play of catcher Mike Piazza and outfielder
Bell. Piazza was 6-for-17 in the four games with three homers and
eight RBIs, extending his hitting streak to 20 games and his streak
of games with at least one RBI to 15. The record is 17, set by Ray
Grimes of the Cubs in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Before going hitless Sunday to end an 11-game hitting streak,
Bell had scored in a club-record 11 straight games. He went 4-for-5
with three runs and four RBIs on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets also lost pitcher Rick Reed for two to three weeks
with a broken wrist suffered Thursday night. Appropriately, given
the theatrical nature of the series opener, Reed was hurt when he
was hit by an Andruw Jones line drive that he lost in the backdrop
of the white lettering of the rotating ad boards behind home plate.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed should have other chances. The Braves and Mets must
play nine more times this season _ three games this month in
Atlanta, followed by a pair of three-game series in Atlanta (Sept.
18-20) and New York (Sept. 26-28) in the final two weeks of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games in September mean a lot more than these do,'' said
Braves outfielder Bobby Bonilla, the former Mets player who was
booed almost as mercilessly as Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of things won't fade any time soon for the Mets and
their fans, however. After losing the opener Thursday, New York
scored 10 runs in the eighth inning Friday night, capped by
Piazza's three-run homer, for an 11-8 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team has to have a game to look back on when the season
is over,'' said the Mets' Matt Franco. ``Now we have ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in a game that was televised to more than half the
nation, the Mets knocked out Greg Maddux, who had been suffering
from the flu, after only four innings en route to a 9-1 victory. It
was Maddux's shortest starting stint in more than four years and
gave the Mets their first back-to-back wins over Atlanta since
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   New York could have taken the NL East lead by percentage points
with a win Sunday, but the Mets were never in the game after giving
up four runs in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (8-5), who had lost four straight decisions since
beating San Diego on May 21, was efficient and silenced the crowd
for six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The lefthander allowed back-to-back homers to Piazza and Todd
Zeile with one out in the seventh but got out of the inning without
further damage and was replaced by Jason Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the same position today as when we came in,''
Glavine said. ``From that standpoint, these are big games. It's
still too early to get too excited. A lot of things could change
before we play again.''

KREUTER WANTS TO STAY A DODGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Todd Hundley is a free agent after the season.
So are Chad Kreuter and Jim Leyritz. And questions remain in the
organization about prospect Angel Pena's wantonness to catch
regularly in the major leagues, which could leave the Dodgers'
catching situation in disarray after the season.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag to retain Hundley could be too much even for the
Dodgers to afford, but not so to keep Kreuter, who's become an
integral part of the club. He's impressed the Dodgers to the point
of where they will try and re-sign him after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be able to work something out at the proper time,
which is after the season,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
said. ``He wants to stay, and in all likelihood we'll be able to
work something out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter's importance goes beyond being a backup catcher. He's
turned into pitcher Chan Ho Park's personal catcher, and in the
process helped Park put his career back on the right path. With
Park not eligible for free agency until after the 2001 season, the
Dodgers hope to keep that relationship intact.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter is highly respected by the entire pitching staff, and
the organization has eye on Kreuter helping Pena grow into the
every-day catcher's position by working closely with him next
season, if that scenario unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   It will undoubtedly aid Kreuter that his agent, Scott Boras,
also represents Park, Kevin Brown, Eric Gagne, Darren Dreifort and
Pena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I want to stay,'' said Kreuter, a former Pepperdine
star. ``I knew in spring training this is the place where I wanted
to be. Obviously, I need to perform and then the powers that be
have to continue to stand by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter is also thankful for the way the Dodgers treated him
since the May 16 fight at Chicago's Wrigley Field. Kreuter was the
first one in the stands after allegedly getting hit in the back of
the head before having his cap stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers have stood by me 100 percent, and it thrills me
that they have,'' said Kreuter. ``I think the fan base has stood by
me close to 100 percent, too. I think that everybody that is a
knowledgeable, well-rounded person probably feels they would have
reacted in the same exact way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player I've talked to on every team that we've come
across said they'd do the same exact thing. So I know I have the
support.''
</P>
<P>
   GREEN GETS A REST: After starting 79 straight games and slumping
for the last two weeks, right fielder Shawn Green wasn't in the
starting lineup but made a cameo appearance as a pinch hitter. He
struck out with the tying run on first in the seventh inning,
illustrating why manager Davey Johnson wanted to rest him in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Green's production, and average, dropped drastically in the last
two weeks. He's mired in a 3 for 33 slump during which his average
fell from .332 to .305. He hit just two homers and batted .260 in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done all right, but I feel I'm not even close to what I
can do,'' said Green, who has 12 homers and 57 RBI. ``I feel a lot
of that comes from going to a new team and wanting to hit a lot of
home runs, or do something like that, and then all of a sudden
getting out of your swing and it becomes a vicious cycle and things
you're trying to do become harder and harder for you because you go
away from what got you there.''
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Shawn Gilbert started in place of Green, but
it'll be his last one for a while. He's expected to be optioned to
Triple-A Albuquerque before the Dodgers play San Diego on Tuesday.
Middle infielder Mike Metcalfe was batting .320 with 19 RBI in 28
games with Dukes and, after stealing 34 bases at Double-A San
Antonio, leads the minor leagues with 43 steals. ... Right-hander
Gregg Olson pitched a scoreless inning in a rehab stint with
Single-A San Bernardino at San Jose. He allowed one hit, walked one
and struck out two. &QL;

GLAUS STILL STRUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Troy Glaus, after missing last Sunday and
Monday with back spasms _ the first two games he missed this season
_ has returned to the lineup. Now if only his swing would.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus is 1 for 21 with 13 strikeouts since his return and has
gone hitless in four games _ the first such stretch he's had this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The third baseman was 0 for 4 Sunday against Oakland with two
strikeouts and failed to hit the ball out of the infield. When he
came to the plate in the seventh with two runners on and the Angels
trailing 8-2, Glaus whiffed at a first-pitch fastball from Jeff Tam
before taking the next two pitches, both fastballs, for called
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, who leads the Angels with 23 homers but has seen his
average slip more than 20 points in the past week to .296, made
like his swing afterward and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's off right now,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``We're
seeing some good swings, but there's a little indecision. It's not
unexpected. This game can be frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   How long Scioscia allows Glaus to swing his way out of the slump
isn't clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping by playing him, he'll play his way out of it,''
Scioscia said. ``Troy's a major part of the offense. There also
comes a time when you're struggling when you consider other
options, but we're not at that point right now.''
</P>
<P>
   SOLID STARTERS: The Angels have been getting solid pitching from
their starting rotation for the last month, but not the kind of
dominating performances they got when Brian Cooper shut out Oakland
7-0 on Friday and Jarrod Washburn took a no-hitter into the seventh
inning of a 7-2 victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Angels have held the opposition to two runs or less
just 13 times in 81 games and only one other time _ April 15 and 16
by Kent Bottenfield and Scott Schoeneweis _ did they do it in
back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   Performances like Cooper's and Washburn's help the Angels in
more areas than the win column.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are good games to have where you're not, as an entire
team, trying to grind out a win,'' pitching coach Bud Black said.
``Mentally, there's less stress when the pitcher's in control and
the offense is getting the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the whole club a mental rest, and we haven't played a
lot of games like that this year. It's been battle, battle,
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis, on the disabled list since June 17 with a strained
rib cage, is continuing to play catch, but no timetable has been
set for his return or rehab program, Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTED? When the All-Star game starters are announced Tuesday,
Oakland first baseman Jason Giambi, the former Long Beach State
star, could become the first Athletic to be voted on since Mark
McGwire and Jose Canseco in 1992. Giambi led Jim Thome by 29,122
votes as of last Tuesday. &QL;

SPARKS STREAK HITS NINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KERRY MURRAY  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ After his team's offense recorded a 22-point
romp and its defense held the Detroit Shock in check, the Sparks
received nothing but praise from coach Michael Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great effort,'' the first-year WNBA coach said of his
team's 85-63 rout of the Shock on Sunday night at the Forum.
``We're slowly but surely honing our game.''
</P>
<P>
   The win extends the Sparks' winning streak to nine, a franchise
record and the longest this season in the WNBA. Overall, the team
is 13-2.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said he was most impressed with his team's defensive
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit team scored 96 points in a 12-point loss to
Sacramento on Saturday and is not at all shy about taking shots.
</P>
<P>
   However, constant pressure from the entire Los Angeles team held
the Shock to 36 percent shooting (26 for 72) from the floor, and 11
percent (1 for 9) from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   For the Sparks, Mwadi Mabika scored a team-high 21 points,
including a team-best 4 of 5 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saturday) I shot some airballs, so I wasn't too happy with
that,'' Mabika said. ``Tonight I went out worked on my outside shot
before the game and I think that helped. I just came out, took my
shot and was feeling good.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said he also was pleased with the outside shooting,
noting there will be times when his team will have to turn to that
type of game depending on the defense it encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more defenses we get accustomed to the better,'' Cooper
said. ``It will all help when we get into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Sparks' bench came in and took care of business,
holding on to a steady 20-point lead in the final five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie, who absorbed three fouls early, sat out nearly 10
minutes in the first half. She fouled out with a little more than
three minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Depth, however, kept the Sparks in the game as Delisha Milton
and Allison Feaster scored 12 and 10 points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks are expecting more of challenge Wednesday night when
they travel to Sacramento to face one of the two teams to beat them
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks return to the Forum at 7:30 p.m. Thursday against the
Washington Mystics. &QL;

SERLENGA SURPRISED BY STINT ON US TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ She was one of the thumbnail-size up-and-comers in the
back of the US Soccer press guide this year and that's where Nikki
Serlenga reckoned it would end. ``I figured I'd finish my soccer
career at Santa Clara, graduate, and have a family,'' she says. ``I
wanted to grow up _ or what I thought was growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the phone rang last winter and a voice asked Serlenga if
she wanted to play for the national team in a tournament Down
Under. The Girls of Summer were on strike and the federation was
looking for a few good women. ``A two-week vacation in Australia?''
Serlenga mused. ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   So it began and so it goes on . . . and on . . . and on for one
of the more intriguing of the fresh faces that coach April
Heinrichs has been running through the US squad.
</P>
<P>
   Serlenga came back from Australia and was invited to camp when
the A team came back to work. Heinrichs gave her a uniform and kept
putting her in games. And when the Americans go to Sydney in
September to chase another Olympic gold medal, the 22-year-old
midfielder from San Diego may well go with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees, even now,'' Serlenga understands. She
plays Michelle Akers's position _ defensive holding midfielder _
and Akers, the team's ageless Alpha female, is expected back from
shoulder surgery this month.
</P>
<P>
   Serlenga has been splitting time with Lorrie Fair, who played
for last year's World Cup team. Only 18 women will make the Olympic
team and Heinrichs is unlikely to keep three holding mids. It's a
numbers game, and Serlenga knows enough not to try doing the math
in her head. ``If you try to put the A team together,'' she says,
``it drives you nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when Serlenga has been out there with the A team,
especially in the ongoing Gold Cup tournament, her footprints are
all over the match. She turned the hat trick in the 8-0 demolition
of Costa Rica. ``I hadn't scored three goals since high school,
back when you'd get eight a game,'' Serlenga says.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday in Louisville, it was Serlenga who launched the
sideline-to-sideline pass that set up Shannon MacMillan for the
12th-minute goal that stung Canada and sent the Americans on their
way to Monday night's final against Brazil at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Only Akers does that, US Soccer people were saying. And while
Serlenga doesn't have Akers's power-forward dimensions _ she's 5-5,
130 to Akers's 5-10, 150 _ she has more than a whiff of her
presence. Her long blonde hair, which makes Serlenga identifiable
from the cheap seats, summons up Akers's leonine mane. And her
dead-ball walk is similarly purposeful and authoritative.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Serlenga saw herself as an understudy. She didn't even
watch last summer's World Cup victory over China _ she was flying
East that day. ``The national team wasn't a goal for me,'' she
says. ``It wasn't even a thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Serlenga was a member of the US under-20 pool, she had
only been in camp once for a week. But her college credentials
(twice a first-team All-American for Santa Clara, four times in the
NCAA final four, an unbeaten regular season last fall) got Serlenga
on the short list for the national team.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she had second thoughts when the call came last winter.
If she missed two weeks of classes, Serlenga would essentially miss
the quarter. And she was reluctant to alienate the Girls of Summer
by stepping into their shoes as a replacement player. ``Am I going
to step on anybody's toes doing this?'' Serlenga wondered. ``Won't
they resent me?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about it, said Jerry Smith, Serlenga's college coach
(and Mr. Brandi Chastain). Take the opportunity. That's how
Chastain got back on the team after being bypassed for the 1995
World Cup. The players went on strike to protest the Olympic bonus
plan, Chastain was brought in and ended up playing every minute of
the Games and winning a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Graduation can wait, Serlenga's mother told her. ``I felt I was
being responsible by thinking I should stay in school,'' Serlenga
says. ``And my mom was like, go play soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   So she did, and scored a goal against the Czechs in her first
international match. ``It was the worst goal, but because it was in
Australia nobody knew about it,'' Serlenga confesses. ``I think the
chunk of dirt I hit went further than the ball. But the goalkeeper
went for the chunk of dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   The JVs ended up winning the tournament and Serlenga got an
invitation to train with the varsity. That ruled out school for the
rest of the winter and spring and it put Serlenga on a magical
mystery tour unlike anything she's ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of these black-and-white, cut-and-dried people,'' she
says. ``I like everything laid out. I write all this stuff in my
day planner. I want to know what I'm doing next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm may know. Nikki Serlenga doesn't. ``I could be in
Germany next week,'' she says. ``And I could be back in San
Diego.'' Serlenga might play against the Brazilians Monday night
and she might not. Heinrichs is still in experimental mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no clue,'' Serlenga shrugs. ``At the end of this
tournament, they'll name the roster for the German trip. That's the
most stability I have right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds are that Heinrichs won't name the Olympic team until the
end of the month, if then. But Serlenga has gone ahead and bought
tickets anyway. ``For my Mom,'' she says. ``If I don't make it, she
can still go. I figure I owe her for all the gas she bought driving
me to soccer all those years.''
</P>
<P>
   If Serlenga doesn't make it, there's another World Cup in 2003,
another Olympics in 2004, and the WUSA pro league next year (she'll
be playing for Atlanta). ``I'll be around,'' she says. ``It isn't
like if I don't make the Olympic team I'll be banned and sent
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole year has been a bonus ball, the way Serlenga sees it.
``Who would have thought they would pick someone who wasn't in the
pool?'' she says. The day planner can only plan so much.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Serlenga doesn't even plan dinner. ``We're going out
for Thai food,'' teammate Julie Foudy told Serlenga Sunday &UR;  &LR; night,
while she was sitting around the Sheraton Needham. ``Get dressed.
Let's go.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It was the macabre irony of Wimbledon's opening week, a
grievous reminder of how outrageously sports trivialize reality
when winning and losing are equated with life and death.
</P>
<P>
   In each of her first three matches before the tournament's
midpoint respite Sunday, Monica Seles was assigned to Court 2.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the so-called show courts, among the most prominent
at the All England Lawn Tennis &AMP; Croquet Club. But it is more
popularly known by its nickname. Because upsets of prohibitive
favorites have become commonplace on its grass in recent years, it
has been dubbed the Graveyard of Champions.
</P>
<P>
   While the point it illustrates may be harmless enough, the mere
mention of it in connection with Seles is offensive. Her career was
diminished, her life forever altered, her innocence shattered by a
true tragedy on a tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, 1993, when she was 19 years old and without peer in
women's tennis, Seles was severely wounded by a crazed spectator.
During a changeover while she was playing Magdalena Maleeva in a
quarterfinal at Hamburg, she was stabbed in the back, just below
the left shoulder blade, by a 38-year-old German, Guenther Parche,
who perpetrated this violence in a manic attempt to restore his
countrywoman, Steffi Graf, to preeminence in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, it worked. Graf also was traumatized by the
incident, but the fact was that it effectively removed Seles, who
had won eight of the last 10 Grand Slam events she had entered _
two US, three French, and three Australian opens _ as an obstacle.
Seles did not play competitive tennis for the next 27 months.
Meanwhile, Graf again became dominant. And in an interpretation of
justice that could be considered as criminal as the offense,
Parche, in effect, received a suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much injustice in there,'' Seles said last week,
``that maybe one day when someone really looks into it, they'll
realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   But no amount of revisionist jurisprudence can provide
restitution for her stolen promise.
</P>
<P>
   Seles hasn't approached her teen level of supremacy since her
return Aug. 15, 1995. She seemed vulnerable, tentative, haunted, as
if waiting for _ fearing _ the next psychotic assault. In the
nearly five full years since her comeback, she has reached four
Grand Slam finals but won only once _ at the 1996 Australian Open.
Remove the knife from Parche's hand and her stockpile of major
championships could have increased tenfold, by conservative
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   As if that were not ordeal enough, she watched her beloved
father, Karolj, suffer horribly from cancer before his death in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   So the Yugoslav pixie with the guttural grunt that punctuates
each shot and the sublime talent forever has been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Graveyard of Champions, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I had such a clean slate till '93,'' said Seles. ``My
life had been so much tennis, my focus. (It was) obviously totally
different then. I lost two matches a year. I think Steffi and I,
those few years, were just dominating tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then obviously after the stabbing, things became different.
You have to think that I didn't touch a racket for 2 1/2 years.
There were a lot hurdles for me to overcome on my own, and then
obviously some other hurdles, too. But I think that's for sure one
of the biggest things that has been hard, because I was playing so
well at that point in my career. I was at a prime age of 19 for the
sport, and that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But a remarkable transformation has taken place recently. Seles
appears somehow refreshed, as if she has experienced a catharsis of
sorts. She won the Italian Open in May, then reached the French
quarterfinals before yielding to eventual champion Mary Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   And while she believes Wimbledon, the lone major she lacks,
remains the most elusive because ``it just, unfortunately, doesn't
suit my game,'' the No. 6 seed has advanced to the fourth round
Monday _ on Court 1, mercifully _ against No. 9 Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario.
</P>
<P>
   As she soldiered on through her week at accursed Court 2 _
pulling a great escape against Karina Habsudova before sweeping
aside Els Callens and Sarah Pitkowski _ Seles seemed increasingly
more assured and relaxed, as if treasuring each moment more than
she would have if so many hadn't been taken from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just really love to play the game of tennis,'' she said. ``I
mean, nothing really besides that really matters to me as much as .
. . my love for the game. Whether that be playing in a Grand Slam
or whether that be practicing at home (in Sarasota, Fla.), I just
love to play. When I wake up in the morning, that's one of my
favorite things to do. I'm just very lucky I can do it
professionally, plus I can do it healthwise and all that other
stuff with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were periods in my life when I didn't have this, and the
last few years have been difficult and there's times I probably
didn't want to be on the tennis court. But I have to say the past
six months, it really appears I was looking forward to going out on
the court. It's really nice to have that feeling back, because for
a long time, it wasn't there _ not on my own, but because of other
stuff outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Her popularity has increased in inverse proportion to her
superiority. At 26, she has become something of a beloved elder,
whereas she was resented for her aloofness _ or more likely her
success _ in her heyday. The change in status is pronounced. While
alleging last week that she had been hazed and subjected to racial
slurs during her first year on the WTA Tour, Alexandra Stevenson
specified Seles as one of the players who welcomed and supported
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think I was unconsciously not nice (before),''
said Seles. ``I was 14, 15, really in my own shell, kind of. Just
said, `Hi,' `Bye,' looked down at the floor. I was very shy. I
think that's how people perceived me in the beginning. Then, by
like when I was 18, they realized that I was different. I changed
probably as a person, too. I was much more open. I wasn't as shy as
I was when I was 14.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, she is perhaps more determined now, though she
still isn't ready to rush down to Ladbrokes to place a wager on
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personality is that I would not enter a tournament if I
would not believe I could win it,'' she said. ``This tournament is
no different. Winning Wimbledon would truly be amazing. You can't
really even put that in words. But I'm in the fourth round and I
have such a long way to go that all I'm doing right now is focusing
on my next match.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, she cannot lose here, regardless of the outcome.
Startlingly, she has maintained throughout the week that she
harbors no lingering animosity toward her assailant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've moved on,'' she said. ``Certain things are not going to
change. But I have no anger or bitterness over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is Seles's ultimate revenge. She won't let Guenther
Parche bother her anymore. That is a victory that transcends games.

EVERETT FRAY A WELL-WORN TALE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In that American League playoff hunt best known as
``Survivor,'' the Red Sox are about to be voted off the island.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, they finished getting swept by the White Sox and Carl
Everett kicked off the time-tested Boston tradition of blaming the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Inimitable Sox manager Pinky Higgins once pushed the face of our
own Bud Collins into a plate of pasta. Years earlier, a
knife-wielding Boston manager is said to have chased a Hub scribe
through a moving railcar. And who can forget Jim Rice ripping the
shirt off the Globe's intrepid Steve Fainaru?
</P>
<P>
   Now there's Everett trying to have harmless me tossed from the
clubhouse before the latest in a depressing line of Sox losses.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours before Sunday's inevitable 8-2 thrashing, I was
standing at the door of Jimy Williams's office when I heard Everett
in the clubhouse grumbling, ``Who wrote Frye and I were fighting?''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring I might be able to shed some light on the issue, I
walked toward Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I tried to talk to you Friday night,'' I started to
tell him. ``You had no comment and Jeff said you two weren't going
at it . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He heard none of it. I was the bad guy _ ``a curly-haired
(expletive) trying to stir things up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only the beginning of a lengthy, expletive-filled tirade
_ outrageous and obscene even by the lofty standards of what my big
ears have heard over the years. Sox publicist Glenn Wilburn stepped
between us and started to nudge me away from Everett. Wilburn was
just doing his job, but it always has amused me that when a
ballplayer flies off the handle the peacemaker usually tells the
object of ire to move away.
</P>
<P>
   Everett wouldn't stop yelling and swearing. Yeesh. This man, who
points to God after every homer and claims he lives by the word of
the Bible, was using every vile word I'd ever heard _ in the middle
of the clubhouse _ just after the Sox had filed into their Sunday
chapel meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded me of the bad old days of 1986 when a Globe
photographer accidentally stumbled into the Sox' Sunday morning
chapel meeting at Fenway and was confronted by an angry outfielder
who screamed, ``Get the (expletive) out of here. Can't you see
we're having our (expletive) chapel?''
</P>
<P>
   Everett told me never to talk with him again (ouch, there's a
void in my life). He told me to get out of the room. His house, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to be like the Sundance Kid and say, ``If you ask me to
stay, I'll leave,'' but this didn't seem like the time for humor. I
stayed.
</P>
<P>
   While Everett was screaming, Williams asked the writers in his
office who was doing the yelling. They told him it was Everett.
Williams never moved.
</P>
<P>
   Back out in the big room, coach Tommy Harper got in front of
Everett, wrapped him up, and slowly nudged him to the other side of
the clubhouse. Everett was still calling me vile names. I tossed a
few back at him. It had been reduced to your basic schoolyard
(You're fat . . . Oh yeah, you're ugly) argument.
</P>
<P>
   Everett got in the face of Wilburn and told him it was his job
to kick me out. When Wilburn wouldn't do it, Everett started to
verbally abuse the publicist. Everett later apologized to Wilburn.
</P>
<P>
   Ever-mindful that fans don't give a hoot about media problems, I
have avoided writing about these inevitable episodes. It's part of
the game. When you rip someone in the paper, who can blame that
player for ripping back? It's only human, and writers should expect
a measure of this.
</P>
<P>
   When I called Steve Crawford a sack of doorknobs, it didn't
surprise me that he got in my face and made all kinds of threats.
You dish it out, you take it. Fair enough. Mo Vaughn probably had a
reason to unload on me in the Sox clubhouse two years ago. Amid the
glowing stuff, I'd written some harsh things about Vaughn's court
case and his contract talks. Ditto for Wade Boggs, Jim Rice, Bill
Fitch, and John McNamara. This job is going to get guys mad
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to figure Everett's outburst and it speaks to the
larger problem of Everett as a loose cannon and the Red Sox'
overall frustration. Good clubhouse karma, a signature of the Sox
for the last two years, seems to be eroding.
</P>
<P>
   Some background info. In Saturday's Globe I wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Frye got into an animated discussion with Carl Everett before
the bottom of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't getting into it,'' said Frye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to say,'' said Everett.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. In Sunday's paper, Gordon Edes explained that Everett
was ``commiserating'' with Frye after the utilityman struck out
pinch hitting for Mike Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   That was the source of Everett's outrage. Two Red Sox were
observed talking in an animated fashion, they were asked about it,
and it was reported with no characterization of negativity. Frye is
fine with it. Everett just doesn't know what was written.
</P>
<P>
   Everett largely has been deified in the Boston papers this year
and he deserves it. He's a legitimate Most Valuable Player
candidate and he deserves to start the All-Star Game. (He ranks
fourth among all outfielders in the latest balloting.) He made
another spectacular catch Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But his five-star nutty was hard to figure. Perhaps he had me
confused with some other smart, handsome, athletic scribe. There
are, after all, so many of us. Perhaps he was trying to light a
fire under the slumping Sox. Perhaps he wants his teammates to
rally around him and think of him as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll talk to Carl about this,'' said Sox publicist Kevin
Shea, who was not with the team in Chicago. ``I'm sure Jimy will
talk to Carl. It's probably some frustration because of the way
things are going.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are not going well. But don't tell Everett I said that.
This curly-haired (expletive) doesn't want to be accused of trying
to stir things up.

RED SOX UNRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-WHITE SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Jimy Williams notwithstanding, the Red Sox have no
business entering any spelling bees just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Not as long as they're still stumped on this one: W-I-N.
</P>
<P>
   And while it may take the designers in Milan some time to catch
up, here's a hot fashion tip obvious to anyone sitting in Comiskey
Park over the weekend:
</P>
<P>
   White Sox are in.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox? At the moment, clearly passe, after being swept for the
second successive weekend and the third time this season, which is
one more series sweep than they endured all of last year. They've
fallen below .500 (38-39) for the first time since April 11, when
they were 3-4.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, it was the White Sox, baseball's highest-flying team,
8-2, completing a three-game domination. Chicago is now 23 games
over .500 (52-29) after Magglio Ordonez drove in five runs with two
home runs and Frank Thomas hit another and was on base four times,
10 times in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Big Hurt? That may be Thomas's nickname, but it's Boston's state
of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't make any mistakes,'' said losing pitcher Pete
Schourek (2-7), who gave up a three-run homer to Ordonez in the
first and back-to-back jobs to Thomas and Ordonez in the third.
``They certainly don't make any mistakes swinging the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit a lot of balls hard this series. We didn't have 'em
fooled very often.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, losers of eight of their last nine games, are
drooping as much as Brian Daubach's red socks. Daubach's hose were
back to half-mast after he'd pulled them up for good luck last
Thursday, when he hit two home runs and drove in six runs in a 12-4
win over the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Sox had five singles and Jose Offerman's
too-late-to-matter home run off 11-game winner James Baldwin, who
last season gave up 11 hits and 10 runs in 2 1/3 innings against
the Red Sox but this season beat them twice, allowing two earned
runs in 16 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Neither ancient history nor the recent past _ Baldwin was lit up
for 12 runs in his previous two starts, both losses _ worked in
Boston's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he pitched better than he has in the past,'' Chicago
manager Jerry Manuel said. ``He handled Nomar Garciaparra really
well all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, whose sacrifice fly in the third drove in the Red
Sox' first run, flied out four times.
</P>
<P>
   At least with Izzy Alcantara out of the lineup Sunday, replaced
in right field by Jeff Frye, the Sox cut their errors from three to
one, but it wasn't a dizzy-free game. No one bothered to cover
second base when Chris Singleton stole in the sixth inning. Catcher
Scott Hatteberg's throw, which was on the bag, wound up in center
field, enabling Singleton to skip to third before he scored on
Herbert Perry's single off reliever John Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprised me, surprised me,'' said Hatteberg, still
startled enough to repeat himself after the game. ``Most of the
time I throw to an empty bag, but usually somebody ends up being
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek had hoped to be there in the Sox' hour of need Sunday.
He wanted to deliver something on the order of his previous start,
when he shut out the Orioles on four hits for seven innings, but
while warming up he had a notion that wasn't going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bad time to have nothing,'' he said. ``I didn't throw enough
quality pitches and they took advantage. Every mistake I made, they
hit, and hit well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't give our hitters a chance. I give up three in the
bottom of the first, and the momentum's gone. We scratch back and
get a run, and I give up two more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who scored a total of eight runs in three games here,
offered token resistance to Baldwin, who set down 11 in a row after
Ed Sprague's two-out walk in the fourth. Offerman broke that string
with his fourth home run to open the eighth, but lefthanded
reliever Kelly Wunsch struck out Carl Everett and retired Morgan
Burkhart on a comebacker to the mound with two on to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who with Garciaparra has carried the Sox' offense all
season, now has gone six straight games without knocking in a run,
his longest drought of the season. Until last week, he hadn't gone
more than three games without a ribbie.
</P>
<P>
   Help may be on the way. Troy O'Leary is due to rejoin the club
Monday night in Minnesota after missing two weeks to deal with
personal problems, and veteran outfielder Bernard Gilkey, signed
after being released by Arizona, should be activated as soon as
general manager Dan Duquette creates a roster spot. Add a couple of
big leaguers, subtract a couple of short-timers, and perhaps the
Sox will right themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think eventually we will,'' said Jason Varitek, who struck
out as a pinch hitter to end the game. ``But we're not playing
right. You can play short, but we've got to maintain our focus and
play with a little determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had called a team meeting after a Saturday loss he
described by spelling U-G-L-Y, took comfort Sunday not from his
dictionary but from the Comiskey Park scoreboard, which showed
first-place Toronto losing again to the Orioles for a three-game
sweep by Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I checked that scoreboard up there again today,''
Williams said. ``As few games as we've won, we're lucky we're still
3 1/2 games out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to keep playing, gentlemen. That's all we can do.''

MARINERS SAIL PAST TEXAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The fan balloting is over, but two of
Seattle's potential All-Stars made one last stump for votes Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele won his 10th game with a strong seven-inning
performance and Edgar Martinez equaled Ken Griffey Jr.'s club
record for runs batted in before the All-Star break with a two-run
homer in the Mariners' 11-4 victory over the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Now it only needs to be seen if the Seattle electorate has any
influence in New York, where Yankees manager Joe Torre, skipper of
the American League team for the game in Atlanta on July 11, is due
to announce the AL voting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up just two cheap runs in the victory, Sele is 8-1
with a 3.92 ERA in his past 10 starts. Martinez had a two-run homer
to cap a seven-run rally in the seventh and leads the majors in
RBIs with 84, the same number rung up by Griffey before the break
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sele won't come straight out and say he wants to go to the
All-Star Game. It goes against his self-effacing style. He was
elected once before, in 1998, but has never pitched in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great honor to be selected,'' Sele said.
``Edgar's a lock. The reason they have All-Star Games is so they
can showcase people like Alex (Rodriguez, the likely starter at
shortstop for the AL) and Edgar.''
</P>
<P>
   And is Sele a lock? He's one of five 10-game winners
league-wide, he and Oakland's Tim Hudson having reached that level
Sunday night. And when Torre polled Piniella, Sele got a strong
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have me vote on five starters and five relievers for the
game,'' Piniella said. ``Sele was absolutely on my list. No doubt
in my mind that he deserves to be there. He and Edgar both.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele already has acres of sand, sun and surf awaiting him during
the break. He and his wife, Jennifer, have reservations on the
beach at San Diego, the Mariners' first stop after the break.
Martinez doesn't have plans _ yet. He doesn't know that he will be
selected as a backup, but he's leaving the time open, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's inclusion wouldn't be at all in doubt if this game
had the designated hitter. Being in Atlanta, it doesn't, so
Martinez is left to wait and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to go,'' Martinez said. ``I know that Aaron
deserves to go. We are where we are because of the way he's
pitched. He's been an All-Star for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Martinez himself? He doesn't mask his desire to head to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go,'' he said. ``I'd like to take my wife (Holli)
and our boy, Alex, along. I'm leaving the time flexible, but three
days off would be welcome, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He shouldn't plan on getting them. Martinez's homer in the
seventh inning was his 23rd, and his league-leading RBI total (84)
and .354 batting average likely have already resonated all the way
to Torre's desk.
</P>
<P>
   And while Sunday night's bit of last-second lobbying by Sele and
Martinez isn't the baseball equivalent of stuffing the ballot box,
the results might come across as stuffing Texas in a coffin.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time defending champion Rangers aren't dead, but if they
climb out of the 10-game deficit now facing them to win the West,
you could call them Lazarus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big game,'' center fielder Mike Cameron said. ``We
win the series, and we beat a team in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Make that the team in the West. Used to be, anyway. The Rangers
are a skeletal representation of the team that had the heart of
Texas going for it the past few seasons. The Rangers had a chance
to win, but one key mistake _ a blown double play thanks to a
throwing error by rookie third baseman Mike Lamb _ gave Seattle an
opening.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners responded by doing what good teams are supposed to
do _ take advantage. After starter Matt Perisho loaded the bases
with no one out in the seventh, pinch-hitter Stan Javier beat out a
potential double-play ball, tying the game, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb's error scored one run, then Cameron came up huge with a
two-out, two-run single. Rodriguez followed with an RBI hit,
Martinez unloaded his bomb, and the crowd would have dissipated
into the Texas night had it not been for the lure of post-game
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had the only in-game fireworks, however, and those
are the ones that count.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has won nine series in a row and has moved out to a
1{-game lead over Oakland in the West. At 15 games over .500
(47-32) just two days short of the halfway point of the season, the
Mariners are positioning themselves for the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the series after losing the first game, and to me,
that's big,'' Cameron said. ``When we lost the first game, we just
came back harder and played better.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rangers couldn't keep up.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of power in the West is changing.

BEGAY GETS DROP ON CALCAVECCHIA 
</HEADLINE>
 HARTFORD OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ His ball sat 22 feet from the hole on the 18th
green at TPC River Highlands Sunday and Notah Begay looked over a
putt that made his knees knock and his hands shake.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess when you've been through what I've been in my life . .
. I had nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But the putt? It was a slick, big right-to-left break with a
championship on the line, not to mention a bucket-full of money.
What was he thinking?
</P>
<P>
   ``Making it,'' he said. ``I mean, I couldn't finish worse than
second. I was already in a playoff. I literally had nothing to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to lose? He won everything when his birdie putt on the
72d hole of the Greater Hartford Open curled in perfectly over the
right lip to put an exclamation point on his improbable
come-from-behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   Closing with a 6-under-par 64 for a tournament-record 20-under
260 total worth $504,000, Begay became the first back-to-back
winner on the PGA Tour since his former Stanford teammate, Tiger
Woods, won three weeks in a row to open the 1999 season. Begay, 27,
who prevailed in the St. Jude Classic last week, now has won four
times on Tour in the last 10 months, which must put him right up
there with his good friend Woods. Right?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably one of the top one or two most recognizable
people in the world,'' said Begay, laughing. ``I'm just hoping to
be the most recognizable guy in Albuquerque.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly has no rival when it comes to being the most
heartwarming story on Tour this year. His one-week jail stint in
March after pleading guilty to drunken driving is a topic every
time he tees it up. ``In a nutshell,'' he said, when asked to
summarize his 2000 Tour season, ``we've got the highest of highs
(from) the lowest of lows.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps drawing upon last week's momentum _ though shooting
rounds of 64-65-67 the first three days couldn't have hurt _ Begay
said he felt in complete control as he went head-to-head with Mark
Calcavecchia. Never mind that Calcavecchia owned a three-shot lead
thanks to rounds of 65-64-64.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get to 20 under,'' said Begay, the only Native
American on Tour. ``I knew if I could get to 20, I'd have a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He got there on the strength of a putting method that could
become the rage if his tear continues. In order to always have a
putt that hooks, he putts lefthanded (on right-to-left breaks) and
righthanded (on left-to-righters). Laugh, if you will, but keep in
mind Begay drained birdies from 15 feet at the second hole, 18 feet
at the fourth, 15 at the fifth, and 17 at the seventh. Oh, and he
nailed a 15-footer to save par at the sixth, dropping that on top
of Calcavecchia's 25-foot par-save.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, he didn't have to make six (long putts) on me, but
he did,'' said a shellshocked Calcavecchia, a nine-time Tour winner
who hasn't tasted victory since 1998. His fifth top-5 finish here
didn't sit well, because after making 19 birdies in three days, he
made just one in the final round and finished with a lackluster
effort, save for a dramatic eagle at the par-4 15th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say he beat me,'' said Calcavecchia, who
paused, not convinced it was true. ``You know, I should have done
better today. I really should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia made his only birdie of the day at the par-4 third
to get to 18 under, but he was caught at the seventh when Begay
made his fourth birdie. When he put his tee shot into a greenside
bunker at the par-3 11th and couldn't get it up-and-down,
Calcavecchia dropped a shot behind, the first time he had been out
of the lead since the end of Round 2.
</P>
<P>
   Begay pushed two shots in front with a birdie putt _ 20 feet, of
course _ at the 12th, after Calcavecchia ran off three straight
pars. Calcavecchia conceded that at that point his thoughts were
not exactly on winning, but on holding off Kirk Triplett (67_264,
solo third) for second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had pretty much written it off,'' said Calcavecchia, who
stood on the par-4 15th tee two strokes down and watched Begay
drill a 3-wood from 296 yards dead on line with the pin. ``I don't
know how close it came to the hole, but I thought, `Well, there's
another birdie.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the ball never slowed, running past the pin into a
swale behind the green.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia, still thinking more of second place than first,
toasted a 3-wood that also tracked the pin. Begay, who discovered
that his ball had rolled long, appeared stunned when his opponent's
had come to rest 6 feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Begay putted from behind the green and ran his eagle bid 3 feet
long, then elected to putt out. ``Probably a mistake,'' he said,
for he lipped out the birdie bid and settled for par. When
Calcavecchia rolled in the eagle putt, he was back in a share of
first at 19 under.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so fast,'' said Calcavecchia, ``but the putt got
easier (when Begay missed what looked like a sure birdie putt.)''
</P>
<P>
   After matching pars at the par-3 16th and par-4 17th and drives
into a fairway bunker on the 18th, it came down to putts of the
same length at a tournament that had been a birdie festival all
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw where he was aiming and I thought he was too far to the
right,'' said Calcavecchia, who saw his 25-footer roll left just as
it got to the hole. ``I didn't think he was going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   No offense, but Begay thought otherwise.

BRUINS BOLSTER BLUE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins, whose most pressing need is defensive help,
added depth to their blue line Sunday when they signed unrestricted
free agent Peter Popovic to a one-year-plus-an-option-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Popovic, a 32-year-old native of Koping, Sweden, brings size
(he's 6 feet 6 inches, 239 pounds) and experience. He broke into
the league in 1993 with Montreal and played for the Canadiens for
five seasons before being traded to the Rangers. He played 68 games
for New York in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   This past season, after going to the Pittsburgh Penguins at the
end of training camp in a deal for Kevin Hatcher, Popovic played 54
games and had one goal and five assists. He missed 21 games because
of a finger injury and seven games with a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Popovic is unlikely to provide much offense. He has nine goals
in his career (425 games), but the Bruins aren't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll provide some stability in our own zone,'' said assistant
general manager Mike O'Connell. ``He likes Boston and he knows what
we've got and he's looking forward to coming.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said coach Pat Burns was in on the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through the (free agent) list and Pat knew him and
spoke highly of him,'' said O'Connell.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he'll be a third or fourth defenseman or more of a role
player remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens,'' said O'Connell. ``We don't know the
status of (unrestricted free agent Don) Sweeney. We're looking for
the older guys (27-year-old draft picks Jarmo Kultanen from Finland
and Pavel Kolarik of the Czech Republic) to hopefully give us some
minutes along with Nick Boynton and Jonathan Girard, and Brandon
Smith as well. Then we'd add those to Kyle McLaren, Darren Van
Impe, and Hal Gill.''

   FITCHBURG, Mass. _ Australian Henk Vogels seems to be having an
awful lot of fun invading the American racing scene. Maybe too much
fun as far as the US bike racers are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the 26-year-old from Perth won the First Union
Classic US Pro Championship in Philadelphia, and Sunday he took the
Fitchburg Longsjo Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The women's side had an international flavor, too, as defending
champion Lynne Bessette of Quebec repeated her win.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day stage started 41 years ago as a one-day race, a
tribute to late Olympian Art Longsjo.
</P>
<P>
   Vogels, who had won two of the three stages, had a lead of 3
seconds going into Sunday's race. So it seemed all he needed to do
to hang on to his lead was stay with the pack, which was sure to
remain together as the 114 racers whizzed around downtown 55 times,
covering each .9-mile lap in just over two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one worry _ the winner of the race would be given
a 10-second bonus. If Eddy Gragus, who was the rider 3 seconds
back, crossed the line first, he would leapfrog to the overall win.
</P>
<P>
   Vogels and his teammates no doubt were concerned when some of
the riders broke away from the pack. Four riders took off and built
a gap of almost half a minute from the field.
</P>
<P>
   But there were still 25 laps to go, and the pack eventually
swallowed up the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I didn't have to do a thing today, because my team
chased every single break,'' Vogels said. ``Hats off to them. I
think Roy Knickman is in the hospital, he must have used 8,000
calories.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pack rode down the final stretch, past the bank
thermometer flashing 93 degrees, 21-year-old Baden Cooke surged
past everyone else to finish in 1 hour 52 minutes 12 seconds.
Cooke, like Vogels, is from Australia, but is living in Los Angeles
while he races.
</P>
<P>
   Gragus said he knew that if he had won the race he could have
taken over the yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was a long shot today, and my best chance was to try
and do something at the finish, but usually I can't outsprint Henk
anyway,'' Gragus said.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's race, Bessette easily defended her overall win,
even though Sarah Ulmer of New Zealand won Sunday's 25-mile race in
1:03.32. Bessette entered the race with a 16-second lead after
winning Saturday's stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some breaks that took off, but my teammates kept
reeling them in,'' she said of the race which, like the men's,
ended in a sprint finish.
</P>
<P>
   Bessette, 25, started racing in 1996 after an injury sidelined
her track and field aspirations. Bessette, from Quebec, is on the
Canadian national team and will compete in the Olympic trials next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Vogels, who rode in the 1997 and 1999 Tours de France with the
French-based Credit Agricole team, last year joined the American
Mercury. He, his wife Cindy, and their 10-week-old son Jett split
their time between Boulder and Perth.
</P>
<P>
   Vogels said he thinks he has a ``90 percent chance'' of
representing Australia in the Olympics when the team is announced
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   He's certainly on the right track.

DON'T ASSUME M'S OUT OF RODRIGUEZ SWEEPSTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is the middle of the season. The Mariners are
winning, and being run as if someone intends for them to contend.
The clock is ticking, and yet Alex Rodriguez has not made up his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done anything yet. What have we done? We're at the
(beginning of) July, we're playing well, but what have we done? We
really haven't accomplished anything this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of improvements, and hopefully things
continue to improve. We have an older team. When it's all said and
done, I'll have to sit down and evaluate what the future of this
franchise is, what my future in this organization could be.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day, however, sitting in front of his locker in the
happy Mariners clubhouse in Safeco Field, the shortstop speculated
on how he might look in purple.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks?
</P>
<P>
   Playing for an expansion team down in the culturally and
meteorologically challenged desert?
</P>
<P>
   In those softball uniforms?
</P>
<P>
   He smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez _ the so-called big-city traditionalist everyone
thinks has his heart set on the Los Angeles Dodgers or New York
Mets or Atlanta Braves, or maybe one of those Chicago teams _ is,
true to his word, keeping his options open.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows, the Diamondbacks have bought themselves a World
Series contender.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, like many free agents before him, is curious about
the power, the glory and the money-like-water spending of Arizona's
Jerry Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez wants to win. He wants to get paid. He wants to know
he's never going to walk into the clubhouse and hear how ownership
is dumping salary like deck chairs off the Titanic and panic
because he's going to get stuck _ the future Hall of Famer with
first-class taste surrounded by farmhands and penny-ante utility
men.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, that was how Rodriguez felt with the Mariners at times
over the past few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every guy in this clubhouse the last two years was pretty
miserable,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were overmatched, and it was draining. You're probably only
as good as your 25th man. Now we're top three in the American
League and top five in baseball, and hopefully we're in a position
to improve ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The club, with a headless-horseman ownership group, squandered
the momentum of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson's status and eventual trade numbed the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The work ethic of former general manager Woody Woodward and a
slow-to-react chain of command foiled any ability to improve the
club.
</P>
<P>
   A stressed-out move to Safeco Field had ownership capping
payroll until revenue streams were in the black.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella threw his hands up, and Ken Griffey Jr.
simmered and stewed about wanting to go home.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Mariner history Rodriguez has on which to base his
decision to stay or go. Maybe that's why, no matter how rosy 2000
seems so far, with CEO Howard Lincoln in control and general
manager Pat Gillick working like a dog, Rodriguez stands firm.
</P>
<P>
   Don't read anything into this.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has not made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are still in this thing.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Rodriguez looked over to his buddy, Edgar
Martinez, one locker away. The quintessential Mariner, Martinez's
status as a one-club player means something to Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot more now than it ever did, because nobody stays
with the same team anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you something. I'm a very straight shooter. Three
years ago, I said I wanted to become a free agent. I've never
changed my posture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, I said, `Come to me when I'm a free agent and
I'll talk to you guys.' Two years ago, I said the same thing. And
this October, when we met in Las Vegas after the Players Choice
Awards, Howard Lincoln said we have a contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `Listen. Keep that. This is not about me right now.
Let's go see what we do this year. Let's go see what develops,'''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew there was no way I was going to come back, I would
have told them in that meeting, like Junior. I would have said,
`Save yourself the time and effort and get rid of me.' I would have
said `Get something for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't tell them to call the Mets. He didn't tell them to
trade him to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   This pleasant, stress-free summer, Rodriguez and the Mariners
are settled into a mutually agreed-upon relationship that says the
free-agent-to-be stays for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With a World Series appearance, Rodriguez has guaranteed he'll
be a Mariner again. Anything short of that, it's his call.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Rodriguez has watched the free-agent market take a
few interesting turns. Griffey signed in Cincinnati for less than
market value. The Cubs all but drove Sammy Sosa to New York, and
Rodriguez has gained more understanding about the damage that can
be done in free-agent bartering.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, you don't name your own price.
</P>
<P>
   What Sosa did in Chicago, by saying he thought the Cubs should
start thinking about a contract extension for $140 million _ that
is not Rodriguez's style.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't Rodriguez who's talking about being the first $200
million baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's irrelevant to me. I play the game. I love the game.
Business is not my forte.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Rodriguez said he felt he was put in a no-win
situation when a reporter asked whether a championship or money
meant more to him.
</P>
<P>
   When Rodriguez said money, in order to take care of his family,
he was slammed across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was being honest. If I said I didn't care about money,
then people would have said I was lying. I'm not going to be
dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, no circus has followed Rodriguez, the way
Griffey was asked all of last season what his future held.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of speculation, but for the most part it's been
very quiet for me this year. It's been good, because the story has
been our ballclub. So, every city I come to there have been some
questions here and there, but for the most part, it's been OK,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, results of voting for the All-Star Game will be
announced. Ahead by nearly 100,000 votes by the time stadium
balloting ended last week, Rodriguez should be named the starting
shortstop for the AL, unless Internet voters push Derek Jeter,
Nomar Garciaparra or Omar Vizquel to the top.
</P>
<P>
   This is Rodriguez's year to be voted onto the team. He's got the
numbers _ .342 batting average, 21 homers, 71 RBIs, 102 hits, .624
slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   He's also got the MVP aura of a star trying to lead his team to
a pennant.
</P>
<P>
   So Rodriguez will go to Atlanta and represent the Mariners. He
will go to Atlanta and hear what he hears when he goes to New York
or Chicago or Los Angeles: The Braves want Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't anyone believe he could just as easily choose to
stay in Seattle?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm from Miami, probably,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at me like I'm a big-city guy. But just for rebuttal
purposes, I don't think I'm a big-city guy. But if you want an
answer, if I was a big-city guy, the biggest stage every year is a
World Series. That's as big as stage as you could ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates like Jay Buhner understand why no one believes the
Mariners have a shot at Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the game. Look what's happened the last few years. The
fans have been burned several times. They've been burned by the
strike, they've been burned by a lot of different things. The way
money's been thrown around. We're getting to a certain point of the
game where if you start paying someone that much money, basically
he's making half the payroll. Fans want to know, how are they going
to be able to support a supporting cast?'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't naive. The fans are pretty smart out there. But
if this team stays competitive, why not? Look at the intangibles.
Look at this stadium. Yeah, we paid a lot for Safeco Field, but ...
it's incredible,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will help keep him to stay here. Us winning will have a
lot to do with it, and who we're bringing back. They've got a lot
of guys locked up. So, I think there's a lot of things in favor of
him coming back. The grass isn't any greener on the other side. He
doesn't have any greater opportunity to win anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez understands this, yet he is one of the few who says
you can't judge Griffey's decision to leave Seattle for Cincinnati
_ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look at the first two months of a 10-year contract
and make a determination. He's on pace to hit 50 homers and drive
in 120, so that's not too bad. And you know he's going to hit
around .300 or .290,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think you can evaluate his decision after five or six
years and see what they've done. Me, personally, I'm not
necessarily one who wants to go back home. I don't think that will
be good for me. Griffey is at a different stage of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the void Griffey left behind has cleared the way for
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   What he won't say, what no one in the Mariners organization will
say, is that the dynamics of the clubhouse are very different this
season without Griffey. There is no dominating personality. There
is no superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Griffey could have been happy staying in Seattle,
Rodriguez was diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for Griffey and whether or not he'd be happy.
But we're winning. And Griffey would fit in with this club. We're
all just one of 25 guys. The name on the front of our jerseys means
more than the names on the back. Everybody is really focused on
being a winning ballclub,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner said he has noticed a change in Rodriguez this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a quiet leader, but he's becoming more of the
guy who will step to the front and say things that need to be said,
keep guys fired up every day in a very positive way,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty good at knowing the game, and knowing when the
time needs to be. I think he's pretty good at knowing everybody's
personality, and when to give a guy a pat on the butt and when to
give a kick in the butt. He's definitely involved into a complete
ballplayer, mentally and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who wants to be seen as a leader, has the
intelligence, diplomacy and political savvy to understand the
subtlety and importance of team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lead by example. You've got to ask my teammates. I'm here.
I'm available. I love to work. But we have a bunch of captains. We
have (Mark) McLemore, who's a great leader. We have Rickey
(Henderson), who's got great presence in the clubhouse and on the
field. Jay and Edgar _ everybody here is a leader,'' Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anyone who's going to run and hide in the training
room. They're going to stand and say, `I screwed up' or `I did a
great job' or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Another half of a season awaits Rodriguez and the Mariners. The
deal struck between Lincoln and Rodriguez in spring training that
no trade will take place seems as if it will stick.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners don't figure to be out of contention by the trading
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   And Rodriguez can assure everyone that the Mariners aren't out
of contention for him, either.

 2000-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In modern soccer, most major competitions involving
European teams reward defensive play. The USA '94 and France '98
World Cup finals are prime examples, as both Brazil and France
sacrificed spontaneity and style and were rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   The European Nations Cup _ Euro 2000 _ mostly defied the
safety-first maxim and indicated that soccer could be redirected
toward creative, wide-open play in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for this should go to France, which defeated
Italy, 2-1, in overtime in the title game Sunday in Rotterdam. Les
Bleus have evolved nicely from a team specializing in destructive
play in 1998 to one that can defend and also attack with flair.
</P>
<P>
   The French were seconds away from losing this game, and were
resuscitated only because of tactical adjustments by coach Roger
Lemerre. But the fact that Lemerre had such variety and vivacity in
reserve illustrates the proficiency of this French team.
</P>
<P>
   France always has had artistic, skillful players, but always
seemed to be fatally flawed. Their mentality has changed, though.
French players have gained experience in England and Italy, which
has exposed them to varying styles of play and also more
competitive situations than their national league. France is also
noted for its well-organized youth development programs, among the
best in Europe, along with Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris daily Liberation also notes the alchemy resulting from
a mixture of ethnicities, which enables France to match ``la
rudesse'' of the Anglo-Saxon countries and also the technique of
the Latin countries, adept at ``la feinte et du geste.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only starters born outside of Gaul were Marcel
Desailly (Ghana), Lilian Thuram (Guadeloupe), and Patrick Vieira
(Senegal). Others can certainly be considered residual products of
French colonialism, including Zinedine Zidane, but this is an
accurate reflection of modern French demographics.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, someone like Zidane, the son of an Algerian
who was in the French army during the fight for independence, might
have been ostracized or certainly would have had to contend with
serious identity issues. Zidane thrives, though, in the modern,
globalized Europe, as do many first-generation offspring of
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane also provides the game with a star of major proportions.
Unlike the Brazilian Ronaldo, who was ill-advisedly placed on a
pedestal in a contrived way, Zidane has earned his status. Zidane,
28, now has won a World Cup and a European championship, plus two
Serie A scudetti with Juventus. Zidane legitimately can be marketed
as the face of European soccer, because he has earned it.
</P>
<P>
   Against Italy, Zidane displayed his vast assortment of dribbles
and touches. The Italians mostly neutralized Zidane but completely
neutralized every other opponent in this tournament. And, as
pyrotechnical as Zidane was, France simply would not have won
without the athleticism of David Trezeguet.
</P>
<P>
   Lemerre probably waited too long to send in Robert Pires and
Trezeguet, and was fortunate Swedish referee Anders Frisk added
four minutes of injury time. Trezeguet outjumped the Italian
defense to flick on a header to Sylvain Wiltord for the tying goal
in the final minute of regulation time. And Pires finally got
warmed up and found space in the right side of Italy's defense to
cross to Trezeguet for the winner in the 102d minute.
</P>
<P>
   Lemerre must have noticed the ineffectiveness of Christophe
Dugarry in the first half, but apparently wanted to let Dugarry and
Zidane remain paired as they had been at Bordeaux from 1992-96.
Wiltord gave France speed as they desperately tried to rally, but
what the team needed was the unpredictability of Pires, who finally
entered in the 85th minute.
</P>
<P>
   At least, Lemerre was creative in his maneuverings. His
predecessor, Aime Jacquet, built an indestructible house of Les
Bleus with ``seven players whose vocation is defensive,'' according
to Liberation. Lemerre entered like an interior decorator and
brightened up the place with bright, new wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   There were many wide-open games and dramatic conclusions in Euro
2000, an event Pele considers equal to the World Cup, minus
Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The Holland-Italy semifinal was an exception, but also a game
unique in the history of soccer. Giampiero Boniperti, who played
for Italy in the 1940s and '50s and was a Juventus director until
recently, said he never had seen a comparable game. But
Holland-Italy was a fascinating joust in which every Dutch thrust
was parried by the Italians, who played with 10 men for 87 minutes.
That game called for defensive tactics by Italy, but coach Dino
Zoff went more offensive in the final, though the absence of
Filippo Inzaghi probably cost the Italians their best chance to
protect the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But after surrendering only two goals in the first 21 days of
the tournament, Italy gave up two goals in 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And now France essentially can go on a victory tour. Les Bleus
will not have to participate in qualifying for the Japan/Korea 2002
World Cup or Euro 2004 in Portugal.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``William Wegman:Fashion Photographers''
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   Wegman's dogs, those long-suffering Weimaraners, are everywhere
these days. We would not be shocked to see them dancing to Gershwin
in the next Gap commercial. Why aren't we tired of them? There's
something fascinating about Wegman's anthropomorphic photographs,
and something so woefully game about the animals that they don't
inspire backlash even as they teeter on the brink of saturation.
Here the dogs are fashion models, posing in shoes by Yves Saint
Laurent (a bad fit), a fur coat by Isaac Mizrahi, tuxedos by
Valentino, shirts by Armani. We wonder: Do they really sit
willingly like that in wigs and sunglasses? Or does Wegman
tyrannize them somehow, forcing them to pose? Either way, they are
oddly beautiful as they solicit our interest and affection. ``My
Weimaraners are perfect fashion models,'' Wegman says. ``Their
elegant slinky forms are covered in gray, and gray, everyone knows,
goes with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run: Hatching the Movie''
</P>
<P>
   By Brian Sibley
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $35)
</P>
<P>
   We are sick of these chickens already, no matter how good the
movie is. We have a close association with an 8-year-old, however,
and we observed that this book distracted him from the Pokimon
scourge for an entire afternoon. The result: We have built a shrine
to Brian Sibley in our house and are lighting candles daily in his
name. Actually, we enjoyed the book ourselves, because it's about
the extraordinary and exhaustive animation that went into creating
a feature-length film starring a bunch of clay birds. (Sibley also
addresses such questions as, ``How many fluffles are on Bunty's
bottom?'' The answer: 3,077, and aren't they grand?) There are lots
of behind-the-scenes photographs and stories about the making of
the movie, as well as sketches, storyboards, a foreword by Mel
Gibson and a cameo appearance by Wallace and Gromit. And, oh yes,
there are chickens everywhere, and they translate very well to the
page.

   ``The Better Angel''
</P>
<P>
   By Roy Morris Jr.

   On Dec. 16, 1862, Walt Whitman saw the name of his brother,
George, in a newspaper list of men recently wounded in the Civil
War. George had been encamped at Fredericksburg, Va. Within an hour
Whitman had packed up and left New York, determined to find his
brother, dead or alive. It was, says Morris, the beginning of the
rest of Walt Whitman's life, for although he would find George with
only minor wounds, there were plenty of soldiers whose luck had not
held up so well. Whitman became obsessed with them. Over the
ensuing months, he devoted himself to the aftermath of battles,
visiting tens of thousands of maimed and broken men who filled
military hospitals and convalescent camps. He brought them gifts,
friendship and his own exuberance. This is the flattering story of
Whitman's effect on those soldiers and theirs on him and his work.
``If he was not literally an angel,'' writes Morris, ``he was more
than a passable substitute.''

the extraordinary and exhaustive animation that went into creating
a feature-length film starring a bunch of clay birds. (Sibley also
addresses such questions as, ``How many fluffles are on Bunty's
bottom?'' The answer: 3,077, and aren't they grand?) There are lots
of behind-the-scenes photographs and stories about the making of

A'S START EARLY, BLAST ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Tim Belcher made an early exit for the second
consecutive start. But but this time it wasn't the umpire who ran
him, it was the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics battered Belcher for seven first-inning runs,
knocking him out after a third of an inning on their way to a 10-3
victory Sunday night over the Angels in front of 21,150 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The stint was the shortest of Belcher's 14-year major-league
career and came five days after he was kicked out in the second
inning at Seattle by home plate umpire Lou DiMuro for protesting a
balk call.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no arguing this result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw batting practice,'' Belcher said after the loss, which
dropped the Angels six games behind first-place Seattle _ a team
coming to town for four games beginning tonight _ and 4 behind
Oakland in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stay a third of an inning and say that's not easy to take
or painful is not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said his past two outings were frustrating, particularly
because the one thing he figured the Angels could count on him for
is innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   When the Angels signed Belcher just before Christmas 1998, he
was coming off three consecutive 200-inning seasons for Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was a mental breakdown, the other one was a physical
breakdown,'' said the 38-year-old right-hander of his past two
starts. ``I've taken a lot of pride in that if I do nothing else, I
pitch a lot of innings and save the bullpen. I certainly haven't
done that the last two starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Christenson, a light-hitting outfielder from Pepperdine,
showed what kind of night it would be for Belcher when he hit the
second pitch of the game more over the left-center field wall. It
was Christenson's second homer this season in 65 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde then slapped a single to right, Jason Giambi
walked on four pitches and Ben Grieve followed with a single to
bring home Velarde. A single by Olmedo Saenz scored Giambi and a
walk to Matt Stairs on a 3-2 pitch loaded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada hit an RBI groundout, but after Eric Chavez was
walked intentionally to load the bases, Ramon Hernandez singled to
score Saenz, making it 5-0, and chasing Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia was given a rousing ovation as he
popped out of the dugout to remove Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Timmy didn't have it,'' Scioscia said. ``He didn't
have a lot of arm speed, he couldn't locate the ball and didn't
have a lot of snap on his breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   All the water coolers, light bulbs and anything else in his way
in the Angels clubhouse were safe, something that might not have
been the case earlier in Belcher's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the energy for that anymore,'' Belcher said. ``I
put a lot of energy in to planning the four days I'm preparing to
pitch. If things go well, I'm exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels exhausted any chance of winning when Mike Fyhrie, who
replaced Belcher, allowed RBI singles to Christenson and Velarde to
make it 7-0 before the Angels came to bat.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, the Athletics _ who are second in the league
in runs scored _ were back on track after being shut out by Brian
Cooper and no-hit for six innings by Jarrod Washburn the past two
nights.
</P>
<P>
   The big inning proved to be plenty for Tim Hudson, the
24-year-old right-hander who improved to 10-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, who has not lost since April 20, allowed six hits, two
walks, two runs and struck out six in seven innings to win for the
21st time in 25 career decisions.
</P>
<P>
   When Hudson got in trouble in the first and third, he went to
his splitter, which acts like a straight change, to get out of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   With runners at the corners in the third, Hudson struck out Mo
Vaughn, allowed a single off a fastball to Tim Salmon, and struck
out Garret Anderson and Troy Glaus to keep the Angels at bay. All
three strikeouts were on the split-fingered pitch, about 10 miles
behind his low-90 mph fastball. &QL;

ONE FORKBALL SPELLS DOOM FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A tie game in the bottom of the ninth, Dodgers
right-hander Mike Fetters on the mound and two left-handers and a
switch-hitter due up for San Francisco. It was a formula for extra
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fetters threw a forkball a hair to high, and Marvin Benard
did something no other left-hander even came close to doing. Benard
dashed a three-run Dodgers comeback with a leadoff homer in the
ninth to give the Giants a 6-5 win Sunday at Pac Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Benard's unlikely homer, his sixth of the season, was the third
hit by a lefty against Fetters this season. He had retired 28 of
the 30 left-handers he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to do it again, I'd throw him the same pitch,''
Fetters said. ``I threw him a pretty decent forkball, it was down.
I guess he was geared for it and sat on it and got the pitch. I
felt like I was throwing the ball pretty good, threw some pretty
good pitches. That happens. I'm not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Giants' second straight win against the Dodgers after
losing the first four games this season. It was the Dodgers' eighth
loss in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one guy you don't expect to give up a hit to a left-hander
is (Fetters), much less a home run,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``I felt we were in pretty good shape there if we could hold
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Benard's homer made for an ugly finish for Fetters, but everyone
else was placing blame on wasted opportunity after wasted
opportunity long before the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers on the day left 13 runners on base, went 2 for 13
with runners in scoring position and left 10 runners on base in the
five innings starter Shawn Estes pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as dramatic of a win as we've had in a long time,''
Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``They threatened all day. Shawn
was in trouble every inning. I keep track of how many times a
starter gets in trouble. I can't remember marking down a pitcher in
trouble every inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent hit a pair of solo homers, Nos.22 and 23, for the
Giants as they built leads of 4-1 and 5-3. And though the Dodgers
rallied to tie it 5-5 in the eighth, the frittered-away chances in
the early innings were the underlying factor in the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Estes walked the bases loaded with one out in the third, but
Todd Hundley struck out and Kevin Elster flied out to right. With
two on and one out in the fourth, the only run the Dodgers mustered
came on Mark Grudzielanek's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Dodgers rallied for two runs in the seventh and
two more in the eighth, it was more what the Giants failed in doing
than what the Dodgers did.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Adrian Beltre scored from second on Felix
Rodriguez's wild pitch and an even wilder throw to third by catcher
Bobby Estalella. Pinch hitter Dave Hansen followed with a single to
score Todd Hundley and make it 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Kent's second homer off reliever Antonio Osuna gave the Giants a
5-3 lead. The Dodgers tied it in the eighth when Gary Sheffield (3
for 4) singled to right to score F.P. Santangelo and a Grudzielanek
scored on Nen's wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of days we missed a couple key hits,'' Beltre
said. ``There's only a couple of guys who are swinging the bat
good, Sheffield and Grudzielanek. We need to step back and be
successful with runners in scoring position.'' &QL;

CHALLENGER IN MEXICO WINS GOVERNING PARTY CONCEDES
</HEADLINE>
 (REWRITES with Fox winning) 
By JULIA PRESTON  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  MEXICO CITY _ Vicente Fox, the rough-spoken rancher and
businessman who galvanized a maverick grass-roots presidential
campaign, won a momentous victory in Mexico's presidential election
Sunday, ousting the political party that has ruled for 71 years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The next president of Mexico will be Vicente Fox Quesada,''
said President Ernesto Zedillo shortly after 11 p.m., conceding
that his Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, had
lost the presidency for the first time since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   In an outpouring of giddy joy, Fox's supporters swarmed into the
streets of Mexico City Sunday night, honking horns and celebrating
the demise of the only rulers most people here had ever known.
</P>
<P>
   In one night of triumph, Fox converted Mexico from a waning
one-party state into a self-confident democracy whose voters are
capable of ousting a government, no matter how dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Fox stood Sunday night on the balcony of his party headquarters,
before a crowd savoring his triumph over Francisco Labastida of PRI
and chanting, ``Vicente Presidente!'' He shot back: ``I like it
when you call me that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the moment of democracy, the moment of change that our
country has so desired,'' said Fox of the National Action Party, or
PAN. He praised the federal elections authorities for conducting
national balloting that finished ``without an important or notable
stain.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, the first PRI candidate who had ever even had to
undergo an internal party primary, was swift to concede defeat, and
to underline that the country should now unite after a ferocious
campaign and the most open vote in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens have taken a decision, that we all should
respect,'' said the 57-year-old former interior minister. ``And I
will be the first to set the example.'' Zedillo said he had called
Fox to congratulate him after the first official returns confirmed
what television surveys of voters had indicated all night: that the
PRI had lost the presidency despite mobilizing its well-oiled
machine to try and extend into the new century the dominance it
exerted for most of the last.
</P>
<P>
   At Labastida's headquarters, several young supporters started to
cry when the television reported the results of the first polls.
The huge plaza at the center of the PRI compound, many times the
scene of tumultuous rallies, was empty. A few PRI supporters walked
dejectedly across its vast empty expanse, furling their PRI banners
into tight rolls as they walked out to the street.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday evening, Fox immediately offered
reconciliation to Labastida. ``It was a very combative process, but
I open my arms to him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also reached out with unusual warmth to the United States,
which had been the chief adversary of many PRI presidents. ``We are
not only neighbors and partners, but we have a common destiny,''
said Fox, who was once the chief executive officer of Coca-Cola in
Mexico. ``I know we are going to do many great things together. I
want to work intensely with the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's big lead in the voter surveys took all of Mexico by
surprise. The final polls before the election had showed him in a
neck-and-neck race with Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a very important step in our struggle to become a
democratic country,'' said Francisco Barrio, a leading PAN
politician who is a former governor of the northern border state of
Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   With a note of astonishment he said: ``Now our party has become
the strongest and most important one in Mexico. We got more votes
than the PRI did today.''
</P>
<P>
   The streets around the Angel of Independence, the winged statue
on a tall pedestal in downtown Mexico City that is this country's
most distinctive monument, became a rollicking fiesta of thousands
of cheering, weeping, dancing Fox supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, eager voters lined up at polling stations _
often waiting for hours in punishing heat _ for their chance to
take part in an election that offered a choice between the
country's familiar but tainted ruling party and a chance for
something different.
</P>
<P>
   The elections Sunday were the most open ever held here, and the
balloting was generally orderly, though marred in several states by
reported pressure on voters from the governing party, which has a
history of fraud, and disorganization that blocked many thousands
of people from casting ballots.
</P>
<P>
   After a blistering campaign that filled the television and other
media as never before, many voters said they made their decision
only in recent days, suggesting that the undecided, who were as
much as 19 percent of the total in the most recent polls, would
determine the day.
</P>
<P>
   In many neighborhoods that long were PRI strongholds, and among
working class Mexicans who were its most loyal followers, one theme
was recurrent: Mexico had to do something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a change, and I have been asking myself, when
is it going to happen?'' said Gustavo Sanchez, a 32-year-old auto
mechanic in Ecatepec, a huge proletarian suburb of Mexico City
where the PRI was once invincible. ``Our leaders need to know that
if they don't do the job right, we're going to get rid of them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon, Jose Woldenberg, the president of the Federal
Elections Institute, which is running the election, reported that
only 13 of 113,423 polling places nationwide had failed to open
because of organizational problems, a record.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the presidential race, Mexicans also voted for the
Senate, with 128 seats, and all 500 seats in the Congress, and to
elect two state governors and the mayor of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 p.m., Felipe Bravo Mena, the president of PAN, declared
that the party had won the governor's race in the central state of
Morelos, beating the PRI by 54 percent to 28 percent. Before the
election, the polls showed that that race was close. Fox's
candidate also swept the governor's race in his home state of
Guanajuato by 59 percent to the PRI's 31 percent, Bravo Mena said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Mexico City, Fox's PAN fared well, with the party
candidate coming within three percentage points of the victor in
the race for mayor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, from the leftist
Party of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the candidate of the leftist Party of the
Democratic Revolution in the presidential contest, had refused to
unite with Fox, and late Sunday evening conceded defeat by his
conservative opposition rival.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who turned 58 Sunday, shatters many traditional paradigms.
Every Mexican president in this century has been either a general,
a lawyer or an economist, and each one has been the favorite son of
an elite with a strong anti-clerical and anti-business bias.
</P>
<P>
   Fox breaks this mold. He is a businessman, a devout Catholic and
politically he has largely been on the outside looking in.
</P>
<P>
   In the economic turmoil here in the 1980s, opposition forces
achieved their first major victories in mayoral elections across
northern Mexico. In 1988, dozens of beleaguered northern
entrepreneurs ran for Congress representing the National Action
Party, including Fox.
</P>
<P>
   He won, served one term in Congress, and ran for governor of
Guanajuato in 1991, losing a disputed election marred by fraud.
When he ran for governor again in 1995, he won a sweeping victory.
Three years into his governorship, he launched his quest for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zedillo, voting early Sunday in a public school near
his official residence, noted ``great calm throughout the
country,'' that was not true everywhere. In the main square of the
city of Puebla, in central Mexico, thousands of people lined up for
long hours at a special polling place set up for Mexicans who were
not in their home towns on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Before the polls opened, hundreds of army soldiers and
policemen, mostly in civilian clothes, crowded to the front of the
line at the one special station for out-of-town voters in Puebla's
crowded plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Since the special station had only 750 ballots to be given out,
many voters realized, after waiting for hours in line, that they
were not going to be able to vote. As the line stretched for six
blocks out of the plaza, angry and frustrated people began to
suspect that the PRI was pulling one of the election tricks for
which it was notorious in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraud! Fraud!'' the voters chanted as tensions mounted, ebbed
and mounted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the PRI again,'' said Maria Guadalupe Corona Moreno, a
28-year-old manager of a textile factory from the state of
Guanajuato who was in Puebla on business. ``I've been waiting to
cast my vote for years,'' she said, waving her voter card, ``and
now it turns out this is just a piece of trash.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI voters in Puebla were also furious about being left out.
``Where is the democracy?'' asked Maria Teresa Inclan Perez, who
said she supported the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   The special polling stations were set up for Mexicans who would
not appear on local rolls because they went to vote in places
different from where they registered. In regular polling places,
Mexicans were given ballots after matching their voter card with a
photograph against a list that included both their name and
picture. But because of restrictions in the campaign laws, only 715
special polling places were set up nationwide, with only 750
ballots each.
</P>
<P>
   The voting Sunday was monitored by no fewer than 38,433 Mexican
observers and 860 foreigners. Everywhere they went, observers found
voters thrilled about being part of what felt like a bona fide
democratic exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was saying that this time their vote really
matters,'' said Pamela S. Falk, a law professor from the City
University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   PRI leaders had promised that the party's huge machine would be
in full gear Sunday, with 2.5 million party followers working to
deliver its voters to the polls. But the power of the PRI system,
which for three decades depressed workers' salaries, was not much
in evidence nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like the people have come out because they want
a change,'' said Ana Maria Mosqueda, 38, a secretary who served was
an elections observer on behalf of a national teachers' union that
has been a bastion of the PRI. She made it clear that her PRI
sympathies had waned. ``We want to be treated better, and we can
make it happen today, one grain of sand at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   In many places the election split families in two, with the
older generation sticking with the PRI and the younger people going
for the opposition. Husbands and wives differed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Caballero Rivas, an office worker who is 39, said he
chose Labastida because ``we need someone who will help us.'' But
as they emerged from a polling station in Ecatepec, his wife,
Gabriela Alcazar, piped up to contradict him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to change,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Chiapas, followers of the Zapatista rebels
burned the voting stations in two tiny rural communities, and
rebels wearing ski masks set up roadblocks to stop PRI followers
from voting in the town of Altamirano. The actions came even though
the Zapatista leader who calls himself Subcomandante Marcos, had
said the Zapatistas would not obstruct the election.

<P>
   &UR; BLIND EYE: The Terrifying Story of a Doctor Who Got Away With
Murder &LR;  By James B. Stewart. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14. A
journalist tells the story of a doctor suspected of killing at
least 35 hospital patients, and indicts the medical authorities who
failed to protect the public. Last year in The New York Times Book
Review, Lance Morrow called this a ``chillingly thorough and
superbly matter-of-fact ... reconstruction that has the fascination
of an acutely observed and troubling novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELEMENTALS: Stories of Fire and Ice &LR;  By A.S. Byatt. Vintage
International, $12. A British writer whose work explores the
intersection of aesthetics and morality spins tales in which
stolid, blinkered Europeans from the North become either imprisoned
or re-energized by the earthier South and the warmer-blooded people
(mostly artists) who live there. In Byatt's eyes, it is an
unforgivable crime not to be curious about a world ``full of light
and life.'' ``Byatt's prose is capacious yet exquisite,'' Fernanda
Eberstadt wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999, and this
collection is infused with ``the throwaway gleams of a writer at
the height of her powers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DISTANCE TO THE MOON: A Road Trip Into the American Dream &LR; 
By James Morgan. Riverhead, $12.95. The author explores America's
obsessive love affair with cars and car culture as he drives from
Miami to Portland, Ore., in a shiny new Porsche. ``The human case
for the automobile has never been more persuasively presented,''
Bruce McCall wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I'M A STRANGER HERE MYSELF: Notes on Returning to America After
Twenty Years Away &LR; , by Bill Bryson (Broadway, $14), is a collection
of humorous dispatches written for a British newspaper about the
author's bumpy re-entry into his native culture with his English
wife and four children. ``The best columns are those in which the
author discards his hapless persona and allows his natural
impatience and intelligence out of their cages,'' Elizabeth Gleick
wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRUE AT FIRST LIGHT &LR;  By Ernest Hemingway. Edited by Patrick
Hemingway. Scribner, $13. This fictional chronicle of an African
safari, which was abandoned by Hemingway and edited by one of his
sons, is a pale imitation of the writer's best work, James Wood
wrote last year. Nonetheless, ``there is a kind of mottled glamour,
made up of bullying integrity and nonsense, of truth and falsity,
which always makes the least of Hemingway's books compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1185 PARK AVENUE: A Memoir &LR;  By Anne Roiphe. Touchstone/Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $13. Avoiding sentimentality and self-pity in favor of an
emotionally mature distance, the author tells of growing up Jewish
in the 1940s and '50s with everything she could want except her
parents' affection. ``Roiphe gives her memoir the dramatic
vividness of a novel,'' Karen Lehrman wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; APPLES FROM THE DESERT: Selected Stories &LR;  By Savyon Liebrecht.
Feminist Press, $13.95. This collection of 12 stories originally
published in Israel focuses on the fault lines between secular and
Orthodox Jews, bereft parents and their torn children. ``At her
best, Liebrecht is the equal of far better-known Israeli authors
like Amos Oz,'' Suzanne Ruta wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MOTHER OF PEARL &LR;  By Melinda Haynes. Washington Square/Pocket
Books, $13.95. This first novel revolves around a large cast of
characters in sleepy Petal, Miss., in the 1950s, including Even
Grade, a black orphan named for a road, and Valuable Korner, a
fatherless white girl named after a real estate sign. Last year the
reviewer Roy Hoffman admired the book's ``profuse and vigorous''
language.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEORGE III: A Personal History &LR;  By Christopher Hibbert. Basic
Books, $18. As portrayed here, George III (1738-1820) was a
churchgoing, monogamous, mostly competent ruler before going
famously mad. His oldest son, however, George IV (1762-1830), the
subject of  &UR; PRINCE OF PLEASURE: The Prince of Wales and the Making
of the Regency &LR; , by Saul David (Grove, $15), led the field in
scandalous behavior at a time when London was the world's capital
for debauchery. ```George III' and `Prince of Pleasure' make a
simply unputdownable theater of the personal and political
absurd,'' Valentine Cunningham wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HOUDINI GIRL &LR;  By Martyn Bedford. Vintage Crime, $13. After
his Irish girlfriend dies in a mysterious train accident, a British
magician discovers that she led a double life and sets out to
unravel her carefully hidden past. Last year the reviewer Carey
Harrison called this ``a masterfully choreographed'' erotic
thriller.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POACHERS: Stories &LR;  By Tom Franklin. HarperPerennial, $12. Set
in lower Alabama, these mordant tales feature sympathetic good old
boys stuck in bad situations, frayed marriages and dead-end jobs.
``With this satisfying collection'' Franklin ``establishes himself
as one of the region's more interesting emerging voices,'' Bruce
Barcott wrote last year.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending June 24, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

<P>
   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 2, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-TERM-REVIEW (Washington) _ It was a Supreme Court term of
surpassing interest, rich in symbol and substance, a vivid reminder
of the court's power to scramble settled expectations, put old
questions to rest and, ultimately, to have the last word. By Linda
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-AIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ How much would it cost to contain
the global AIDS epidemic? The answer is: How much would it cost to
banish ignorance, to deaden lust, to shame rape, to stop war, to
enrich the poor, to empower women, to defend children, to make
decent medical care as globally ubiquitous as Coca-Cola _ in short,
to get rid of all the underlying causes of the epidemic in the
Third World? By Donald G. McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL-LYING-REVIEW (Undated) _ What is it about legal
proceedings and particularly those pre-trial sworn interviews known
as depositions that turn sophisticated people into quibblers,
dissemblers or amnesiacs? Why can't they just respond to the
questions posed as people respond in everyday conversations? By
Adam Liptak.
</P>
<P>
   SKIMPY-CLOTHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Blame ``Sex and the City'' or
blame the decline of the ozone layer, but skin is in. American
women are wearing less than ever before. Summer itself is hotter.
And over the past decade, the proliferation of the Wonderbra
coincided with global warming so that just as cleavages became more
pronounced, shorts became shorter. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   GENOME-PROGRAM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Just as surely as any
shrink-wrapped Microsoft disk, the human genome is a program, a set
of precisely coded instructions that evolution has written for the
design, operation and unfortunately rather limited maintenance of a
person. That people should be operated by such a specific script is
as amazing as it would be to find that robots have souls. By
Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY-CELEBS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some statements from
celebrity women who have explained why they chose to appear nude in
Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-BLUES-REVIEW (London) _ Britain is endlessly wondering
``How'm I doing?'' But unlike Ed Koch, the self-congratulating
former mayor of New York, Britain rarely expects a positive answer.
And lately, a nation that is always sensitive about perceived
slights to its international status has found more than usual to be
upset about. And now along comes ``The Patriot,'' a film about the
American Revolution that presents the English as effete war
criminals with snobby accents who herd families of fledgling
Americans into barns and set them on fire, just for fun. To Britons
sick of being pushed around, this obnoxious affront to
retrospective pride may be the last straw. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ All of Mexico's
presidential candidates call themselves democrats, but the voters
will really be choosing between two sharply different ways of
political life. The longtime ruling party, known as the PRI, offers
its tradition of top-down control and doing what it takes to stay
in power. The opposition comes from a contrasting wellspring of
grass-roots struggles for citizens' rights and the fight for the
balance of powers. The opposition is democratic, in the way that
most Americans understand the term. The PRI is not. Yet Mexicans
are clearly torn about this choice. By Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ANTIMISSILE-REVIEW (Beijing) _ It's hard to find any
foreign-policy expert here, in or out of government, who believes
the stated U.S. rationale for a continental anti-missile defense:
That it's merely intended to stop the likes of North Korea or Iraq.
Even Westward-leaning scholars here think the new push for missile
defense in Washington reflects an underlying conviction that the
United States must better prepare for battle with China. By Erik
Eckholm.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 2, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-TERM-REVIEW (Washington) _ It was a Supreme Court term of
surpassing interest, rich in symbol and substance, a vivid reminder
of the court's power to scramble settled expectations, put old
questions to rest and, ultimately, to have the last word. By Linda
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-AIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ How much would it cost to contain
the global AIDS epidemic? The answer is: How much would it cost to
banish ignorance, to deaden lust, to shame rape, to stop war, to
enrich the poor, to empower women, to defend children, to make
decent medical care as globally ubiquitous as Coca-Cola _ in short,
to get rid of all the underlying causes of the epidemic in the
Third World? By Donald G. McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL-LYING-REVIEW (Undated) _ What is it about legal
proceedings and particularly those pre-trial sworn interviews known
as depositions that turn sophisticated people into quibblers,
dissemblers or amnesiacs? Why can't they just respond to the
questions posed as people respond in everyday conversations? By
Adam Liptak.
</P>
<P>
   SKIMPY-CLOTHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Blame ``Sex and the City'' or
blame the decline of the ozone layer, but skin is in. American
women are wearing less than ever before. Summer itself is hotter.
And over the past decade, the proliferation of the Wonderbra
coincided with global warming so that just as cleavages became more
pronounced, shorts became shorter. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   GENOME-PROGRAM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Just as surely as any
shrink-wrapped Microsoft disk, the human genome is a program, a set
of precisely coded instructions that evolution has written for the
design, operation and unfortunately rather limited maintenance of a
person. That people should be operated by such a specific script is
as amazing as it would be to find that robots have souls. By
Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY-CELEBS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some statements from
celebrity women who have explained why they chose to appear nude in
Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-BLUES-REVIEW (London) _ Britain is endlessly wondering
``How'm I doing?'' But unlike Ed Koch, the self-congratulating
former mayor of New York, Britain rarely expects a positive answer.
And lately, a nation that is always sensitive about perceived
slights to its international status has found more than usual to be
upset about. And now along comes ``The Patriot,'' a film about the
American Revolution that presents the English as effete war
criminals with snobby accents who herd families of fledgling
Americans into barns and set them on fire, just for fun. To Britons
sick of being pushed around, this obnoxious affront to
retrospective pride may be the last straw. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ All of Mexico's
presidential candidates call themselves democrats, but the voters
will really be choosing between two sharply different ways of
political life. The longtime ruling party, known as the PRI, offers
its tradition of top-down control and doing what it takes to stay
in power. The opposition comes from a contrasting wellspring of
grass-roots struggles for citizens' rights and the fight for the
balance of powers. The opposition is democratic, in the way that
most Americans understand the term. The PRI is not. Yet Mexicans
are clearly torn about this choice. By Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ANTIMISSILE-REVIEW (Beijing) _ It's hard to find any
foreign-policy expert here, in or out of government, who believes
the stated U.S. rationale for a continental anti-missile defense:
That it's merely intended to stop the likes of North Korea or Iraq.
Even Westward-leaning scholars here think the new push for missile
defense in Washington reflects an underlying conviction that the
United States must better prepare for battle with China. By Erik
Eckholm.

   A Shiver Creeps Over Los Angeles &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hal Bernson, a Los Angeles city councilman, did not mince words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this city may regret the day that it ever voted
to bring this convention here,'' he declared, summing up the city's
growing anxiety about the possibility of demonstrations at the
Democratic National Convention there next month.
</P>
<P>
   Bernson was responding to a warning by the Los Angeles police of
the potential for ``a level of activity'' at least as intense as
the violent protest that disrupted a meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle last December. Responding to those
concerns, the council approved a plan to cordon off protesters in a
fenced-in parking lot, and the Secret Service revised plans for
lodging Vice President Al Gore in a nearby hotel. The American
Civil Liberties Union has filed suit against the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The jittery mood was a counterpoint to the placidity of the
campaign elsewhere. As has become almost pro forma in the campaign,
another multibillion-dollar spending plan was put forth by a
presumptive nominee: Gore unveiled an energy plan that he said
would authorize $148 billion over 10 years to improve mass
transportation and decrease dependence on oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been afraid to take on big oil,'' Gore said, an
obvious dig at his rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a former
oilman. Bush, however, said Gore was fooling no one, as a member of
an administration that has seen a 50-cent rise in the cost of
gasoline in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   A new dynamic in the debate was fostered by the rise of Ralph
Nader, who after securing the Green Party's presidential nomination
did not wait long to ridicule Gore as ``a gee-whiz techno twit''
who had abandoned the disenfranchised in favor of large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   If Nader's words threatened to liven the race up a bit, so did
the ruling on Tuesday by the U.S. Supreme Court, striking down a
Nebraska law that banned a procedure known as a partial-birth
abortion. Gore used the decision to remind voters of Bush's
opposition to abortion rights. ``His views about choice are really
quite extreme,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   _ PETER MARKS
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, America. Hola, Cuba! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever emotional problems Elian Gonzalez may develop later in
life, he can never say he was unwanted as a child. For seven
bizarre months, almost everyone seemed to want him _ on both sides
of that odd political fault line off the tip of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the courts had the last word. The Supreme Court
chose not to hear the case, unable to find any grounds for an
appeal. On news of the court's refusal to get involved, Elian and
his entourage (how many 6-year-olds have entourages?) quickly
headed back to a cheering welcome in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That ended the drama, perhaps, but the ripples still roll onto
both shores. In Cuba, Fidel Castro got a definite jolt of
revolutionary caffeine from the epic Battle for Elian, and now he
wants to keep that energy humming in his unceasing campaign to end,
or at least ease, the U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   And, after 38 long years, such a prospect suddenly seemed a
shade more likely. The Cuban-Americans who take a hard line on
Havana _ a group whose political heft vastly outweighs its numbers
_ suddenly found itself on the defensive and reshuffled its
leadership to present a new, younger face to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just Elian, of course. After the 1997 death of Jorge
Mas Canosa, an anti-Castro dynamo who often seemed to dictate U.S.
policy on Cuba, the exile lobby lost steam _ witness the accord in
Congress on lifting the ban on sales of food and medicine to Cuba.
Many in Little Havana got a temporary boost from having Elian
around.
</P>
<P>
   _ HUBERT B. HERRING
</P>
<P>
   Looking Into the Books Of Political Fund-Raisers  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved a bipartisan bill that forces a growing group
of secretive tax-exempt groups that raise and spend money on
political activities to disclose their donors and expenditures.
When enacted, the bill will mark the first major change in the
nation's campaign finance law since 1979. Supporters like Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., said the measure was a small but important step
toward broader election-law overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   _ ERIC SCHMITT
</P>
<P>
   Softening Cuban Embargo  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of negotiations, House Republican leaders agreed to
language that would weaken the economic embargo against Cuba for
the first time in four decades. The bill, pushed by Rep. George W.
Nethercutt Jr., R-Wash., would permit the direct sale of food to
Cuba, similar to a policy allowing the sale of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation, designed to benefit agribusiness and to
shore up Nethercutt's re-election chances, is so loaded down with
restrictions that it is more a symbolic step toward normalizing
Cuban-U.S. relations than it is a boon to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   _ LIZETTE ALVAREZ
</P>
<P>
   Drug Benefits for the Elderly  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defying a veto threat from President Clinton, the House approved
a Republican plan to provide prescription drug benefits to the
elderly by offering subsidies to insurers to help defray the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were responding to the pleas of Medicare
beneficiaries but without creating a a ``big government'' program.
Democrats denounced the plan as a sham, saying insurers would not
offer drug coverage at an affordable price.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will probably address the issue as elections
approach. No one knows whether a new law will emerge this year, but
experts say Congress will surely add drug benefits to Medicare
within a few years.

   Voting Surprises in Zimbabwe
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe awoke to a new political dynamic after voters gave a
nascent opposition party just over a third of the seats in
Parliament. The two days of balloting were largely free of the
intimidation that has marked the political climate for months. The
ruling party, led by longtime President Robert Mugabe, still won
the most seats. His party once held all but 3 of the 150 seats.
With 57 going to the nine-month-old Movement for Democratic Change,
it was a stunning setback for Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   _ HENRI CAUVIN
</P>
<P>
   Hypothetical Surpluses  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, which not long ago faced budget deficits
as far as the eye could see, is now anticipating mind-boggling
surpluses. President Clinton revised his 10-year surplus projection
upward by $1.3 trillion, to $4.2 trillion. There is no assurance,
however, that the surpluses will materialize; much is earmarked for
debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   _ RICHARD W. STEVENSON
</P>
<P>
   Scraping By in Japan  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday's parliamentary elections delivered a stinging
setback to Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party. A
surprisingly weak showing resulted in the party barely retaining
control over the powerful lower house. Many already expect calls to
replace the prime minister, Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   Live Long and Prosper  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good times lifted 1.1 million more taxpayers into $100,000 plus
incomes in 1998, the IRS reported. A record 8.2 million returns, 1
in 15, were above that threshold. On the other end, one-third of
tax returns, 40.1 million, showed less than $15,000 of income, but
many of these taxpayers were children who sold stocks at a profit
in their college funds. Capital gains accounted for 9 percent of
all incomes, but 44 percent of the average $6,290 income in this
lowest income class.

</P>
<P>
   Spying as a Business Tool  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Microsoft Corp.'s most bitter rivals, the database
software maker Oracle Corp., said it had authorized spying on three
Microsoft-financed lobbying groups. Its effort was revealed last
month after private investigators were caught offering cash to
janitors for the trash of the Association for Competitive
Technology, a group that has been lobbying for Microsoft in its
federal antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   _ JOHN MARKOFF
</P>
<P>
   Over the Counter  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As every patient knows, the phrase ``over the counter'' means
medicine for headaches, colds and the like. But with two drug
makers seeking to make their cholesterol-fighting pills available
without a prescription, the Food and Drug Administration began
reexamining its over-the-counter drug policy. At issue is whether
patients can manage chronic conditions, like osteoporosis and high
blood pressure, without a doctor's supervision.
</P>
<P>
   _ SHERYL GAY STOLBERG
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers Misled  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nation's sixth-largest credit-card company, Providian
Financial Corp., agreed to reimburse the millions of customers it
had misled and improperly billed. Providian will pay at least $300
million to about 3 million consumers, according to the federal and
California officials who signed the agreement with the corporation.
Over the last five years, Providian convinced people, many of them
with poor credit histories, to sign up for cards with higher fees
and interest rates than were apparent.
</P>
<P>
   _ DAVID LEONHARDT
</P>
<P>
   The Toll on Beaches  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Believers in the biblical injunction against building houses on
sand found an ally in the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
which published an analysis of shoreline building with an alarming
conclusion: a quarter of the houses within 500 feet of the coasts
on the ocean and Great Lakes are in danger of falling to the waves
in the next 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   The report says Fema must alter the federal Flood Insurance
Program to reflect this risk _ principally by mapping erosion
hazard areas and raising insurance rates there. But advocates for
coastal dwellers called the report a thinly disguised attempt to
drive residents from the beach.
</P>

   _ CORNELIA DEAN
</P>
<P>
   Off-Shore Caches  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They look a little like elephants and mice, but the world's
wealthiest nations have put pressure on some of the smallest to
stop offering shelter to tax dodgers and money launderers. For the
first time the developed nations published a blacklist of 35 tax
havens and 15 potential laundering centers, many of them Atlantic
and Pacific island getaways, and told them to clean up their banks
or face sanctions.

THE COURT RULES, AMERICA CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a Supreme Court term of surpassing interest,
rich in symbol and substance, a vivid reminder of the court's power
to scramble settled expectations, put old questions to rest and,
ultimately, to have the last word.
</P>
<P>
   The justices stood by some precedents and repudiated others.
They invalidated four federal laws, continuing on the path of
subjecting the exercise of congressional authority to close and
skeptical scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   During the term that began last Oct. 4 and ended June 28, the
court decided only 73 cases, the fewest of any term since the early
1950s. Although small, the docket ranged over almost the entire
constitutional landscape. The First Amendment alone, with its
provisions governing association, religion and free speech,
injected the justices into state electoral systems, high school
football games and sexually explicit cable television programming.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some of the court's most important rulings were
statutory: the invalidation of the Food and Drug Administration's
regulation of tobacco and a decision keeping many medical
malpractice cases against health maintenance organizations out of
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO decision was unanimous, as were more than a third of the
court's rulings. But the court was more sharply divided than usual,
with the middle ground often seeming to disappear. Twenty cases
were decided by 5-4 votes, a higher proportion than in most recent
years. A solid conservative bloc consisting of Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas hung together and
prevailed in 13 of the 20.
</P>
<P>
   The four more-liberal justices _ John Paul Stevens, David H.
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer _ voted as a
group in the majority in only one 5-4 case, the decision striking
down Nebraska's abortion law, where they were joined by O'Connor.
The six remaining close cases were scrambled: for example, in the
case striking down a federal regulation on sexually explicit
programming on cable television, Thomas, who often displays a
libertarian bent on free speech issues, and Kennedy, who almost
always adopts the free-speech position, were in the majority to
strike down the regulation, while Breyer, often sympathetic to
government interests in speech cases, voted in dissent.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the court this term were O'Connor, who cast
only five dissenting votes; Rehnquist, who cast eight; and Kennedy,
who dissented nine times. Chief Justice Rehnquist's position at the
center of the court is itself a measure of how conservative the
court has become; Associate Justice Rehnquist had been the court's
most frequent lone dissenter before President Ronald Reagan chose
him ago to succeed Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for example, on criminal law, Rehnquist's vote is a fair
indicator of the court's center of gravity. To his right, Scalia,
who dissented 15 times this term, and Thomas, who dissented 12
times, were the two dissenters from the chief justice's decision
that reaffirmed the Miranda ruling. To the chief justice's left,
Stevens dissented 28 times and Ginsburg 23, on cases ranging from
equal protection to congressional authority to prisoners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the labels conservative and liberal do not fully capture
this court. ``Which cases were most visible to the public this
year?'' John G. Roberts Jr., a Supreme Court practitioner and and
former deputy solicitor general during the Bush administration,
asked rhetorically the other day. ``Probably school prayer,
abortion, and Miranda, and the conservatives lost all three,''
Roberts said. ``The conventional wisdom needs to be taken
skeptically.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to this court's mysteries may lie in examining where the
justices commit their energy. Questions of individual rights, such
as race and due process, are not the front-burner issues at the
court that they were a few years ago, perhaps because the justices
have reached a kind of settlement: affirmative action has been
sharply limited, while at the same time the due process guarantee
is alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what animates the justices are questions of the court's
own institutional turf in particular and the allocation of
governmental power in general, both among the branches of the
federal government and between Washington and the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is reflecting in a bunch of different doctrines the
general sense that the federal government is too big, too powerful,
too incompetent,'' said Professor Christopher H. Schroeder of Duke
University Law School. Cases this year in which the court struck
down state incursions into the federal government's authority in
foreign affairs were not the contrary, he said, reflecting instead
``the classic 18th-century notion that where we need the federal
government, we need it internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines in the court's federalism debate have been clearly
drawn, with the open question being where the court plans to take
it next.
</P>
<P>
   One logical path, Schroeder said, would be in the libertarian
direction of giving individual citizens more ammunition against
government authority through strengthening the Fifth Amendment
doctrine against the uncompensated ``taking'' of private property,
for example. But Scalia has pushed the takings argument as far as
his current colleagues seem willing to follow, trying but not quite
succeeding in making much land-use regulation constitutionally
questionable as a ``regulatory taking'' for which landowners must
be compensated.
</P>
<P>
   So, like questions that this election-year term has raised about
the court's future, this is one that does not have a clear answer.
Even a casual look at the term's 5-4 decisions shows what could lie
ahead, depending on which president gets to fill which vacancies,
if any. The four liberal dissenters from the decisions curbing
federal authority would move quickly to overturn those precedents
if they gained another vote, while at the same time, Thomas and
three other conservative justices _ minus O'Connor _ who came up
one vote short of dramatically lowering the barrier to public aid
to parochial schools would not hesitate to move quickly in that
direction. To that degree, the term that ended last week is as much
prologue as last word.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-SCOTUS-TERM-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: last word. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Following are summaries of the term's most important decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that because the procedure that abortion
opponents call partial-birth abortion may be the most medically
appropriate way of terminating some pregnancies, it cannot
constitutionally be banned. The 5-4 decision, Stenberg vs. Carhart,
No. 99-830, invalidated a Nebraska law while rendering the laws of
30 other states unconstitutional as well. Breyer wrote the majority
opinion; the dissenters were Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas and,
surprisingly in light of his earlier support for abortion rights,
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-3 vote, the court ruled that a Colorado law creating a
``no-approach'' zone outside medical offices did not violate the
free speech rights of abortion protesters seeking to urge women not
to go through with their abortions. Stevens wrote the opinion in
Hill vs. Colorado, No. 98-1856. Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Federalism
</P>
<P>
   By the 5-4 vote that has become familiar from the court's
increasingly bitter debate over the proper allocation of federal
and state authority, the court struck down a central provision of
one federal law, the Violence Against Women Act, and invalidated
the application of the federal age discrimination law to the
states.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when the justices saw a case as presenting a
straightforward issue of the supremacy of federal law _ as opposed
to a federal incursion into a traditional area of state authority _
the court was most often unanimous in upholding the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's majority opinion in the Violence Against Women Act
case, United States vs. Morrison, No. 99-5, declared that ``the
Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national
and what is truly local.'' The decision invalidated the law's civil
damages provision, which permitted suits in federal court by
victims of crimes ``motivated by gender.'' The dissenters were
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   By the same 5-4 lineup, the court ruled in Kimel vs. Florida
Board of Regents, No. 98-791, that Congress lacked authority to
make the states, as employers, liable to suit under the federal Age
Discrimination in Employment Act. Writing for the majority,
O'Connor said the government's interest in eradicating age
discrimination on the job yielded to the states' sovereign
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In another case involving state immunity, the court avoided the
Constitution and looked only to Congress' intent in ruling that
Congress did not mean to make states liable to suit under the False
Claims Act for defrauding the federal government. Scalia wrote the
opinion in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources vs. Stevens, No.
98-1828, with Stevens and Souter dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the court rejected a states' rights
challenge to the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, a federal law that
bars states from selling personal information about licensed drives
and automobile owners. Rehnquist wrote the opinion in Reno vs.
Condon, No. 98-1464.
</P>
<P>
   The court was also unanimous in upholding the supremacy of
federal law in two cases with foreign policy implications. In one,
Crosby vs. National Foreign Trade Council, No. 99-474, an opinion
by Souter held that a federal law placing sanctions on Myanmar, the
former Burma, pre-empted a Massachusetts law that withheld state
business from companies that do business with that nation's
repressive military regime.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court invalidated Washington State's
safety and environmental regulations for tanker traffic along its
coast. Kennedy wrote the opinion in United States vs. Locke, No.
98-1701.
</P>
<P>
   Due Process &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a case about the right of parents to resist interference in
their children's lives from grandparents and others, the court
ruled 6-3 that a Washington state law went too far in permitting a
judge to order grandparents' visiting rights over a mother's
objection. The splintered opinions in Troxel vs. Granville, No.
99-138, invoked the Constitution's due process protection for
parental child-rearing decisions, but failed to agree on a
definitive approach. O'Connor wrote a plurality opinion that
Rehnquist, Breyer and Ginsburg joined. Souter and Thomas provided
additional votes on the parents' side. Kennedy, Stevens and Scalia
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Law &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court's 7-2 reaffirmation of Miranda vs. Arizona, in an
opinion by Rehnquist, was the leading criminal law case. The court
said in Dickerson vs. United States, No. 99-5525, that because
Miranda ``announced a constitutional rule,'' Congress was not free
to replace the famous Miranda warnings with a case-by-case test of
whether a confession was voluntary. The decision invalidated a 1968
law, known as Section 3501, by which Congress had purported to
overrule Miranda. Scalia and Thomas dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down New Jersey's hate crime law, ruling 5-4
that the Constitution requires the jury to make the central
finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, of whether a crime was
motivated by bias. The New Jersey law left this job to the judge.
The decision, Apprendi vs. New Jersey, No. 99-478, cast doubt on
federal and state laws in which judges make the crucial findings
that determine sentences. Stevens wrote the majority opinion; the
dissenters were O'Connor, Breyer and Kennedy, along with Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   The court's other criminal law cases were a mix of
search-and-seizure issues and cases interpreting a 1996 law
restricting state inmates' access to federal court. The outcome was
mixed as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-SCOTUS-TERM-REVIEW-3RDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: as well. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 5-4, that flight at the mere sight of a police
officer can often _ although not always _ be suspicious enough to
justify the police in conducting a stop-and-frisk search. Rehnquist
wrote for the majority in Illinois vs. Wardlow, No. 98-1036,
upholding the search of a man who bolted from the sight of police
cars converging on a Chicago street. Stevens dissented, joined by
Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal defendants prevailed in two other search cases.
Ginsburg wrote for a unanimous court that an anonymous tip that a
person is carrying a gun is not enough to justify a stop-and-frisk
search in the absence of some indication that the information is
reliable. The case was Florida vs. J.L., No. 98-1993. And the court
ruled 7-2 that, without some particular suspicion of wrongdoing,
law enforcement agents cannot walk down the aisle of a bus
squeezing passengers' overhead carry-on bags to see if any might
contain contraband. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, in Bond
vs. U.S., No. 98-9349, while Breyer and Scalia dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In interpreting the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act, a 1996 law in which Congress limited the rights of state
inmates to challenge their convictions in federal court by means of
petitions for writs of habeas corpus, the court made clear that
federal judges still have an important role to play despite the new
law's limitations. Applying the new law, the court overturned death
sentences in two cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, the court was unanimous in ruling that a Virginia
death row inmate, Michael Williams, should not have been penalized
by the state's failure to provide needed evidence. Kennedy wrote
for the court in Williams vs. Taylor, No. 99-6615.
</P>
<P>
   A second ruling under the 1996 law, also confusingly called
Williams vs. Taylor, No. 98-8384, was more convoluted, producing
two controlling opinions. First, the court interpreted a provision
barring federal courts from setting aside a state court decision
unless the state ruling was an ``unreasonable'' application of
federal law. The question was the meaning of ``unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because a decision was wrong did not make it necessarily
unreasonable, O'Connor wrote in a 5-4 portion of the ruling that
was joined by Rehnquist, Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas. In dissent,
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer said federal judges should not
have to defer to state court decisions they regarded as incorrect,
even if plausible.
</P>
<P>
   But by a 6-3 vote, in a portion of the opinion by Stevens, the
court then granted relief to the inmate in this case, Terry
Williams, on the ground that he had not received effective
assistance of counsel. Rehnquist, Thomas and Scalia dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In an 8-1 decision, the court ruled that documents produced in
response to a broad subpoena under a grant of immunity cannot be
used as evidence if the prosecutor did not previously know of the
documents' existence. The case, United States vs. Hubbell, No.
99-166, grew out of Kenneth W. Starr's prosecution of Webster L.
Hubbell, the former associate attorney general, on tax evasion
charges. In an opinion by Stevens, the court ruled that Hubbell's
production of thousands of personal financial records was a
``testimonial act'' that was shielded by his immunity agreement.
Rehnquist dissented.
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment: Free Speech &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an important campaign finance case, the court voted 6-3 to
reaffirm the constitutionality of low limits on campaign
contributions and rejected the argument that such limits can be
valid only if aimed at documented instances of corruption. The
case, Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-963, was
from Missouri, where a $1,000 contribution limit mirrors that of
federal campaign law. Souter wrote the opinion, joined by
Rehnquist, O'Connor, Breyer, Ginsburg and Stevens. Kennedy, Scalia
and Thomas dissented. Several justices, although not a majority,
wrote separately to suggest that beyond this case, the court's
entire approach to campaign finance might have to be reconsidered
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled unanimously that public universities can collect
student activity fees even from students who object to particular
activities, as long as the policy is neutral as to the student
organizations' viewpoints. Kennedy wrote the opinion in Board of
Regents vs. Southworth, No. 98-1189, a case from the University of
Wisconsin that was followed closely throughout the higher education
world.
</P>
<P>
   Sexually explicit expression was at issue in two cases. By a 6-3
vote, the court upheld a nude dancing ordinance from Erie, Pa.,
that requires dancers to wear at least pasties and a G-string.
O'Connor wrote a plurality opinion for herself, Rehnquist, Kennedy
and Breyer, while Scalia and Thomas voted separately to uphold the
ordinance. Stevens, Ginsburg and Souter dissented in City of Erie
vs. Pap's A.M., No. 98-1161.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court voted 5-4 to strike down a federal
law that required many cable television systems to limit sexually
explicit channels to late-night hours. Kennedy's majority opinion,
U.S. vs. Playboy Entertainment Group, No. 98-1682, was joined by
Stevens, Thomas, Souter and Ginsburg. Rehnquist, Breyer, Scalia and
O'Connor dissented.
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment: Association &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled by a 5-4 vote that the Boy Scouts can ban gay
members because opposition to homosexuality is part of the
organization's expressive message. Application of New Jersey's
anti-discrimination law violated the Boy Scouts' right to freedom
of association, Rehnquist said for the court in Boy Scouts of
America vs. Dale, No. 99-699. The dissenters were Stevens, Souter,
Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down California's blanket primary, under which
all voters get a single ballot from which they can choose
candidates of any party affiliation. The system stripped parties of
their right to political association, Scalia said for the 7-2
majority in California Democratic Party vs. Jones, No. 99-401.
Stevens and Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-SCOTUS-TERM-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: Ginsburg dissented. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment: Religion &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled 6 to 3 that the practice of organized,
student-led prayer at public high school football games amounted to
an unconstitutional establishment of religion. Stevens wrote the
majority opinion in Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Doe,
No. 99-62. The dissenters were Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the court lowered the barriers against public
aid to religious schools, upholding a federal program that places
computers and other equipment in parochial school classrooms. The
vote in Mitchell vs. Helms, No. 98-1648, was 6-3, but the majority
splintered over how far to go. Thomas wrote a plurality opinion for
himself, Rehnquist, Scalia and Kennedy, with a narrower concurring
opinion by O'Connor and Breyer declined to go so far.
</P>
<P>
   Civil Rights &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an employment discrimination case, the court ruled
unanimously that even in the absence of smoking-gun evidence of
discrimination, a plaintiff can prevail by showing that an
employer's innocent-sounding explanation for its action was a lie.
O'Connor wrote the opinion in Reeves vs. Sanderson Plumbing
Products, No. 99-536.
</P>
<P>
   The court overturned a provision of Hawaii's constitution under
which only descendants of the native Hawaiians can vote in
elections for trustees of the state's Office of Hawaiian Affairs.
Voting 7-2 in Rice vs. Cayetano, No. 98-818, the court found the
provision to violate the 15th Amendment, which provides that the
right to vote shall not be denied on account of race. Kennedy wrote
the majority opinion. Stevens and Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In an important voting rights case, the court ruled by a 5-4
vote that the Justice Department must approve districting changes _
even those adopted with a discriminatory purpose _ as long as the
changes leave minority voters no worse off than before. Prevention
of backsliding is the only test for Justice Department
``pre-clearance'' under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the court
said in Reno vs. Bossier Parish, No. 98-405. Scalia wrote the
majority opinion, joined by Rehnquist, O'Connor, Kennedy and
Thomas. Souter wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Stevens,
Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Law and Regulation  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled 5-4 that the Food and Drug Administration never
received authority from Congress to regulate tobacco products. The
court's interpretation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
was a blow to the Clinton administration's anti-smoking policy; the
invalidated rules restricted the marketing of cigarettes to
children and teen-agers. O'Connor wrote the court's opinion in FDA
vs. Brown &AMP; Williamson, No. 98-1152, joined by Rehnquist, Scalia,
Kennedy and Thomas. Breyer dissented, joined by Stevens, Souter and
Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting the federal law that governs employee health
benefits, the court ruled unanimously that the financial incentives
that health maintenance organizations give doctors to hold down
costs do not amount to a violation of the federal duty to put
patients' interests first. The decision, Pegram vs. Herdrich, No.
98-1949, handed the patients' rights debate back to Congress.
Souter wrote the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 5-4, the court upheld a provision of a recent federal
law, the Prison Litigation Reform Act, that restricts the authority
of federal judges to keep in place court orders governing the
operation of state and local prison systems. O'Connor wrote the
majority opinion in Miller vs. French, No. 99-224, joined by
Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas. Souter, Stevens, Breyer and
Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In an important environmental case, the court upheld the ability
of private plaintiffs to invoke so-called citizen suit provisions
of federal environmental law and bring lawsuits to stop pollution.
Ginsburg wrote the 7-2 opinion in Friends of the Earth vs. Laidlaw,
No. 98-822. Scalia and Thomas dissented.

court's rulings. But the court was more sharply divided than usual,
with the middle ground often seeming to disappear. Twenty cases
were decided by 5-4 votes, a higher proportion than in most recent
years. A solid conservative bloc consisting of Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas hung together and
prevailed in 13 of the 20.
</P>
<P>
   The four more-liberal justices _ John Paul Stevens, David H.
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer _ voted as a
group in the majority in only one 5-4 case, the decision striking
down Nebraska's abortion law, where they were joined by O'Connor.
The six remaining close cases were scrambled: for example, in the
case striking down a federal regulation on sexually explicit
programming on cable television, Thomas, who often displays a
libertarian bent on free speech issues, and Kennedy, who almost
always adopts the free-speech position, were in the majority to
strike down the regulation, while Breyer, often sympathetic to
government interests in speech cases, voted in dissent.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the court this term were O'Connor, who cast
only five dissenting votes; Rehnquist, who cast eight; and Kennedy,
who dissented nine times. Chief Justice Rehnquist's position at the
center of the court is itself a measure of how conservative the
court has become; Associate Justice Rehnquist had been the court's
most frequent lone dissenter before President Ronald Reagan chose
him ago to succeed Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for example, on criminal law, Rehnquist's vote is a fair
indicator of the court's center of gravity. To his right, Scalia,
who dissented 15 times this term, and Thomas, who dissented 12
times, were the two dissenters from the chief justice's decision
that reaffirmed the Miranda ruling. To the chief justice's left,
Stevens dissented 28 times and Ginsburg 23, on cases ranging from
equal protection to congressional authority to prisoners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the labels conservative and liberal do not fully capture
this court. ``Which cases were most visible to the public this
year?'' John G. Roberts Jr., a Supreme Court practitioner and and
former deputy solicitor general during the Bush administration,
asked rhetorically the other day. ``Probably school prayer,
abortion, and Miranda, and the conservatives lost all three,''
Roberts said. ``The conventional wisdom needs to be taken
skeptically.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to this court's mysteries may lie in examining where the
justices commit their energy. Questions of individual rights, such
as race and due process, are not the front-burner issues at the
court that they were a few years ago, perhaps because the justices
have reached a kind of settlement: affirmative action has been
sharply limited, while at the same time the due process guarantee
is alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what animates the justices are questions of the court's
own institutional turf in particular and the allocation of
governmental power in general, both among the branches of the
federal government and between Washington and the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is reflecting in a bunch of different doctrines the
general sense that the federal government is too big, too powerful,
too incompetent,'' said Professor Christopher H. Schroeder of Duke
University Law School. Cases this year in which the court struck
down state incursions into the federal government's authority in
foreign affairs were not the contrary, he said, reflecting instead
``the classic 18th-century notion that where we need the federal
government, we need it internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines in the court's federalism debate have been clearly
drawn, with the open question being where the court plans to take
it next.
</P>
<P>
   One logical path, Schroeder said, would be in the libertarian
direction of giving individual citizens more ammunition against
government authority through strengthening the Fifth Amendment
doctrine against the uncompensated ``taking'' of private property,
for example. But Scalia has pushed the takings argument as far as
his current colleagues seem willing to follow, trying but not quite
succeeding in making much land-use regulation constitutionally
questionable as a ``regulatory taking'' for which landowners must
be compensated.
</P>
<P>
   So, like questions that this election-year term has raised about
the court's future, this is one that does not have a clear answer.
Even a casual look at the term's 5-4 decisions shows what could lie
ahead, depending on which president gets to fill which vacancies,
if any. The four liberal dissenters from the decisions curbing
federal authority would move quickly to overturn those precedents
if they gained another vote, while at the same time, Thomas and
three other conservative justices _ minus O'Connor _ who came up
one vote short of dramatically lowering the barrier to public aid
to parochial schools would not hesitate to move quickly in that
direction. To that degree, the term that ended last week is as much
prologue as last word.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &UR; BC-SCOTUS-TERM-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: last word. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Following are summaries of the term's most important decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that because the procedure that abortion
opponents call partial-birth abortion may be the most medically
appropriate way of terminating some pregnancies, it cannot
constitutionally be banned. The 5-4 decision, Stenberg vs. Carhart,
No. 99-830, invalidated a Nebraska law while rendering the laws of
30 other states unconstitutional as well. Breyer wrote the majority
opinion; the dissenters were Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas and,
surprisingly in light of his earlier support for abortion rights,
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-3 vote, the court ruled that a Colorado law creating a
``no-approach'' zone outside medical offices did not violate the
free speech rights of abortion protesters seeking to urge women not
to go through with their abortions. Stevens wrote the opinion in
Hill vs. Colorado, No. 98-1856. Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Federalism
</P>
<P>
   By the 5-4 vote that has become familiar from the court's
increasingly bitter debate over the proper allocation of federal
and state authority, the court struck down a central provision of
one federal law, the Violence Against Women Act, and invalidated
the application of the federal age discrimination law to the
states.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when the justices saw a case as presenting a
straightforward issue of the supremacy of federal law _ as opposed
to a federal incursion into a traditional area of state authority _
the court was most often unanimous in upholding the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's majority opinion in the Violence Against Women Act
case, United States vs. Morrison, No. 99-5, declared that ``the
Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national
and what is truly local.'' The decision invalidated the law's civil
damages provision, which permitted suits in federal court by
victims of crimes ``motivated by gender.'' The dissenters were
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   By the same 5-4 lineup, the court ruled in Kimel vs. Florida
Board of Regents, No. 98-791, that Congress lacked authority to
make the states, as employers, liable to suit under the federal Age
Discrimination in Employment Act. Writing for the majority,
O'Connor said the government's interest in eradicating age
discrimination on the job yielded to the states' sovereign
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In another case involving state immunity, the court avoided the
Constitution and looked only to Congress' intent in ruling that
Congress did not mean to make states liable to suit under the False
Claims Act for defrauding the federal government. Scalia wrote the
opinion in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources vs. Stevens, No.
98-1828, with Stevens and Souter dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the court rejected a states' rights
challenge to the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, a federal law that
bars states from selling personal information about licensed drives
and automobile owners. Rehnquist wrote the opinion in Reno vs.
Condon, No. 98-1464.
</P>
<P>
   The court was also unanimous in upholding the supremacy of
federal law in two cases with foreign policy implications. In one,
Crosby vs. National Foreign Trade Council, No. 99-474, an opinion
by Souter held that a federal law placing sanctions on Myanmar, the
former Burma, pre-empted a Massachusetts law that withheld state
business from companies that do business with that nation's
repressive military regime.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court invalidated Washington State's
safety and environmental regulations for tanker traffic along its
coast. Kennedy wrote the opinion in United States vs. Locke, No.
98-1701.
</P>
<P>
   Due Process &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a case about the right of parents to resist interference in
their children's lives from grandparents and others, the court
ruled 6-3 that a Washington state law went too far in permitting a
judge to order grandparents' visiting rights over a mother's
objection. The splintered opinions in Troxel vs. Granville, No.
99-138, invoked the Constitution's due process protection for
parental child-rearing decisions, but failed to agree on a
definitive approach. O'Connor wrote a plurality opinion that
Rehnquist, Breyer and Ginsburg joined. Souter and Thomas provided
additional votes on the parents' side. Kennedy, Stevens and Scalia
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal Law &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court's 7-2 reaffirmation of Miranda vs. Arizona, in an
opinion by Rehnquist, was the leading criminal law case. The court
said in Dickerson vs. United States, No. 99-5525, that because
Miranda ``announced a constitutional rule,'' Congress was not free
to replace the famous Miranda warnings with a case-by-case test of
whether a confession was voluntary. The decision invalidated a 1968
law, known as Section 3501, by which Congress had purported to
overrule Miranda. Scalia and Thomas dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down New Jersey's hate crime law, ruling 5-4
that the Constitution requires the jury to make the central
finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, of whether a crime was
motivated by bias. The New Jersey law left this job to the judge.
The decision, Apprendi vs. New Jersey, No. 99-478, cast doubt on
federal and state laws in which judges make the crucial findings
that determine sentences. Stevens wrote the majority opinion; the
dissenters were O'Connor, Breyer and Kennedy, along with Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   The court's other criminal law cases were a mix of
search-and-seizure issues and cases interpreting a 1996 law
restricting state inmates' access to federal court. The outcome was
mixed as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-SCOTUS-TERM-REVIEW-3RDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: as well. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 5-4, that flight at the mere sight of a police
officer can often _ although not always _ be suspicious enough to
justify the police in conducting a stop-and-frisk search. Rehnquist
wrote for the majority in Illinois vs. Wardlow, No. 98-1036,
upholding the search of a man who bolted from the sight of police
cars converging on a Chicago street. Stevens dissented, joined by
Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal defendants prevailed in two other search cases.
Ginsburg wrote for a unanimous court that an anonymous tip that a
person is carrying a gun is not enough to justify a stop-and-frisk
search in the absence of some indication that the information is
reliable. The case was Florida vs. J.L., No. 98-1993. And the court
ruled 7-2 that, without some particular suspicion of wrongdoing,
law enforcement agents cannot walk down the aisle of a bus
squeezing passengers' overhead carry-on bags to see if any might
contain contraband. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, in Bond
vs. U.S., No. 98-9349, while Breyer and Scalia dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In interpreting the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act, a 1996 law in which Congress limited the rights of state
inmates to challenge their convictions in federal court by means of
petitions for writs of habeas corpus, the court made clear that
federal judges still have an important role to play despite the new
law's limitations. Applying the new law, the court overturned death
sentences in two cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, the court was unanimous in ruling that a Virginia
death row inmate, Michael Williams, should not have been penalized
by the state's failure to provide needed evidence. Kennedy wrote
for the court in Williams vs. Taylor, No. 99-6615.
</P>
<P>
   A second ruling under the 1996 law, also confusingly called
Williams vs. Taylor, No. 98-8384, was more convoluted, producing
two controlling opinions. First, the court interpreted a provision
barring federal courts from setting aside a state court decision
unless the state ruling was an ``unreasonable'' application of
federal law. The question was the meaning of ``unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because a decision was wrong did not make it necessarily
unreasonable, O'Connor wrote in a 5-4 portion of the ruling that
was joined by Rehnquist, Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas. In dissent,
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer said federal judges should not
have to defer to state court decisions they regarded as incorrect,
even if plausible.
</P>
<P>
   But by a 6-3 vote, in a portion of the opinion by Stevens, the
court then granted relief to the inmate in this case, Terry
Williams, on the ground that he had not received effective
assistance of counsel. Rehnquist, Thomas and Scalia dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In an 8-1 decision, the court ruled that documents produced in
response to a broad subpoena under a grant of immunity cannot be
used as evidence if the prosecutor did not previously know of the
documents' existence. The case, United States vs. Hubbell, No.
99-166, grew out of Kenneth W. Starr's prosecution of Webster L.
Hubbell, the former associate attorney general, on tax evasion
charges. In an opinion by Stevens, the court ruled that Hubbell's
production of thousands of personal financial records was a
``testimonial act'' that was shielded by his immunity agreement.
Rehnquist dissented.
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment: Free Speech &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an important campaign finance case, the court voted 6-3 to
reaffirm the constitutionality of low limits on campaign
contributions and rejected the argument that such limits can be
valid only if aimed at documented instances of corruption. The
case, Nixon vs. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, No. 98-963, was
from Missouri, where a $1,000 contribution limit mirrors that of
federal campaign law. Souter wrote the opinion, joined by
Rehnquist, O'Connor, Breyer, Ginsburg and Stevens. Kennedy, Scalia
and Thomas dissented. Several justices, although not a majority,
wrote separately to suggest that beyond this case, the court's
entire approach to campaign finance might have to be reconsidered
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled unanimously that public universities can collect
student activity fees even from students who object to particular
activities, as long as the policy is neutral as to the student
organizations' viewpoints. Kennedy wrote the opinion in Board of
Regents vs. Southworth, No. 98-1189, a case from the University of
Wisconsin that was followed closely throughout the higher education
world.
</P>
<P>
   Sexually explicit expression was at issue in two cases. By a 6-3
vote, the court upheld a nude dancing ordinance from Erie, Pa.,
that requires dancers to wear at least pasties and a G-string.
O'Connor wrote a plurality opinion for herself, Rehnquist, Kennedy
and Breyer, while Scalia and Thomas voted separately to uphold the
ordinance. Stevens, Ginsburg and Souter dissented in City of Erie
vs. Pap's A.M., No. 98-1161.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court voted 5-4 to strike down a federal
law that required many cable television systems to limit sexually
explicit channels to late-night hours. Kennedy's majority opinion,
U.S. vs. Playboy Entertainment Group, No. 98-1682, was joined by
Stevens, Thomas, Souter and Ginsburg. Rehnquist, Breyer, Scalia and
O'Connor dissented.
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment: Association &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled by a 5-4 vote that the Boy Scouts can ban gay
members because opposition to homosexuality is part of the
organization's expressive message. Application of New Jersey's
anti-discrimination law violated the Boy Scouts' right to freedom
of association, Rehnquist said for the court in Boy Scouts of
America vs. Dale, No. 99-699. The dissenters were Stevens, Souter,
Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down California's blanket primary, under which
all voters get a single ballot from which they can choose
candidates of any party affiliation. The system stripped parties of
their right to political association, Scalia said for the 7-2
majority in California Democratic Party vs. Jones, No. 99-401.
Stevens and Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-SCOTUS-TERM-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: Ginsburg dissented. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First Amendment: Religion &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled 6 to 3 that the practice of organized,
student-led prayer at public high school football games amounted to
an unconstitutional establishment of religion. Stevens wrote the
majority opinion in Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Doe,
No. 99-62. The dissenters were Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the court lowered the barriers against public
aid to religious schools, upholding a federal program that places
computers and other equipment in parochial school classrooms. The
vote in Mitchell vs. Helms, No. 98-1648, was 6-3, but the majority
splintered over how far to go. Thomas wrote a plurality opinion for
himself, Rehnquist, Scalia and Kennedy, with a narrower concurring
opinion by O'Connor and Breyer declined to go so far.
</P>
<P>
   Civil Rights &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an employment discrimination case, the court ruled
unanimously that even in the absence of smoking-gun evidence of
discrimination, a plaintiff can prevail by showing that an
employer's innocent-sounding explanation for its action was a lie.
O'Connor wrote the opinion in Reeves vs. Sanderson Plumbing
Products, No. 99-536.
</P>
<P>
   The court overturned a provision of Hawaii's constitution under
which only descendants of the native Hawaiians can vote in
elections for trustees of the state's Office of Hawaiian Affairs.
Voting 7-2 in Rice vs. Cayetano, No. 98-818, the court found the
provision to violate the 15th Amendment, which provides that the
right to vote shall not be denied on account of race. Kennedy wrote
the majority opinion. Stevens and Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In an important voting rights case, the court ruled by a 5-4
vote that the Justice Department must approve districting changes _
even those adopted with a discriminatory purpose _ as long as the
changes leave minority voters no worse off than before. Prevention
of backsliding is the only test for Justice Department
``pre-clearance'' under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the court
said in Reno vs. Bossier Parish, No. 98-405. Scalia wrote the
majority opinion, joined by Rehnquist, O'Connor, Kennedy and
Thomas. Souter wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Stevens,
Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Law and Regulation  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled 5-4 that the Food and Drug Administration never
received authority from Congress to regulate tobacco products. The
court's interpretation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
was a blow to the Clinton administration's anti-smoking policy; the
invalidated rules restricted the marketing of cigarettes to
children and teen-agers. O'Connor wrote the court's opinion in FDA
vs. Brown &AMP; Williamson, No. 98-1152, joined by Rehnquist, Scalia,
Kennedy and Thomas. Breyer dissented, joined by Stevens, Souter and
Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting the federal law that governs employee health
benefits, the court ruled unanimously that the financial incentives
that health maintenance organizations give doctors to hold down
costs do not amount to a violation of the federal duty to put
patients' interests first. The decision, Pegram vs. Herdrich, No.
98-1949, handed the patients' rights debate back to Congress.
Souter wrote the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 5-4, the court upheld a provision of a recent federal
law, the Prison Litigation Reform Act, that restricts the authority
of federal judges to keep in place court orders governing the
operation of state and local prison systems. O'Connor wrote the
majority opinion in Miller vs. French, No. 99-224, joined by
Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas. Souter, Stevens, Breyer and
Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   In an important environmental case, the court upheld the ability
of private plaintiffs to invoke so-called citizen suit provisions
of federal environmental law and bring lawsuits to stop pollution.
Ginsburg wrote the 7-2 opinion in Friends of the Earth vs. Laidlaw,
No. 98-822. Scalia and Thomas dissented.

TOFFS AND MACHIAVELS: THE BRITISH AREN'T GETTING ANY RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In its understated way, Britain is the Ed Koch of
nations, endlessly wondering ``How'm I doing?'' But unlike the
self-congratulating former mayor of New York, Britain rarely
expects a positive answer. And lately, a nation that is always
sensitive about perceived slights to its international status has
found more than usual to be upset about.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did CBS News recently report that some crime in England
is far worse than in the United States, but England's soccer team
ignominiously lost to Romania (Romania!) in the Euro 2000
tournament. Then, the country's No. 2 tennis player, Greg Rusedski,
was blown out of Wimbledon on opening day by Vincent Spadea, an
American known to British newspapers as ``the world's biggest
loser'' because he had lost 22 of his last 22 matches.
</P>
<P>
   And now along comes ``The Patriot,'' a film about the American
Revolution that presents the English as effete war criminals with
snobby accents who herd families of fledgling Americans into barns
and set them on fire, just for fun. To Britons sick of being pushed
around, this obnoxious affront to retrospective pride may be the
last straw.
</P>
<P>
   The film hasn't even opened in Britain yet, but the newspapers
have been full of outrage at what they see as wanton disregard for
the historical record. Maybe the war was dirty and violent at
times, they say, but their soldiers certainly never shot children
or minced around in the creepy manner of Nazi generals. And it's no
accident that Mel Gibson stars in the film, they say _ he's
Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``As every Hollywood casting agent knows, the devil speaks with
an English accent,'' Neil Norman wrote in The Evening Standard,
deploring how ``to a man, the dastardly English are presented as
heartless toffs and Machiavels, war criminals and child-killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do the British persist in casting everything in terms of
national pride? Shouldn't they just lighten up?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a significant pride in what we achieved in the past
with regard to the British empire, and we don't like to see it
unfairly traduced,'' explained the British historian Andrew
Roberts. This puffed-up feeling about the past, he said, is
inextricably linked to a sadly deflated view of the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is there to be proud of?'' he asked, musing crossly about
the European Union. ``What are we doing now? We're getting sucked
into some amorphous European superstate, largely against our will.
As a nation we haven't achieved much since 1945, and the things
that we are rightly proud of are being taken away from us by the
distortions of a foreign entertainment industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot,'' of course, is just one in a recent series of
Hollywood slights perpetrated on the British _ and more
specifically, the English. There were the Englishmen in
``Titanic,'' who battened down the hatches to prevent the declasse,
mostly Irish, lower-deck passengers from escaping. Then there was
Anthony Hopkins, the repellant hissing villain in ``The Silence of
the Lambs.'' And don't forget Gibson's ``Braveheart,'' in which the
English are shown raping, slaughtering and pillaging their way
through 13th-century Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   More worryingly, Britons don't figure in ``U-571,'' a recent
film starring Matthew McConaughey as the leader of a band of
Americans on a submarine who capture the German Enigma code-making
machine in World War II. In real life, the Americans didn't capture
the code _ the British did.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. Before the communists, when the Nazis
were still the worst villains, World War II movies regularly showed
the British and Americans working together to repel the heinous
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until quite recently, films made in America were on the
whole quite admiring of the British and British history,'' said
Jeffrey Richards, a professor of cultural history at the University
of Lancaster. Since then, he said, the British film market has
virtually disappeared, and Hollywood no longer cares whether it
alienates British viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The British are feeling alienated a lot these days. But no
matter what other people say about them, it's not as bad as what
they say about themselves _ particularly when they lose at sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this absurd obsession with sport,'' Roberts said.
``Even though, since 1967, we've been beaten at all the sports we
invented, after 30 years we still get into great emotional upsets.
The things we should be looking at seriously are things like
Britain's great economy, but instead we get into a huge tussle
about whether Greg Rusedski has a good day at Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   When the unfortunate Rusedski lost to Spadea, the hapless
American who had been touring the world losing one match after
another for eight months, The Times of London just couldn't control
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are on a 22 match, world-record losing streak,'' it
wrote, ``there is only one person capable of ending your misery: a
British sports star.''

FOR MONEY? HEY, I DID IT FOR ME 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review  
 By BRUCE KLUGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Playboy magazine published nude photographs of Darva
Conger, the 34-year-old emergency room nurse who agreed in February
to wed the self-described real estate baron Rick Rockwell on Fox
TV's ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' Their brief
matrimonial union was subsequently annulled, unconsummated.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of her television appearance, Conger assured the
public that she did not intend to exploit her sudden celebrity by
accepting the many offers that had come her way _ including posing
nude on a Web site _ but she seems to have changed her tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had any problem with Playboy,'' she explains in an
article that accompanies a 10-page romp along an undisclosed beach
in the August issue. ``It's amazing how comfortable I felt, maybe
because everything was so professional and it was a natural
environment. . . . I'm not a voluptuous bedroom bunny, I'm an
outdoor person.''

<P>
   _ Joey Heatherton, entertainer, defending her appearance in
Playboy, April 1997
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually part of my reawakening. From my Mediterranean

</P>
<P>
   ``There was another girl shooting the day I was at the Playboy
photo studio, and she was perfect. But . . . I didn't hate her, I
didn't feel jealous. . . . We bring different things to the
pictures. She brings beautiful breasts, and I bring OK breasts and
lots of personality.''

her appearance in Playboy, July 1994
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people are going to say, `Why did you pose for
Playboy?' Well, the answer is, I think the body is a beautiful
thing. I know I was not supposed to have an affair with a married
man, but I'm human, too. I'm a Christian. I go to church on

python. I love snakes and wanted to do a shot all covered with
them. I was disappointed that there was only one; I'd envisioned
six or seven.''

MISSILE WARS: WHAT AMERICA CALLS A DEFENSE CHINA CALLS AN OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ ``A huge superpower and you say you're afraid of tiny
little North Korea?'' snorted Sha Zukang, China's chief
arms-control negotiator, in a recent interview. ``We think that's
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it's hard to find any foreign-policy expert here, in
or out of government, who believes the stated U.S. rationale for a
continental anti-missile defense: that it's merely intended to stop
the likes of North Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he will decide in coming weeks, after
a crucial test scheduled for July 7, whether to start building
radars and 100 missile interceptors in Alaska, the first phase of a
grander project.
</P>
<P>
   Even westward-leaning scholars here think the new push for
missile defense in Washington reflects an underlying conviction, in
the U.S. military and a strong faction of the political elite, that
the United States must better prepare for battle with China.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Washington has a growing coterie of politicians,
ex-officials and experts who warn of an emerging ``China threat,''
China has an even broader group of officials and scholars who think
the United States is trying to hem their country in. They portray
the United States as a power-drunk bully, determined to preserve
its post-Cold War status as the world's dominant power.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders almost certainly share suspicions about the
``American threat,'' but they also know that their ability to shape
events will remain limited until China becomes far richer and more
technologically advanced. So for now they are putting more emphasis
on revamping the economy than on pursuing a costly arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is the obvious flashpoint, the place where U.S. promises
and China's core goals most obviously could collide. But many
experts here see U.S. support for Taiwan as part of a broader,
unstated program of containment.
</P>
<P>
   ``China faces an elementary reality: the United States is
steadily encroaching on China, and China's means for counterattack
and room for maneuver under American pressure have shrunk,'' wrote
Wang Weiguang, an international relations expert at Beijing
University, in an essay in the current issue of Strategy and
Management, a mainstream policy journal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Washington's guarantees to Taiwan, these experts point
accusingly at recent U.S.-Japanese defense guidelines that seem
designed to draw Japan into any Pacific war; at U.S. military ties
elsewhere in Asia; at U.S. use of human rights and trade disputes
to keep China on the defensive; and now, at the seeming rush toward
missile defenses that would neutralize China's nuclear forces and
could be extended over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, as the missile defense proposal gained
popularity, Washington's attention was largely on Russian
objections and the need to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty. Only belatedly have officials seriously considered the
depth of China's objections and the possible truth of its warnings
that a dangerous arms race could be set off.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington ignores Beijing's protests, some scholars here
privately say, the always shaky support for friendly relations with
the United States will be eroded. For from here, American
assurances that the system is not intended to counter China simply
will not wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has used North Korea as an excuse to build
missile defenses, but now the two Koreas have improved their
relations and the risk of war has dramatically declined,'' said Yan
Xuetong, a scholar at the Chinese Institute of Contemporary
International Relations, which has close ties to the government.
``If the United States continues to develop a missile defense
anyway, it's difficult for us to believe that it's not aimed at
China.''
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable future, the proposed missile defenses would
be useful against only one country and that is China, said Shen
Dingli, an expert in arms control and American studies at Fudan
University in Shanghai. Russia's missile forces will remain large
enough to overwhelm the system, he noted, and, realistically, no
other potential enemy will have effective intercontinental missiles
for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon planners say that for reliable defense, three
interceptors should be launched toward every incoming missile. So
the 100-interceptor plan seems tailor-made to cancel out China's
small force of long-range missiles, estimated by Western
intelligence agencies at no more than 18 or 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the United States says the system is not aimed at
China, the capability is aimed at China,'' Shen said.
</P>
<P>
   China is already developing more accurate and powerful
intercontinental missiles and officials here say they will do what
is necessary to protect China's nuclear credibility. They would
probably multiply the number of new missiles they build or put
multiple warheads on new missiles, as well as deploy decoys to
outwit the American defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their suspicions about American goals, President Jiang
Zemin and other Communist Party leaders continue to stress their
desire for cooperation, and they are taking the politically risky
path of further opening their economy to global competition.
</P>
<P>
   Like American counterparts who advocate building ties between
the two nations, China's leaders may hope that frictions can be
contained and overwhelmed by the two nations' shared interests in
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders also know how much their power over
international affairs remains constrained by China's relative
backwardness, economic and military. And they seem to believe that
``economic power is the most important and most essential factor in
comprehensive national power,'' as the latest Pentagon assessment
of China's military described the Chinese credo.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock of the Kosovo war, which the Chinese saw as a
terrible sign that the United States can take drastic measures
while ignoring China, there was serious debate in Beijing about
whether to accelerate the growth in military spending, which
remains far below U.S. levels. But at a key leadership meeting last
summer, the senior leaders reaffirmed their priority emphasis on
economic and technological development, according to the Pentagon
report.
</P>
<P>
   China does seek great power status and especially to become the
preeminent Asian power, strong enough, in the words of the Pentagon
analysis, ``so that no major action will be taken by any other
international actor in Asia without first considering Chinese
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Through sheer size and assertiveness, if not yet weaponry, China
may be almost there. But America's apparent readiness to pursue a
missile shield despite the evident harm to China's security would
be, for many people here, one more stinging reminder of why they
must make China stronger.

TOFFS AND MACHIAVELS: THE BRITISH AREN'T GETTING ANY RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In its understated way, Britain is the Ed Koch of
nations, endlessly wondering ``How'm I doing?'' But unlike the
self-congratulating former mayor of New York, Britain rarely
expects a positive answer. And lately, a nation that is always
sensitive about perceived slights to its international status has
found more than usual to be upset about.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did CBS News recently report that some crime in England
is far worse than in the United States, but England's soccer team
ignominiously lost to Romania (Romania!) in the Euro 2000
tournament. Then, the country's No. 2 tennis player, Greg Rusedski,
was blown out of Wimbledon on opening day by Vincent Spadea, an
American known to British newspapers as ``the world's biggest
loser'' because he had lost 22 of his last 22 matches.
</P>
<P>
   And now along comes ``The Patriot,'' a film about the American
Revolution that presents the English as effete war criminals with
snobby accents who herd families of fledgling Americans into barns
and set them on fire, just for fun. To Britons sick of being pushed
around, this obnoxious affront to retrospective pride may be the
last straw.
</P>
<P>
   The film hasn't even opened in Britain yet, but the newspapers
have been full of outrage at what they see as wanton disregard for
the historical record. Maybe the war was dirty and violent at
times, they say, but their soldiers certainly never shot children
or minced around in the creepy manner of Nazi generals. And it's no
accident that Mel Gibson stars in the film, they say _ he's
Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``As every Hollywood casting agent knows, the devil speaks with
an English accent,'' Neil Norman wrote in The Evening Standard,
deploring how ``to a man, the dastardly English are presented as
heartless toffs and Machiavels, war criminals and child-killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do the British persist in casting everything in terms of
national pride? Shouldn't they just lighten up?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a significant pride in what we achieved in the past
with regard to the British empire, and we don't like to see it
unfairly traduced,'' explained the British historian Andrew
Roberts. This puffed-up feeling about the past, he said, is
inextricably linked to a sadly deflated view of the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is there to be proud of?'' he asked, musing crossly about
the European Union. ``What are we doing now? We're getting sucked
into some amorphous European superstate, largely against our will.
As a nation we haven't achieved much since 1945, and the things
that we are rightly proud of are being taken away from us by the
distortions of a foreign entertainment industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot,'' of course, is just one in a recent series of
Hollywood slights perpetrated on the British _ and more
specifically, the English. There were the Englishmen in
``Titanic,'' who battened down the hatches to prevent the declasse,
mostly Irish, lower-deck passengers from escaping. Then there was
Anthony Hopkins, the repellant hissing villain in ``The Silence of
the Lambs.'' And don't forget Gibson's ``Braveheart,'' in which the
English are shown raping, slaughtering and pillaging their way
through 13th-century Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   More worryingly, Britons don't figure in ``U-571,'' a recent
film starring Matthew McConaughey as the leader of a band of
Americans on a submarine who capture the German Enigma code-making
machine in World War II. In real life, the Americans didn't capture
the code _ the British did.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. Before the communists, when the Nazis
were still the worst villains, World War II movies regularly showed
the British and Americans working together to repel the heinous
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until quite recently, films made in America were on the
whole quite admiring of the British and British history,'' said
Jeffrey Richards, a professor of cultural history at the University
of Lancaster. Since then, he said, the British film market has
virtually disappeared, and Hollywood no longer cares whether it
alienates British viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The British are feeling alienated a lot these days. But no
matter what other people say about them, it's not as bad as what
they say about themselves _ particularly when they lose at sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this absurd obsession with sport,'' Roberts said.
``Even though, since 1967, we've been beaten at all the sports we
invented, after 30 years we still get into great emotional upsets.
The things we should be looking at seriously are things like
Britain's great economy, but instead we get into a huge tussle
about whether Greg Rusedski has a good day at Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   When the unfortunate Rusedski lost to Spadea, the hapless
American who had been touring the world losing one match after
another for eight months, The Times of London just couldn't control
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are on a 22 match, world-record losing streak,'' it
wrote, ``there is only one person capable of ending your misery: a
British sports star.''

THE FOUR-LETTER ALPHABET THAT SPELLS LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computers are uncaring devices that run on electrons and the
cold numbers in their programming. They are hard, boxy things and
essentially hateful. People are soft, warm, fuzzy, logic-averse
creatures who like to cuddle and are mostly rounder than they want
to be. Surely nothing connects two such far distant realms.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, something does, something that last week was pried out
from the obscurity where for 4 billion years it has been gradually
evolving its present shape.
</P>
<P>
   Just as surely as any shrink-wrapped Microsoft disk, the human
genome is a program, a set of precisely coded instructions that
evolution has written for the design, operation and unfortunately
rather limited maintenance of a person. That people should be
operated by such a specific script is as amazing as it would be to
find that robots have souls.
</P>
<P>
   The genome's programming language has only four letters,
designated A, G, C and T after the chemical units of DNA, but these
suffice to express the instructions for building the most complex
known object in the universe. The human brain is thought to possess
about 100 billion nerve cells wired together with 100 trillion
interconnections. The connections are so cunningly engineered that
some scientists suspect there is not a single miswiring in the
entire system.
</P>
<P>
   How do you go from four letters to the complexity of the brain?
That's pretty easy. You just build one layer of complexity on top
of another until you have what you need. The four letters spell out
64 three-letter words. The words, in strings of about 300,
constitute some 50,000 instructions, a k a genes, and the body's
cells, of which the brain has about 1,000 different varieties, each
use a special subset of the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Can our self-image of fuzzy free spirits long survive when the
genome proves that life, at its deepest level, is scripted by a
logical program? The program's control is so tight that, as has
long been known, a single error in the instructions can cause
malfunctions such as sickle-cell anemia and other hereditary
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Even in matters of behavior, the program can be astonishingly
precise. A favorite laboratory animal, the microscopic roundworm
known as C. elegans, can be found in soils around the world,
peacefully eating bacteria. Some C. elegans colonies are very
social and all dine together. In others, solitary feeding is the
rule. Biologists at the University of California in San Francisco
recently discovered that both social and solitary feeding in the
worm are controlled by the same gene. In the 215th word of the
gene, the solitary feeders have the letters G-T-T, the social
feeders T-T-T. Just as in computer programs, a single letter can
make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Because the genome's designer has an absolute lock on the
biological software market, the human genome is written in the same
programming code as is that of roundworms. But no doubt our
behavioral instructions have somewhat more wriggle-room than the
worm's because the choices we must make to survive are rather more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years we should get to read those behavioral
instructions. Whatever they are _ instincts to slaughter or show
mercy, the contexts for love and hatred, the taste for obedience or
rebellion _ they are the determinants of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have caught the first glimpses of our instruction book,
previously known only to God,'' said Dr. Francis Collins, head of
the Human Genome Project, in announcing its decipherment at a White
House ceremony last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Genesis account, to continue Collins' thought, tells us
there were two trees in the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Knowledge
and the Tree of Life. God evicted Adam and Eve because he feared
that, having tasted the Tree of Knowledge, his problem tenants
would eat next of the Tree of Life and live forever.
</P>
<P>
   The genome, to borrow the Genesis writer's metaphor, is surely
represented by both trees, entwined around each other like two
strands of a double helix. Have we not now broken back into the
garden for a second bite?
</P>
<P>
   From the Tree of Knowledge we will learn to read the programming
instructions that shape human nature and determine the implicit
survival rules of human societies. From the Tree of Life we will
learn to fix the programming errors that limit longevity and,
should we choose, to change the program so as to extend lifespan
many decades.
</P>
<P>
   Linguists trying to reconstruct the language spoken by the
ancestral human population have found that the world's major
language groups bear strong echoes of the mother tongue's words for
``one'' and maybe ``two,'' but nothing more. Perhaps the first
people, like many primitive cultures today, had a counting system
that went, ``One, two, many.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that we have lost our innocence and can count the
different degrees of infinity, we can see that that world is
constructed of numbers, just as Pythagoras taught, and that beneath
the velleities of human nature lies the same powerful programming
language whose G-T-T/T-T-T switch determines the sociality of the
roundworm.

MISSILE WARS: WHAT AMERICA CALLS A DEFENSE CHINA CALLS AN OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BEIJING _ ``A huge superpower and you say you're afraid of tiny
little North Korea?'' snorted Sha Zukang, China's chief
arms-control negotiator, in a recent interview. ``We think that's
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it's hard to find any foreign-policy expert here, in
or out of government, who believes the stated U.S. rationale for a
continental anti-missile defense: that it's merely intended to stop
the likes of North Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he will decide in coming weeks, after
a crucial test scheduled for July 7, whether to start building
radars and 100 missile interceptors in Alaska, the first phase of a
grander project.
</P>
<P>
   Even westward-leaning scholars here think the new push for
missile defense in Washington reflects an underlying conviction, in
the U.S. military and a strong faction of the political elite, that
the United States must better prepare for battle with China.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Washington has a growing coterie of politicians,
ex-officials and experts who warn of an emerging ``China threat,''
China has an even broader group of officials and scholars who think
the United States is trying to hem their country in. They portray
the United States as a power-drunk bully, determined to preserve
its post-Cold War status as the world's dominant power.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders almost certainly share suspicions about the
``American threat,'' but they also know that their ability to shape
events will remain limited until China becomes far richer and more
technologically advanced. So for now they are putting more emphasis
on revamping the economy than on pursuing a costly arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is the obvious flashpoint, the place where U.S. promises
and China's core goals most obviously could collide. But many
experts here see U.S. support for Taiwan as part of a broader,
unstated program of containment.
</P>
<P>
   ``China faces an elementary reality: the United States is
steadily encroaching on China, and China's means for counterattack
and room for maneuver under American pressure have shrunk,'' wrote
Wang Weiguang, an international relations expert at Beijing
University, in an essay in the current issue of Strategy and
Management, a mainstream policy journal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Washington's guarantees to Taiwan, these experts point
accusingly at recent U.S.-Japanese defense guidelines that seem
designed to draw Japan into any Pacific war; at U.S. military ties
elsewhere in Asia; at U.S. use of human rights and trade disputes
to keep China on the defensive; and now, at the seeming rush toward
missile defenses that would neutralize China's nuclear forces and
could be extended over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, as the missile defense proposal gained
popularity, Washington's attention was largely on Russian
objections and the need to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty. Only belatedly have officials seriously considered the
depth of China's objections and the possible truth of its warnings
that a dangerous arms race could be set off.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington ignores Beijing's protests, some scholars here
privately say, the always shaky support for friendly relations with
the United States will be eroded. For from here, American
assurances that the system is not intended to counter China simply
will not wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has used North Korea as an excuse to build
missile defenses, but now the two Koreas have improved their
relations and the risk of war has dramatically declined,'' said Yan
Xuetong, a scholar at the Chinese Institute of Contemporary
International Relations, which has close ties to the government.
``If the United States continues to develop a missile defense
anyway, it's difficult for us to believe that it's not aimed at
China.''
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable future, the proposed missile defenses would
be useful against only one country and that is China, said Shen
Dingli, an expert in arms control and American studies at Fudan
University in Shanghai. Russia's missile forces will remain large
enough to overwhelm the system, he noted, and, realistically, no
other potential enemy will have effective intercontinental missiles
for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon planners say that for reliable defense, three
interceptors should be launched toward every incoming missile. So
the 100-interceptor plan seems tailor-made to cancel out China's
small force of long-range missiles, estimated by Western
intelligence agencies at no more than 18 or 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the United States says the system is not aimed at
China, the capability is aimed at China,'' Shen said.
</P>
<P>
   China is already developing more accurate and powerful
intercontinental missiles and officials here say they will do what
is necessary to protect China's nuclear credibility. They would
probably multiply the number of new missiles they build or put
multiple warheads on new missiles, as well as deploy decoys to
outwit the American defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their suspicions about American goals, President Jiang
Zemin and other Communist Party leaders continue to stress their
desire for cooperation, and they are taking the politically risky
path of further opening their economy to global competition.
</P>
<P>
   Like American counterparts who advocate building ties between
the two nations, China's leaders may hope that frictions can be
contained and overwhelmed by the two nations' shared interests in
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders also know how much their power over
international affairs remains constrained by China's relative
backwardness, economic and military. And they seem to believe that
``economic power is the most important and most essential factor in
comprehensive national power,'' as the latest Pentagon assessment
of China's military described the Chinese credo.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock of the Kosovo war, which the Chinese saw as a
terrible sign that the United States can take drastic measures
while ignoring China, there was serious debate in Beijing about
whether to accelerate the growth in military spending, which
remains far below U.S. levels. But at a key leadership meeting last
summer, the senior leaders reaffirmed their priority emphasis on
economic and technological development, according to the Pentagon
report.
</P>
<P>
   China does seek great power status and especially to become the
preeminent Asian power, strong enough, in the words of the Pentagon
analysis, ``so that no major action will be taken by any other
international actor in Asia without first considering Chinese
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Through sheer size and assertiveness, if not yet weaponry, China
may be almost there. But America's apparent readiness to pursue a
missile shield despite the evident harm to China's security would
be, for many people here, one more stinging reminder of why they
must make China stronger.

MEXICANS GET A CHANCE TO DEFINE DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing)  (The Week in Review)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Carmen Salinas, a popular television talk show
host, was warming up a huge crowd for the party in power before a
speech by its presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida. She did
not emphasize his views or personality. ``Labastida is the man, the
good one, the winner,'' she said. It was all the crowd needed to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   In most democracies, parties nominate candidates they hope will
win by persuading citizens to vote for them. But this is Mexico.
And the party was the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as
the PRI, which has governed Mexico since its founding in 1929. In
that party, things work differently.
</P>
<P>
   During the decades when the PRI held a virtual political
monopoly, its insiders picked the candidate they knew would win and
then instructed citizens to vote for him. Today, the monopoly is
cracking. But even so, PRI voters still expect to be told who is
the likely winner. Their party is still driven by patronage, and
they want to be on the right side of whoever will dole it out. And
so the all-important thing is to know who is ``el bueno,'' the good
one, the winner.
</P>
<P>
   It is a facet of a political culture that sets the PRI apart
from parties born of pluralistic democracy. And that is the
all-important issue at stake Sunday as Mexicans vote.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the PRI is going into a presidential
election in which there is a real possibility that it could lose.
It promises to be the most fair and open election the country has
ever had. Polls show Labastida running even with a moderate
conservative, Vicente Fox, of the National Action Party or PAN (a
leftist, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is also running.)
</P>
<P>
   All of the candidates call themselves democrats, but Mexicans
are nevertheless making a fundamental choice about the nature of
their democracy. They are choosing between two sharply different
interpretations of it _ a PRI version that says only one party is
needed, and the challengers' version, which says competition
between parties is the very essence of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   There are, in fact, not only candidates but also profound
questions in front of these voters: What makes a country a
democracy? Is it enough to have an election, or does it require
real competition between parties? Suppose the party always in power
is popular because it keeps the society on an even keel and doles
out lots of favors. Isn't that democracy? If so, what about policy?
Can it come only from the leaders, or must it bubble up from the
voters? Months ago, the PRI government promised, and seems to have
delivered, reforms that produced a real election contest. Still,
what the PRI is offering is a continuation of top-down control _
and of public acceptance that it will do whatever it can get away
with to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, by contrast, has staged a grass-roots campaign
for citizens' rights and for a balance of powers between the
president and Mexico's legislature. In short, it is democratic in
the way that most U.S. voters understand the term. The PRI is not.
Still, many Mexicans think of the PRI as a party that truly
represents them.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans recognize that the central dispute in the presidential
race is over ``la alternancia'' _ the idea that parties must
alternate in power if democracy is to be achieved. PRI leaders
argue that they can reform their party from within and make it
democratic. ``As long as we have the option of alternating power,
we have democracy,'' said Sandra Fuentes Berain, a top official in
the Labastida campaign. ``Alternating power is not a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox and Cardenas represent those who believe that their
country will not become a democracy until the PRI is removed.
Denise Dresser, a political analyst, puts it this way: ``Mexicans
have truly never had the chance to throw the bums out. Tasting that
experience would be extraordinarily empowering. It would inject a
whole new fresh air into the process.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI leaders make no bones about the authoritarian nature and
genius of their party. ``In this election, you are going to see the
machinery of the PRI, like few parties in the world have,'' said
Emilio Gamboa, one of Labastida's top campaign managers. ``I'll bet
not even the party in China has a machine like the one we have
built up over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, in fact, was created by Mexican strongmen determined to
impose order on the chaos of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. To this
day, Gamboa said, its early work to spread national unity, services
like clinics and schools, and political largesse throughout the
land have cemented its followers' loyalty. ``Our party kept the
social peace,'' Gamboa said.
</P>
<P>
   Many PRI supporters who turned out to cheer Labastida knew
little about him, other than that he was their man. But his rallies
turned into dense crushes as followers pressed to shake his hand
or, with luck, have a picture taken with him that they could
display in transactions with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of change, PRI voters have been forgiving of its corruption
scandals and long-term economic policies that have failed to lift
the poor. ``I'd rather have an old devil I know than a new devil I
don't,'' said Cristina Luna Flores,42, a rural homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's party, the PAN, has deeply conservative Catholic and
business-oriented roots. But its rightist ideas have been tempered
as it evolved into a a resistance movement against the PRI,
battling to defend electoral victories against PRI fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, to be sure, evokes another anti-democratic figure in
Mexican politics, the caudillo or strongman. He is a strong-willed,
hard-driving and charismatic candidate who overwhelmed and
sometimes even ignored his party. But he forced the PAN to
modernize its platform and endowed it with a new organization for
getting votes. In doing so, he mobilized millions who are not PAN
militants but want something new. They range from young people to
the wealthy elite and even the military. ``We need change,'' said
Fernando Antonio Reyes, 49, an active duty army lieutenant in a Fox
crowd. ``The PRI has taken away all our buying power. We can't take
its corruption anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins, the closeness of the race means Mexico will face
new conflicts. even if Labastida wins, the struggle to topple the
PRI has accelerated. If Fox wins, his own style and the need to
share power with PRI holdovers in the Congress may sorely test the
assumption that change at the top is the soul of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   So even as it evolves, Mexico is likely to remain a strange
hybrid _ an electorate in pursuit of democracy with an
authoritarian force at its very heart.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Haiti's industry: drug conduit
 &HT;    For release July 5, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - As they slide along the murky waters of the Miami River,
a minor stream that cleaves a major city, small coastal freighters
inbound from Haiti now receive more attention than did the
outbounds of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What used to be going out were hundreds of bicycles, most stolen
from lawns and yards of Miami families, stacked high on the decks
bound for Haiti. While the problem still exists, and has been added
to by other forms of contraband, it's what's coming in _ and how _
that has U.S. Customs authorities in knots.
</P>
<P>
   Its natural resources diminished, its economy bankrupt, its
politics clouded and its people impoverished, Haiti has become an
easy conduit for the Colombian drug trade. Transferring drugs might
just be the country's leading industry.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States plans to devote $1.3 billion to help
Colombia fight drug cultivation and trafficking, someone needs to
pay attention to what's flowing out of Cap Haitian and
Port-de-Paix.
</P>
<P>
   This is where much of the cocaine reaching this country is
loaded onto small freighters that chug their way to South Florida
and up the Miami River, attempting to avoid the eyes of U.S.
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, some of the most innovative ways of sequestering the
drugs have been uncovered by resolute Customs' officers, but one
has to wonder: for every load found, how many get through? The
contraband has been found welded into the hulls of some of the
vessels, or hidden inside balloons within water-filled ballast
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a game of hide-and-seek, wait-and-wonder. Often, days pass
before the freighters begin unloading cargo, in the hope that the
eyes of the Customs' officials might be diverted elsewhere by then.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that 6,000 pounds of cocaine have been seized
since November from ships that originated in Haiti. Inasmuch as
most of what's coming in from there is contraband, and most of
what's going out is contraband (bicycles, weapons and cash drug
receipts), it's a wonder that either the federal, state or local
governments do not simply ban the arrival of the freighters.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping them at sea for a search cannot be an option, as often
the ships have to be lifted from the water, their hulls exposed,
for agents to fully explore every nook of the vessel for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti is a problem that just doesn't want to go away. Despite
the occupation of the country by U.S. troops, and a hoped-for
achievement of political stability, it really hasn't happened,
although last week's elections seemed a step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Political terrorism still reigns in the small villages,
unemployment is out of sight and Haiti is no further along to a
market-driven democracy today than it was after the slave revolt
from French rule 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian drug cartels, seeking new avenues for their
product, have found it easy to access the coasts and forests of
Haiti where law enforcement people seem to be invisible. The drugs
then are loaded onto the coastal freighters bound for South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials estimated that 14 percent of all the cocaine
that came into the United States from South America in 1999 came
through Haiti. Not only are they coming by sea, but by air as well.
In June, U.S. Customs seized two Air de Ayiti Express planes,
suspecting them of smuggling drugs (and illegal immigrants!) from
Haiti in late night landings at private airports in Miami and Fort
Lauderdale. Thus far, $2.3 million in cocaine has been seized.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., lifted his personal
blockage of $22 million in aid to Haiti, a bounty he was holding
hostage in retaliation for a Houston company being fined by Haiti
for alleged customs irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows how the $22 million will be used, but Haiti's track
record with foreign aid has not been distinguished. It may appear
hard and cruel to beat on a nation so steeped in poverty, but Haiti
needs to be convinced that it cannot continue as a conduit for
drugs bound for the United States .
</P>
<P>
   Haiti needs to be included in the war on drugs. If there is $1.3
billion available to spend fighting that (losing) war in Colombia,
then some needs to be spent (under U.S. control) to preempt the
traffic coming out of Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   At a congressional hearing last week, Rep. Benjamin Gilman,
R-N.Y., chairman of the House International Relations Committee,
accused Haiti of becoming a ``narco-state.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs agents, probing deep into the hulls and ballast
tanks of rusty old freighters on the Miami River, would agree.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Nader's biggest threat is to an apathetic public
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the vanity of third-party candidates to believe that
because the political distance between them and the major parties
is so great, the narrower differences between Democratic and
Republican candidates is trivial.
</P>
<P>
   That was the subtext of the Alabama Gov. George Wallace's
white-backlash presidential campaigns. To yahoo cheers, the
combative states'-righter would declare that there ``isn't a dime's
worth of difference'' between the Republican and Democratic
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar will no doubt be coming from the demagog Pat
Buchanan once he starts running as the nominee of the Reform Party.
(Where is Ross Perot when you really need him?)
</P>
<P>
   And Ralph Nader is keenly huckstering the cliche as the
candidate of the Green Party's muddle of romantic and zealoparty
differences that matter so much in the House and Senate not matter
in the White House?
</P>
<P>
   Republicrats? Democrats would upgrade education by punching up
the resources of public schools. The preferred GOP answer is to use
tax-money vouchers substantially to replace public schools with
private, often sectarian ones.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore would shore up Social Security in strikingly
different ways. (Neither of them, by the way, fully credible.) Bush
is willing unilaterally to abrogate the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty; Gore seeks only to fine-tune it. Their environmental
records could not be more different.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on and the distinctions are not just superficial
or ones of only degree rather than of kind.
</P>
<P>
   And because the distinctions matter, Nader's claim is finally
not just nonsense but pernicious nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing it as he does, Nader is unlikely to bring voters
clamoring to his candidacy. Just the opposite. Americans prefer to
keep their political squabbles more over particulars than between
clashing ideological crusades.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's pitch most likely will just reinforce the dismissive
indifference by which a lazy electorate forfeits its democratic
franchise in stay-at-home apathy. The idea that Gore and Bush are
interchangeable fits the dangerous bill of goods we've sold
ourselves to the effect that politics doesn't matter; that it has
no consequences in our daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Out here in the real world, Nader won't talk many voters into
seeing him as offering a choice. Rather, he'll bolster the sorry
assumption that the realistic democratic choices don't matter.

THE FOUR-LETTER ALPHABET THAT SPELLS LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computers are uncaring devices that run on electrons and the
cold numbers in their programming. They are hard, boxy things and
essentially hateful. People are soft, warm, fuzzy, logic-averse
creatures who like to cuddle and are mostly rounder than they want
to be. Surely nothing connects two such far distant realms.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, something does, something that last week was pried out
from the obscurity where for 4 billion years it has been gradually
evolving its present shape.
</P>
<P>
   Just as surely as any shrink-wrapped Microsoft disk, the human
genome is a program, a set of precisely coded instructions that
evolution has written for the design, operation and unfortunately
rather limited maintenance of a person. That people should be
operated by such a specific script is as amazing as it would be to
find that robots have souls.
</P>
<P>
   The genome's programming language has only four letters,
designated A, G, C and T after the chemical units of DNA, but these
suffice to express the instructions for building the most complex
known object in the universe. The human brain is thought to possess
about 100 billion nerve cells wired together with 100 trillion
interconnections. The connections are so cunningly engineered that
some scientists suspect there is not a single miswiring in the
entire system.
</P>
<P>
   How do you go from four letters to the complexity of the brain?
That's pretty easy. You just build one layer of complexity on top
of another until you have what you need. The four letters spell out
64 three-letter words. The words, in strings of about 300,
constitute some 50,000 instructions, a k a genes, and the body's
cells, of which the brain has about 1,000 different varieties, each
use a special subset of the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Can our self-image of fuzzy free spirits long survive when the
genome proves that life, at its deepest level, is scripted by a
logical program? The program's control is so tight that, as has
long been known, a single error in the instructions can cause
malfunctions such as sickle-cell anemia and other hereditary
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Even in matters of behavior, the program can be astonishingly
precise. A favorite laboratory animal, the microscopic roundworm
known as C. elegans, can be found in soils around the world,
peacefully eating bacteria. Some C. elegans colonies are very
social and all dine together. In others, solitary feeding is the
rule. Biologists at the University of California in San Francisco
recently discovered that both social and solitary feeding in the
worm are controlled by the same gene. In the 215th word of the
gene, the solitary feeders have the letters G-T-T, the social
feeders T-T-T. Just as in computer programs, a single letter can
make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Because the genome's designer has an absolute lock on the
biological software market, the human genome is written in the same
programming code as is that of roundworms. But no doubt our
behavioral instructions have somewhat more wriggle-room than the
worm's because the choices we must make to survive are rather more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years we should get to read those behavioral
instructions. Whatever they are _ instincts to slaughter or show
mercy, the contexts for love and hatred, the taste for obedience or
rebellion _ they are the determinants of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have caught the first glimpses of our instruction book,
previously known only to God,'' said Dr. Francis Collins, head of
the Human Genome Project, in announcing its decipherment at a White
House ceremony last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Genesis account, to continue Collins' thought, tells us
there were two trees in the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Knowledge
and the Tree of Life. God evicted Adam and Eve because he feared
that, having tasted the Tree of Knowledge, his problem tenants
would eat next of the Tree of Life and live forever.
</P>
<P>
   The genome, to borrow the Genesis writer's metaphor, is surely
represented by both trees, entwined around each other like two
strands of a double helix. Have we not now broken back into the
garden for a second bite?
</P>
<P>
   From the Tree of Knowledge we will learn to read the programming
instructions that shape human nature and determine the implicit
survival rules of human societies. From the Tree of Life we will
learn to fix the programming errors that limit longevity and,
should we choose, to change the program so as to extend lifespan
many decades.
</P>
<P>
   Linguists trying to reconstruct the language spoken by the
ancestral human population have found that the world's major
language groups bear strong echoes of the mother tongue's words for
``one'' and maybe ``two,'' but nothing more. Perhaps the first
people, like many primitive cultures today, had a counting system
that went, ``One, two, many.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that we have lost our innocence and can count the
different degrees of infinity, we can see that that world is
constructed of numbers, just as Pythagoras taught, and that beneath
the velleities of human nature lies the same powerful programming
language whose G-T-T/T-T-T switch determines the sociality of the
roundworm.

MEXICANS GET A CHANCE TO DEFINE DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing)  (The Week in Review)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Carmen Salinas, a popular television talk show
host, was warming up a huge crowd for the party in power before a
speech by its presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida. She did
not emphasize his views or personality. ``Labastida is the man, the
good one, the winner,'' she said. It was all the crowd needed to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   In most democracies, parties nominate candidates they hope will
win by persuading citizens to vote for them. But this is Mexico.
And the party was the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as
the PRI, which has governed Mexico since its founding in 1929. In
that party, things work differently.
</P>
<P>
   During the decades when the PRI held a virtual political
monopoly, its insiders picked the candidate they knew would win and
then instructed citizens to vote for him. Today, the monopoly is
cracking. But even so, PRI voters still expect to be told who is
the likely winner. Their party is still driven by patronage, and
they want to be on the right side of whoever will dole it out. And
so the all-important thing is to know who is ``el bueno,'' the good
one, the winner.
</P>
<P>
   It is a facet of a political culture that sets the PRI apart
from parties born of pluralistic democracy. And that is the
all-important issue at stake Sunday as Mexicans vote.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the PRI is going into a presidential
election in which there is a real possibility that it could lose.
It promises to be the most fair and open election the country has
ever had. Polls show Labastida running even with a moderate
conservative, Vicente Fox, of the National Action Party or PAN (a
leftist, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is also running.)
</P>
<P>
   All of the candidates call themselves democrats, but Mexicans
are nevertheless making a fundamental choice about the nature of
their democracy. They are choosing between two sharply different
interpretations of it _ a PRI version that says only one party is
needed, and the challengers' version, which says competition
between parties is the very essence of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   There are, in fact, not only candidates but also profound
questions in front of these voters: What makes a country a
democracy? Is it enough to have an election, or does it require
real competition between parties? Suppose the party always in power
is popular because it keeps the society on an even keel and doles
out lots of favors. Isn't that democracy? If so, what about policy?
Can it come only from the leaders, or must it bubble up from the
voters? Months ago, the PRI government promised, and seems to have
delivered, reforms that produced a real election contest. Still,
what the PRI is offering is a continuation of top-down control _
and of public acceptance that it will do whatever it can get away
with to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, by contrast, has staged a grass-roots campaign
for citizens' rights and for a balance of powers between the
president and Mexico's legislature. In short, it is democratic in
the way that most U.S. voters understand the term. The PRI is not.
Still, many Mexicans think of the PRI as a party that truly
represents them.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans recognize that the central dispute in the presidential
race is over ``la alternancia'' _ the idea that parties must
alternate in power if democracy is to be achieved. PRI leaders
argue that they can reform their party from within and make it
democratic. ``As long as we have the option of alternating power,
we have democracy,'' said Sandra Fuentes Berain, a top official in
the Labastida campaign. ``Alternating power is not a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox and Cardenas represent those who believe that their
country will not become a democracy until the PRI is removed.
Denise Dresser, a political analyst, puts it this way: ``Mexicans
have truly never had the chance to throw the bums out. Tasting that
experience would be extraordinarily empowering. It would inject a
whole new fresh air into the process.''
</P>
<P>
   PRI leaders make no bones about the authoritarian nature and
genius of their party. ``In this election, you are going to see the
machinery of the PRI, like few parties in the world have,'' said
Emilio Gamboa, one of Labastida's top campaign managers. ``I'll bet
not even the party in China has a machine like the one we have
built up over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, in fact, was created by Mexican strongmen determined to
impose order on the chaos of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. To this
day, Gamboa said, its early work to spread national unity, services
like clinics and schools, and political largesse throughout the
land have cemented its followers' loyalty. ``Our party kept the
social peace,'' Gamboa said.
</P>
<P>
   Many PRI supporters who turned out to cheer Labastida knew
little about him, other than that he was their man. But his rallies
turned into dense crushes as followers pressed to shake his hand
or, with luck, have a picture taken with him that they could
display in transactions with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of change, PRI voters have been forgiving of its corruption
scandals and long-term economic policies that have failed to lift
the poor. ``I'd rather have an old devil I know than a new devil I
don't,'' said Cristina Luna Flores,42, a rural homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's party, the PAN, has deeply conservative Catholic and
business-oriented roots. But its rightist ideas have been tempered
as it evolved into a a resistance movement against the PRI,
battling to defend electoral victories against PRI fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, to be sure, evokes another anti-democratic figure in
Mexican politics, the caudillo or strongman. He is a strong-willed,
hard-driving and charismatic candidate who overwhelmed and
sometimes even ignored his party. But he forced the PAN to
modernize its platform and endowed it with a new organization for
getting votes. In doing so, he mobilized millions who are not PAN
militants but want something new. They range from young people to
the wealthy elite and even the military. ``We need change,'' said
Fernando Antonio Reyes, 49, an active duty army lieutenant in a Fox
crowd. ``The PRI has taken away all our buying power. We can't take
its corruption anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins, the closeness of the race means Mexico will face
new conflicts. even if Labastida wins, the struggle to topple the
PRI has accelerated. If Fox wins, his own style and the need to
share power with PRI holdovers in the Congress may sorely test the
assumption that change at the top is the soul of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   So even as it evolves, Mexico is likely to remain a strange
hybrid _ an electorate in pursuit of democracy with an
authoritarian force at its very heart.

NO LIMIT: THE COSTS OF GLOBAL AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question is: How much would it cost to contain the global
AIDS epidemic? The short answer is: Well, how much have you got?
</P>
<P>
   How much would it cost to banish ignorance, to deaden lust, to
shame rape, to stop war, to enrich the poor, to empower women, to
defend children, to make decent medical care as globally ubiquitous
as Coca-Cola _ in short, to get rid of all the underlying causes of
the epidemic in the Third World?
</P>
<P>
   The latest global survey of the epidemic was released last week
by Unaids, the U.N. agency dealing with AIDS. It estimated that
more than one-third of all 15-year-olds in the worst-affected
countries are still destined to die even if infection rates somehow
drop.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, AIDS is usually addressed as a medical
problem to be solved with health care or public health policy.
Overseas experts say that even seeing the epidemic that way is a
luxury that reflects American thinking: any germ can be killed if
it is hammered long enough with a big enough wad of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But AIDS in the Third World, said Anthony Kinghorn, a South
African consultant to governments and businesses facing the
epidemic, is ``really a welfare and education issue rather than a
medical one.''
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe and India and Haiti, one cannot tackle AIDS the way
it has been fought in San Francisco and New York. One cannot simply
put baskets of condoms in all the gay bars and clean needles in all
the methadone clinics or even send speakers to all the high schools
and plant scary articles in the press.
</P>
<P>
   For one, much of the world at risk of AIDS can't read. Most of
the world at risk has never used a condom. Most of the world at
risk has never heard of Act Up and wouldn't dare heckle a
president. And most of the world with AIDS thinks it doesn't have
the disease and doesn't know anyone who does, because 95 percent of
those infected in the Third World have never been tested. (Most
estimates come from anonymous testing at pre-natal clinics.) And
most of the world cannot afford the drugs that Americans can.
</P>
<P>
   With such verities in mind, then, how is one to think about
containing AIDS _ say, in Africa, the continent most dramatically
affected so far?
</P>
<P>
   If there were money, what might be done with it?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, estimates are bandied about. The Unaids survey
mentioned a need for $2 billion a year for sub-Saharan Africa, of
which about $300 million has been committed, said Dr. Peter Piot,
head of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But that figure seems negligible, given the scope of the
disease. And it is, because Unaids estimates are painfully
conservative. The $2 billion was only for prevention _ not care _
and only to bring standards up to the level of Uganda or Senegal,
the only two African countries that have cut their numbers of
citizens living with AIDS. It envisioned modest goals: condom
handouts, blood testing, counseling for prostitutes and students,
routine treatment for venereal diseases, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   When Unaids tries to calculate the theoretical additional cost
of medical care, ``it gets more difficult,'' said Bernhard
Schwartlaender, the agency's chief epidemiologist. The calculations
are pared down to what realistically might be done. They include
treating only people with access to medical systems that can do
easier things like tuberculosis treatment and pre-natal care
reasonably well. Most of the money would go for the cheapest drugs,
like the antibiotic Bactrim, which prevents only simple infections.
Some money is allotted for more sophisticated drugs to fight
drug-resistant tuberculosis and fungal infections, and for an
``AIDS cocktail'' of anti-retroviral drugs _ but in these cases,
only enough to reach a fraction of those infected because those
therapies must be closely supervised and the medical resources to
do so are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the calculations assume that the cocktail will cost
only $1,400 a year (as opposed to the $12,000 a year or more that
an American AIDS patient might spend). To get the cost that low,
Western drug companies would have to cut their prices by 90 percent
or the drugs would have to be purchased from Brazil, India or other
countries that ignore patents.
</P>
<P>
   If that could all be arranged by 2005, Schwartlaender said, the
cost would be about $1.7 billion a year to get the cheapest care
for the dying to 40 percent of all infected Africans and the AIDS
cocktail to 10 percent _ an inadequate, but realistic, goal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-GLOBAL-AIDS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: realistic, goal. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If the drugs are more expensive or you increase the coverage
rate, the costs explode accordingly,'' Schwartlaender said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody calculates what it would cost to give Africans and Asians
the kind of health care that Americans _ even American welfare
recipients _ receive. That would run into hundreds of billions,
because one would have to start from ground zero, building the
hospitals and importing the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   To put this in perspective: There are an estimated 34 million
HIV-infected people in the world, at least 30 million of them poor.
Poor not just by American standards, but by world standards: living
on less than $2 a day. AIDS specialists rarely say this bluntly,
but the truth is that most of those 30 million people have simply
been written off, because the first priority for the first few
billion dollars is prevention, not treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it is possible to talk so straightforwardly about the
terrible cost of AIDS _ at least not until more political leaders
in Africa realistically confront the dimensions of the problem, and
more governments overseas mobilize to help Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Whiteside, an economist who studies AIDS in South Africa,
which has the world's fastest-growing epidemic, puts it this way:
``You can't give up on the infected because of the message it
sends.'' But if he had $1 billion to spend most wisely, he would
spend it on ``giving women more power, caring for orphans and
getting them education.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the overwhelming problem of poverty. An
HIV-positive American can focus on his T-cell counts; an
HIV-positive African in a rural village still has to focus on
finding clean water and food.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Uganda,'' said Kinghorn, the South African consultant,
``there are lots of kids who are aware of AIDS now. But they're
simply not able to protect themselves. They have to do high-risk
things to put bread on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Once poverty is factored in _ especially when the dying young
can no longer build an economy _ the question becomes: How much can
be done with the least money? But that, too, is problematic. The
cheapest form of prevention is condoms. The U.S. Agency for
International Development is the biggest condom customer in the
world. With its European counterparts, the total bill for Africa
and Asia runs to Tens of millions of dollars. But distribution is
the difficult part, along with overcoming prejudices against them.
When, for example, will grown men in Soweto stop teasing young men
by asking, ``Oh, do you shower with your raincoat on, too?''
</P>
<P>
   A vaccine would also be a cheap countermeasure. The Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation has put up $250 million for the hunt, and
the Clinton administration has offered $1 billion in tax credits to
any company that invents one. But a vaccine, like a cure, remains
elusive. Optimists say one might be found and approved in 10 years.

<P>
   Blame HBO's ``Sex and the City'' or blame the decline of the
ozone layer, but skin is in. American women are showing more of it
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Summer itself is hotter. And over the last decade, the
proliferation of the Wonderbra coincided with global warming so
that just as cleavages became more pronounced, shorts became
shorter.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, always synchronized with hemlines, has reached
crazy new heights and so has the slip dress. Some of the skirts,
like some of the stocks, have since plunged down again. Other
skirts, like other stocks, have reached these new heights without
having much to them in the way of visible material: They're so
sheer, they're almost transparent.
</P>
<P>
   With the triumph of minimalism, the handkerchief has returned,
not as a decoration in a man's pocket but as an entire piece of
women's clothing, featured in handkerchief tops and hanky hemlines.
Sleeves, once a staple of the workplace, have become optional.
MTV's official anthem for its Spring Break 2000 was the ``Thong
Song,'' the R-and-B artist Sisqo's ode to revealing apparel.
</P>
<P>
   A brief history of skimpy: When things from the lingerie or
handkerchief category first became ``clothes,'' they seemed like
mistakes. The model wearing the bra top down the runway looked as
if she had been interrupted while getting dressed. The woman
arriving at the party in the camisole looked as if she had been
awakened from a nap. Backless shoes and shirts appeared incomplete.
But now everyone can tell that these things are not mistakes,
because it has become OK to wear what was formerly considered
underwear or handkerchiefs in most situations.
</P>
<P>
   They're not fashion mistakes, at least. But following fashions
can lead to other mistakes. Just as tight corsets put Victorian
women into severe physical discomfort, so today's scarf tops and
cropped tanks can bring stylish dressers to new levels of personal
discomfort. As women have embraced the empowerment and comfort of
wearing less, they have also been punished by those who can't see
past naked skin. As Erin Brockovich discovered, and as Julia
Roberts learned when she played Brockovich in the recent movie, if
women need to work twice as hard as men to prove they're as good,
scantily clad women need to work three times as hard.
</P>
<P>
   Female exposure has been attacked by the puritanical and the
macho alike. At the George Washington Middle School in Alexandria,
Va., 12-year-old girls wearing shorts of the lengths recommended by
Seventeen magazine were accused of violating the school dress code,
lined up and subjected to humiliating inspections. Last season,
even the trend-setting sitcom character Ally McBeal was held in
contempt of court for wearing a micro-mini.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the recent Puerto Rican Day parade in New York
City's Central Park, women wearing the latest fashions were mauled
by young men less interested in the pages of Vogue than in the
violent imagery of traditional skin magazines.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame that plunging necklines and ascending midriffs have
become identified with pornographic fantasies, because they do
reflect an improved reality. Women of all sizes, shapes and ages
wear the tie-backs and halters once seen only on the young and
slim, partly thanks to better self-image and the increased
acceptance of different body types. Designers have even made tube
tops for the visibly pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   While it seems generous of designers to want women to feel
better about themselves, clothing makers do profit from skimpy
fashions: they can charge more and more for items that are tinier
and tinier.
</P>
<P>
   Less is simple, and simplicity especially delights the low-end
retailers who copy and mass-produce couture. The popularity of the
George label sold in England's Asda chain, which was just purchased
by Wal-Mart, demonstrates that consumers like cheap versions of
designer fashions so much that they will buy them in the
supermarket. The American discount warehouse Sam's Club now sells
clothes. Why go elsewhere? these non-clothing clothing stores seem
to be asking. Wouldn't it be nice to wear less, pay less and think
about the whole thing less?
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice, if the judgments and gazes that followed
weren't quite so judgmental and gazing. Those who dare to show the
flesh and the confidence celebrated by current styles may find
themselves in a zone of discomfort. Women who dress provocatively
have traditionally been accused of sending a mixed message. But now
that provocative is chic, women are the ones receiving the mixed
message: Everyone's wearing it, but wear it at your own risk.

(Repeating for all needing).  (The Week in Review)  
 Co.  
 By ADAM LIPTAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think the truth is my friend in this,'' said Vice President
Al Gore as he released the transcript of a contentious sworn
interview with a Justice Department official over fund-raising in
the 1996 election. Ordinary folks trying to untangle the 123-page
document may wonder how Gore really treats his friends.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Gore's answers were very different from
those in any questioning of a smart, well-prepared witness
disinclined to help his adversary. They were, however, very
different from human conversation.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about legal proceedings and particularly those
pretrial sworn interviews known as depositions that turn
sophisticated people into quibblers, dissemblers or amnesiacs? Why
can't they just respond to the questions posed as people respond in
everyday conversations?
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not alone in having questions raised about his candor
under oath, questions that had House Republicans putting pressure
on Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint a special counsel. The
independent counsel Robert Ray recently concluded that the
testimony of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the dismissal of
several White House travel office employees in 1993 was at least
truthful enough that Ray did not think he could prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that she had lied.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was, in fact, tolerably forthcoming as far as depositions
go. At times, he was precise, even a little funny. He knew that on
the day of the interview he had been vice president for ``seven
years and two months and 28 days.'' He recounted his delight on
learning in the spring of 1996 that his schedule would include a
luncheon at a Buddhist temple in California. ``This ought to be
interesting,'' he said he remembered thinking. ``Little did I
know.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of an impressive series of documents that
suggested the contrary, he stoutly resisted his interlocutors'
efforts to make him concede that fund raising was going on at
either White House ``coffees'' (of which he attended either one,
according to Gore, or some 30, according to other reports) or the
luncheon at the Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer for all the parsing is that depositions are
preparation tools meant to prevent surprises at trial. They are
very rarely considered in their entirety or even used at trial.
Lawyers sometimes use them to contradict witnesses who change their
stories on the stand; occasionally the transcripts are read to the
jury when witnesses are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of videotaped depositions, and their use in and
out of the courtroom, a lawyer's standard advice to witnesses _ to
say as little as possible _ may no longer be wise, particularly
when those witnesses are public figures. The evasive responses of
Microsoft's Bill Gates helped undermine his corporation's case.
President Clinton, on the other hand, is thought to have helped
himself with his garrulous and expansive grand jury testimony,
whatever its truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer prepares a witness by stating that the enterprise
embarked upon is an exercise in playing defense, and that the
questioner is the enemy. The object is not to give up any ground.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, the lawyer continues, must become a user-unfriendly
computer, producing a truthful answer but not a particularly
expansive one. The witness is not obligated to reformulate the
questions or respond to what the questioner is plainly, if
clumsily, driving at.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer also reminds witnesses that their names on a document
_ as addressees or perhaps even as authors _ are no proof that they
have ever seen it, much less that what it says is true. The lawyer
will note the value of stock answers like ``I don't know'' or ``I
don't remember.'' It may also be suggested that perjury
prosecutions are rare and that the crime is a long coast dotted
with countless safe harbors. Perjury requires a statement that is
known to be false when said, actually false rather than merely
misleading, and material to the case.
</P>
<P>
   One Supreme Court case demonstrates just how hard perjury is to
prove. A witness was asked, ``Do you have any bank accounts in
Swiss banks?'' He said no, truthfully. ``Have you ever?'' The
witness, who once had a personal account there, replied: ``The
company had an account there for about six months, in Zurich.''
Because the last answer was literally true, although certainly
misleading, the defendant's conviction was reversed.

<P>
   Ordinary conversation is a very different beast. A chat with a
friend over a beer is filled with answers to the question you meant
to or should have asked, with corrections of mistaken premises,
with volunteered information, with little anticipations and
courtesies and clarifications.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, everyday life is full of misunderstandings. It is no
easy task to communicate even where both sides are trying their
best. Now factor in the adversary system, and the chances of
learning anything the witness chooses not to convey diminish
radically.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to suggest that life outside of litigation is an
Eden of truth-telling. Gore was questioned mercilessly about a
seemingly harmless courtesy letter to a supporter after a visit to
Taiwan. He was made to assess his own truthfulness, sentence by
sentence. ``No, I was actually glad I was not with them on the rest
of the voyage,'' he testified. And, he continued, ``the statement
that the `meetings with the government and business leaders were
fascinating' appears to be an overstatement, as does the
description of the visit to the Fo Kuang Shan facility as being
`almost overwhelming.''' So too ``the statement that it was `the
most enjoyable trip I have ever taken.''' The entire thing was a
tissue of lies or, as Gore put it, ``within the customary bounds of
this sort of communication.''

SOMETIMES, A HALF-TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE

<P>
   ``I think the truth is my friend in this,'' said Vice President
Al Gore as he released the transcript of a contentious sworn
interview with a Justice Department official over fund-raising in
the 1996 election. Ordinary folks trying to untangle the 123-page
document may wonder how Gore really treats his friends.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Gore's answers were very different from
those in any questioning of a smart, well-prepared witness
disinclined to help his adversary. They were, however, very
different from human conversation.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about legal proceedings and particularly those
pretrial sworn interviews known as depositions that turn
sophisticated people into quibblers, dissemblers or amnesiacs? Why
can't they just respond to the questions posed as people respond in
everyday conversations?
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not alone in having questions raised about his candor
under oath, questions that had House Republicans putting pressure
on Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint a special counsel. The
independent counsel Robert Ray recently concluded that the
testimony of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the dismissal of
several White House travel office employees in 1993 was at least
truthful enough that Ray did not think he could prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that she had lied.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was, in fact, tolerably forthcoming as far as depositions
go. At times, he was precise, even a little funny. He knew that on
the day of the interview he had been vice president for ``seven
years and two months and 28 days.'' He recounted his delight on
learning in the spring of 1996 that his schedule would include a
luncheon at a Buddhist temple in California. ``This ought to be
interesting,'' he said he remembered thinking. ``Little did I
know.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of an impressive series of documents that
suggested the contrary, he stoutly resisted his interlocutors'
efforts to make him concede that fund raising was going on at
either White House ``coffees'' (of which he attended either one,
according to Gore, or some 30, according to other reports) or the
luncheon at the Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer for all the parsing is that depositions are
preparation tools meant to prevent surprises at trial. They are
very rarely considered in their entirety or even used at trial.
Lawyers sometimes use them to contradict witnesses who change their
stories on the stand; occasionally the transcripts are read to the
jury when witnesses are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of videotaped depositions, and their use in and
out of the courtroom, a lawyer's standard advice to witnesses _ to
say as little as possible _ may no longer be wise, particularly
when those witnesses are public figures. The evasive responses of
Microsoft's Bill Gates helped undermine his corporation's case.
President Clinton, on the other hand, is thought to have helped
himself with his garrulous and expansive grand jury testimony,
whatever its truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer prepares a witness by stating that the enterprise
embarked upon is an exercise in playing defense, and that the
questioner is the enemy. The object is not to give up any ground.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, the lawyer continues, must become a user-unfriendly
computer, producing a truthful answer but not a particularly
expansive one. The witness is not obligated to reformulate the
questions or respond to what the questioner is plainly, if
clumsily, driving at.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer also reminds witnesses that their names on a document
_ as addressees or perhaps even as authors _ are no proof that they
have ever seen it, much less that what it says is true. The lawyer
will note the value of stock answers like ``I don't know'' or ``I
don't remember.'' It may also be suggested that perjury
prosecutions are rare and that the crime is a long coast dotted
with countless safe harbors. Perjury requires a statement that is
known to be false when said, actually false rather than merely
misleading, and material to the case.
</P>
<P>
   One Supreme Court case demonstrates just how hard perjury is to
prove. A witness was asked, ``Do you have any bank accounts in
Swiss banks?'' He said no, truthfully. ``Have you ever?'' The
witness, who once had a personal account there, replied: ``The
company had an account there for about six months, in Zurich.''
Because the last answer was literally true, although certainly
misleading, the defendant's conviction was reversed.
</P>

with volunteered information, with little anticipations and
courtesies and clarifications.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: It isn't always easy when boys act
like boys
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I raised three daughters, no sons. My oldest
grandchild is also a girl. But my other three are boys.
</P>
<P>
   I tell my daughters not to be too hard on their sons, that it
isn't always easy being a boy.
</P>
<P>
   When they ask me why, what can I say? It's hard to explain.
</P>
<P>
   But here's as good an explanation as any, a story I heard
first-hand from a fellow.
</P>
<P>
   He was new in town, fresh out of law school and just starting
out. A fellow he'd met at the office, an older guy, invited him to
a weekend deer hunt. He said it'd be a good way for him to get
acquainted.
</P>
<P>
   The young guy, being young, believed him.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he arrived at the cabin that Friday night, everyone
else was already there, half a dozen or so, playing cards and
drinking beer.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody so much as looked up to greet him. Nobody offered him a
beer, nobody introduced himself.
</P>
<P>
   He eased over to the side of the table where his friend from the
office sat. But when he tried to speak the other guy shook his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you see we're playing poker,'' he growled.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled up a chair and positioned it as close as he could to
the one fellow he knew. Still, nobody said anything to him, nobody
acknowledged his presence.
</P>
<P>
   He looked first at one and then another. One in particular _ the
one they called Mangy Bill _ he tried to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Mangy Bill was a giant of a man, with fiery red hair and, by all
indications, a temper to match. The scowl on his face was
punctuated by a half-chewed cigar, cocked in the corner of his
mouth, like a stubby exclamation point for the string of expletives
he directed at the cards he'd drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Then, before the young man realized what was happening,
everyone's attention was directed at him.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the friend from the office turned to his visitor.
``Hey, don't say that!'' he all but shouted, looking first at him
and then at Mangy Bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' the young man said, confused. ``I didn't say
anything?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, for your own sake,'' he implored. ``Just keep your
mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   But by this time Mangy Bill was on his feet, and the rest of
them were pushing back from the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you accusing me of cheating?!'' he roared, his chest and
arms straining at the vest, his veins bulging in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? No! I _ .'' Before the words were halfway out of the
young man's mouth, it was already too late.
</P>
<P>
   In a flash, from out of nowhere it seemed, Mangy Bill had pulled
a Bowie knife, its eight, thick inches of sharpened steel glinting
in the dingy light of the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   One minute the knife was in his hand, the next it was quivering
where he had stabbed it, in the center of the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the count of three,'' he snarled, ``go for it!''
</P>
<P>
   That's when the other guys hit Mangy Bill, gang tackling him and
dragging him down to the floor in a flood of shouts and curses, a
torrent of arms and fists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run! Run!,'' they were yelling at the young man. ``We can't
hold him long!''
</P>
<P>
   And run he did, across the room and out the door to his car.
Cranking it up and floor-boarding it, tires screaming, he careened
down the country road and into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Monday at the office, when he tried to talk to his friend about
what had happened to Mangy Bill, the older man just shook his head.
``Better that we never mention it,'' he whispered. ``Not now, not
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until 20 years later, at a cocktail party when he overheard
his name mentioned by a couple of men who were laughing, did he
learn the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so funny?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you know,'' one of them said, grinning. ``We were talking
about that time at the clubhouse when you first moved to town, when
we had some fun with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fun?'' he said, his voice barely audible. ``You were having
fun?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' the fellow said, starting to laugh again. ``It was all
a put-up deal, just our way of introducing ourselves. Don't tell me
you never figured it out?''
</P>
<P>
   At first, he just nodded. Then, he grinned. Finally, he managed
a dry, hoarse chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was laughing again, and he laughed with them.
</P>
<P>
   They told him Mangy Bill was a buddy of theirs from out of town,
a dock-worker as a matter of fact, as nice a fellow as you'd ever
meet _ and what a great sense of humor!
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they didn't have to tell him, they said, slapping him
on the back and laughing all the louder.
</P>
<P>
   What can you say? Boys will be boys.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, it isn't always easy being a boy.

CDC ADVISES FRESHMEN TO GET BACTERIAL MENINGITIS SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEGAN SCOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the rate of bacterial meningitis on the rise among college
freshmen, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
recommended for the first time Friday that all incoming students
consider getting vaccinated against the potentially lethal brain
infection.
</P>
<P>
   The communicable disease strikes about 3,000 Americans annually
and kills about 300, according to the CDC. Five people in
Massachusetts have died of the disease this year. Out of these
cases, 100 to 125 occur among college students, and up to 15 die as
a result.
</P>
<P>
   But federal health officials said freshmen living in dormitories
are particularly vulnerable, facing a risk of meningitis that is
six times higher than other college students. They called on
college health clinics and others who provide medical care to
students to make the vaccine available before the new academic year
begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once college students _ and their parents _ are aware that a
vaccine is available to help protect against this deadly disease,
our hope is that they will consider immunization before heading off
to college this fall,'' said David Spilker, president of the
Meningitis Foundation of America.
</P>
<P>
   Meningitis, also known as meningococcal disease, is an
inflammation of the lining around the brain, usually caused by one
of several types of viruses or bacteria. Because the disease
produces flu-like symptoms, physicians often misdiagnose it.
Meningitis then progresses rapidly and can result in permanent
brain damage, hearing loss, learning disability, kidney failure, or
death.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen who live in dormitories are at a higher risk of
meningitis, in part because of a lifestyle that may include sex,
alcohol consumption, active and passive smoking, shared utensils,
irregular eating habits, and sleeping patterns, all activities that
place them at a higher risk of meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a time when freshmen experiment with a lot of
activities where there's an exchange of saliva,'' said Bela Matyas,
medical director of the epidemiology program at the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health. ``The other reason is people come to
colleges from all over the country, so they're bringing different
strains with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle of Higher Education reported last year that during
the 1998-1999 academic year, 83 cases, six of them fatal, were
reported at academic institutions including Dartmouth and
Muhlenberg colleges, Eastern Illinois and Lehigh universities, and
the University of Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin at Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Many students and their parents don't realize that the vaccine
is 85 percent protective against four out of the five strains of
meningitis. The only side effects may include a low-grade fever and
pain and swelling at the site of the vaccination, but serious
reactions are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Bozof, who lost her son Evan to meningitis two years ago
when he was a junior at Georgia Southwestern State University, said
she only found out about the vaccine after Evan's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything about bacterial meningitis,'' said
Bozof, who lives in Atlanta. ``I had no idea how deadly it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Students do not have to be revaccinated, because when the
vaccine wears off in three to five years, many students are no
longer at high risk.
</P>
<P>
   Many colleges have started informing students and parents about
the vaccine, and some schools have provided it on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with the CDC's recommendation,'' said Boston
University spokesman Colin Riley. ``We offered the vaccine last
year in conjunction with the flu vaccine, and several hundred
students took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine, which costs approximately $70 per student, was
advertised in the school newspaper and in dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Harvard University has already sent a letter to the
parents of incoming freshmen recommending the vaccine.

A GREAT BUT UNSUNG MOVIE COMEDIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his ruptured-duck walk and his eyes staring balefully from
a clown's rubber face, the late Walter Matthau was one of the great
but curiously unsung film comedians of the last 35 years. Matthau,
who died at age 79 on Saturday of a heart attack in Santa Monica,
Calif., didn't hit his stride until his mid-40s. Perhaps that had
something to do with it. Although his acting credentials were
impeccable _ postwar study at the New School with Rod Steiger, Gene
Saks, and Tony Curtis, a string of Broadway stage credits _ his
film career got off to an undistinguished start in a series of
villain roles, ranging from ``The Kentuck-ian'' with Burt Lancaster
(1955) to ``Charade'' with Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant (1963).
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 came a foreshadowing of his persona-to-be. The film was
a comedy, ``Goodbye, Charlie.'' In it, Matthau played a film mogul
widely believed to have been modeled on Alexander Korda, who was
appalled to learn that he would have to suffer the indignity of a
prison term just for shooting, as he so memorably put it, ``wan
lee-tul writer.'' In 1965, his Broadway success as the sloppy,
divorced sportswriter Oscar Madison threw his career into high
gear. Onstage, Matthau played the role against Art Carney. In the
1968 ``Odd Couple'' film, his uptight alter ego was Jack Lemmon.
They had worked together before. Matthau won an Oscar playing the
shyster lawyer brother-in-law of Lemmon's injured TV cameraman in
Billy Wilder's icepick-sharp ``The Fortune Cookie'' (1966).
</P>
<P>
   The tinge of misanthropy in that role completed Matthau's comic
persona. Although they never billed themselves as such, he and
Lemmon became one of film's great comedy teams. In those two films,
in ``The Front Page'' (1994), in three ``Grumpy Old Men'' films
from 1995 to 1997, and in ``The Odd Couple II'' (1998), their
interplay was the stuff of film's classic comedy teams _ Laurel and
Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Hope and Crosby, Martin and Lewis _
with Lemmon playing the prissy superego vainly attempting to impose
control on the messy ambulatory id, done to such perfection by
Matthau, who extended his cantankerousness to the role of an
old-timer refusing to go quietly to pasture in a film Lemmon
directed, ``Kotch'' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   In all, they collaborated in 11 films. They appeared in ``The
Grass Harp'' (1995), directed by Matthau's son, Charlie, but did
not have scenes together. Both did the movie to give Charlie
Matthau's career a boost.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath his armor of wise-guy humor, there was a warm, smiling
side to Matthau that seldom made it to the screen. But it did
surface in his wise, kindly old father figure in ``The Grass
Harp.'' As soon as he acquired clout in the early '70s, Matthau
made a point of doing certain projects simply for enjoyment. In
``Earthquake'' (1974), he had fun contributing a cameo as a drunk
at a bar, mugging outrageously, using in the credits the name he
was born with: Walter Matuschanskayasky.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorites among his films was ``Hopscotch'' (1980), a
spy thriller costarring Glenda Jackson. He liked it because it
allowed his character, Charlie Dark, to succeed with his wits, not
bullets and explosions, and because he insisted on _ and got away
with _ having his favorite composer, Mozart, on the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-3, Matthau was taller than he appeared on screen, and
walked with a bit of a slouch, which of course fed into his comic
persona. It wasn't conscious, he once told this writer. It was
because he arrived at his full height early and felt self-conscious
at school. Because he so often played loosely wrapped, vinegary
characters, his pinpoint timing and technical skill as a physical
farceur were generally overlooked, or insufficiently credited.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a thoroughly forgettable film, such as ``Dennis the
Menace'' (1993), his disguised grace at dodging the falling objects
crashing down around his head, as the arch-tyke systematically
demolished the world of Matthau's Mr. Wilson, remains an object
lesson for actors. In later years, Matthau enjoyed incorporating a
disheveled look into roles as Einstein in ``I.Q.'' (1994) and the
fictionalized screenwriter father of Nora and Delia Ephron in
``Hanging Up'' (2000). Although his crochetyness precluded begging
for audience approval, Matthau will be remembered as a beloved
actor. Everyone has a favorite Matthau movie. Mine is ``A New
Leaf'' (1970). He plays a dissolute playboy of impeccable taste who
marries Elaine May's mess of a millionairess, planning to murder
her for her money. Comedy is timing. Matthau made me laugh every
time he'd wait an extra beat, staring in cold, deadpan disgust at
May's newest escalation of disarray, convincing us he was wondering
if even the prospect of a fat inheritance was worth enduring her.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Nothing messes with a person's mind quite like money.
</P>
<P>
   Too much of it, not enough, fear of losing it, the compulsion to
squander it, the dread of being hated for having it, negative
parental messages about managing it _ or not managing it _ and a
thousand other psychological pitfalls have been trapping man since
he invented a monetary system.

   ``It's OK at a cocktail party to say how much you made on XYZ
stock, but it's not OK to say how much you lost, and it's not OK to
talk about your personal finances,'' says Richard Geist, president
of the Institute of Psychology and Investing in Waban, Mass. and a
pyschologist at Harvard Medical School. He counsels individuals on
their money troubles and works with investment firms on the
psychology of risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is emotional,'' he says. ``It's power, self-esteem,
control, authority. The family that never talks about money makes
it secretive and negative. People grow up with these emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Geist and a growing number of psychologists and financial
planners are helping people draw out those emotions while also
helping them draw up a budget. They are trying to close the gap
between the spiritual and the monetary, teaching people to see
money as not merely ``the day job'' or the accumulating pension
that will lead to fulfillment in retirement, but as a tool for
doing what's meaningful to them now.
</P>
<P>
   The field has been coming into its own since the mid-'90s,
expanding along with the economic boom and the mounting pressures
people feel to be smart about money. A survey last year by the
Certified Financial Board of Standards _ the professional
organization that sets standards for the financial planning
industry _ found that 42 percent of American consumers are worriers
who fret over their financial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking `What is your life about? What do you need to be
fulfilled?' '' explains George Kinder, a guru of the movement and
author of the book ``The Seven Stages of Money Maturity.'' He
teaches Buddhism and is cofounder of the Nazrudin Project, a
national organization of 150 financial planners that takes its name
from a character in the teaching stories of the Sufis, the mystic
branch of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Kinder gets down to the basics quickly, asking clients three
questions: 1. If you had all the money you'd ever need, how would
you live? 2. If you had five to 10 years left to live, what would
you do with your life? 3. If you had 24 hours to live, what would
you regret not having done?
</P>
<P>
   Then he probes the reasons why people aren't following their
hearts' desires, or why they may be unconsciously sabotaging it _
buying a convertible, say, as a reward for sticking with a
well-paying but frustrating job when what they really want to do is
paint or sing or run an inn.
</P>
<P>
   His ``seven stages'' begin with exploring belief systems
instilled in childhood, working through the pain of trying to hang
on to those beliefs, and then moving onto knowledge, understanding,
``vigor'' _ achieving one's goals _ vision, and ``aloha,'' or
kindess shown to one's fellow man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like peeling back the layers of a psychological onion,''
says Gayle Colman, a Nazrudin member, who runs a financial planning
business with her husband, Richard.
</P>
<P>
   They are working with one client who grew up in what Colman
describes as a ``feast or famine atmosphere'' because the family
squandered whatever money came in. ``Consequently my client lives
an incredibly frugal life,'' Colman explains. ``He is paralyzed by
fear that he may have to live in an impoverished state.
Intellectually he hears what I'm saying but emotionally he's
feeling great fear. So we have to go back and relive those
emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   For one married couple seeing the Colmans, the issue was facing
reality. They were blowing through a trust fund as if it were water
and avoiding the obviously sinking bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The financial problem was that they had left high-paying jobs to
start a sporting goods business but were keeping up the lifestyle
of a two-career couple.
</P>
<P>
   The psychological problem behind the behavior was that the
husband had grown up in a wealthy family and never learned to
manage money, while the wife grew up watching every penny. So he
assumed money would always be there no matter what he did, while
she felt entitled to spend freely after all those years of
skimping. The combination nearly drained a $650,000 fund, as they
bought a $400,000 home, paid for the wife's graduate education at
Harvard, and enrolled the children in private school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another six months and it would have been gone,'' says the
wife, 39. She and her husband are now on a strict budget, giving
themselves each a $50 weekly personal spending allowance. They
balance the checkbook every month _ something they never used to do
_ and are letting the trust fund accumulate for their retirement
and their children's college education. They moved out of the
$400,000 house, downsizing to one costing $100,000 in a nearby
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped the train before the train wreck,'' says the wife.
``We learned a lot about ourselves and what's important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   A computer company manager, 35, felt ``like a piece of raw meat
in a pool of piranhas'' when the high-tech firm he worked for sold
for $70 million and he instantly became a multimillionaire. ``I
needed financial advice but didn't know who to trust.'' He and his
wife found the Colmans through a friend and thought the
psychological approach ``felt right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that there is a link between money and psychology was
new to me,'' he explains, noting that George Kinder's book opened
the door to Eastern religions and meditation. ``I had subscribed to
all the money magazines, but nothing really talks about the
holistic approach: 99.99 percent of the noise about money today is
about the mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife are learning that she has a distrust of people
with money _ her father, a construction worker, always said rich
people never broke a sweat or earned a dime. The couple is working
through the possibilities of setting up a foundation, supporting
existing charities, or doing something else profound with the money
that has changed their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money can enable you to follow a higher purpose,'' he says.
``But it's a daunting task trying to figure out what the hell that
is.''
</P>
<P>
   When Christopher Mogil inherited a family fortune, he formed a
support group in Philadelphia. He now runs another called More Than
Money in Arlington, Mass. The organization helps people network and
explore philanthropic projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will be sympathetic to the problems you experience if
you have money,'' says Mogil. ``You're in a society that judges you
by the work you do and you're not working. Dating can be difficult.
Is the person interested in me or my money? It does change
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Mogil has plumbed the messages he got about money when growing
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was from a family where my father's side struggled and my
mother's side was flush. My father's side always judged the other
side as selfish. My mother's side always blamed my father's side
for not having money. And both sides were trying to be middle class
when they weren't _ they were wealthy and working class.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he has learned to be ``honest and upfront with people
and not hide who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Pearne, a clinical psychologist who has been a wealth
counselor for 20 years and also deals with people of moderate
means, says: ``This is the decade we will learn to talk about
money.'' The reasons: the economy, the need for people to be smart
about retirement planning as companies and the government do less,
and the amount of wealth that will change hands in the next 10 to
15 years _ more than $10 million will be inherited by the baby boom
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is the last taboo,'' he says. ``In the '60s and '70s we
learned to talk about sex. In the '80s and '90s we learned to talk
about death. Now it's money. That which is not talked about gains
power within us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudden wealth, he says, can ``destroy lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your feelings toward the person who bequeathed you the money
shape how you handle it. If you are angry at your parents you may
go on binge spending, act out, or develop a cocaine addiction.
Money represents parental control.''
</P>
<P>
   He has seen people so afraid they are going to lose their money
or make a bad investment decision that they put it into a CD or
savings account for years, and they consequently do lose a fortune
in potential stock earnings or interest.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, he has seen ``the stock-market obsessed,'' who check
their holdings every hour. ``It's like a video-game addiction,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Carter, who runs MoneySense, a financial counseling
service in Newburyport, Mass., defines five types of personalities:
money-mindless, money-deserving, money-balanced, money-fearful, and
money-obsessed. The first forgets to pay bills, doesn't remember
what lunch cost, and usually has been raised to feel he or she
(often she) shouldn't have to deal with all that.
</P>
<P>
   The money-deserving person feels entitled and can be either
financially savvy or a spendthrift. Carter describes one such
client as ``a 3-year-old in the room screaming for a lollipop.''
The balanced person has perspective on dollar signs, while the
fearful person thinks about money all the time, and the obsessed
can't function because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is connected to our worth, to what we think we deserve,
and to how much we are loved,'' says Carter. ``It's convoluted
between need and want, and consequently piques all the emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter notes how a woman had called that day to say she left two
of her children out of her will. The woman has seven children and
is leaving her estate only to five. ``Now, what does
(itals)that(unitals) say?'' Carter asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to make money sane,'' she says. ``You've got to look at
your own demons and then try to move into balance.''

<P>
   He's affluent enough to live in a Weston neighborhood where the
houses cost at least $1 million, but Dennis Saylor couldn't bear to
fork over $30 to hire someone to haul his old refrigerator to the
basement.
</P>
<P>
   So the 44-year-old lawyer rented a dolly for $20, spent three
hours on the job, and ultimately bruised his cheekbone and arms
when the appliance nearly toppled onto him. Still, the refrigerator
got to the basement, and Saylor has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I earned as much as Bill Gates, there was no way I was
going to pay to have someone move that refrigerator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists might label Saylor's refrigerator ordeal a ``mental
accounting error,'' a bad choice in the persistent
time-versus-money calculation. Psychologists could say he was
reflecting deep ambivalence about the signs of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Others would call him just plain cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, more and more Americans these days cling to
certain frugal habits, even as they enjoy a creeping sense of
affluence in this prosperous economy. While they indulge in
luxuries in many areas of their life, many skimp in others, often
irrationally pursuing metered parking spots in downtown Boston
while driving a new Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   What motivates them?
</P>
<P>
   These selective tightwads say it's partly about money and partly
about personal identity. For them, it's refusing to jump full force
into this society's materialistic mania, especially if they have
impressionable children. It's a yearning to retain some
penny-pinching ways, such as changing the oil in a car, sewing on a
button, or fighting, on principle, a $2 overcharge on a bill.
</P>
<P>
   It's also about clinging to old habits, often inherited from
their parents, that are rooted in the belief that self-sufficiency
and thriftiness are virtues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my frugality I inherited from my upbringing,'' said
Scott Schoen, 42, who insists on mowing his own large lawn in
Franklin, Mass., even as his wife pleads with him to hire someone.
``I grew up with five boys in the family, and we cut our own lawn.
My father would have thought it was horrible to pay someone to cut
your lawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoen acknowledges that it makes little economic sense to chain
himself to his lawn mower most Saturdays. As a dual-income couple
(he's a downtown lawyer with a six-figure salary; she's a full-time
teacher), the Schoens could easily afford whatever it costs to hire
a local teenager for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Just how many people fall into this category is hard to
determine. Not wanting to look like tightwads, they are often
quiet, even secretive, about where they draw the line. And national
studies on frugality are often unreliable, as Americans like to
report being frugal, even when they really don't act that way.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of Americans report that they are frugal,
according to a study by Arizona State University marketing
professor John Lastovicka.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just wishful thinking, Lastovicks said. After all,
the nation's credit card debt is at an all-time high, and the
national savings rates often dropped into negative numbers last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, researchers who study American spending say there always
has been a sizable minority of people who retain some frugal
habits, no matter how their incomes grow, and it's a group that
sticks out when times are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are holding back in a general environment of
upscaling,'' said Juliet Schor, a Harvard economist and author of
``The Overspent American.'' ``Their spending habits are part of
their personal identity. It's unsettling to change everything. By
retaining certain habits, it gives them a sense of continuity about
who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ryan, a psychology professor at the University of
Rochester, N.Y., said he knows men who insist on repairing their
cars or drinking cheap beer because it reminds them of ``their
buddies from high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Therapists say people who are frugal tend to share traits such
as an upbringing in which their parents associated money with
security and independence, rather than pleasure. (Of course, some
people react against their parents, so frugal parents can raise
free-spending children.)
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists say children as young as 4 are influenced by their
parents' tight or loose approaches to money.
</P>
<P>
   Many people regard frugality as a sign of intelligence, and they
are particularly galled when they feel cheated, no matter what the
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Brown, a prosperous apartment landlord with a reputation
for thriftiness, said he recently complained to a waitress at a
pancake house about being charged an extra $1.75 for Vermont maple
syrup. He was never told about the charge in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're overcharged, it's like an invasion of your common
sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated areas of frugality may seem chintzy or charming, but
they can also be illogical. Richard Thaler, a University of Chicago
economist, said he once conducted a survey showing that when buyers
of a $35 clock radio were told that they could save $10 by driving
10 minutes to another store, most took the trip. But when buyers of
an $800 television were told they could buy the same set for $790
at a store 10 minutes away, they declined the cost-saving trip.
</P>
<P>
   That decision reflects an irrational choice, a ``mental
accounting error,'' Thaler said. He said people should have
determined whether ``10 minutes of time was worth $10 or not,'' as
opposed to making a decision on the percentage savings on the total
price.
</P>
<P>
   Any calculation of such modest sums is unseemly to some people.
While puritanical America used to regard frugality as a good trait,
it turned into a negative one beginning in the 1950s, said Sheldon
Garon, a Princeton University historian who is writing a book about
frugality.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the '50s that this country began economic policies
encouraging consumer spending, with cheap imports, easy credit, and
loans, Garon said. The spendthrift was portrayed as more glamorous,
more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he maintains, there's a minority who continue in the
Puritan tradition of associating frugality with sound moral values.
That tradition may also fuel the voluntary simplicity movement, in
which Americans cut back their incomes and spending. Several
national surveys show that 10 to 25 percent of Americans are taking
some steps to cut back both earning and spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of showing that you have more virtue than others,''
Garon said.
</P>
<P>
   Jodi Hartley, a real estate executive and a grandmother, said
she enjoys her thriving income, but believes that frugality is a
way of showing that money can't be taken for granted. She said she
remembers when money was tight.
</P>
<P>
   Hartley still goes out of her way to avoid downtown parking
fees, and she plans to make a special trip to Bloomingdale's to
return a $66 pocketbook she said fell apart shortly after she
bought it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't get my money easily,'' she said. ``I earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Frugality can be taken to the extreme. Many psychologists cite
those who treat bargain-hunting like an obsession or even see
superstitious signs of good luck when they get a good buy. Philip
Levendusky, a McLean Hospital psychologist, said he thinks some
people play out their hard-wired aggressive instincts in the new
jungle of shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get a good deal, it's as if they won the battle,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   When does frugality become excessive? People who are selectively
frugal don't usually go to self-depriving extremes, but
psychologists say it could happen, particularly if cost-cutting is
used as a way to curb excessive guilt or anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists acknowledge, however, that they know a lot more
about obsessive spenders than obsessive savers. The reasons are
pretty obvious, said Cheryl Fellows, a clinical psychologist and
author of ``Dollars and Sense: The Psychology of Money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing that frugal people do is see a private
therapist,'' she said. ``It's expensive.''

ITEM PRICING GATHERS DUST FOR SOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever noticed the different retail philosophies of Home
Depot and CVS?
</P>
<P>
   When you go into a CVS to buy shaving cream, you find the price
marked on the can as well as on the shelf under the can. But when
you go into Home Depot to buy a package of light bulbs, the price
is only on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   By stamping prices on individual items in its stores, CVS is
complying with a regulation of the Massachusetts attorney general
that carries the force of law. Home Depot, which says the
regulation is too costly to implement and too prone to errors, is
flouting that law.
</P>
<P>
   CVS's approach is definitely more consumer friendly. It lets
shoppers identify prices more easily, compare prices away from the
shelf, and spot scanner errors right at the register. But it's one
of those things most consumers don't pay attention to unless
there's a problem. (I had a problem last week at Home Depot when I
bought a drain spout that had no price anywhere.)
</P>
<P>
   I've been agonizing about item-pricing lately because my sense
is that Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly's support for
item-pricing is wavering in the face of retail opposition.
Nationally, item-pricing's popularity seems to be waning, with only
a handful of states and municipalities still requiring prices on
individual store items. The question facing Massachusetts consumers
is whether we should join the national trend or buck it.
</P>
<P>
   We can thank Colman Herman for bringing the issue to the
public's attention. A frequent shopper at the Home Depot in Quincy,
Mass., he became annoyed at the company's disregard for the
item-pricing regulation and decided to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   He first asked Reilly's office to enforce its own regulation,
but no one there would listen to him. Reilly has never enforced the
regulation. His aides say they receive few complaints about it and
consider it a low priority.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Herman last September filed a complaint against Home
Depot's Quincy store in small claims court. He won, but Home Depot
shrugged off the $25 fine. So Herman filed another complaint this
year and when the case was transferred to Quincy District Court he
scored another victory.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mark S. Coven has ordered Home Depot's Quincy store to
start item pricing by Aug. 16. Home Depot is appealing. The
retailer is not claiming it is in compliance with the law, rather
that Herman was improperly acting as a private attorney general and
Coven was exceeding his authority. The retailer has made no secret
of the fact that it hopes to win on appeal before it has to start
item pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Home Depot's attorney pressed Coven for a stay of his
compliance order, arguing Herman would not be injured by waiting
until the appeal is heard. ``That's because you don't believe in
the validity of this regulation,'' a testy Coven snapped back,
denying the request.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed by Herman's success, Timothy J. Shea, chief of
Reilly's public protection bureau, sent a letter to Home Depot in
late May saying the attorney general would support Herman on
appeal. He also directed the chain to bring all of its
Massachusetts stores into compliance, a request Home Depot has
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Shea's letter didn't sound like he was wedded to item pricing.
He said the regulation is the law until it's changed and invited
Home Depot to suggest changes. Home Depot declined comment last
week, but the Retail Association of Massachusetts says it is
working on a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate that we have an attorney general here that
recognizes that there are some antiquated laws that need to be
updated,'' said Jon Hurst, president of the retail association.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst said item pricing was enacted in Massachusetts in the
early 1970s, a time when there were no scanners and check-out
personnel needed help keeping track of prices. Today, Hurst said,
marking prices on individual items only increases the potential for
pricing errors. And he said item pricing takes personnel away from
customer service functions and drives up retail costs as well as
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Downey, district manager for Home Depot, said in an
affidavit it would cost the chain $250,000 a year per store to
comply with the item-pricing regulation and deplete an already
understaffed sales force. ``Eventually this will harm Home Depot's
customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reilly, Herman says he is amenable to changes in the
item-pricing regulation as long as consumers are protected.
``Consumers have to have an easy, effective means when they're
checking out to make sure what they're being charged is what the
item is priced at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Reilly will adopt that same view is unclear. What is
clear is that Reilly is not as big a fan of item pricing as
Attorney General Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, who not only
supports that state's item-pricing law but aggressively enforces
it.
</P>
<P>
   She and her predecessor have sued such retailers as Kmart, Sears
&AMP; Roebuck, Staples, Wal-Mart and, yes, even Home Depot for failing
to comply with the state's item-pricing law.
</P>
<P>
   Chris DeWitt, spokesman for Granholm, said Michigan residents
love the item-pricing law. He said it allows consumers to determine
whether they were overcharged, which surveys indicate is fairly
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've brought a lot of public attention to this issue,''
DeWitt said. ``This is one of the most, if not the most, popular
consumer laws in Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Long-distance options
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reader reaction to last week's column on long-distance
alternatives was heavy. Some didn't like my attitude, others did,
and many sent in their own long-distance suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Several people said they did not like BigZoo.com as much as
Marianne Stevenson, who I quoted. Their chief complaint was busy
signals getting through to the toll-free number for the
3.9-cents-a-minute prepaid service. ``The phone calls might as well
be free if you can't make them when you want to,'' said James
Pringle.
</P>
<P>
   Other readers offered some very promising long-distance
suggestions. Jock Gill, for example, suggested www.erbia.com, which
is charging 5.9 cents a minute plus a 3 percent universal access
fee and what it calls a $1 Federal Communications Commission
charge. Sign up online or at 877-549-6001.
</P>
<P>
   John Strom suggested GTC Telecom, which he said charges 5 cents
a minute plus a universal service fee and other government charges.
GTC can be reached online at gtctelecom.com or at 800-486-4030.
</P>
<P>
   Elyse Greenberg likes USA Datanet, a long-distance service you
use by dialing a local-access number. It charges 10 cents a minute
but no more than 99 cents a call. It also has a 4.9-cent flat-rate
plan. USA Datanet can be reached at usadatanet.com or by calling
877-532-8263.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Waters sent me an e-mail suggesting several ways to get free

FOR INVESTORS, A TRIP TO NOWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since Geraldo ripped open Al Capone's vault have so many
been so worked up about so little.
</P>
<P>
   When mutual fund investors get their midyear statements over the
next few weeks, millions will notice an interesting thing: Not much
has happened. Lost amid the Wall Street histrionics is the fact
that a whole lot of people have portfolios that are worth about as
much now as they were New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few funds gained 7 percent in the first quarter, then
lost 6 percent in the second,'' said Kevin Parke, chief equity
officer for the Boston-based MFS fund family. ``Investors who owned
individual stocks might be down 50 or 60 percent, but the
volatility has been more of a wash for fund investors.''
</P>
<P>
   But, oh, what a trip to nowhere it's been.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first six months of 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index
has moved at least 2 percent in a single day more times than it did
in all of 1999. The technology-driven index has jumped or slumped
at least that much on more occasions this year, in fact, than it
did in the six combined years between 1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, technology funds gained 27.2 percent in February to
post their second-best month since researcher Morningstar Inc.
began tracking the sector 52 years ago. (The only better month came
in February 1968, when the ``sector'' consisted of two funds.)
</P>
<P>
   The new-economy funds gave it back in April and May, losing 13
percent each month, before rebounding in the latter half of June.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lipper Inc., science and technology funds ended the
second quarter on the upside by about 2.4 percent year to date.
</P>
<P>
   But go-go technology funds weren't the only ones to take
shareholders on a wild ride.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications funds gained an average of 12.7 percent in
the first quarter, then lost an average of 15.8 percent in the
second. Even diversified US growth funds rose 13.4 percent through
March 31, and fell 7.3 percent between then and June 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that a significant percentage of investors are
chasing performance, cycling in and out of funds and sectors every
time they hear a new tip,'' said Burt Greenwald, a fund industry
consultant in Philadelphia. ``Investor attention spans haven't been
reduced, they've collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but not every fund or sector has spent six months
treading water.
</P>
<P>
   Some performed fairly well in the first half of the year, though
the numbers don't necessarily sparkle next to the gargantuan
returns a handful of funds posted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The year's best peformer so far? Health and biotechnology funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That in spite of the election year, which is traditionally bad
for health-care stocks,'' said John Hancock investment strategist
Barry Evans, referring to politicians' quadrennial promises to
tinker with the system.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this point, the typical health-care fund was under
water by about 1 percent. This time around, the sector has crested
38.1 percent higher at mid-year than it began.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of natural resources funds, too, have been among the
few happy to see soaring prices for gasoline and natural gas. As
prices moved north, investment returns went with them.
</P>
<P>
   Funds in the sector have returned, on average, 14.4 percent so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the kind of year in which everybody is going to be
thrilled when they open those statements,'' said Jim Weiss, chief
stock strategist at State Street Research in Boston. ``In the
second quarter, especially, there were very few places to hide in
terms of getting positive results.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those places was State Street's own Global Resource fund,
which was the quarter's best performer, according to Lipper. The
fund, which focuses on small- and mid-cap energy companies around
the world, gained 28.3 percent in the second quarter and 45.2
percent during the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Dan Rice takes big risks to get those returns, though.
Global Resource topped the Lipper charts in 1997, returning more
than 70 percent, and slipped virtually to the bottom a year later,
shedding half its value.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very interesting quarter for Dan,'' Weiss said.
``Overall, however, the second quarter probably marked the first
time in a while that diversification paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts agree. After two years in which aggressive growth
and technology funds ruled the roost to the virtual exclusion of
all others, bond funds, value funds, and international funds showed
signs of life in the past three months. The only surprise is that
the laggards didn't come on stronger as investors mowed down growth
and technology funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was inevitable that at some point the pendulum would swing
differently,'' Greenwald said. ``I think the move back has started,
albeit slowly, and diversification will pay more and more going
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among managers interviewed by the Globe is that
the second half of the year will see the market stay at current
levels or move slightly higher, but with quite a bit of volatility.
Most also expect trading volume to remain relatively light, as many
investors stay on the sidelines waiting for a sign of things to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term mutual fund people use when there are no clear trends
is that it's a stock-picker's market,'' joked Evans, of John
Hancock. ``This market is going to muddle along for a while yet, so
you can expect to hear that term batted around a lot in the next
few weeks.''

LOVE AFFAIR WITH TECH STOCKS HAS COOLED, BUT IT'S FAR FROM OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're back _ at least part of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Left for dead a month ago, technology stocks have come back to
life faster than anyone imagined. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite
Index, at about 3900, is far below its peak of over 5000. But it is
well above the low point of 3200 it reached in late May.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive is the fact that some of the blue-chip names in
technology, like EMC Corp., are trading at or near their all-time
highs. For investors in these stocks, it's as if the nasty 40
percent slide in the Nasdaq never happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in awe,'' of the rebound, said Ned Riley, chief investment
strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   But the world has changed since March, when tech stocks first
began to tumble. Before March, tech stocks were like the children
in Lake Wobegon: They were all above average. As we enter the
second half of the year, investors are making sharp distinctions
between the best and the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about all the stocks with good earnings stories have come
back nicely,'' said Richard Skaggs, a portfolio manager with Loomis
Sayles. Among those that have held up reasonably well are household
names such as Cisco Systems, Oracle, and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Others that have survived more or less intact include some of
the hot new names in the infrastructure space _ companies like
Sycamore Networks or Juniper Networks or JDS Uniphase. These
companies don't necessarily make money, but they are growing fast
and investors have some confidence that they will be profitable in
the not too distant future.
</P>
<P>
   Before March, investors were willing to believe in any company
with a good story. Now they either want to see the money or have a
solid assurance that the money is coming.
</P>
<P>
   For more speculative companies, especially Internet companies,
that hard-nosed attitude has proved devastating. Consider the fate
of CMGI, the Andover company that has invested in dozens of
Internet start-ups. Since January, CMGI has lost 70 percent of it
value. The stock price of one of its subsidiaries, Engage, a young
online marketing company, is down 85 percent just since March.
</P>
<P>
   The well-publicized failure of some dot-coms, and the troubles
of big name companies like Amazon.com, have made investors
suspicious of money-losing Internet plays. Even the profitable
Internet companies such as Yahoo and AOL have been hurt by the
general fear that the retail side of the Internet may not be all it
was cracked up to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are reluctant to give big valuations to companies
with no earnings that may run into cash problems,'' said Steve
Demirjian, who manages money for Westfield Capital.
</P>
<P>
   But earnings or the lack of them don't fully explain the zigs
and zags in the technology market this year. The economic outlook
has played a role as well. In March, when the Nasdaq started to
fall, the US economy was growing like gangbusters and the Federal
Reserve clearly announced its intention to raise interest rates to
slow the economy down.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are bad for all stocks, but they can be
particularly lethal for stocks with very high price/earnings
ratios, a description that covers most technology stocks. The
reason: Higher rates make future earnings less valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the worries was the government's decision to push for
the breakup of Microsoft. The move had no immediate implications
for technology companies. But nervous investors reasoned that if
Microsoft could be a target, other successful technology companies
could be as well.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was the issue of valuations. The price of
technology stocks had reached record levels by March _ the Nasdaq
rose 86 percent in 1999 and another 24 percent in the first part of
this year. After a runup like that, some kind of correction was
probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, surveying the incredible rise and then fall in
technology stocks, Thomas O'Neill, chief investment officer at
FleetBoston Financial, said: ``I don't think in my lifetime we will
ever again see the level of speculation we have just seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the speculative excesses may have been washed out of the
market, but the love affair with tech stocks is far from over.
Mutual fund investors continue to put money into tech funds and
money managers continue to recommend tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the bullishness come from?
</P>
<P>
   Tech fans point to a few things. First and foremost, the
eocnomic picture has changed, at least a little. The US economy is
showing some signs of slowing, and the Federal Reserve last
Wednesday decided not to boost rates at its June meeting. The Fed
may yet raise rates again this year, but for the moment the
pressure is off.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy does slow, say analysts, old economy companies
are likely to feel the pinch as consumers cut back on purchases of
cars and houses. But the best new economy companies _ those
supplying the tools that will make corporate America more
productive _ will continue to do reasonably well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals in technology remain pretty darn good,'' said
Brian Grove, who manages money for Vaughan Nelson in Houston. Grove
isn't the only one who thinks so. If you had a nickel for every
analyst who is crowing about the fundamentals in technology, you
would be rich already.
</P>
<P>
   The tech bulls point out that, despite the ups and downs of the
stock market this year, the basic story in technology is
essentially unchanged: demand continues to be strong for
semiconductors, telecom equipment, wireless technology, and storage
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The best companies in those areas should grow rapidly in the
coming year, according to Rob Joseph, a technology specialist with
State Street Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth prospects for many companies look astonishingly
good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years recently, the fourth quarter has been a
strong one for tech stocks, in part because new products are
announced then. No one knows whether 2000 will see a repeat of that
pattern, but some money managers say there is plenty of cash
sitting on the sidelines ready to come in if a late year rally
breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   So what's not to like?
</P>
<P>
   A few things, say those who remain skeptical about the quick
rebound in technology stocks. At the top of the list is the Federal
Reserve. The Fed took no action last week, but said it would raise
rates again if the slowdown proves illusory.
</P>
<P>
   If rate hikes were a problem in the spring, is there a reason to
think they won't be a problem in the fall?
</P>
<P>
   A second potential problem is the dot-com failures. So far the
stock market is treating the dot-coms and the infrastructure
companies as if they come from two separate universes. In reality,
of course, the two are tightly interwoven. The dot-com companies
have been voracious customers of hardware, software, storage, and
consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   If the dot-coms get into trouble, won't their appetite for some
of those other products and services drop off?
</P>
<P>
   Fears of such a chain reaction hit Scient Corp. last week. The
San Francisco-based e-consulting firm said one of its dot-com
clients had filed for bankruptcy, an event that forced Scient to
set up a reserve to cover possible losses. Scient stock fell 20
percent in a day.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the valuation question. Technology stocks are
never cheap. But at this point, the blue chip names in technology _
Oracle, EMC, Cisco _ sell for price/earnings ratios of anywhere
from 90 to 120. The stock market as a whole has a price/earnings
ratio of 24. The higher the multiple, the greater the expectation
of future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's O'Neill says some of the prices on tech stocks are
approaching nosebleed territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, if you've had to pay 100 times earnings for a
company, it has been difficult to make good returns over time,''
said O'Neill. ``And God forbid, one of these companies should have
a major disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill is not surprised the Nasdaq has bounced off its low, but
he cautions against reading too much into the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there another low coming?'' he said. ``Very likely there
is.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it: Tech stocks are either wildly overvalued
or appropriately priced, a safe haven in an uncertain world or a
risky place to be.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you just love Wall Street?

THERE'S NO AVOIDING UNCERTAINTIES   PLANNING FOR RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. I have a question about the assumptions you use on spending
after retirement. When estimating retirement income, do you assume
that the reader wants to have enough money to pay his or her bills,
not be a burden to others, and die broke? Or do you assume the
reader wants to have enough money to establish an estate at least
the size of the principal available at retirement? Or something in
between? My wife and I have put one son through college at no
expense to him, and we are doing the same for the second. Our goal
is to have enough so that our sons will not have to support us, but
we are not specifically planning to set aside funds for an
inheritance. We expect in retirement that we will be spending not
only the interest earned, but a judicious amount of principal in
most years. Is my view consistent with your assumptions?
</P>
<P>
   B.K., Burlington, Vt. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If most of the people I have addressed on the subject of
retirement planning followed my suggestions, they would likely
leave fairly substantial estates. But this is not because of any
feeling that the next generation is likely to need a helping hand,
but rather because of the vast uncertainties involved in retirement
planning.
</P>
<P>
   The first, of course, is that nobody knows how long he will
live. Relying on life expectancy tables _ such as those used by the
IRS _ could land you in the soup. Suppose you carefully outline a
plan that would serve you until your mid-80s, and then lived
another decade? The financial implications could be painful.
</P>
<P>
   The second uncertainty is investment results. I try to be
realistic and conservative, but I have to remain aware that results
might be considerably lower than projected. (Remember the stock
market decade from 1968 to 1978? People who counted on a stock
market return of the go-go years of the mid-1960s were in tough
shape during those years.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, there's always the chance the future might bring
higher-than-anticipated levels of inflation. I have recently been
using a 3.5 percent figure _ a little higher than the 3 percent
suggested at the Merrill Lynch Web site where I go for these
calculations. But it is certainly far from unthinkable that
inflation might return to higher levels and perhaps stay there for
a long time. Even a small change can work out to big differences.
At 3.5 percent inflation, in 20 years you would need $99,489 to buy
what $50,000 buys today; crank the inflation-rate assumption up to
4 percent and you would need $109,556.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for many people, one of the biggest expenses in life
comes near the end _ high medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors lead me to seek a retirement plan that will
allow the retiree a certain amount of sponge _ and which will leave
his heirs a nice inheritance if everything goes better than it
might.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, my advice for someone who is seeking to leave the world
precisely as broke as when he entered it would be to make his
calculations by projecting a very long life and by setting aside
significant financial pools to deal with lower-than-expected
investment returns, higher-than-anticipated inflation levels, and
substantial unexpected expenses.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will reach age 70 1/2 in September and take my first
required distribution in December, so as to minimize the tax
burden. Our home and autos are paid for, and my pension and Social
Security provide enough income, so we don't need the additional
funds at this time. My original thought for the IRA distributions
was to establish a taxable account in each of the funds I am
currently using. But I have some concern with the funds,
particularly Washington Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   J.M., Orange, Calif. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think your plan is solid and would suggest you take a
longer view of the results of Washington Mutual Investors.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of your projected distribution is correct. Although
you could delay your first mandatory withdrawal into the tax year
2001, it would remain the distribution for tax year 2000 _ and then
you would have to take a second distribution for tax year 2001 in
the same year. Taking two distributions in one year would have
unpleasant tax consequences for most people.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual Investors is doing just what it has been doing
for years _ investing in large-cap value-oriented stocks, sticking
with its bets, and producing low turnover. Its current
price-to-earnings ratio is 22.6, and its portfolio shows an average
price-to-book value ratio of 5.4. While its payout level is only
1.79 percent, that is more a function of a stock market that has
sent prices so high that most stock portfolio yields have become
negligible.
</P>
<P>
   What has been happening is simply that value investment is
thoroughly out of fashion. Washington Mutual's results have
reflected those of most value funds. When you look at its 1.8
percent year-to-date loss entering last week, you'll find it in
line with the median 1.7 percent loss for its peer funds in the
large-cap value group. Despite a one-year return of a negative 8.2
percent (compared to a 4 percent loss as the median for its peers),
the fund's three-year record of 10.4 percent average annual return
compares nicely to the 8.8 percent for its peer group.
</P>
<P>
   I can understand the frustration of value investors looking at
the greener grass over in the growth pasture where the bulls have
been grazing. I am one of those value investors. But market
fashions always change, and when I consider the 35.5
price-to-earnings ratio of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index, and
the yields of the funds that track that index only slightly better
than 1 percent, the value territory looks mighty good to me. I
suggest you stick with Washington Mutual Investors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We hold some stocks that have dividend reinvestment plans. So
far, I have not subscribed because I felt it was unwise to have
fractions of stocks. Mostly I have 100, 200, 300, or 400 shares of
a company. What problems might I encounter by owning fractional
shares?
</P>
<P>
   O.B., El Cajon, Calif. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't see any real problem. Dividend reinvestment plans, or
DRIPs, do indeed allow participants to hold fractional shares. Many
people allow shares to build up in a DRIP until they have more than
100 shares in the plan, then ask that they be sent a certificate
for a 100-share round lot of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, some plans have added a feature that allows
stockholders to mail their certificates to the institutions
managing the DRIP, thus putting all of their holdings in the DRIP.
This not only solves problems of safe storage of the certificates,
but gives the owner the ability to sell the shares either without
paying a brokerage commission or at a cost that's lower than a
broker's fee might be. (Though it's only fair to add that when you
sell DRIP shares, you can't be sure what price they will bring at
the date at which the DRIP managers make their purchases and
sales.)
</P>
<P>
   If you hold fractional shares in a DRIP and decide to withdraw
from the plan, you can either instruct the DRIP to sell the stock
or issue you a certificate for the number of full shares you own.
They will then sell any fractional shares you own and send you a
check for the value of the fractional share.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the uncertainty of a sale price, the only
disadvantages I can see to using DRIPs are minor for most
investors. One is that you cannot use the stock in the account as
security for a loan, as you can do with shares for which you hold
the certificates. Another is that if you borrow money from your
broker to buy stocks, the larger the value of the stocks being held
in your account by your broker, the smaller the chance you might
face a margin call if one of the stocks bought on margin runs into
trouble. For conservative long-term investors, these disadvantages
should loom very small.

DIAMONDS REDEFINED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the 20th century, a woman who wanted diamonds usually
had to find a man first. Today, she just looks for a good jeweler.
</P>
<P>
   Not as romantic, but, then, what is in this can-do, no-nonsense
techno-millennium?
</P>
<P>
   The rock purchased solo supposedly still makes the heart sing,
and that song still echoes Marilyn's classic number in ``Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes'' _ but today she's singing it in a business suit
while hefting a briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   She's a dot-comer, banker, executive, doctor, or professor, and
the jewelry trade refers to her as a ``self-purchaser'' _ the
hottest trend breathing on the glass cases across America.
</P>
<P>
   ``A diamond has traditionally been associated with getting
hitched,'' says a single, 49-year-old Boston woman who owns her own
business and purchased two sets of diamond earrings at Shreve,
Crump &AMP; Low _ one for $3,000 and one for $5,000. ``There's a sense
of power, money, and validation attached to the diamond, and in
today's world we women validate ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg DiStefano, manager of the Diamond Information Center in New
York, reports that the US self-purchase market was $3.75 billion
last year, representing 6.7 million pieces of diamond jewelry sold
to women, a 41 percent increase over 1998. According to a national
survey, women spent an average of $585 on diamond jewelry for
themselves last year, up from $430 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   He says nearly 40 percent of the self-purchase market is diamond
rings for the right hand, and that mostly married women are buying
them. Single women are leaning more toward tennis bracelets and
earrings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have more money at their disposal than they used to,''
says DiStefano, adding that the diamond has moved beyond the heavy
symbolism of a love relationship to become ``a hot fashion item''
featured on couture runways and magazine spreads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women in my generation were so reticent about everything,''
says Phyllis Godwin, owner of Granite City Electric in Quincy,
Mass., who inherited most of her fine jewelry from her mother but
who enjoys making the occasional purchase of a new piece.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, when she wanted diamond stud earrings, she felt
she had to wait for her husband to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were too small, and I took them back,'' she says.
``That's how women got what they wanted back then _ by exchanging
what the man picked out. Today, if you're a young woman with
financial capability you march right into Tiffany's and buy
whatever you damn please. There's a sense of instant
gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lebowitz, diamond buyer at Shreve, Crump &AMP; Low,
understands gratification. He leans on the case containing a
$22,500 diamond ring and smiles. ``The woman customer wants to be
wooed and schmoozed. She wants the experience. She wants to be
admired, fussed over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like she might be a little wistful for the old days when
she came in with a guy. Could it be that all the independent
purchasing is a little like bowling alone? Or is that heresy this
deep into feminism?
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are showing men how powerful they are as managers,''
Lebowitz continues, pointing to the store's popular precious stone
rings _ rubies, emeralds, and sapphires set with diamonds and
selling for $5,000 to just under $40,000. ``Buying diamonds shows
how powerful women are as consumers. It says to business and
personal relations: `I've made it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but are they happy? And what is happiness?
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought the fur coat, the house, and the car,'' says the
Boston businesswoman with two pairs of diamond earrings. ``What's
left? The diamond.''
</P>
<P>
   How do the earrings make her feel? ``Put together,'' she says.
``I can wear them with jeans or a full-length gown. You feel like
you've arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   But for how long? And is a diamond really forever, or is it
another temporary gratification? What, as the man said, do women
really want?

PRIVATE MONEY MANAGEMENT IS BROUGHT TO THE NOT-SO-RICH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Private money management, once an exclusive service for those
with at least half a million dollars, is now available to anyone
with a mere $50,000 to $100,000 and an Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is bringing down minimum account sizes and making the
world of money managers less of a private preserve for the really
rich or institutional investors. Now the simply well-to-do
individual can get in on the game.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Internet address for private money managers _
www.myMoneyPro.com _ launched last week and promises to offer
services ``at historically low account minimums,'' beginning at
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's access to the best money managers in the country,'' said
Viggy Mokkarala, vice president of marketing for the Sunnyvale,
Calif.-based Internet company that premiered Monday.
</P>
<P>
   MyMoneyPro.com joins such other sites as www.WrapManager.com and
www.RunMoney.com. These sites offer between just over a dozen to
more than 100 money managers with whom they have relationships, out
of a universe of thousands of such managers.
</P>
<P>
   There are also Web sites set up by some of the individual money
management firms themselves. And there are sites that rate the
managers and provide details and contact information for them, such
as www.ManagerReview.com and www.NelNet.com.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in Web sites relating to private money managers
parallels the increase in assets in individually managed accounts.
Between 1998 and 1999, assets under management in such accounts
grew $97 billion, to $425 billion, according to statistics released
in February by the Washington-based Money Management Institute, a
national trade association.
</P>
<P>
   But private money managers, whether visited online or off, still
may not be for everyone who meets what seems to be an ever-dropping
minimum account size. Some people who have enough to join the
private club may opt out because they're happy with their mutual
funds, or they may know how to successfully manage their money
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the chief reasons the well-to-do seek out a money
manager: Tax planning, individual investment advice, and special
attention that only money can buy. But perhaps the biggest reason
the wealthy opt for a privately managed account over an actively
managed mutual fund held in a taxable account _ control over
capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   In a mutual fund, everyone's money is pooled together, and the
fund manager's buy and sell decisions are made without
consideration for an individual shareholder's tax situation.
</P>
<P>
   In an individually managed account, the private money manager
buys and sells individual securities on behalf of the well-to-do
client, usually with the aim of minimizing what may already be a
hefty tax bill. The private money manager typically gets
compensated with a certain percentage of the money under
management, at a rate that can be equivalent to or less than the
cost of investing in a mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has a substantial amount of money and who needs a
level of service beyond what they can get with a mutual fund would
probably be using a money manager,'' said Peter Walker, publisher
of Money Manager Review, which analyzes the performance of
thousands of private managers and offers both a print and online
subscription. Walker's Web site, www.ManagerReview.com, provides a
lot of free information about individual managers and the money
manager hiring process but allows only paid subscribers access to
the detailed performance and rating data.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a summary of some of the Internet sites relating to
private money management:
</P>
<P>
   --www.myMoneyPro.com: A banner headline on this site proclaims
``Our Top Independent Money Managers,'' but they're not necessarily
number one and they're not rated by myMoneyPro.com. Rather,
according to the Web site's press material, the management firm
``must have delivered sustained performance in the top 25 percent
when compared with its peers during the previous three to five
years, according to national ratings services'' such as Money
Manager Review or Nelson Investment Management Network. To view the
managers, their investment philosophies, and other details, you
need to register and get an access code.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 money managers who have so far signed up with
myMoneyPro.com are also not personally handling the accounts for
investors who register through the Web site. Rather, they are
``subadvisers'' who share their model portfolio with the Internet
company, which then constructs an investor's portfolio according to
the model of the particular money manager the investor picks. The
investor can customize the portfolio, however, by giving special
instructions about particular investments or tax concerns to
myMoneyPro.com.
</P>
<P>
   An account is set up in an investor's name through Fidelity
Investments. Fees range from as low as 1.05 percent to as high as
3.5 percent, depending on the account size and the money manager
you pick. There are additional flat fees for changing money
managers in less than a year and for accounts under $100,000.
MyMoneyPro.com shares some of its fees with the money managers, but
otherwise does not compensate them. The managers do not pay the
Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Mokkarala, vice president of marketing, said in an interview in
Boston days before the site's launch, ``we're not about to give you
100 choices and send your brain into a freeze.'' Rather, he said,
``The money manager partners of ours we choose very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   --www.WrapManager.com: To view the ``over 55 top tier,
professional money managers'' available through this site, you need
to register or open an account. At the time of this review,
however, there were some glitches trying to submit a registration
or open an account _ a prompt asked for more information, but there
was no field in which to put that material. As a result, access to
data about the ``top tier'' money managers was denied. But the
site, a registered affiliate of The Investment Center, Inc., in New
Jersey, did reveal to all visitors that the minimum account size is
$100,000 and the ``all-inclusive fee'' is 1.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --www.RunMoney.com: Launched in May ``Because Wall Street is No
Place for Pedestrians,'' this site also requires a minimum $100,000
investment, but its annual ``all-inclusive fee'' ranges from 1
percent to 1.5 percent, depending on the size of the account. While
the most detailed information is reserved for those who register,
the casual visitor to this site can find out more information than
at myMoneyPro.com or WrapManager.com, such as some basics about the
120 portfolio managers available here and a comparison of mutual
funds and individually managed accounts from a fee and tax basis.
The neatest feature is a ``Mutual Fund Buster'' that allows you to
enter your mutual fund holdings, then calculates how much more in
taxes and fees you'll pay over 20 years in those funds compared
with an investment in a similarly styled individually managed
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   --www.ManagerReview.com and www.NelNet.com: If money is no
object, and you can afford the usual $500,000 or higher minimum
account sizes for the best private money managers as rated by Money
Manager Review or Nelson Investment Management Network, you can
check out the rating services at these Web addresses. Some of the
information about the managers is available for free, but the more
detailed data usually requires a paid subscription.

Within four hours, 500 people had clicked on the posting. Within a

 &HT;    AOL tunes up downloadable music
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Want to see the future of the Internet? Keep an eye on
Bob Pittman, America Online's president and chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of the AOL/Time Warner merger vote, Pittman, 46,
has become one of the most influential figures in both old and new
media. The decisions he'll make at America Online will have an
impact on nearly everyone who picks up a magazine, watches TV, goes
to a movie or logs on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Media insiders will remember Pittman as the man who helped
develop MTV and VH1, the wildly popular cable music channels.
</P>
<P>
   He joined AOL in 1996 with a plan to use his knowledge of TV
programming to create channels and ``programming'' for the online
service.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman also came to AOL to transform the online service's
business model. Ripping another page from his television
background, he moved AOL from a subscription-based business model
to one that included advertising, marketing and electronic
commerce. The combination was and still is so successful that
almost all other Internet service providers _ including the No. 2
ISP, Atlanta-based EarthLink _ now consider it a key component of
their business strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman has expanded his vision to include delivering AOL on any
device from the traditional PC to pagers and television. He also
sees a world where AOL users can watch movies and download music
right on the service.
</P>
<P>
   Charging for digital music downloads could be the one place
where Pittman will make his biggest impression on the Internet
economy. Last week, AOL took its first step toward selling music
online, making a deal with InterTrust Technologies that will let
AOL members download digital music for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of trying to figure out how to
commercialize digital downloading,'' said AOL spokeswoman Wendy
Goldberg. The technology will be included in AOL version 6.0 due
out this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the billion-dollar question that artists, record
companies and Internet companies dearly want to answer is whether
AOL customers will be willing to purchase music online _ no matter
how easy it is to do.
</P>
<P>
   Talal Shamoon, senior vice president for media at InterTrust,
said America Online's 22 million-plus subscriber base would be the
ideal setting to launch a secure version of Napster, the widely
used system for swapping music files.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, through its various partners and the seemingly limitless
resources of the Time Warner family of media products, could offer
a stunning range of incentives that could include everything from
concert tickets to a free month of HBO.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are limitless, and if anyone can figure out a
way to persuade listeners to pay for music on the Net, the odds are
pretty good it's Pittman. After all, who would have thought back in
1981 that people would be willing to sit and watch a channel that
then consisted of nothing but music videos 24 hours a day?
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be at the threshold of something very big,'' Shamoon
told The Wall Street Journal. ``A robust electronic community of
people exchanging content in a safe way, where rights holders get
paid and consumers feel good about the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether that ``something very big'' actually materializes is
entirely up to Pittman, and it's hard to find a pundit who doesn't
believe Pittman is this century's P.T. Barnum _ the kind of
businessman who instead of selling things you don't want, persuades
you to buy things you had absolutely no idea you wanted.
</P>
<P>
   His business skills Hollywood media connections and marketing
genius create a rare set of talents, combining ``old economy''
horse trading with ``new economy'' innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Mark Stavish, head of personnel for AOL, put it best when
he told the Sunday Times of London, ``People say AOL exists because
of Steve (Case, AOL's founder and chief executive), but it works
because of Bob.''

 &HT;    And now for the news
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Well, folks, there's some good news and some
bad news. You'll have to decide for yourself which is which.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has gone home...but...the auto-hysterical cousin
Marisleysis is still shedding public tears. Lincoln-Marti, the
private school Elian attended while he was in Miami has hung a
plaque in his old classroom and intends to have an Elian museum in
place by August to display the work he did during the estimated 100
days he was enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves big-mouth pitcher, John Rocker, split open a
callous on his thumb and had to watch from the bullpen as the Mets
stomped all over his team. It could have been worse...he could have
had to take the 7 train to the ballpark and sit next to some of
those folks he's been trashing lately.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Mayor Rudy has asked the natives not to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Mars is looking wetter all the time and the guys with the
satellites and telescopes are telling us that maybe there's some
water frozen under there, and maybe there's life on the red planet
after all.
</P>
<P>
   And MAYBE Orson Welles was right.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, and his long-time
lady love, Camilla Parker Bowles, have finally appeared together at
an official function. They hosted a fundraiser for the Prince's
Foundation, the group that oversees Charles's environmental and
architectural projects. Their recent photo in U.S.News &AMP; World
Report showed them all dressed up and, for a change, with somewhere
to go.
</P>
<P>
   His Highness was in black tie, Camilla wore Versace _ but it was
nothing like the oddity of the same label almost worn by Jennifer
Lopez to the Grammy awards. Ms. Parker Bowles's gown was palest
pink and covered the fair lady's charms nicely. And she didn't look
one bit like a Rottweiler.
</P>
<P>
   This whole romance thing between Charles and Camilla has had
little impact on my life. The way I see it, they've been at it a
long time and should by now, know what they want, in spite of
Charles's mum's objections. Rumor has it though that the Queen is
coming around a bit and the ladies have done ng beauty. Without
royal trappings, they just look comfortable together, the way a
middle-age couple should. After all, that's what they are.
</P>
<P>
   Charles's princely face is etched by squint lines _ some put
there by his years in the cockpit, and others no doubt, by
wondering when his mama is going to hand him the scepter and orb
and say, ``Have at it son; the country's all yours.'' Nor is
Camilla's countenance free of wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Charles is not tall, but that's okay. And Camilla isn't skinny.
HOORAY!
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Parker Bowles's shape is considerably less than
perfect by today's standards. She has a chest just like a real
woman's and, forgive me for noticing, it's long past perky. And
even a Versace cannot disguise the amplitude of the lady's
midsection _ referred to by us commoners as a spare tire.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? It looks good. It looks natural. And it
surely makes me feel a whole lot better about what I'm seeing in
the mirror every day.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, her Prince still loves her.
</P>
<P>
   Good news? Bad news? I dunno. It's your call.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Does your grill drool grease or sputter sparks?
At one time or another most grills become the source of a deck-top
mess. Instead of pressure washing wood or stone after every
cookout, why not buy a bib for the barbie? The ``Original'' Grill
Pad ($25 to $40 depending on size; www.diversitech.com) is little
more than a pad of thick, feltlike material coated in colored
concrete. But it's big enough (30-by-42-inch rectangles or 30-inch
rounds) to protect the deck and can be cleaned off with a shot from
the garden hose.

   IF ONLY IT POPPED CORN

   At first our home TVs and radios pumped their sound through a
single speaker. The speaker count jumped to two for stereo, then
four, and for the past couple years it's been six speakers for 5.1
channel Dolby Digital. Now the latest is Dolby Digital 6.1 Extended
Surround, which requires seven speakers to bring the movie theater
experience home. Sherwood America, a California-based home and car
audio specialist, won an Innovation Award at the International
Consumer Electronics Show in January for its design of the
Newcastle R-956 Receiver ($1,500; www.sherwoodamerica.com), which
is capable of reproducing the 6.1 channel movie theater sound
environment at home. The R-956 has six 120-watt-per-channel
discrete amplifiers to drive its speakers. The receiver also
features an on-screen display, a dedicated audiovisual output to
send signals to a home theater in a second room and digital outputs
for a compact disc or mini disc recorder.

 &HT;    A dud named 'Sue'
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ What a disappointment. The most complete
Tyrannosaurus rex ever discovered gets the most shallow treatment
ever burned onto a CD-ROM in Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive's I See
Sue . . . the T.rex. ($20; www.simonandschuster.com; for Windows
and Mac). The sad truth is that you'll get relatively few glimpses
of the magnificent creature's bones alongside a mind-numbingly
simple, simulated board game in which you collect and discard
tiles, go-fish style, to complete a dinosaur and move across a
badly-drawn playing field. The game takes about as long to master
as tic-tac-toe, and the frustratingly random jump-aheads and
fall-backs on the game board remove even that classic paper and
pencil game's strategy factor. Annoying Nickelodeon child star
Danny Tamberelli (''Pete and Pete,'' ``Figure it Out,'' ``All
That'') provides repetitive, bothersome rhyming commentary with
only the most cursory level of information. Skip the CD-ROM and go
straight to the wonderful Web site, www.iseesue.com, for a far more
in-depth look at Sue's discovery and reconstruction with puzzles to
print and complete. Yeah, T.rex is supposed to be bad, just not
like this. (Ages 4-7).
</P>
<P>
   NOW THIS GAME'S GOT BITE
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Dinosaur Activity Center ($30;
www.disneyinteractive.com; for Windows and Mac) is everything ``I
See Sue'' isn't . . . that's the good news and the bad news.
Whereas ``Sue'' is a clunker built around a real creature,
``Dinosaur'' is a fantastic, personality-filled CD-ROM based on
those fictional, Disnified creatures-with-human-faces from the hit
movie of the same name. Of the three great arcade and logic
strategy games here (not including the silly Lemur Love Match),
Colossal Fossil Face Off is the best. It's a simplified chess-type
game of dino vs. dino, where each player's beasts have their own
special moves. The object is to discover which of your opponent's
creatures is hiding the dinosaur egg. There's a fun dinosaur puzzle
maker, which lets kids mix and match dino parts and record their
own voice-over roars, and, with an Internet connection, the
dinosaur creations can be e-mailed to friends. Children won't learn
much about real dinosaurs here, but they won't be bored to tears
after five minutes, and they'll pick up some logic and strategy
skills along the way. (Ages 5 and up).

 &HT;    Protect your PC privacy
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I am connected to the Internet via cable modem (MediaOne). I've
read numerous articles that indicate I'm at risk from hackers
breaking into my PC files with this connection. Is this true even
if I only have my PC on and am working in Microsoft Word, for
example, but have not clicked on the icon that connects me to
MediaOne's home site?
</P>
<P>
   _ Yvonne Naylor, Bay Village, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There are pitfalls. As a cable modem user, once you turn
on your PC or Mac, you're immediately perched out there on a
network. And you're not alone. You are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You become even more susceptible to intruders when you
launch your browser to surf the Web. The Internet isn't secure at
all. That's a given. Threats exist to privacy and data.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There are things you can do, though. If you don't want to
surf but wish to use a word processor or another application and
not feel like someone's peering over your shoulder, disconnect the
fat network cable (RJ-45) that runs from your computer to the cable
modem.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: That way, you stay close to home. On your own hard drive.
You don't connect to the cable TV network or make the giant leap to
the Web, the mother of all networks. When you want to rejoin the
masses, plug the cable back in and you're good to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: When you're ``live'' and online, one safety precaution is
to turn off File and Print Sharing in the Network Control Panel on
the PC. That can cut off an interloper's way ``in.'' On the Mac,
turn off the File Sharing Control Panel. Disable printer sharing
within the printer software or Control Panels, depending on the OS.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Or ``build'' a personal firewall. Firewalls come in all
shapes and sizes, but here we're talking about software that
controls traffic between your computer and the Internet and alerts
you to possible intrusions. For the PC, there's Norton Internet
Security 2000 (symantec.com) at $69.95. In addition to defending
against invasion, this package puts icing on the cake by keeping
cookies in check and blocking banner ads. Norton ed to the Internet
or not.

 &HT;    Delete PC fear
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you scared of Web surfing? Terrified of
technology? You are not alone. And there is help. Getting plugged
in to the information revolution is easier than you think.
</P>
<P>
   You may even find that it's fun.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of nervousness about the Web comes from what seems like an
endless stream of advertisements on television, radio, magazines
and newspapers that toss around phrases like ``e-business,''
``Internet service provider,'' ``DSL,'' along with names of
companies that have three w's in front of them and a dot-com after
them.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of decent, smart, intelligent people don't deal with the
Internet on a daily basis, don't have an e-business and don't want
to have one. They stare at the TV dazed and confused as one
Internet ad is followed by the next, with no idea what these
companies are selling or even how to find the Web site where all
this stuff is being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Don't despair. No matter what your computer geek friends may
tell you, everybody _ even your 6-year-old who may be in the living
room working on his Web site as you read this _ was a computer
novice once. Really.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watched the Super Bowl, nearly every ad was a dot-com
advertisement,'' says Stacy Elliott, the so-called Digital Diva,
who travels the country for Microsoft delivering the message that
computer use can be simple. ``You would have thought the whole
world had Internet access except for you, and that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of people who cringe when someone tells them
to look something up on the Web or who rank the idea of installing
software with jumping out of an airplane without a parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let all the lingo and hype keep you away from computers
and the Internet. If computers were really that hard to use,
Circuit City would only sell video equipment and software
billionaire Bill Gates would be the night manager at a McDonald's
instead of the richest man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice anyone can give the computer-shy is to ask not
what you can do for technology but rather what technology can do
for you. ``If someone tells me to get a digital camera,'' Elliott
says, ``my first instinct is still to ask why, and most of the time
people will say, `Well, because it's cool.' That means nothing to
me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if somebody told me that a digital camera would let me
take pictures of my new home in Seattle, put them up on the
Internet so my friends in the Midwest can see them, then I can see
there is some utility, some reason for getting a digital camera.''
</P>
<P>
   So lesson one is an easy one. Ask yourself what you want to get
from your technology adventures. Do you want to track your stocks
online? Do you want to keep up with breaking news from around the
world? Do you want to listen to music online? Or do you just want
to e-mail your kids at college?
</P>
<P>
   Once you know what you want to do, you're halfway home. The next
step is to learn how to do it. Elliott suggests a hands-on
approach. Find a friend who has a computer or uses the type of
technology you're interested in and ask for a demonstration. She
says actually being able to play around with technology in your own
home or at a friend's house without any pressure to understand
everything right away is the best way to wade into the technology
waters.
</P>
<P>
   One way to get started is to just sit down at the computer with
a good friend or a good book to guide you in your initial efforts.
Just wandering the aisles of the local bookstore to find a book
that answers your questions without raising new ones is your best
bet. But don't grab the first book you see. If you don't understand
anything in the book, don't buy it. If seeing pictures of what the
computer screen should look like will help, buy a book with plenty
of easy-to-understand illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   There's also nothing wrong with grabbing your computer-savvy
friends and having them show you what to do. The Web site,
SeniorNet, says not to be afraid to ask for help. Although the site
is geared toward seniors, the advice holds true for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you have to tell yourself some things: Nobody is born
knowing this stuff,'' writes Lois Granick, a SeniorNet instructor
in Washington. ``Teaching older adults does sometimes mean
convincing them that they can learn. Students need to be convinced
that learning new things _ including computers _ is sometimes
difficult and often slow. It's is not possible to learn it
instantly. The computer is particularly intimidating to those first
approaching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Granick says that once seniors get over their fears of the
computer the fun part of computing is almost always instantly
apparent. ``Students at the end of the first lesson are reluctant
to leave the Solitaire game that is scheduled for the last 15
minutes of the session to practice mouse usage.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you're online and looking for a jump start to the Web,
there are plenty of guides to help you find interesting Web sites
geared to your interests. ``The Internet Cool Guide'' and ``The
Internet Cool Guide to Online Shopping'' are two small,
easy-to-read guides to some of the best-known Web sites. Even if
you're not online yet, browsing through books like these will give
you some idea of the range of materials available online. If you
figure out what you want from technology and take things
step-by-step, you may find that none of this is as complicated as
it seems.
</P>
<P>
   The message SeniorNet and even Microsoft want to send to the
computer-phobic is that they are not alone and help is on the way.
You can learn how to surf the Net or install a computer program
without taking special classes or wading through complicated
technical manuals.
</P>
<P>
   If you're afraid you're going to crash your computer, erase the
memory or otherwise destroy a thousand-plus dollar piece of
equipment, imagine how Elliott, now a bona fide ``digital diva''
with her own Web site (www.digitaldiva.com) must have felt when she
went to work in Microsoft's marketing department three and a half
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the difference between hardware and software,''
she says. ``That's a pretty big problem when you work at Microsoft.
I'd sit in these meetings and hear all this technology talk and I
was just overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   She spent most of her time in meetings scribbling down strange
acronyms and techno-speak that sounded like something Captain
Picard would utter in an average episode of ``Star Trek,'' then
hurry back to her office and try to look everything up.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, like a lot of women new to technology, was afraid to
ask questions of her Microsoft colleagues because she didn't want
to appear ignorant. However, she soon discovered that many of her
friends who didn't work for high-technology companies like
Microsoft were just as confused and intimidated as she was.
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Diva's traveling road show takes her all over the
country with the Microsoft team, demonstrating products and
spreading the word that technology is accessible. She has a ``try
it, you'll like it'' attitude about technology that resonates with
women who are interested but slightly nervous around computers,
software, hand-held devices and other high-tech gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent show-and-tell engagement at the Atlanta Civic
Center, women stopped to look over and ``test drive'' everything
from money management software programs to electronic organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to open our eyes and see what's happening,'' said
Jody Gold, a visitor from Maryland who stopped by the technology
display to test out a hand-held electronic organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we really want to get involved in and not shy
away from,'' added her friend Beth Kwiateck. They both said that
being able to play around with various software and computer
devices in a low-stress atmosphere (none of the products
demonstrated was available for purchase on-site) made them more
willing to ask questions and try the products out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only use the computer at home,'' said Beth Kearney, ``but my
daughter just got a high-tech job and she wants to tell me about
all this stuff and I want to find out what it's all about.''

 &HT;    `Digital Diva' Stacy Elliott's Tips
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Elliott, Microsoft's ``Digital Diva,'' offers this advice
for newcomers to computers and the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   1. Figure out what you want to do. Focus on what you want to do
rather than on the technology itself. From there you can decide
what products you need.o bring a gadget and demonstrate how it
works, or have the meeting at a home where everyone can try the
computer. ``All of a sudden, you'll have new ideas about what
technology can do,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   4. Do a little bit every day. Don't try to do everything all in
one day. Play with it, practice with it and explore. Learn one
thing, then you can go onto something else.
</P>
<P>
   5. Read up. Don't skip over the technology articles in magazines
like Family PC _ if you are connected to the Internet you can go
out onto the Web and look for more tips and tricks. Elliott
suggests flipping through books at the local bookstore to find the
right one for you. Make sure you don't buy any book that uses
language you don't understand. One book she recommends is ``The
Grown-Up's Guide to Computing'' by Mary S. Furlong and Stefan B.
Lipson from the Microsoft Press, but there are many good ones to
chose from.

 &HT;    Digital cameras, recordable CDs great for storing memories
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes, to listen to me talk, you'd think that I
didn't like technology at all. A lot of times I end up complaining
about how it has messed with my life in bad ways.
</P>
<P>
   And it's partly true. Cellular phones bug me, junk e-mail drives
me crazy, Internet chat rooms seem like bad parties full of
dull-witted people, the debate between Mac owners and PC folk bores
me, and I will be able to live the rest of my life happily without
receiving another e-mailed joke.
</P>
<P>
   But since I write about technology, there are some things you
need to understand. I do love technology, have loved it since I was
a kid messing with ham radios, sending frog astronauts into near
space _ and usually an early grave _ with homemade rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is great. It's just that it's somehow become a
religion instead of a tool.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some great tools out there, and today I'll tell
you about some of the ones that do impress me and are useful in my
life.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with digital cameras. I started thinking about the
trend toward these filmless cameras last night while _ in a fit of
nostalgia _ looking through some old photographs taken when I was a
kid. Looking at those photographs you'd have thought that I come
from a long line of pastel-colored people.
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear a lot of good reasons to get a digital camera,
including how easy it makes it to send a photograph by e-mail to
relatives and friends. And those are good reasons. But _ if you are
the kind of person who wants future generations of your family to
see how you really look _ digital cameras have another advantage.
Unlike photographic prints, where the the chemistry that creates
the images are doomed to eventually blotch and fade into
nothingness, a digital photograph should look the same 100 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings me to the second gadget that seems to have a
real future: the recordable CD. If you have a lot of photographs,
you can transfer them to the CD and store it away. Unlike magnetic
recording devices, if stored properly, it should last for a century
or two. (And if your great-great-grandchildren wish, they can copy
it a hundred years from now. Unlike duplicating a videotape, the
copy will be identical to the original with no loss of quality.)
</P>
<P>
   The mass storage available on a CD and its semipermanence make
it a great place to store other family memories including texts
about the family tree, precious letters and other information that
you'd like to keep around. Just one quick tip: Make two copies.
Keep one at home and store another one in a safe deposit box or
with a friend. That way if your home is ever struck by fire or some
other disaster, you won't lose the memories.
</P>
<P>
   The third technological marvel that I recommend to you is a UPS,
an uninterrupted power supply. Years ago, when I started writing
about computers, the UPS was something reserved for businesses and
government. It was too expensive for home users. But nowadays, you
can buy one for $100 or so, and it's worth every penny.
</P>
<P>
   A UPS is basically a large battery connected to circuitry that
converts the battery power into current that your PC can use. When
the power goes out at your house _ and, at my house at least, that
happens at least six or seven times a year _ the UPS automatically
kicks in to supply an uninterrupted source of power. That means
you'll have time to shut down your computer normally and save your
work. And since a UPS also provides excellent protection against
power surges and dips, your PC should work better with fewer screen
freezes and also last longer. The power dips and surges gradually
do damage to your machine.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of useless and expensive software and hardware
out there. But I don't know a soul _ truly _ who regrets owning any
of the devices I've mentioned today.

 &HT;    AOL tunes up downloadable music
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Want to see the future of the Internet? Keep an eye on
Bob Pittman, America Online's president and chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of the AOL/Time Warner merger vote, Pittman, 46,
has become one of the most influential figures in both old and new
media. The decisions he'll make at America Online will have an
impact on nearly everyone who picks up a magazine, watches TV, goes
to a movie or logs on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Media insiders will remember Pittman as the man who helped
develop MTV and VH1, the wildly popular cable music channels.
</P>
<P>
   He joined AOL in 1996 with a plan to use his knowledge of TV
programming to create channels and ``programming'' for the online
service.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman also came to AOL to transform the online service's
business model. Ripping another page from his television
background, he moved AOL from a subscription-based business model
to one that included advertising, marketing and electronic
commerce. The combination was and still is so successful that
almost all other Internet service providers _ including the No. 2
ISP, Atlanta-based EarthLink _ now consider it a key component of
their business strategies.

<P>
   Pittman has expanded his vision to include delivering AOL on any
device from the traditional PC to pagers and television. He also
sees a world where AOL users can watch movies and download music
right on the service.
</P>
<P>
   Charging for digital music downloads could be the one place
where Pittman will make his biggest impression on the Internet
economy. Last week, AOL took its first step toward selling music
online, making a deal with InterTrust Technologies that will let
AOL members download digital music for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of trying to figure out how to
commercialize digital downloading,'' said AOL spokeswoman Wendy
Goldberg. The technology will be included in AOL version 6.0 due
out this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the billion-dollar question that artists, record
companies and Internet companies dearly want to answer is whether
AOL customers will be willing to purchase music online _ no matter
how easy it is to do.
</P>
<P>
   Talal Shamoon, senior vice president for media at InterTrust,
said America Online's 22 million-plus subscriber base would be the
ideal setting to launch a secure version of Napster, the widely
used system for swapping music files.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, through its various partners and the seemingly limitless
resources of the Time Warner family of media products, could offer
a stunning range of incentives that could include everything from
concert tickets to a free month of HBO.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are limitless, and if anyone can figure out a
way to persuade listeners to pay for music on the Net, the odds are
pretty good it's Pittman. After all, who would have thought back in
1981 that people would be willing to sit and watch a channel that
then consisted of nothing but music videos 24 hours a day?
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be at the threshold of something very big,'' Shamoon
told The Wall Street Journal. ``A robust electronic community of
people exchanging content in a safe way, where rights holders get
paid and consumers feel good about the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether that ``something very big'' actually materializes is
entirely up to Pittman, and it's hard to find a pundit who doesn't
believe Pittman is this century's P.T. Barnum _ the kind of
businessman who instead of selling things you don't want, persuades
you to buy things you had absolutely no idea you wanted.
</P>
<P>
   His business skills Hollywood media connections and marketing
genius create a rare set of talents, combining ``old economy''
horse trading with ``new economy'' innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Mark Stavish, head of personnel for AOL, put it best when
he told the Sunday Times of London, ``People say AOL exists because
of Steve (Case, AOL's founder and chief executive), but it works
because of Bob.''

 &HT;    Delete PC fear
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you scared of Web surfing? Terrified of
technology? You are not alone. And there is help. Getting plugged
in to the information revolution is easier than you think.
</P>
<P>
   You may even find that it's fun.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of nervousness about the Web comes from what seems like an
endless stream of advertisements on television, radio, magazines
and newspapers that toss around phrases like ``e-business,''
``Internet service provider,'' ``DSL,'' along with names of
companies that have three w's in front of them and a dot-com after
them.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of decent, smart, intelligent people don't deal with the
Internet on a daily basis, don't have an e-business and don't want
to have one. They stare at the TV dazed and confused as one
Internet ad is followed by the next, with no idea what these
companies are selling or even how to find the Web site where all
this stuff is being sold.
</P>
<P>
   Don't despair. No matter what your computer geek friends may
tell you, everybody _ even your 6-year-old who may be in the living
room working on his Web site as you read this _ was a computer
novice once. Really.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watched the Super Bowl, nearly every ad was a dot-com
advertisement,'' says Stacy Elliott, the so-called Digital Diva,
who travels the country for Microsoft delivering the message that
computer use can be simple. ``You would have thought the whole
world had Internet access except for you, and that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of people who cringe when someone tells them
to look something up on the Web or who rank the idea of installing
software with jumping out of an airplane without a parachute.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let all the lingo and hype keep you away from computers
and the Internet. If computers were really that hard to use,
Circuit City would only sell video equipment and software
billionaire Bill Gates would be the night manager at a McDonald's
instead of the richest man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice anyone can give the computer-shy is to ask not
what you can do for technology but rather what technology can do
for you. ``If someone tells me to get a digital camera,'' Elliott
says, ``my first instinct is still to ask why, and most of the time
people will say, `Well, because it's cool.' That means nothing to
me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if somebody told me that a digital camera would let me
take pictures of my new home in Seattle, put them up on the
Internet so my friends in the Midwest can see them, then I can see
there is some utility, some reason for getting a digital camera.''
</P>
<P>
   So lesson one is an easy one. Ask yourself what you want to get
from your technology adventures. Do you want to track your stocks
online? Do you want to keep up with breaking news from around the
world? Do you want to listen to music online? Or do you just want
to e-mail your kids at college?
</P>
<P>
   Once you know what you want to do, you're halfway home. The next
step is to learn how to do it. Elliott suggests a hands-on
approach. Find a friend who has a computer or uses the type of
technology you're interested in and ask for a demonstration. She
says actually being able to play around with technology in your own
home or at a friend's house without any pressure to understand
everything right away is the best way to wade into the technology
waters.
</P>
<P>
   One way to get started is to just sit down at the computer with
a good friend or a good book to guide you in your initial efforts.
Just wandering the aisles of the local bookstore to find a book
that answers your questions without raising new ones is your best
bet. But don't grab the first book you see. If you don't understand
anything in the book, don't buy it. If seeing pictures of what the
computer screen should look like will help, buy a book with plenty
of easy-to-understand illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   There's also nothing wrong with grabbing your computer-savvy
friends and having them show you what to do. The Web site,
SeniorNet, says not to be afraid to ask for help. Although the site
is geared toward seniors, the advice holds true for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you have to tell yourself some things: Nobody is born
knowing this stuff,'' writes Lois Granick, a SeniorNet instructor
in Washington. ``Teaching older adults does sometimes mean
convincing them that they can learn. Students need to be convinced
that learning new things _ including computers _ is sometimes
difficult and often slow. It's is not possible to learn it
instantly. The computer is particularly intimidating to those first
approaching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Granick says that once seniors get over their fears of the
computer the fun part of computing is almost always instantly
apparent. ``Students at the end of the first lesson are reluctant
to leave the Solitaire game that is scheduled for the last 15
minutes of the session to practice mouse usage.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you're online and looking for a jump start to the Web,
there are plenty of guides to help you find interesting Web sites
geared to your interests. ``The Internet Cool Guide'' and ``The
Internet Cool Guide to Online Shopping'' are two small,
easy-to-read guides to some of the best-known Web sites. Even if
you're not online yet, browsinww.digitaldiva.com) must have felt
when she went to work in Microsoft's marketing department three and
a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the difference between hardware and software,''
she says. ``That's a pretty big problem when you work at Microsoft.
I'd sit in these meetings and hear all this technology talk and I
was just overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   She spent most of her time in meetings scribbling down strange
acronyms and techno-speak that sounded like something Captain
Picard would utter in an average episode of ``Star Trek,'' then
hurry back to her office and try to look everything up.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, like a lot of women new to technology, was afraid to
ask questions of her Microsoft colleagues because she didn't want
to appear ignorant. However, she soon discovered that many of her
friends who didn't work for high-technology companies like
Microsoft were just as confused and intimidated as she was.
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Diva's traveling road show takes her all over the
country with the Microsoft team, demonstrating products and
spreading the word that technology is accessible. She has a ``try
it, you'll like it'' attitude about technology that resonates with
women who are interested but slightly nervous around computers,
software, hand-held devices and other high-tech gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent show-and-tell engagement at the Atlanta Civic
Center, women stopped to look over and ``test drive'' everything
from money management software programs to electronic organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to open our eyes and see what's happening,'' said
Jody Gold, a visitor from Maryland who stopped by the technology
display to test out a hand-held electronic organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we really want to get involved in and not shy
away from,'' added her friend Beth Kwiateck. They both said that
being able to play around with various software and computer
devices in a low-stress atmosphere (none of the products
demonstrated was available for purchase on-site) made them more
willing to ask questions and try the products out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only use the computer at home,'' said Beth Kearney, ``but my
daughter just got a high-tech job and she wants to tell me about
all this stuff and I want to find out what it's all about.''

 &HT;    Barbecuer's deck hand
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Does your grill drool grease or sputter sparks?
At one time or another most grills become the source of a deck-top
mess. Instead of pressure washing wood or stone after every
cookout, why not buy a bib for the barbie? The ``Original'' Grill
Pad ($25 to $40 depending on size; www.diversitech.com) is little
more than a pad of thick, feltlike material coated in colored
concrete. But it's big enough (30-by-42-inch rectangles or 30-inch
rounds) to protect the deck and can be cleaned off with a shot from
the garden hose.
</P>
<P>
   IF ONLY IT POPPED CORN
</P>
<P>
   At first our home TVs and radios pumped their sound through a
single speaker. The speaker count jumped to two for stereo, then
four, and for the past couple years it's been six speakers for 5.1
channel Dolby Digital. Now the latest is Dolby Digital 6.1 Extended
Surround, which requires seven speakers to bring the movie theater
experience home. Sherwood America, a California-based home and car
audio specialist, won an Innovation Award at the International
Consumer Electronics Show in January for its design of the
Newcastle R-956 Receiver ($1,500; www.sherwoodamerica.com), which
is capable of reproducing the 6.1 channel movie theater sound
environment at home. The R-956 has six 120-watt-per-channel
discrete amplifiers to drive its speakers. The receiver also
features an on-screen display, a dedicated audiovisual output to
send signals to a home theater in a second room and digital outputs
for a compact disc or mini disc recorder.

 &HT;    A dud named 'Sue'
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ What a disappointment. The most complete
Tyrannosaurus rex ever discovered gets the most shallow treatment
ever burned onto a CD-ROM in Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive's I See
Sue . . . the T.rex. ($20; www.simonandschuster.com; for Windows
and Mac). The sad truth is that you'll get relatively few glimpses
of the magnificent creature's bones alongside a mind-numbingly
simple, simulated board game in which you collect and discard
tiles, go-fish style, to complete a dinosaur and move across a
badly-drawn playing field. The game takes about as long to master
as tic-tac-toe, and the frustratingly random jump-aheads and
fall-backs on the game board remove even that classic paper and
pencil game's strategy factor. Annoying Nickelodeon child star
Danny Tamberelli (''Pete and Pete,'' ``Figure it Out,'' ``All
That'') provides repetitive, bothersome rhyming commentary with
only the most cursory level of information. Skip the CD-ROM and go
straight to the wonderful Web site, www.iseesue.com, for a far more
in-depth look at Sue's discovery and reconstruction with puzzles to
print and complete. Yeah, T.rex is supposed to be bad, just not
like this. (Ages 4-7).
</P>
<P>
   NOW THIS GAME'S GOT BITE
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Dinosaur Activity Center ($30;
www.disneyinteractive.com; for Windows and Mac) is everything ``I
See Sue'' isn't . . . that's the good news and the bad news.
Whereas ``Sue'' is a clunker built around a real creature,
``Dinosaur'' is a fantastic, personality-filled CD-ROM based on
those fictional, Disnified creatures-with-human-faces from the hit
movie of the same name. Of the three great arcade and logic
strategy games here (not including the silly Lemur Love Match),
Colossal Fossil Face Off is the best. It's a simplified chess-type
game of dino vs. dino, where each player's beasts have their own
special moves. The object is to discover which of your opponent's
creatures is hiding the dinosaur egg. There's a fun dinosaur puzzle
maker, which lets kids mix and match dino parts and record their
own voice-over roars, and, with an Internet connection, the
dinosaur creations can be e-mailed to friends. Children won't learn
much about real dinosaurs here, but they won't be bored to tears
after five minutes, and they'll pick up some logic and strategy
skills along the way. (Ages 5 and up).

 &HT;    Protect your PC privacy
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I am connected to the Internet via cable modem (MediaOne). I've
read numerous articles that indicate I'm at risk from hackers
breaking into my PC files with this connection. Is this true even
if I only have my PC on and am working in Microsoft Word, for
example, but have not clicked on the icon that connects me to
MediaOne's home site?
</P>
<P>
   _ Yvonne Naylor, Bay Village, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There are pitfalls. As a cable modem user, once you turn
on your PC or Mac, you're immediately perched out there on a
network. And you're not alone. You are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You become even more susceptible to intruders when you
launch your browser to surf the Web. The Internet isn't secure at
all. That's a given. Threats exist to privacy and data.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There are things you can do, though. If you don't want to
surf but wish to use a word processor or another application and
not feel like someone's peering over your shoulder, disconnect the
fat network cable (RJ-45) that runs from your computer to the cable
modem.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: That way, you stay close to home. On your own hard drive.
You don't connect to the cable TV network or make the giant leap to
the Web, the mother of all networks. When you want to rejoin the
masses, plug the cable back in and you're good to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: When you're ``live'' and online, one safety precaution is
to turn off File and Print Sharing in the Network Control Panel on
the PC. That can cut off an interloper's way ``in.'' On the Mac,
turn off the File Sharing Control Panel. Disable printer sharing
within the printer software or Control Panels, depending on the OS.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Or ``build'' a personal firewall. Firewalls come in all
shapes and sizes, but here we're talking about software that
controls traffic between your computer and the Internet and alerts
you to possible intrusions. For the PC, there's Norton Internet
Security 2000 (symantec.com) at $69.95. In addition to defending
against invasion, this package puts icing on the cake by keeping
cookies in check and blocking banner ads. Norton currently doesn't
have a Mac version available. For another PC version, surf to
networkice.com and look at BlackICE Defender ($39.95). For the Mac,
check out DoorStop at opendoor.com for $59.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Also, it doesn't hurt to see what your cable company says
about protecting your system (www.mediaone.com). When downloading
off the Net, virus protection is a must. Keep an eye out for
insidious e-mail attachments, too. As we know all too well from the
Love Bug, double-clicking an attachment can launch an executable
that wreaks havoc. Having a text/image viewer around doesn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: A couple of good-sense practices to adopt, if you haven't
already. If you have passwords to anything, don't share. Also, back
up data regularly. That's smart to do whether you're connected to
the Internet or not.
</P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    `Digital Diva' Stacy Elliott's Tips
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Elliott, Microsoft's ``Digital Diva,'' offers this advice
for newcomers to computers and the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   1. Figure out what you want to do. Focus on what you want to do
rather than on the technology itself. From there you can decide
what products you need. If you just want to send e-mail and surf
the Web, your needs will be simple. But if you want to send digital
pictures, you need a camera and a scanner.
</P>
<P>
   2. Grab a friend and go to the computer store. It's good to take
a friend along with you. Store personnel are great, but they don't
know you and your skill level. The best way to learn about
technology is to have somebody you know help.
</P>
<P>
   3. If you belong to a club, have a ``Tech Night.'' ``Many people
are involved in clubs or organizations, like gardening clubs or
book clubs,'' Elliott says. Pick a night to talk about technology.
Ask everyone to bring a gadget and demonstrate how it works, or
have the meeting at a home where everyone can try the computer.
``All of a sudden, you'll have new ideas about what technology can
do,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   4. Do a little bit every day. Don't try to do everything all in
one day. Play with it, practice with it and explore. Learn one
thing, then you can go onto something else.
</P>
<P>
   5. Read up. Don't skip over the technology articles in magazines
like Family PC _ if you are connected to the Internet you can go
out onto the Web and look for more tips and tricks. Elliott
suggests flipping through books at the local bookstore to find the
right one for you. Make sure you don't buy any book that uses
language you don't understand. One book she recommends is ``The
Grown-Up's Guide to Computing'' by Mary S. Furlong and Stefan B.
Lipson from the Microsoft Press, but there are many good ones to
chose from.

 &HT;    Ontrack's SystemSuite 2000 comparable to rival
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ontrack's SystemSuite 2000 goes head-to-head with
Norton's SystemWorks and comes out pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   It runs from a control center with 10 basic modules, some of
which, as you might expect, have redundant sections.
</P>
<P>
   The Fix Wizard, for example, has nine functions, all but one of
which can be found under other headings.
</P>
<P>
   Disk and Files contains core programs such as DiskFixer, a disk
defragmenter, FileUndeleter and several system-file backup
programs. The file recovery program is similar to Norton's _ unless
you give it a deleted file to look for, it will search a specified
drive for all the deleted files it can find, and present a list of
them, their folder of origin and an estimate of the likelihood of
complete recovery.
</P>
<P>
   For folks who haven't been through this sort of thing before,
and find the concept of searching for a deleted file to be somewhat
oxymoronic, file deletion still works like this:
</P>
<P>
   When you order a file deleted, it isn't immediately wiped out.
Instead, the system tags it as deleted, making its space on the
hard drive available for new information. Sooner or later _ sooner,
of course, if you decide you want it back _ it will be overwritten,
entirely or partially.
</P>
<P>
   Registry tools are the best thing about these latest programs.
It seems to me that SystemSuite's RegistryFixer is somewhat more
aggressive and detailed than Norton's comparable program. After
launching it, it will present the user with a list of registry
problems with three levels of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   If it's certain it can deal with a problem, it will already be
marked for action. The other two levels are left up to the user. In
some cases, it will offer a choice of actions, in addition to the
choice of doing nothing at all about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, on the other hand, can either fix the problem or not,
and that's it. If you want something done about a problem it can't
handle, then you have to go into the Registry editor and deal with
it yourself, a process I would not recommend to the novice.
</P>
<P>
   SystemSuite keeps automatic track of all the registry changes so
if you made a bad guess, it can be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   It has the usual complement of system diagnostics and monitors,
and protective services that include a Crashproof function. I have
no confidence in these things; they generally cause more problems
than they forestall.
</P>
<P>
   The Crisis Center is an interesting idea. Of its four
components, only one is concerned with helping you deal with data
recovery yourself. One conveys you to various online advice sites,
and the other two hook you up with industrial-strength, extra-cost
services provided by OnTrack.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Digital cameras, recordable CDs great for storing memories
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes, to listen to me talk, you'd think that I
didn't like technology at all. A lot of times I end up complaining
about how it has messed with my life in bad ways.
</P>
<P>
   And it's partly true. Cellular phones bug me, junk e-mail drives
me crazy, Internet chat rooms seem like bad parties full of
dull-witted people, the debate between Mac owners and PC folk bores
me, and I will be able to live the rest of my life happily without
receiving another e-mailed joke.
</P>
<P>
   But since I write about technology, there are some things you
need to understand. I do love technology, have loved it since I was
a kid messing with ham radios, sending frog astronauts into near
space _ and usually an early grave _ with homemade rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is great. It's just that it's somehow become a
religion instead of a tool.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some great tools out there, and today I'll tell
you about some of the ones that do impress me and are useful in my
life.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with digital cameras. I started thinking about the
trend toward these filmless cameras last night while _ in a fit of
nostalgia _ looking through some old photographs taken when I was a
kid. Looking at those photographs you'd have thought that I come
from a long line of pastel-colored people.
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear a lot of good reasons to get a digital camera,
including how easy it makes it to send a photograph by e-mail to
relatives and friends. And those are good reasons. But _ if you are
the kind of person who wants future generations of your family to
see how you really look _ digital cameras have another advantage.
Unlike photographic prints, where the the chemistry that creates
the images are doomed to eventually blotch and fade into
nothingness, a digital photograph should look the same 100 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings me to the second gadget that seems to have a
real future: the recordable CD. If you have a lot of photographs,
you can transfer them to the CD and store it away. Unlike magnetic
recording devices, if stored properly, it should last for a century
or two. (And if your great-great-grandchildren wish, they can copy
it a hundred years from now. Unlike duplicating a videotape, the
copy will be identical to the original with no loss of quality.)
</P>
<P>
   The mass storage available on a CD and its semipermanence make
it a great place to store other family memories including texts
about the family tree, precious letters and other information that
you'd like to keep around. Just one quick tip: Make two copies.
Keep one at home and store another one in a safe deposit box or
with a friend. That way if your home is ever struck by fire or some
other disaster, you won't lose the memories.
</P>
<P>
   The third technological marvel that I recommend to you is a UPS,
an uninterrupted power supply. Years ago, when I started writing
about computers, the UPS was something reserved for businesses and
government. It was too expensive for home users. But nowadays, you
can buy one for $100 or so, and it's worth every penny.
</P>
<P>
   A UPS is basically a large battery connected to circuitry that
converts the battery power into current that your PC can use. When
the power goes out at your house _ and, at my house at least, that
happens at least six or seven times a year _ the UPS automatically
kicks in to supply an uninterrupted source of power. That means
you'll have time to shut down your computer normally and save your
work. And since a UPS also provides excellent protection against
power surges and dips, your PC should work better with fewer screen
freezes and also last longer. The power dips and surges gradually
do damage to your machine.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of useless and expensive software and hardware
out there. But I don't know a soul _ truly _ who regrets owning any
of the devices I've mentioned today.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _Q: Regarding your reply to the person who asked
about mountain vs. hill _ I've noticed other tricky pairs like
that. For example, when does a pond become a lake or a creek become
a river?
</P>
<P>
   _ Charles Wukasch
</P>
<P>
   A: Naming of ponds, lakes, streams and rivers is by local
convention. Cartographic researcher Beth Gorman of the United
States Geological Survey Earth Science Information Center reports
no volume amount defines these terms. Technically, all flowing
bodies of water are called streams (the Mississippi Stream?!).
Generally, local convention dictates creeks are smaller than
streams and rivers are larger. Q: Over the weekend my husband and I
were having a discussion of where all the cabooses are. Could you
help, please?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jennie Koch
</P>
<P>
   A: A few are still in operation, reports Robert Crossman of
Austin &AMP; Texas Central Railroad. This car also often contained crew
sleeping and eating quarters. Cabooses (caboosi?) and their crew
monitored the rear of the train and put the air brakes on if
necessary. These functions are now performed by FRED, or flashing
rear end device. Many cabooses ended up in scrap yards; some have
more interesting second careers as lake houses or diners.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do we get a question to the team that made ``The Sixth
Sense''? Almost everyone I've asked agrees that Cole knows
(senses?) the doctor is ``not quite himself'' from the beginning.
Was this intended? _ F. Dacic
</P>
<P>
   A: How about the opinion of Thomas Schatz, chair of the
University of Texas' radio, television and film department? If you
have not seen this movie, stop reading here. Logic tells the
audience that Cole knows Bruce Willis' character is dead although
his performance cannot blatantly reveal this fact. Cole is always
``in a state'' when he sees Dr. Crowe. The audience never sees
Crowe's wounds; however, most of the film is through Crowe's, not
Cole's, eyes. Schatz concludes Cole definitely knew. Q: My dear
friend who lives in Bullhead City, Ariz., wants a thermometer that
registers more than 120 degrees. It does get hot there. Do they
make such a thing?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jean Neece
</P>
<P>
   A: How about up to 158 degrees? That's very hot. Call Life With
Ease at (800) 966-5119 to order a talking indoor/outdoor
thermometer ($22.95 plus shipping). The National Climatic Data
Center reports the highest temperature recorded in the United
States is 134 degrees (ouch!) on July 10, 1913, in Greenland Ranch,
Calif. Arizona's record is 128 degrees on June 29, 1994, in Lake
Havasu City (not far from Bullhead). And the Lone Star State? 120
degrees on Aug. 12, 1936, in Seymour.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a 1943 Abraham Lincoln penny. I read an advertisement
that told me the coin was worth about $3,000, but the address on
the advertisement was fishy. It was only a P.O. box in the New York
area. I wanted to know if I could get the coin evaluated here in
Austin. Are there old coins that are worth $3,000 as claimed in the
advertisement?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mohammed Suhail
</P>
<P>
   A: Before you respond to this or any other penny-worth-a-fortune
ad, grab a magnet. If the penny is attracted to the magnet, it may
be worth 10 cents. Rare coin dealer Larry Spence (454-3003) says
that during World War II, copper was needed for the war effort, so
1943 pennies were made of steel. A few 1943 pennies (blank, S or D)
were made of copper. These copper ones are valuable, but few have
been found. Some 1943 steel pennies have turned black, so owners
believe they are copper. Counterfeiters occasionally plate 1943
steel pennies with copper and try to pass them off as rare. If your
penny passes the magnet test, take it to a reputable dealer, who
will have it authenticated by the American Numismatic Association.
While you are sorting through change, look for a mint error dollar
coin (Sacagawea on the reverse and a Washington quarter on the
obverse). Interest has been high since an Arkansas newsman stumbled
on it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a handmade beautiful quilt that I have been using for
a bedspread for five or six years. It is in desperate need of a
good washing and I am afraid I will ruin it. I have heard it is not
a good idea to have a quilt dry-cleaned. Could you please tell me
how to do this properly and what soap to use?
</P>
<P>
   _ Joyce Fraser
</P>
<P>
   A: Washing by hand is the kindest thing you can do to a quilt.
Test for colorfastness first. Then select a pure soap such as
Ivory, Castile or quilt soap. Quilt soap is formulated with orvus
paste _ a soap gentle enough to use on animals. Wash the quilt in
the bathtub and dry on a rack or even over the shower curtain rod.
(Place a towel or sheet between the quilt and the metal rod.) Q: I
just bought a wading pool for my little girl. It's rather large, so
I feel wasteful filling and emptying it every day. If it had a
screen over it to keep out debris and mosquitoes, how long is the
water good?
</P>
<P>
   _ Cindy Bogard
</P>
<P>
   A: As I recall, the composition of my children's wading pool on
a summer afternoon was part melted Popsicle, part unidentified
liquid and two parts very warm water. I'd dump it. ``Not a good
idea to keep water in a fill-and-draw pool,'' says Mark Parsons of
the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services department. The
pool needs chlorine and circulation. Children are not that
particular about personal hygiene, he added delicately. Nothing
dangerous to your child's health may grow in this water overnight,
but then again, nothing dies either.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My neighbor is looking for Lip Life lipstick. She used to buy
it at a store named Leon's. Secondly, she'd like to find an ostrich
feather duster that has a long enough handle to reach regular
ceiling height.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paula Calton
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, Lip Life by Neutrogena has not been made for four
years. Telescoping feather dusters (what is it about ostriches that
make their feathers sooooo attractive to dust?) may be ordered from
Gardener's Supply Co. at (888) 833-1412. This arm extends 72 inches
and may be detached for daily use. Gardener's boasts these feathers
were humanely harvested. Contact Jane Greig at P.O. Box 670,
Austin, TX 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail jgreig(at)statesman.com or
fax (512) 445-3968.

 &HT;    Reality tv just got more realBy Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ CBS, the network that prides itself on devotion
to hard news, is loaning its morning news anchor to the latest
edition of the peeping Tom wave.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Big Brother'' debuts Wednesday at 8 p.m., the live hour
of this multi-night reality series will be hosted by Julie Chen,
who anchors the news segments on CBS's ``The Early Show.'' Not a
peep of protest has been heard, which presumably means that no one
cares that the once-blurred line between news and entertainment is
now invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally comfortable with doing it,'' Chen told USA Today.
``I look at it as an extension of my job on
</P>
<P>
   'The Early Show.' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' is an extension of news? That thumping noise you
hear is Edward R. Murrow rolling over in his grave. People aren't
squawking about this, but they should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ill-advised, because it undermines the credibility of the
person delivering information,'' says Stephen D. Reese, chairman of
the journalism department at the University of Texas. ``Maybe it's
not something the audience is immediately aware of, but over time
the message sent is that there's no discernible difference between
entertainment and news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' for the blissfully unaware, is the new
voyeuristic series, inspired by George Orwell's ``1984,'' that
hopes to latch on to the coattails of the blockbuster ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The program will air in half-hour installments Monday, Tuesday
and Friday, a live hour Thursday and an hour-long recap on Saturday
throughout July. On the live editions, the 10 residents who have
been locked away in a house with 28 hidden cameras and 60
microphones will nominate two people to be evicted. Viewers will
phone in their votes for the unlucky resident. The last person left
receives $500,000 _ a pittance compared with the $1 million
awaiting the final ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen will interview the rejected ones, which is perhaps no
different from the weekly interviews ``The Morning Show'' does with
the rejects from ``Survivor'' or the ``Good Morning America'' chats
with ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?'' winners. Except that Chen
will be out of her normal news context. Maybe that's an important
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually two sides of the same coin,'' Reese says.
``They're just using the programs to mutually reinforce each other.
There's no news there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' was a hit in the Netherlands, Germany and Spain
and is expected to catch fire here. Adding to the overall
creepiness is the fact that people can peek in on the house guests
24 hours a day, seven days a week via video streaming on the Web at
www.bigbrother2000.com.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT WITH MILLER
</P>
<P>
   ABC's decision to sign politically inclined comedian Dennis
Miller to ``Monday Night Football'' is destined to be an overtime,
Super Bowl touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   It's an inspired idea that could spark a much-needed trend
toward crackling commentary in otherwise dull events. I'm thinking
Billy Graham on heavyweight boxing and Meatloaf at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Sports purists are howling that Miller will detract from the
hallowed game of football with his acid wisecracks, but ``Monday
Night Football'' is entertainment first, sports second. Just ask
the Nielsen surveyors, who say the audience on Monday nights
includes lots of viewers just looking for a good time, a miniature
demographic of the Super Bowl. Hard-core football fans are the ones
watching three games on Sunday afternoon. Maybe those games need
``serious'' announcers.
</P>
<P>
   The last time there was any spice to the commentary on ``MNF''
was when Don Meredith and Howard Cosell traded insults in the
1970s. And when Dandy Don sang ``Turn Out the Lights'' at half-time
of the lopsided games. That team disbanded in 1983 and was followed
by a string of flops that included O.J. Simpson, Joe Namath, Fran
Tarkenton, Alex Karras and Boomer Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   Placing someone totally out of context on the ``MNF'' team may
well prove to be a stroke of genius with far-reaching
repercussions. Just think of the possibilities . . .
</P>
<P>
   Eminem at the Republican National Convention. This controversial
rapper would do a fabulous job analyzing the prospects of George W.
Bush. CNN might have to bleep Em from time to time, but that would
add sparks to what might otherwise be a major snoozer. Paired with
stodgy Bernard Shaw, Eminem would provide the much-needed chemistry
to attract an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas at the Democratic National
Convention. This works on many levels. Supreme Court justices are
mysterious because they rarely speak to the media and they aren't
supposed to be political. Pair Thomas with Ted Kennedy, and you've
got a blockbuster. It wouldn't make a whit of difference if Al Gore
is stiff and boring. The commentary would be spellbinding.
</P>
<P>
   Meatloaf, commentator at large, for the Summer Olympics. Can't
you just imagine Meatloaf popping off about tiny gymnasts and
platform divers? Could he even react quickly enough to comment on
gold-medal sprinter Michael Johnson? Just parading him around in a
Peacock polo shirt would draw a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ruth and Dan Rather at the Oscars. Admit it, you've always
wanted to see these two together. Dr. Ruth may be the same size as
the statuettes, but she's got a keenly ribald sense of humor and an
oddly compelling voice. Gunga Dan, of course, spouts folksy sayings
(``Ooooo boy! That guy is all hat and no cattle!'') and sings a
mean train song. Billy Crystal would be a faded memory within
minutes.

 &HT;    Here's how to juggle like a pro!
 &HT;    By Ryon Horne
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's all in the imaginary square.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Ron Anglin would say if you were in his juggling
workshop at the Horizons Circus Camp. He was kind enough to share
with readers the basics of ``cascade juggling.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he suggested that you:
</P>
<P>
   1. Practice in front of your bed so the objects you drop will
fall in front of you.
</P>
<P>
   2. Start by using plastic grocery bags in which you've torn a
small hole in the bottoms. You'll learn the movements easily
because the bags move through the air slowly. Once you get the hang
of it, you'll be able to juggle with balls and other objects.
</P>
<P>
   Let's learn how to juggle!
</P>
<P>
   JUGGLING WITH TWO BAGS
</P>
<P>
   _ Imagine there's a square in front of you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hold the end of one bag in your right hand and toss it to the
top left corner of the imaginary square. (Lift very hard when you
toss.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Toss your second bag _ the one in your left hand _ to the top
right corner of the imaginary square.
</P>
<P>
   _ Catch the bag on the left with your left hand. Catch the bag
on the right with your right hand.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do this until you are comfortable juggling with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   JUGGLING WITH THREE BAGS
</P>
<P>
   _ In your right hand, hold one bag between the pointer and
middle fingers while holding another one between your thumb and the
other fingers. In your left hand, hold the third bag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Toss the bag held between the pointer and middle fingers _
aiming for the top left corner. (See top photo.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Then toss the bag in your left hand to the top right corner
and catch the first bag with your left hand. (See second photo.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Toss the third bag across to the top left corner and catch the
second bag with your right hand. (See third photo.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep going. You'll always have one bag in the air and one in
each hand.

 &HT;    Cuban boy goes home
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Six-year-old Elian Gonzalez returned to Cuba last week
with his father after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for
him to go. The court rejected the case of Elian's Miami relatives,
who wanted him to stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his family will stay in a government guesthouse in
Havana for a while, then return to his hometown of Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, Elian's mother drowned while trying to bring
him to the United States. The boy was rescued by fishermen. He then
was caught in a battle that pitted his Cuban father, who wanted to
take him home to Cuba, against his uncle and cousins in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The situation made many Americans question which was worse _ a
boy facing life without his father or a boy facing life in
Communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   READING THE `BOOK OF LIFE'
</P>
<P>
   Scientists last week announced that they had cracked 99 percent
of the human genetic code and should complete the ``book of life''
within the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has thousands of genes that dictate how their bodies
function and even what diseases they may get. In essence, our genes
are the instruction booklets for our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hope that understanding the genetic code will lead to
cures or new treatments for illnesses such as diabetes, Alzheimer's
disease and cancer. But it may take decades for scientists to
figure out just how to use everything they've learned.
</P>
<P>
   ROCKER RETURNS TO N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker (above) faced a roar of boos
and dodged a few thrown objects as he raced onto the field at Shea
Stadium last week to face the New York Mets on their home turf. The
Braves had not played in New York since Rocker months ago made ugly
statements about New Yorkers, minorities, foreigners and
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker quieted the crowd a little by pitching well. Before
Thursday's game, the left-hander apologized again for what he had
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, though, the New York Police Department sent about
700 officers to the game to keep the crowd from getting too unruly.
</P>
<P>
   BYE-BYE, PLAIN M&AMP;MS
</P>
<P>
   The M&AMP;M/Mars candy company has decided that the name ``Plain''
just doesn't do justice to their original M&AMP;Ms. So the little round
chocolate treats are getting a new name: ``Milk Chocolate'' M&AMP;Ms.
</P>
<P>
   The company has begun putting packages with the new name in
stores. It also is airing TV ads featuring a plain red M&AMP;M calling
itself a ``Milk Chocolate'' M&AMP;M.''

   One of Alice's adventures in Wonderland takes the form of a
race. When it is over, she asks who has won. ``Everybody has won,''
the judge, a dodo, replies, ``and all must have prizes.'' The race
to sequence the human genome _ or, rather, to claim the credit for
sequencing it _ is now over. So the White House's dodo-in-chief,
Bill Clinton, has duly awarded prizes to everybody. But let's not
forget that this particular race was not to the finish-line, but to
the starting-line. Knowing the sequence is really just the
beginning. &QL;

   His strategy for winning last weekend's parliamentary election
in Zimbabwe was worse than a crime. It was a mistake. Ready to
wreck the country in order to hold on to power, Zimbabwe's
president, Robert Mugabe, ruthlessly tried to refight the
liberation war, encouraged brutal intimidation of the opposition,
played the race card against whites, and promised to seize their
land and give it to landless blacks. Mugabe believes his right to
rule is absolute; Zimbabwe's voters beg to differ. For their sake,
his party, ZANU, could do itself and Zimbabwe a favor by dumping
Mugabe now. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   It used to be said that every foreign article about Japanese
general elections began with the same two sentences, adjusted for
the odd change of dramatis personae: The Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) would again form the government. And there would be no change
of policies. After the poll on June 25, the same can be said again.
But there is a difference: once, this saying was a compliment
(don't meddle with success). Now, it's a sign of despair (while
Japan's society is changing, its political system remains
paralyzed). &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Markets notoriously overshoot, in both directions. So, it seems,
can dot.com obsessions. For much of the past three years, shares in
Internet firms have climbed stratospherically, regardless of
whether they were making any profits or even any sales. The future
promised land, it was felt, was all that mattered. But now the
price of Amazon.com and other dot.com shares have tumbled, forcing
a rethink of ``real'' offline firms vs. ``virtual'' online ones.
The truth is, business bosses can behave badly, and companies can
make losses, whether in the new or the old economies. &QL;

   DENVER, COLO. _ Thank God for Greens. Amid the general po-faced
seriousness of American politics, here is a party that doesn't dare
to be dull. One pony-tailed wannabe presidential candidate from
Tennessee says that he hasn't smoked pot with Al Gore for a long
time. Another, named Jello Biafra, wants a maximum wage _ around
$200,000, he thought, should suffice _ and the abolition of both
the CIA and sports-utility vehicles (SUVs). And delegates in formal
evening wear carried placards saying ``Billionaires for Bush and
Gore. We bought the election so you don't have to.'' &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ The nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court are
famously shy of the limelight, preferring to announce their most
politically contentious decisions on the very last day of their
nine-month term and then go off on vacation, leaving a swirl of
controversy behind them. They did it again on June 28, in four
split rulings, capping a term littered with attention-grabbing
cases. It coincided with a presidential election year. Inevitably,
this has raised the question: how much impact can the next
president have on the direction of the Supreme Court? A lot. &QL;

century, party bosses paid the ultimate compliment to the brand-new
system of industrial mass-production by inventing ``machine
politics.'' Now that commercial America is in love with the
Internet, when will that, too, turn politics upside down? Is a
handshake still more potent than a Web page? &QL;

   HAVANA _ Fidel Castro might have won his epic Battle for Elian,
the six-year-old boy shipwrecked off Florida last November, who

   MEXICO CITY _ The last four presidential terms have ended in
economic turbulence, but this time it is going to be different. So
Mexican officials have sworn and, until recently, investors had
believed them. But a bout of nerves that began last month seems to
be worsening. This week the peso fell, briefly, to its lowest point
since February 1999. It is not just political uncertainty over this
weekend's election that is to blame. Investors are also worried
about the effect on Mexico of a hard landing in the United States,
which takes 90 percent of its exports. &QL;

will be the fuel cell. This is a device that reacts hydrogen and
oxygen together to release electrical energy. Environmentalists
like it, because its exhaust is water. And, after some initial
hesitation, the world's car makers are now investing heavily in
turning it into a practical reality. The latest prototype comes
from General Motors, which hopes to get its first fuel-cell-powered
car into the showrooms by 2004. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Live by the sword, die by the sword. In less than two
decades, Bernie Ebbers made his way from small-time motels to
big-time telecoms, eventually controlling a third of America's
long-distance calling and nearly as much of its Internet traffic
through his empire, Worldcom. Last year he crowned his run with a
deal that was then the biggest in history: a $115 billion bid for
Sprint, America's third-largest long-distance carrier and perhaps
its best wireless firm. But on June 27, the streak ended: Sprint
was one acquisition too many. Both America's Department of Justice
and the European Union's regulatory authorities moved to block the
deal. &QL;

   His strategy for winning last weekend's parliamentary election
in Zimbabwe was worse than a crime. It was a mistake. Ready to
wreck the country in order to hold on to power, Zimbabwe's
president, Robert Mugabe, ruthlessly tried to refight the
liberation war, encouraged brutal intimidation of the opposition,
played the race card against whites, and promised to seize their
land and give it to landless blacks. Mugabe believes his right to
rule is absolute; Zimbabwe's voters beg to differ. For their sake,
his party, ZANU, could do itself and Zimbabwe a favor by dumping
Mugabe now. &QL;

   It used to be said that every foreign article about Japanese
general elections began with the same two sentences, adjusted for
the odd change of dramatis personae: The Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) would again form the government. And there would be no change
of policies. After the poll on June 25, the same can be said again.
But there is a difference: once, this saying was a compliment
(don't meddle with success). Now, it's a sign of despair (while
Japan's society is changing, its political system remains
paralyzed). &QL;

   Markets notoriously overshoot, in both directions. So, it seems,
can dot.com obsessions. For much of the past three years, shares in
Internet firms have climbed stratospherically, regardless of
whether they were making any profits or even any sales. The future
promised land, it was felt, was all that mattered. But now the
price of Amazon.com and other dot.com shares have tumbled, forcing
a rethink of ``real'' offline firms vs. ``virtual'' online ones.
The truth is, business bosses can behave badly, and companies can
make losses, whether in the new or the old economies. &QL;

   DENVER, COLO. _ Thank God for Greens. Amid the general po-faced
seriousness of American politics, here is a party that doesn't dare
to be dull. One pony-tailed wannabe presidential candidate from
Tennessee says that he hasn't smoked pot with Al Gore for a long
time. Another, named Jello Biafra, wants a maximum wage _ around
$200,000, he thought, should suffice _ and the abolition of both
the CIA and sports-utility vehicles (SUVs). And delegates in formal
evening wear carried placards saying ``Billionaires for Bush and

economic turbulence, but this time it is going to be different. So
Mexican officials have sworn and, until recently, investors had
believed them. But a bout of nerves that began last month seems to
be worsening. This week the peso fell, briefly, to its lowest point
since February 1999. It is not just political uncertainty over this
weekend's election that is to blame. Investors are also worried
about the effect on Mexico of a hard landing in the United States,
which takes 90 percent of its exports. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Live by the sword, die by the sword. In less than two
decades, Bernie Ebbers made his way from small-time motels to
big-time telecoms, eventually controlling a third of America's
long-distance calling and nearly as much of its Internet traffic
through his empire, Worldcom. Last year he crowned his run with a
deal that was then the biggest in history: a $115 billion bid for
Sprint, America's third-largest long-distance carrier and perhaps
its best wireless firm. But on June 27, the streak ended: Sprint
was one acquisition too many. Both America's Department of Justice
and the European Union's regulatory authorities moved to block the
deal. &QL;

<P>
   One of Alice's adventures in Wonderland takes the form of a
race. When it is over, she asks who has won. ``Everybody has won,''
the judge, a dodo, replies, ``and all must have prizes.''
</P>
<P>
   The race to sequence the human genome _ or, rather, to claim the
credit for sequencing it _ is now over. It is time to declare
victory and get back to work.
</P>
<P>
   So the White House's dodo-in-chief, Bill Clinton, has duly
awarded prizes to everybody. There are prizes for the leaders of
the Human Genome Project, the publicly-funded entry in the race.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a prize for Craig Venter, the entrepreneurial
scientist who fired the shot that turned what had been a leisurely
stroll into a contest in the first place, by founding a company
called Celera Genomics to do the whole thing with private money.
</P>
<P>
   The prizes to the public project's scientists are the pretense
that the race was actually a tie, and that a commercial upstart
that is barely two years old did not really beat them to it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Venter's prize is the officially sanctioned respectability
that should give him a place on the invitation list (traditionally
limited to three people) to receive a Nobel award for medicine from
the hands of the King of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably, the unravelling of the full sequence of the human
genome _ a list, in order, of the chemical bases that encode the
information needed to assemble and run a human body _ is a
scientific wonder.
</P>
<P>
   It is not diminished by the fact that what have been announced
are ``draft'' sequences, and that dotting every genetic ``i'' and
crossing every ``t'' will actually take years.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it diminished by the fact that this particular race was
not to the finishing-post, but to the starting-line. Knowing the
sequence is really just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The actual benefits will come from the hard graft of
interpreting the data and coming up with uses for them. Those
benefits will be real, and may be spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Genomic knowledge, of humans and other species, will transform
medicine by introducing side-effect-free drugs that work first
time, expanding the range of diseases that are treatable and
refining diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   If allowed, it could transform agriculture by increasing the
nutritional value of crops and making them easier to grow. Even
industry should benefit, as microbes are harnessed to produce
chemicals that are currently either impossible, or too costly, to
make.
</P>
<P>
   And at a more elevated level, the biological knowledge generated
will enhance understanding of what, exactly, it means to be human.
</P>
<P>
   When triumphalism is in the air, however, it is always wise to
pause. These new technologies create extraordinary possibilities
that people find disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Many such fears, perhaps most, will prove unwarranted; and the
astounding benefits that this new technology is capable of
delivering are not to be cast away without good reason. But caution
is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The genome revolution will move the world into places that are
ethically, as well as scientifically, uncharted. That people are
nervous about genomic technology is obvious from the reaction in
Europe, and increasingly in America, to genetically modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   All the scientific evidence suggests that these are harmless to
people and no more harmful to the environment than more traditional
methods of farming. Yet a few uses of the ``F'' word
(``Frankenstein,'' not the other one) in newspaper headlines have
supermarkets clearing their shelves and activists clearing fields.
</P>
<P>
   If that sort of reaction greets the idea of plants that have had
single genes for things such as herbicide resistance transferred
into them, what will be the response to more heavily engineered
plants and animals?
</P>
<P>
   Quite apart from fears about health, which will probably
diminish if research continues to show them to be unfounded, there
is the question of what happens if something runs wild. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The risk that this may happen needs to be faced _ provided it is
also remembered that no technology is entirely safe and that the
most it makes sense to demand is that the risks are understood and
kept low.
</P>
<P>
   Any new organism will be designed for the cosseted environment
of farm or fermentation tank, not the big, bad world where
everything is trying to eat you or steal your food. But things can
go wrong, as with the spread of prickly pear in Australia early
last century or zebra mussels in the North American Great Lakes at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   A sensible risk assessment therefore needs to ask, in each case,
how bad could things be if the worst happens?
</P>
<P>
   More dangerous, however, than the inadvertent spread of
genetically engineered species is the risk that somebody will use
the technology to do deliberate harm _ by building better
pathogens, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Those who worry about Saddam Hussein cloning himself using the
new technology should probably worry more about what he is cloning
in his country's germ-warfare laboratories. That is because knowing
the human genome, and knowing the genomes of numerous pathogens, it
might be possible to re-engineer the latter so that the former
cannot resist.
</P>
<P>
   Against this threat there are only two defenses. One is the
eternal vigilance of the intelligence services of civilized
governments. The second is the creation of laboratories that could
analyze a threat rapidly and respond to it with a treatment using
the same technological nous that created the threat in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   For many, though, the real ``F'' nightmare is tinkering with
human genes in egg and sperm cells, or in recently fertilized eggs.
</P>
<P>
   This might be done for the best of motives _ to prevent disease.
But it might also be done for motives that some people, at least,
would regard as more suspect, such as slowing the process of aging;
or for motives that make most people, at present, very
uncomfortable, such as making your child more intelligent, or
better-looking, or more sociable.
</P>
<P>
   Quite possibly, parents will one day be able to equip their
children with capacities that are currently inhuman.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing lines across this squirming territory is going to be
difficult. What is ``natural'' is no guide. Man has already left
nature far behind, thank heaven: open-heart surgery is
``unnatural.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Morally, it is straightforward to put state-sponsored eugenics,
at least, utterly beyond the pale. At the moment, however, many
governments extend sweeping prohibition of genetic interventions to
individual parents, as well.
</P>
<P>
   For now, that seems sensible and cautious. But if the technology
proves reliable in other animals, pressure will grow for the bans
to be relaxed _ and it might then be wise to relax them, at least
in part.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, it might be right to shift the burden of proof from
individuals who wish to use these technologies to governments that
wish to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   It is at least imaginable that, in a liberal regime, the sum of
individual parental decisions might, for example, reduce genetic
diversity in undesirable ways. And governments, which rightly act
against child abuse, would be right to act against ``genetic''
child abuse in the unlikely event that perverse parents began
adding damaging genes to their children. &QL;

   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,275) &LR;  &QC;

   On the whole, though, if human genetic engineering looks safe
for the humans who are engineered, a light hand of regulation will
in the end be most appropriate.

<P>
   His strategy for winning last weekend's parliamentary election
in Zimbabwe was worse than a crime, it was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to wreck the country in order to hold on to power,
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, tried to refight the
liberation war, encouraged brutal intimidation of the opposition,
played the race card against whites, and promised to seize their
land and give it to landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Like his predecessor, Ian Smith, who believed that white rule in
Zimbabwe would last a thousand years, Mugabe believes his right to
rule is absolute. Zimbabwe's voters beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he now has the sense to listen to them, the damage
Mugabe has done in recent months will take years to repair. And the
nightmare may not be over yet.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an opposition victory, Mugabe had claimed, could
be entertained only in dreamland. Yet the dream almost came true.
</P>
<P>
   Roused from years of political apathy and determined to stand up
to Mugabe's thugs, Zimbabweans turned out in their greatest numbers
since independence and, for once, the majority did not vote for the
ruling ZANU-PF party.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the main opposition party, the Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC), defied Mugabe's racism by electing four
white MPs. Several ministers, close cronies of the president, lost
their seats. Crucially, Mugabe has lost the two-thirds majority in
parliament that he needs to change the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In time, this election may be seen as having broken the back of
Mugabe's increasingly autocratic one-party state. But it has also
created an explosive situation.
</P>
<P>
   The election showed up the natural divisions Mugabe has
exacerbated: the disaffected towns were mostly for the MDC, the
rural areas for ZANU; the minority Ndebele parts of the country
voted solidly for the opposition, the majority Shona areas stayed
loyal to the government.
</P>
<P>
   But for the intimidation in rural areas, the opposition might
have won a majority of seats. Yet the MDC leader, Morgan
Tsvangirai, has behaved with statesmanlike restraint, so far.
</P>
<P>
   He has accepted an unfree, unfair election because it has given
him and his supporters a moral victory. He has yet to say whether
he would join a national-unity government, if asked. Mugabe has yet
to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe badly needs a change of direction. The economy is in
ruins; it is expected to shrink by about 5 percent this year. The
country may not be able to feed itself. There is not enough foreign
exchange to buy fuel and electricity. Inflation may soon rise to
nearly 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Devaluation is an essential part of any recovery strategy. But
that means that a country already feeling impoverished by bad,
corrupt government is about to get poorer. Under such conditions,
one more stupid move by Mugabe could bring violent upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are now on the president. In order to prevent economic
collapse, he needs emergency loans. But to obtain those he must win
back the trust of the donors.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks of national reconciliation, but such words have been
cheapened by his own recent actions. The president has ten
parliamentary seats to appoint. He could offer one to Tsvangirai,
who failed to win his seat in the open election, and give others to
national representatives instead of ZANU party hacks.
</P>
<P>
   His government says it will push ahead with land acquisitions.
That will be fine, so long as the change of farm ownership benefits
the poor and landless, not the rich and well-connected, and so long
as Mugabe follows the law instead of encouraging violent
occupations. And he should let the police and courts pursue those
who used violence and intimidation during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's own eyes are on the presidential election in 2002, and
so are those of his supporters and rivals within ZANU. The party is
no slavish monolith. There have been two attempts to unseat Mugabe
in the past year. He held on by promising a huge election victory
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Now that so many voters have deserted him, Mugabe may yet change
his policies in the hope of facing a more contented and united
country in two years' time. But that is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ZANU could do itself and Zimbabwe a favor by dumping Mugabe
now. &QL;

<P>
   It used to be said that every foreign article about Japanese
general elections began with the same two sentences, adjusted for
the odd change of dramatis personae: The Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) would again form the government. And there would be no change
of policies.
</P>
<P>
   After the poll on June 25, the same can be said again. But there
is a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Once, this saying was a compliment; it was best not to meddle
with success. Now, it is a sign of despair; there is scant prospect
of an end to Japan's failure.
</P>
<P>
   Failure? Isn't that a little strong? Despite a decade-long
slowdown and then recession, which followed the collapse of the
country's stock market in 1990-91, Japan remains the world's
second-largest economy. Its unemployment rate, when measured in
comparable ways, is higher than in America but lower than in
France. Japanese people remain comfortably off.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some disturbing signs of social
deterioration, Europeans and Americans can still find much to envy
there. And the best Japanese companies remain world-class,
producing brilliant new gadgets or reliable cars with typical
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Japan is suffering from failure, nonetheless. The failure is
that, ten years after the lean times began, no government has
introduced the sort of broad reforms that are needed to take the
economy out of intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some changes, to be sure: more competition in
finance, more, thanks to deregulation, in sectors such as retailing
and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But, by and large, every government since the troubles began has
followed a policy of wait and hope: of postponing painful reforms
in the hope that the economy will revive of its own accord. That is
the policy that the re-elected, LDP-led coalition is expected to
leave unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that fortune will smile upon Japan. The economy
has been recovering for the past few months, with a bit of extra
consumer spending and some more corporate investment.
</P>
<P>
   If that were to carry on for another year or two, consumers
might gain enough confidence to run down their savings and spend
even more, and the government might be able to trim back its huge
budget deficit, now approaching 10 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   The room, and the political backing, might emerge for a genuine
clear-out of dead wood in the banking and life-insurance
industries, for wider competition in telecoms, and for other
much-needed deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past five years, however, economic revivals have
been brought rudely to a halt. In 1995 the Kobe earthquake
destroyed lives and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997 came the East Asian financial crisis, amplified by
Russia's debt default in mid-1998: the crisis walloped Japanese
exports, as well as adding to the already large pile of bad loans
at Japan's banks.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these shocks was Japan's fault. Nor, if it comes,
will the next one probably be: it is likelier to arise from a slump
in America, or a political crisis of some sort in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's fault is one of negligence: that by shrinking from
implementing proper reform, successive governments have left Japan
terribly vulnerable to another shock.
</P>
<P>
   If one comes, Japan's fiscal tanks will be empty; public-sector
debts already exceed 120 percent of GDP, and loom even larger once
the government's full liabilities are totted up.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, much of the Yen110 trillion ($1 trillion or so) in
fiscal-stimulus packages in the past decade has been frittered away
on unproductive projects, which have shovelled public money into
the grateful hands of one of the LDP's main backers, the
construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the main banks have in effect been nationalized. And
the public bailouts continue, this time with a rescue of a bankrupt
retailer, Sogo.
</P>
<P>
   What Japan needs is a vigorous clean-out of the banks' loan
books and their managements; the liberalization of farm trade;
deregulation and proper antitrust enforcement in telecoms and a
myriad other sectors.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no current prospect of this, or anything like it,
happening. Wait and hope. &QL;

E-COMMERCE ``NIRVANA'' GETS A NEEDED REALITY CHECK

<P>
   Markets notoriously overshoot, in both directions. So, it seems,
can dot.com obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past three years, shares in Internet firms have
climbed stratospherically, regardless of whether they were making
any profits or even any sales. The future promised land, it was
felt, was all that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   But now the price of Amazon.com, the most famous e-commerce
pioneer of them all, has tumbled. Some investors seem to have
decided suddenly that nobody will ever make any money from commerce
on the Web, so they are dumping almost all their dot.com shares.
</P>
<P>
   The truth lies, as ever, between these two extremes. The
Internet does not, and never did, hold out the hope of a nirvana in
which such things as cash flow, delivery of goods or sales service
would become trivia.
</P>
<P>
   It is therefore right to judge the performance of firms that do
business over it, whether with consumers (so-called B2C) or with
other businesses (B2B), on such traditional criteria as the
soundness of their business plans and their prospects for sales
revenues and profits.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what the markets are starting to do. At the same
time the Internet offers a splendid new medium through which to
transact business. That is why online sales of so many goods and
services are growing so fast, and it is also why so many
old-economy firms are redesigning their businesses around it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are some features of the Internet that justify a
substantial premium for the more successful e-commerce firms. A
combination of network effects, high fixed costs and negligible
marginal costs makes it easier for such firms to expand rapidly, to
trade globally and to preserve their first-mover advantages against
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with Internet as with some other new-technology
businesses, the creation of temporary monopolies or near-monopolies
that permit the creaming-off of high returns may be easier to
achieve than it is in most traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the really striking point about business on the Internet
is not that it is a passing fad that is dying out; it is that
almost all companies, from glamorous e-tailers to boring car
makers, are now doing it.
</P>
<P>
   One effect is to blur the boundaries between ``virtual'' online
firms and ``real'' offline ones.
</P>
<P>
   In retailing, for instance, Amazon now has a substantial
warehouse and logistical infrastructure, while Wal-Mart is building
a big online retail arm. As this boundary-blurring continues, the
underlying judgment about such companies will come to depend not on
how they are doing business but on whether they are any good at it.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers such as the recently deceased boo.com or the
once-troubled Toys ``R'' Us will suffer the consequences of poor
performance, but their pain will not have been caused by the
Internet. It will rather be down to such humdrum failings as being
badly run companies that do not make enough money.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of a convergence of online and offline worlds can be
detected well beyond the field of e-commerce. Consider the
much-hyped ``new'' economy, which has often been said to justify or
even to necessitate new rules.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that, as an OECD report this week has confirmed,
the new economy is far more talked-about than measurable. It is
also that, whether new or old, the economy actually observes pretty
much the same rules: overheating can trigger inflation, structural
rigidities will mean higher unemployment, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to another conclusion: that, online or offline,
regulation by government should be decided on broadly the same
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, new-economy zealots have tended to assert that all
antitrust intervention, whether in the case of Microsoft or, this
week, over WorldCom's planned takeover of Sprint, is bound to be
wrongheaded.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is that monopolies in the new economy are likely to
be more frequent but also more temporary than in the old. Best,
therefore, for regulators to stay out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   There is something to this. Because new technology and the
Internet can display network effects and increasing economies of
scale, some parts of them may tend naturally towards monopoly; and,
at the same time, technological change is so rapid that such
monopolies may sometimes prove temporary.
</P>
<P>
   So antitrust regulators should indeed be wary of intervening too
heavily and too often. Yet the lesson of the Microsoft trial is
that such intervention can still be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Business bosses can behave badly, and companies can make losses,
whether in the new or the old economies; the response in either
case should be much the same. &QL;

   DENVER, COLO. _ Thank God for Greens. Amid the general po-faced
seriousness of American politics, here is a party that doesn't dare
to be dull.
</P>
<P>
   One pony-tailed would-be presidential candidate from Tennessee
says that he hasn't smoked pot with Al Gore for a long time.
Another, Jello Biafra, wants a maximum wage _ around $200,000, he
thought, should suffice _ and the abolition of both the CIA and
sports-utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates in formal evening wear carried placards saying
``Billionaires for Bush and Gore. We bought the election so you
don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   And, turning to serious business, the platform calls for a
30-hour working week, the decriminalization of marijuana and
proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Greens had 43 elected officials in 13 states. This
year, the figure is 78 in 19 states. California's Green Party has
over 100,000 members, the largest single green party (they claim)
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Blithely ignoring the petty detail that he is not actually a
member of their party, the Greens' presidential candidate is Ralph
Nader, the celebrated consumer advocate, protectionist and
Economist contributor. (Yes, he once wrote a series of articles for
us on car safety but he has since grown up and condemns capitalism
utterly.)
</P>
<P>
   After the WTO rumpus in Seattle and the McCain insurgency, the
timing might be ripe for an anti-globalization independent. But
third-party surges have a way of looking good in June and petering
out in November.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ross Perot's 19 percent of the vote in the 1992 election
was disappointing compared with what might have been: in June he
had been leading the polls. And this time Pat Buchanan's Reform
Party is also competing for independents.
</P>
<P>
   For the Greens, electoral success means getting 5 percent of the
vote, enough to secure federal funding next time around. Their best
cards are Nader's name and the notion of a ``blue-green'' alliance
between blue-collar workers worried about competition from cheap
labor abroad and environmentalists worried about trees.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance of Teamsters and Turtles can work. The leader of
the Green Party of Gary, Indiana (one of America's biggest steel
towns) runs it from the offices of the local steelworkers' union.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Green Party was founded last year in the Houston
headquarters of the AFL-CIO after the two sides had teamed up
against a firm that had offended Greens by felling redwoods and the
union by locking out aluminium workers.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the Green platform, with its support for union
rights and a more generous social safety net, looks close to that
of a European socialist party.
</P>
<P>
   What about the idea that the unions are only supporting his
turquoise alliance to discipline Gore? Nader replies that he will
attract voters away from George W. Bush as well.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he will mobilize the 50 percent of Americans who do not
vote at all. If so, that would be a miracle. But nothing else has
got them to the polls. Perhaps some populist business-bashing
will. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The nine justices of the Supreme Court are famously
shy of the limelight, yet their dramatic timing is impeccable.
</P>
<P>
   They like to announce their most politically contentious
decisions on the very last day of their nine-month term and then go
off on vacation, leaving a swirl of controversy behind them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they turned in a vintage performance. On June 28, in
four split rulings, the court overturned a Nebraska law banning
so-called ``partial-birth'' abortions, upheld a law restricting
anti-abortion protests, allowed taxpayers' money to be used to buy
computers for religious schools, and ruled that the Boy Scouts can
exclude gays.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, it had upheld the famous Miranda warning to
criminal suspects (``You have the right to remain silent...''),
overturned a referendum result allowing voters in California to
cast a vote in any political party's primary, and knocked down a
New Jersey hate-crime law which gave too much sentencing power to
judges rather than juries.
</P>
<P>
   This week's judicial fireworks capped a term littered with
attention-grabbing cases. It coincided with a presidential election
year.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, this has highlighted the question: how much impact
can the next president have on the direction of the court? A lot,
is the most widely held view.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School, points out
that both candidates have promised to add more conservative and
liberal justices respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The most vulnerable ruling could be Roe v Wade, the
controversial 1973 decision which guaranteed American women the
right to an abortion. ``It might take three appointments to
overturn Roe, but even just one could undermine it,'' says Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal, then, seems to depend on how many justices (and
which ones) retire in the next four years. No one has retired since
1994, and several justices have had serious health problems,
including Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 75.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the nine are Republican appointees, and so might be
less willing to be replaced by Al Gore than by George W. Bush. But
with eight justices over 60, nature may intervene anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there are reasons to doubt that appointments by the next
president, whoever he is, will matter as much as people suppose.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the current character of the court. The Rehnquist
court is often described as sharply divided, with a narrow
conservative majority, largely because of a series of 5-4 votes on
federalism, affirmative action, religion and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The inflammatory language of dissenting opinions written by
justices in the minority has often bolstered this impression. In a
scathing dissent from the Miranda decision, Justice Antonin Scalia
seemed to threaten civil disobedience by continuing to apply the
law the court had just knocked down.
</P>
<P>
   And yet such overheated rhetoric is somewhat misleading. Most
closely contested cases have been over relatively narrow
differences of opinion about how to apply earlier court precedents
to new situations.
</P>
<P>
   The Rehnquist court has not overturned major laws or signalled a
sharp change of direction for the nation, as the 1960s Warren court
did. It was not supposed to be this way.
</P>
<P>
   In their five appointments, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George
Bush consciously set out to make the court more conservative. But
three of their appointees, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and
David Souter, have proved to be fairly moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The court's most consistent line of decisions has aimed at
restricting federal power in favor of states' rights, and it has
chipped away some of the civil-liberties protections. But it has
moved with comparative caution even in doing this.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone applauds the court's pragmatism. Douglas Kmiec, a
law professor at Pepperdine University in California and a former
Reagan administration official, complains that the court has once
again ``delivered the expected, common-sensical outcomes without
paying attention to the demands of the Constitution or its
history.''
</P>
<P>
   This may suit most Americans, but it turns the court into a
third legislative chamber. ``If arguments are not anchored in
constitutional argument, it becomes almost a lawless process,'' he
argues.
</P>
<P>
   In his view conservative justices such as Scalia, who claim to
adhere strictly to the text of the Constitution, are as guilty of
ad hoc rationales as the ``liberal'' justices. The result has made
the court's decisions difficult to predict.
</P>
<P>
   This term, for example, has seen Stephen Breyer, a
Clinton-appointee, lecturing Justice Kennedy, a Reagan-appointee,
on why soft-core pornography should not be delivered unfiltered
into homes via cable-television.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Rehnquist, long a fierce critic of the Miranda
decision, wrote this week's opinion upholding it.
</P>
<P>
   And Justice Scalia, a strong supporter of the court's
states-rights agenda, wrote the opinion knocking down California's
primary system which many _ including the two dissenting justices
who have consistently opposed expanding states' rights _ thought
was preeminently a matter for the states.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual incoherence, as well as political moderation,
of the court could make it more difficult for the next president to
push it sharply in any one direction, at least with only one or two
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, given their centrist positions, neither Bush nor Gore
may want to risk a bruising confirmation battle for a controversial
appointee. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Politics has few rules, especially in an election
year. But here is one: it generally lags commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 19th century, party bosses paid the ultimate
compliment to the brand-new system of industrial mass-production by
inventing ``machine politics.'' Now that commercial America is in
love with the Internet, when will that, too, turn politics upside
down?
</P>
<P>
   The arguments for sooner rather than later are not difficult to
make. The proportion of the voting-age population with Internet
access will hit 70 percent by election day.
</P>
<P>
   This wired world includes the vast majority of the people that
politicians drool over _ those with a high propensity not just to
vote but also to volunteer time and money.
</P>
<P>
   A traditional direct-mail pitch costs 30 to 40 cents per address
and yields a response rate of 1 percent to 1.5 percent. Targeted
banner ads on the Web have a similar yield for a dime or less. And
it is generally easier to get the people you want.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the old mailshots which ask raving right-wing
libertarians to give generously to Hillary Rodham Clinton. (``I'll
fight my heart out for the values you and I share.'')
</P>
<P>
   Now computers allow politicians to talk only to people who are
reasonably susceptible to their blandishments.
</P>
<P>
   Wistful politicians talk of reinventing the old face-to-face
politics of wards and precincts on a new basis: not the accident of
geography, but the glue of common interests and aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet gold rush is spreading to politics. All you need is
a moderately catchy name (vote.com, voter.com, speakout.com); a
moderately well-known political figure (Susan Molinari, Randy Tate
and Michael Deaver have all been recruited by start-ups on the
grounds that somebody, somewhere knows who they are); and a
moderately clever gimmick (attracting visitors to Web sites that
specialize in politics and then selling their names to candidates,
or selling ``campaign starter-kits'').
</P>
<P>
   Then you too can turn democracy into a money-spinner. But before
you rush to buy shares in one of these start-ups, it is worth
remembering one awkward fact.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's presidential race, the people who have made the
biggest fuss about the Internet have all got one thing in common:
they're losers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes predicated his entire campaign on the assumption
that the Internet would redefine politics in much the same way that
television did in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   He launched his campaign on the Internet, employed five
full-time staffers to work on his Web site, invented something
called the ``e-Precinct,'' which encouraged supporters to enroll
friends in ``e-Blocks'' and ``e-Neighborhoods,'' and even held
virtual fund-raisers, featuring private e-chats with the man
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He got just two delegates. John Kasich, another Republican,
styled himself as the ``JFK of the information age'' and maintained
such a sophisticated Web site that voters from Iowa, New Hampshire
and Ohio got different pages when they logged on. They didn't vote
for him, though.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley and John McCain had, by common consent, much better
Internet operations than the party machines that crushed them.
</P>
<P>
   The party that is currently making the most fuss about the
Internet is the Reform Party. Its members will be able to vote for
their presidential candidates online (which might save the world a
few punch-ups).
</P>
<P>
   One of the candidates for the job, John Hagelin of the Natural
Law Party, assures the world that the Internet will break the mold
of traditional politics. The establishment candidates are far more
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   With George W. Bush, this might be expected. But Al Gore, a man
whose idea of bliss is reading position papers on ``government in a
networked world,'' runs a Web site that is less professional than
his rival's.
</P>
<P>
   They have dabbled in ``electronic town halls.'' They have even
engaged in (rather tame) e-mail wars.
</P>
<P>
   In general, they have used the Internet as a means of speeding
up old-fashioned political combat rather than a means of changing
the rules of engagement. Thus they post plenty of useful
information. (It is particularly nice to be able to search position
papers and, in Bush's case, get up-to-date lists of donors.)
</P>
<P>
   They get volunteers to sign up (100,000 for Bush). But they shy
away from driving the political debate. Which is exactly as it
should be.
</P>
<P>
   For both candidates have grasped what eluded the cerebral
Forbes: that even in a country as big and wired as the United
States, politics is still about pressing the flesh rather than
personalized e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   As Joe Klein put it in his 1992 political novel, ``Primary
Colors'': ``The handshake is the threshold act, the beginning of
politics... He (i.e., President Bill Clinton) is interested in you.
He is honored to meet you... He'll flash that famous misty look of
his. And he will mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no substitute for the personal touch if you are going
to convert people to your cause. Presidents Kennedy and Reagan
moved hearts with the force of their rhetoric. Bill Clinton seduced
normally cynical journalists into becoming shameless apologists.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's success in raising more than $6 million online is
certainly impressive. But what really made his campaign was the
months he spent talking to ordinary voters in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   There is also no substitute for the personal touch when it comes
to mobilizing your political base.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore have raised about $1.6 million online _ a
paltry sum compared with the $21.3 million that Bush raised at a
dinner in Washington on April 26, or the $26.5 million that Clinton
and Gore raised at a blue-jeans rally there a month later.
</P>

   The very least you want if you are going to part with serious
money is a good dinner. That is not to say that the Internet is a
mere irrelevance. As the television and the computer merge, more
personality will be able to seep into the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Internet is wonderful at giving a vent to the angry
or a voice to the powerless. In 1998, with barely any effort, a
California couple accumulated $13 million and 500,000 signatures
when they pledged to stop Clinton's impeachment. Zack Exley's spoof
Web site, www.gwbush.com, has infuriated the governor as much as
anything else in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One day, as the technology improves, it may even produce the
fabled world of electronic wards and precincts. But for the time
being, at least, the handshake is still far more potent than the
Web page. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The last four presidential terms have ended in
economic turbulence, but this time it is going to be different. So
Mexican officials have sworn and, until recently, investors had
believed them.
</P>
<P>
   But a bout of nerves that began last month seems to be
worsening. This week the peso fell, briefly, to its lowest since
February 1999, and the central bank, worried about inflation,
tightened monetary policy slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The jitters were ostensibly triggered by worries that the result
of the presidential election on July 2 will be both close and
disputed. But investors have been uneasy for a while.
</P>
<P>
   When Moody's, a credit-rating agency, announced in March that it
was awarding investment-grade status to Mexican bonds, the premium
these yield over United States Treasury bonds fell for only a few
days before rising again.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just political uncertainty that is to blame. Investors
are worried about the effect on Mexico of a hard landing in the
United States, which takes 90 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
   And Mexico's economy is showing signs of overheating: GDP grew
at an annual rate of 7.9 percent in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials point out that this is partly because of strong
American demand for Mexico's exports. But cynics detect a typical
pre-election boom, engineered partly by higher government spending:
buoyed by higher oil revenues, this increased by 15 percent in real
terms in the first quarter compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales are racing ahead, too, boosted by higher real
wages. All that points to a slowdown after the election.
</P>
<P>
   But the odds are still against a 1994-style crash. The peso's
fall is not yet alarming: indeed, it was (and perhaps still is)
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the economy President Ernesto Zedillo will bequeath
to his successor on Dec. 1 is far sounder than the one he
inherited: the current-account deficit is much smaller, there is
almost no short-term foreign debt, the floating peso gives
flexibility, and management is more open.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect growth to slow to 5-6 percent for the year as a
whole. But that slowdown could still be bruising, if, say, Mexico
was unlucky enough to suffer post-election political turmoil, a
crash in oil revenue, and a sudden cooling in American demand.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the handover of power from one president to the
next, rather than the election itself, has been the trigger for
Mexico's economic eruptions. But this year, for the first time, the
election result is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   History is not doomed to repeat itself in Mexico, but officials
and investors alike will need to remain vigilant for the next few
months. &QL;

   HAVANA _ Fidel Castro might have won his Battle for Elian, the
six-year-old boy shipwrecked off Florida last November, who finally
returned to Cuba with his father on June 28. But his hopes that
this victory would prompt bigger changes in American policy towards
Cuba seem premature.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the United States' House of
Representatives agreed this week to a plan that would allow sales
of food and medicine to Cuba. But this apparent easing of America's
trade embargo comes with so many conditions attached that Castro's
officials dismissed it as ``a great joke which would in practice
change nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   How quickly the proposal will become law is not clear. On paper,
it is the biggest change in the embargo since it was imposed in
1960. Some supporters of the measure believe it heralds the further
gradual easing of American policy towards Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But under the new proposal, Cuba will not have access to private
or public credit from the United States to finance any purchases;
and barter, a common Cuban trading method, will not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Transport will be difficult and expensive, since any ships
visiting the island will still be banned from putting into a United
States' port during the following six months.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also bans the purchase of any Cuban goods by
American firms, and potentially stiffens the ban on United States'
citizens visiting Cuba by turning this from an administrative
ruling into a law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does it not soften the blockade, in some aspects it
makes it worse,'' said Ricardo Alarcon, the president of Cuba's
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cuba is desperately short of hard currency, it is unlikely
to be able to buy much food or medicine on the proposed terms
(although American firms may eventually find ways around this).
</P>
<P>
   Any strengthening of the travel ban, however, could hurt Cuba's
economy. Tourism is now the island's biggest industry, and tens of
thousands of Americans have visited the country illegally over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago, Cuban officials were speculating that the
fight over Elian would herald a real easing of the trade embargo,
and perhaps the lifting of the travel ban.
</P>
<P>
   That was because it seemed to show that the leaders of Miami's
exile community, who pushed for the boy to stay, were out of touch
with mainstream American opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the congressional deal shows that the Cuban-American lobby
still has political weight. In effect, the Cuban-Americans have
blocked a push by business lobbies for more open trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Many businessmen argue that the embargo has been ineffective at
toppling Castro, but effective at excluding them from a market
dominated, as a result, by European and Canadian rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Now that America has agreed to normal trading relations with
China, the United States Chamber of Commerce is to make eliminating
the Cuba embargo its top priority, said Craig Johnstone, its
vice-president, during a visit to Havana last month.
</P>
<P>
   But neither George W. Bush nor Al Gore seem to agree: to
Castro's annoyance, both candidates have sided with Miami over both
Elian and the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four decades, Castro's main objective has been
political survival. The fact that Congress and the Clinton
administration are at last discussing the embargo is being
portrayed in his government's propaganda as evidence of Cuba's
``power of resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the upshot of that discussion suggests that Congress is only
slightly more likely than Castro to start blinking. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Live by the sword, die by the sword.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two decades, Bernie Ebbers made his way from
small-time motels to big-time telecoms, eventually controlling a
third of America's long-distance calling and nearly as much of its
Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   He built this empire with a classic new economy strategy of
buying real assets with virtual money, in this case shares pumped
high by stock market enthusiasm for his company, WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he crowned his run with a deal that was then the
biggest in history: a $115 billion bid for Sprint, America's
third-largest long-distance carrier and perhaps its best wireless
firm.
</P>
<P>
   But, on June 27, the streak ended: Sprint was one acquisition
too many. Both America's Department of Justice (DOJ) and the
European Union's regulatory authorities moved to block the deal on
competition grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Although both Sprint and WorldCom are officially keeping their
options open, the merger is dead.
</P>
<P>
   For the DOJ, the problem boiled down to simple arithmetic: it
reckoned that it was bad for competition to move from three big
long-distance firms to two.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the stated objection was to the unhealthy
concentration that would arise from combining the Internet
operations of WorldCom and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the European regulators may have been reacting more to
the shabby way WorldCom behaved in acquiring MCI.
</P>
<P>
   It first promised to spin off some MCI Internet holdings to
Cable &AMP; Wireless to satisfy regulatory concerns, and then did so in
such a halfhearted way (it stole back employees and kept customers)
that the British firm had to take it to court (C&AMP;W settled for $200
million).
</P>
<P>
   Big companies on buying sprees run into antitrust issues all the
time. But this is different. Ebbers is a serial buyer like no
other.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade he has bought nearly 70 companies,
including several larger than his own. MCI, then America's
second-largest long-distance firm, was three times WorldCom's size
when the upstart bought it with stock in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   From its base in Clinton, Miss., WorldCom snapped up fiber-optic
networks, Internet infrastructure, data services, calling-card
firms and local telecom carriers, emerging as one of the world's
leading Internet carriers and business telecoms suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing did Ebbers call his first yacht ``Aquasitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers argued (as he would, of course) that the deal was good
for competition. Certainly, in a business where the price of
long-distance calling may soon reach zero (in part because of a
swarm of smaller competitors, including free Internet calling
services), the harm to consumers of reducing big long-distance
firms from three to two may be limited.
</P>
<P>
   Upstarts, such as Qwest, are well capitalized, while the
remaining Baby Bells should soon be entering the market in force.
Bell Atlantic already has nearly 1 million long-distance customers
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There is also plenty of competition (and money to create new
competition) in Internet infrastructure, the area that worried the
EU.
</P>
<P>
   But the regulators' real concerns went deeper. After MCI,
regulators on both sides of the Atlantic had simply seen enough
megamergers for now, especially from the cowboy from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't come back soon with another big one like this,'' one had
reportedly warned Ebbers in the wake of the MCI deal. Yet a year
later he did exactly that with Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the regulators saw in the WorldCom-MCI
deal echoes of a reanimated Ma Bell, the end-to-end monopolist that
they had broken up in 1984 after years of painful litigation. In
Europe, too, WorldCom was simply seen as an untrustworthy predator.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sets of regulators highlighted aspects of the deal
that they disliked, the list of parts that WorldCom would have had
to spin off (at less than preferential terms, given such a forced
sale) was impracticably long.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last days there was talk of wholesale divestitures,
from long distance to local networks, to allow the deal through.
But WorldCom decided that they would have undermined the merger's
financial logic and left the table. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700, OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT NEXT FOR WORLDCOM? &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom's core competence is buying other companies and making
more of their assets than their previous owners did. Now, it can no
longer simply buy its way to the top. It needs a new strategy. But
what?
</P>
<P>
   For a start, Ebbers could still buy other firms, provided they
were smaller and did not overlap much with its existing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom still needs wireless; Sprint's digital PCS network had
been that company's main attraction. Other wireless firms, such as
Nextel and Voicetel, are still available. But WorldCom decided last
year that Nextel was too expensive; since then Nextel's market
value has doubled while WorldCom's has shrunk, making it dearer
still.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, WorldCom could expand more abroad, especially in
markets and businesses where it is not yet strong. Or it could
change tack, seeking to increase revenues more from its operations
than from acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom has always been a better operating company than it was
given credit for; some of its acquisitions, especially MCI's
consumer business, were actually a drag on earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom now talks of shedding its consumer long-distance
business, which is both slower-growing than the rest of its
operations and an antitrust obstacle, and focusing on the more
lucrative business market.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point every company has to be about execution instead
of just acquisition,'' says Richard Klugman, an analyst with
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, an investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it could turn from predator to prey. There are plenty
of potential buyers, including European firms such as Deutsche
Telekom, France Telecom and BT.
</P>
<P>
   This week Deutsche Telekom, which has previously expressed an
interest in WorldCom, completed a bond issue that raised $14.5
billion; it also recently won shareholder approval to use shares
valued at $100 billion for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely, however, that the German firm, which believes
it needs to do a big deal in America, will now go for Sprint. It
already has a 10 percent stake and knows the company well from the
recently dissolved Global One alliance that included France
Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is likely to make life any easier for Ebbers or
his company. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It looks increasingly likely that the eventual
replacement for the internal-combustion engine in motor vehicles
will be the fuel cell.
</P>
<P>
   This is a device that reacts hydrogen and oxygen together to
release electrical energy. Environmentalists like it, because its
exhaust is water. And, after some initial hesitation, the world's
car makers are now investing heavily in turning it into a practical
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The latest prototype comes from General Motors. The archly named
HydroGen1 is a third of the size of the company's previous version,
yet it produces about 60 percent more power _ 80 kilowatts, the
equivalent of an average 1,600cc engine _ and GM's researchers
estimate its thermal efficiency at somewhere between 53 percent and
67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, up to two-thirds of the energy in HydroGen1's
fuel is ultimately channelled to the vehicle's wheels. That is
nearly four times more than the best gas-engined vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The car maker claims to have achieved several other significant
breakthroughs with HydroGen1.
</P>
<P>
   It can operate at temperatures as cold as -40degreesC. Even in
such conditions, it takes less than 30 seconds to boost itself into
operation, compared with five minutes or more for existing fuel
cells.
</P>
<P>
   But it is its compactness that really makes it look a plausible
predecessor to a production version.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel cell and hydrogen-storage system in the previous
prototype took up not only the engine compartment of an Opel
Zafira, but the vehicle's trunk and half the rear seat as well.
</P>
<P>
   HydroGen1 squeezes most of its hardware under the hood, while
raising the floor of the trunk by a modest 10cm (2.5 inches) and
the rear seat by 4cm. And the fuel tank, which holds enough
hydrogen to drive the car some 600km (400 miles), is the same size
as an ordinary gas tank.
</P>
<P>
   This environmental (and, potentially, commercial) paragon is not
the result of some startling breakthrough. It is, rather, the sum
of a lot of humdrum engineering refinements.
</P>
<P>
   These include simpler pipework, miniaturized electronics and a
better understanding of the ``envelope'' of operating conditions
that a commercially available vehicle must be able to tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   The previous prototype was found to be overdesigned. By paring
things back to match capabilities to requirements, a smaller,
cheaper fuel cell becomes possible.
</P>
<P>
   If it can keep up this process of continuous improvement, GM
hopes to get its first fuel-cell-powered car into the showrooms by
2004. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Had John Holland kept his balance the submarine might have
remained a useless military curiosity instead of becoming the ship
that revolutionized naval warfare. For 400 years before his fateful
spill on an icy Boston street, a score of inventors had
unsuccessfully tried to perfect a vessel that could attack from
beneath the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Their designs took shape in wood, iron, steel and brass, and
were powered by every conceivable prime mover, from oars and hand
cranks, to boilers and batteries, and internal combustion engines.
Yet no one could make the idea work. No one, that is, until
Holland. During his lengthy recuperation from a broken leg the new
Irish immigrant, a failed school teacher without a lick of formal
technical training, managed to make the pieces fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally in this unfair life the best man wins,'' observes
British submarine historian Richard Compton-Hall. ``Holland had
none of the important political and commercial contacts. He
complained that submarine designs were hidden to prevent
competition from other inventors. But this is exactly why Holland
got it right. He started with an open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   One hundred years ago this fall, on Oct. 12, 1900, the U.S. Navy
deployed the product of that open mind, the USS Holland. While this
fishy-looking, fume-belching boat would never fire a shot in anger,
it would reshape the fate of nations more completely than any war.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks by a German submarine on the passenger liner Lusitania
drew an isolationist America into the trenches of World War I. By
the time global hostilities ceased at the end of World War II,
American submarines so completely dominated the Pacific Rim that
the Japanese had virtually no ships left to sink.
</P>
<P>
   And if any one weapon can be said to have won the Cold War, it
was clearly the submarine. Deep-diving ``boomers'' carried more
than half of the nuclear arsenal. Fast attack submarines trailed
Soviet missile carriers and performed vital intelligence functions,
such as tapping deep-sea cables carrying secret Soviet military
messages.
</P>
<P>
   PIG BOATS
</P>
<P>
   The submarines that quickly gave America mastery of the deep
were descendants of the first generation of boats that followed the
Holland. Longer and sleeker, they were powered by increasingly
reliable diesel engines. During World War I the U.S. Navy separated
submersibles into two groups according to mission. N-class boats
chiefly patrolled America's coasts and harbors. K-, L-, O- and most
E-class boats patrolled the open seas from bases in the Azores and
Bantry Bay in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions aboard these boats weren't very different from living
in a minivan with a dozen of your closest friends. The squalor
below deck earned these early submarines the nickname ``pig
boats.'' Although no sinkings would be attributed to U.S.
submarines during World War I, the boats are credited with helping
to keep open the sea lanes along the European coast and critical
maritime approaches to the British Isles.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, the pig boat had
undergone a technological transformation. With the Salmon class the
Navy had at last succeeded in building a submarine with the speed
and range necessary to accompany its surface fleet. The era of the
``fleet'' submarine was born, and with it a powerful new weapon.
Pound for pound submarines would prove themselves the most deadly
weapon ever set to sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of a hesitant beginning due to the Pearl Harbor
surprise and difficulties with defective torpedoes, the submarine
force destroyed 1,314 enemy ships for 5.3 million tons, which
translated into 55 percent of all enemy ships lost,'' says Gary
Weir of the U.S. Naval Historical Center in Washington. Victory
came at a high price. Of the 16,000 submariners who put to sea, 375
officers and 3,131 enlisted men remain on ``eternal patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   A TRUE SUBMARINE
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of many naval historians, the USS Nautilus was the
first true submarine. Through World War II, submarines actually
spent most of their time on the surface where their diesel engines
could freely gulp the air and spin propellers and the generators
that charged the batteries used for underwater operations.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear reactor changed everything. Steam was generated by
nuclear fission, which required neither air nor a combustible fuel
source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producing the Nautilus became the most important goal for
reasons of national security, mutual profit and the sheer challenge
of harnessing the power of the atom to drive an American warship,''
says Weir. This technology found its first home in the Nautilus,
the first ship truly at home in the ocean deep.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time the Navy was experimenting with nuclear
propulsion, it was also re-evaluating the basic formula for
submarine hull design. Researchers at the Navy's David Taylor Model
Basin in Carderock, Md., reached the same conclusion Holland had
intuitively grasped from the start: Submarines should look like
fish.
</P>
<P>
   This new thinking debuted with the USS Albacore. A purely
experimental submarine, the vessel set a series of speed records,
and then underwent a series of rebuilds to test various hull
designs and counterrotating propellers.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of a true submarine, as opposed to a submersible,
coincided with a sea change in naval strategy. In the early 1950s,
fears of provoking the Soviet Union into an all-out war shifted the
strategic emphasis of submarines toward defense and antisubmarine
warfare. This required boats that could dive deeper, run quieter
and detect Soviet vessels without revealing their presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skipjack represented the consummation of a marriage between
nuclear power and the Albacore hull,'' says Weir. Since then every
nuclear submarine has followed the same design.
</P>
<P>
   BOOMERS AND HUNTERS
</P>
<P>
   As the Cold War continued submarine design branched along two
paths: missile carriers, or ``boomers,'' and attack submarines.
After a Polaris missile was successfully launched from the USS
George Washington in 1960, it became clear that submarines were the
ideal launch pads for ballistic missiles to check Soviet
aggression. By the end of the Cold War, 54 percent of America's
nuclear arsenal traveled in Ohio class submarines.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of the attack fleet consists of 62 Los Angeles
class submarines, which carry Mk 48 torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise
missiles. During Operation Allied Force in Kosovo, one in four
cruise missiles launched against a Serbian target was fired from a
submarine. Initially, these deadly hunters were to be replaced by
Seawolf class boats, but with the demise of the Soviet Union this
seems unlikely. The Navy now plans for only three Seawolf class
boats.
</P>
<P>
   FUTURE SUBMARINES
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's next submarine, the Virginia class, is scheduled to
launch in 2004. It will be the first submarine that is optimized
for attacking targets on both land and sea. Below deck the USS
Virginia will be configured to rapidly shift from torpedoes to
cruise missiles. An oversize nine-man airlock will put SEAL teams
into the thick of the action in hours.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of submarines hovering at about the $2 billion
mark, money has become an issue. To cut cost the Virginia class has
been designed entirely on a computer and will be built of modular
segments. ``The USS Virginia will achieve the right balance of
combat capability and affordability,'' says a Navy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Virginia class, both the definition of missions and
the shape of submarines themselves become murky. Strategists
believe future naval engagements will move from the deep ocean into
the ``littorals,'' the shallow waters near shore.
</P>
<P>
   Targets are as likely to be on land as at sea. The most
imaginative designs envision underwater mother ships that launch
SEAL teams, much as aircraft carriers launch jet fighters.

   COVERING OLD VINYL FLOORING
</P>
<P>
   Q: The house I bought has two bathrooms, and I want to put new
vinyl flooring in them. I'm not sure if the old vinyl has asbestos,
or even whether that matters, but in any case I would like to know
how to go over the top of the old vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Martin Cleary, Lewes, Del.
</P>
<P>
   A: As long as you cover the existing vinyl, it doesn't matter if
it contains asbestos. However, manufacturers don't recommend
covering over more than one layer of vinyl flooring. In that case,
manufacturers recommend removal. Then the presence of asbestos
becomes a concern. Unless you're certain that the vinyl flooring
does not contain asbestos, for safety's sake you should assume that
it does.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos in vinyl products is non-friable (that is, when it is
dry, it cannot be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand
pressure). But some removal practices like grinding or sanding can
cause the particles to become airborne.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to remove the floor, get a copy of a booklet
published by the Resilient Flooring Institute, ``Recommended Work
Practices For Removal Of Resilient Floor Coverings.'' Write the
Institute at 401 E. Jefferson St., Suite 102, Rockville, Md.,
20850. You can also request it by sending a fax to 301-340-7283,
but please don't call with your request.
</P>
<P>
   If the existing vinyl flooring consists of a single layer, you
can cover over it as long as it is well bonded. The vinyl should be
cleaned, and any surface finish such as wax must be removed by wet
stripping only. If the vinyl is textured or embossed, you should
use an embossing leveler to fill in and smooth out the surface.
Another option is to cover the floor with quarter-inch-thick
plywood, and then apply the flooring.
</P>
<P>
   TREATING SOUTHERN PINE
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to stain my new Southern yellow pine deck. Should I
first apply a water-repellent preservative?
</P>
<P>
   _ Joann Crews, Thomasville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can apply a water-repellent preservative, often referred
to as WRP, or a semitransparent stain, but you should not apply
both because an application of WRP will inhibit the absorption of
the stain. Besides, many semitransparent deck stains are
water-repellent preservatives with a small amount of pigment added
to give them color. These products will be absorbed by the deck,
and will inhibit mildew growth and prevent water from soaking into
the deck.
</P>
<P>
   It's important not to apply a stain that is more heavily tinted
than a semitransparent type. However, you can apply heavily
pigmented stains on vertical surfaces, such as handrail balusters.
People apply solid stains to their decks but are usually
disappointed when the finish performs poorly. Research by wood
technologists and finish chemists indicates that heavily pigmented
stains don't perform well on horizontal wood surfaces that are
exposed to the weather.
</P>
<P>
   REVIEW: BACKUP POWER INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   Many homeowners are left in the dark when electricity is
disrupted because they feel owning a generator is a hassle they can
do without. They'd rather take their chances or tough it out when
the lights go out.
</P>
<P>
   There is a backup power alternative to generators: A bank of
12-volt batteries that supply current through an inverter/charger.
When the system supplies current, the inverter converts the
batteries' direct current into 120 volts of alternating current.
When the system is operating in standby mode, the charger maintains
the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   These systems are designed to come on automatically and quickly
enough to prevent the loss of computer data. Incidentally, it's not
some weird idea cooked up by the battery companies. Various forms
of the method have been used for years.
</P>
<P>
   Trace Engineering offers literature that explains how its
systems provide low-maintenance backup power from an
inverter/charger-battery system. Generally speaking, you would use
this system to power a computer, lights, a refrigerator, a water
pump, and gas or oil-fired heating systems. Appliances that need
more current require a backup generator.
</P>
<P>
   Trace designs its systems so that generators can be integrated
into them. We were surprised to learn, however, that even without a
generator, some of these systems are capable of producing thousands
of watts for hours at a time.
</P>

   SHARKS REALLY DO GET CANCER
</P>
<P>
   The foundation of the ``cartilage pill'' industry, the notion
that sharks don't get cancer, has been shaken by a new study
presented at a recent meeting of the American Association for
Cancer Research.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on recent research, Gary Ostrander, of Johns Hopkins
University, said that sharks, skates and rays really do get the
disease. ``People are out there taking shark cartilage pills based
on very faulty data and no preventative studies to show that it
works,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   HARVESTING ELECTRICITY FROM DIESEL FUEL
</P>
<P>
   A device that makes electricity from burning diesel fuel is
being perfected by Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York and
Edtek of Kent, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   A low-pressure air-atomizing nozzle sprays fuel into a
combustion chamber. Infrared emissions from the flame are converted
to electricity by a converter that consists of a mesh filter and a
gallium antimonide photovoltaic cell. The filter reflects away
low-frequency energy that produces heat, but allows sufficiently
energetic photons to pass and stimulate a flow of electrons in the
photo cell.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the program is to develop a portable
thermophotovoltaic generator that produces 500 watts of 24-volt
direct current, while burning about 0.07 gallons of diesel fuel an
hour. A prototype operates at 10 percent efficiency. Researchers
say efficiencies could reach 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE EYES IDENTIFY CHEMICALS
</P>
<P>
   Recently declassified technology from heatseeking missiles is
being used to quickly identify chemicals. In some cases it works
5,000 times faster than conventional methods, says Purdue
University professor Jochen Lauterbach. The instrument bathes the
sample in invisible infrared light, and then looks at the resulting
unique molecular signature. Early applications will include finding
more efficient catalysts for pollution-control systems.
</P>
<P>
   MEET YOUR NEW RELATIVE
</P>
<P>
   Chinese and American scientists say they have found bones that
bridge the anatomical gap between lower and higher primates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to use the term missing link, but these fossils really
do fill a wide gap that previously separated higher primates from
their relatives,'' says Christopher Beard of Carnegie Museum of
Natural History in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   He coordinated the American side of an expedition that found 45
million-year-old fossils of an Eosimias centennicus in a limestone
quarry 350 miles southeast of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The find clarifies the family link among monkeys, apes and
humans, the researcher says.
</P>
<P>
   PHONE PAD LETS DEAF CALL 911
</P>
<P>
   A new way of arranging letters on a telephone will give the deaf
access to 911 emergency service, even from pay phones. The ability
to send words over phone lines is hampered by the lack of a Q,
space or Z on keypads.
</P>
<P>
   Placing the missing characters over the number 1 lets you send
the entire alphabet, says James Burrell. His company, AM Research
of Union, N.J., (www.8key.com) won a patent for the idea. He says
he will license it to 911 centers for a dollar a month. AM has a
similar system for use as a one-hand keyboard that helps to prevent
carpal tunnel syndrome by reducing hand motion.
</P>
<P>
   GENE SPLICING IN SPACE LAB
</P>
<P>
   Gene splicing appears to work 10 times better in space than on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, NASA conducted a DNA transfer experiment with soybeans
aboard the space shuttle. Of these seedlings, 9 percent exhibited a
genetically inserted trait, compared to 1 percent in the control
group on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even know if you could do gene transfer in space,''
says Richard Vierling, the Purdue University researcher who
designed the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   He theorizes that low gravity makes it somehow easier for
bacteria carrying altered genetic material to enter cells.
</P>
<P>
   A followup study will fly on a future space shuttle.

 By FENELLA SAUNDERS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trying to find something on the Internet is a lot like rummaging
through countless cardboard boxes in a dark attic. Even if the
search is eventually successful, it almost always turns up too much
junk. Worse, no search is ever comprehensive.
 &HT;    The dark attic of the Internet is only infiltrated as far as the
very limited capabilities of a particular search engine. Yahoo's
directory, for example, is merely an index of selected sites
cataloged by anonymous editors.
 &HT;    Other popular indexers, such as Excite, Lycos and Alta Vista,
send spindly bits of software known as spiders meandering from Web
site to Web site, sucking up bits of text from each page they
encounter and making a list of the keywords they find. This patchy
list _ not the Web itself _ is what a search engine actually
searches.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, search engines are having a tough time keeping
up with the exponential growth of the Net, which already boasts
more than 5 million Web sites and about 1.5 billion total pages of
information.
 &HT;    Experts estimate that the amount of information on the Net is
expanding by 2 million pages a day and that the best search engines
cover no more than 16 percent of those pages, down sharply from 34
percent in 1997. Spiders take months to finish one incomplete sweep
of the Web, during which time tens of millions of pages have
appeared, changed or disappeared.
 &HT;    So is it hopeless? Some Web engineers are trying to compensate
by developing swifter, more efficient spiders. Others look for ways
to transform the very nature of the search process by making it
more human.
 &HT;    Fast Search and Transfer (FAST), a new company with headquarters
in Oslo, Norway, has created spiders on steroids. FAST's programs
can index 80 million pages a day _ twice as many as spiders
dispatched by conventional search engines _ and may be able to
index all of the Web by early next year.
 &HT;    Instead of collecting data from spiders in one big list of
keywords the way other search sites do, FAST divides the
information into several hundred more manageable chunks and scans
all of them simultaneously, performing more than 600 searches per
second.
 &HT;    But brute force doesn't make the job of sorting through all that
information any easier. Marc Krellenstein, chief technology officer
of Northern Light in Cambridge, Mass., believes finesse is
ultimately more important than strength. His spiders do not have
the sheer muscle of FAST, and he could care less.
 &HT;    ``It may only be a quarter or a third of the Web that we've
indexed, but it's a better part of it in terms of its quality,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Northern Light classifies Web pages according to various
criteria, including a custom list of 25,000 subject areas. A team
of real, live human librarians spot-checks the classifications.
When someone does a search, the engine organizes the results into
folders, each with a subject title.
 &HT;    Both FAST and Northern Light still depend primarily on random
searches by dumb spiders, so the next step is to give spiders the
ability to recognize connections between different Web sites.
 &HT;    Reka Albert, Albert-Lazlo Barabasi and Hawoong Jeong of Notre
Dame are studying how the so-called six-degrees-of-separation
phenomenon relates to the Internet. In the 1960s, Yale social
psychologist Stanley Milgram observed that two complete strangers
are likely to be connected by a network of six or fewer
acquaintances.
 &HT;    The Notre Dame researchers have proven that the Internet is a
small world too. They did a statistical analysis of hyperlink
connections and discovered that the average number of clicks needed
to get between two randomly chosen pages on the World Wide Web is
19. Even if the Web expands to 10 times its present size, that
average will only increase to 21 clicks.
 &HT;    The upshot is that people could quickly reach any page on the
Web if only they knew the right place to start and how to navigate.
Spiders programmed to recognize degrees-of-separation patterns
might be an answer.
 &HT;    ``If something goes in intelligently and can see what links it
is following, it doesn't have to index everything,'' Albert says.
 &HT;    Such clever spiders are already in the works. Sridhar
Rajagopalan and his colleagues at IBM's Almaden Research Center in
San Jose have designed a prototype search engine called CLEVER,
which uses spiders endowed with a dose of humanlike intelligence.
They seek out hubs _ mini-index sites with a large collection of
hyperlinks on a single subject _ and authorities _ pages that a
large number of other Web sites put on their lists of hyperlinks.
 &HT;    CLEVER scores each page based on the quality of the pages it
points to and the quality of those that point to it, which in turn
affects the scores of all those linked pages.
 &HT;    By repeating this circular process, the search engine quickly
locates the best hubs and authorities. Instead of relying on the
judgment of editors at index sites such as Yahoo or America Online,
CLEVER gathers the opinions of those who really matter _ the
millions of people who have created Web pages and added links to
their favorite sites.
 &HT;    Rajagopalan considers that an advance over the current Web
chaos. ``We're giving people access to the collective wisdom of the
Web,'' he says.
 &HT;    A group led by Bernardo Huberman and Lada Adamic of the Internet
Ecologies Group at Xerox PARC is pursuing a related approach using
data from Google, one of the most sophisticated of the current
search engines.
 &HT;    Natalie Glance of Xerox Research Center Europe in Meylan,
France, hopes to add to the collective wisdom by fostering more of
a sense of personal connection on-line.
 &HT;    ``There are possibly millions of people doing the same search as
you, so how can we bring in the power of the community to help?''
Her answer: a software program that acts as a community search
assistant by cataloging queries made by many people looking for the
same kind of information.
 &HT;    For example, a generic search for digital cameras might generate
a list of cameras other people are considering and pinpoint the
popular models.
 &HT;    Glance has also created an automated process, called Knowledge
Pump, which would make it possible for people to submit comments
about Web sites and receive recommendations based on past
preferences.
 &HT;    One surefire way to foster more community spirit is to make the
search process less forbidding. That advance means doing away with
endless, incomprehensible lists of text.
 &HT;    WebTheme, a cybergraphics program developed by Jim Thomas and
his colleagues at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in
Richland, Wash., displays search results as a glowing galaxy, in
which each point of light represents an individual Web page and
star clusters denote related topics. WebTheme can also represent
data as a topographical map on which peaks show the largest
subjects.
 &HT;    Some Web visionaries imagine a day when intelligent spiders will
weave together connections between related bits of the Web,
creating threads that become something meaningful in themselves _ a
cybertapestry. When many people weigh in on a topic, a process
called group filtering occurs, which yields predictions that tend
to be extremely accurate.
 &HT;    Robert Lucky, an electrical engineer and corporate vice
president of Telcordia Technologies in Morristown, N.J., compares
the phenomenon to the national point spread in football pools,
which often produce uncannily accurate predictions of game scores.
 &HT;    ``Somehow, this process of everybody contributing a guess
settles out to something that is statistically accurate,'' he says.
 &HT;    Lucky is confident a similar process will make searching the
Internet more fruitful.
 &HT;    ``A lot of information in the world isn't stuff written down in
books; it's nuances in people's heads. If you put them all
together, you can form something better than any individual
opinion. As they say, nobody is as smart as everybody.''

 &HT;    Trying to find something on the Internet is a lot like rummaging
through countless cardboard boxes in a dark attic. Even if the
search is eventually successful, it almost always turns up too much
junk. Worse, no search is ever comprehensive.
 &HT;    The dark attic of the Internet is only infiltrated as far as the
very limited capabilities of a particular search engine. Yahoo's
directory, for example, is merely an index of selected sites
cataloged by anonymous editors.
 &HT;    Other popular indexers, such as Excite, Lycos and Alta Vista,
send spindly bits of software known as spiders meandering from Web
site to Web site, sucking up bits of text from each page they
encounter and making a list of the keywords they find. This patchy
list _ not the Web itself _ is what a search engine actually
searches.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, search engines are having a tough time keeping
up with the exponential growth of the Net, which already boasts
more than 5 million Web sites and about 1.5 billion total pages of
information.
 &HT;    Experts estimate that the amount of information on the Net is
expanding by 2 million pages a day and that the best search engines
cover no more than 16 percent of those pages, down sharply from 34
percent in 1997. Spiders take months to finish one incomplete sweep
of the Web, during which time tens of millions of pages have
appeared, changed or disappeared.
 &HT;    So is it hopeless? Some Web engineers are trying to compensate
by developing swifter, more efficient spiders. Others look for ways
to transform the very nature of the search process by making it
more human.
 &HT;    Fast Search and Transfer (FAST), a new company with headquarters
in Oslo, Norway, has created spiders on steroids. FAST's programs
can index 80 million pages a day _ twice as many as spiders
dispatched by conventional search engines _ and may be able to
index all of the Web by early next year.
 &HT;    Instead of collecting data from spiders in one big list of
keywords the way other search sites do, FAST divides the
information into several hundred more manageable chunks and scans
all of them simultaneously, performing more than 600 searches per
second.
 &HT;    But brute force doesn't make the job of sorting through all that
information any easier. Marc Krellenstein, chief technology officer
of Northern Light in Cambridge, Mass., believes finesse is
ultimately more important than strength. His spiders do not have
the sheer muscle of FAST, and he could care less.
 &HT;    ``It may only be a quarter or a third of the Web that we've
indexed, but it's a better part of it in terms of its quality,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Northern Light classifies Web pages according to various
criteria, including a custom list of 25,000 subject areas. A team
of real, live human librarians spot-checks the classifications.
When someone does a search, the engine organizes the results into
folders, each with a subject title.
 &HT;    Both FAST and Northern Light still depend primarily on random
searches by dumb spiders, so the next step is to give spiders the
ability to recognize connections between different Web sites.
 &HT;    Reka Albert, Albert-Lazlo Barabasi and Hawoong Jeong of Notre
Dame are studying how the so-called six-degrees-of-separation
phenomenon relates to the Internet. In the 1960s, Yale social
psychologist Stanley Milgram observed that two complete strangers
are likely to be connected by a network of six or fewer
acquaintances.
 &HT;    The Notre Dame researchers have proven that the Internet is a
small world too. They did a statistical analysis of hyperlink
connections and discovered that the average number of clicks needed
to get between two randomly chosen pages on the World Wide Web is
19. Even if the Web expands to 10 times its present size, that
average will only increase to 21 clicks.
 &HT;    The upshot is that people could quickly reach any page on the
Web if only they knew the right place to start and how to navigate.
Spiders programmed to recognize degrees-of-separation patterns
might be an answer.
 &HT;    ``If something goes in intelligently and can see what links it
is following, it doesn't have to index everything,'' Albert says.
 &HT;    Such clever spiders are already in the works. Sridhar
Rajagopalan and his colleagues at IBM's Almaden Research Center in
San Jose have designed a prototype search engine called CLEVER,
which uses spiders endowed with a dose of humanlike intelligence.
They seek out hubs _ mini-index sites with a large collection of
hyperlinks on a single subject _ and authorities _ pages that a
large number of other Web sites put on their lists of hyperlinks.
 &HT;    CLEVER scores each page based on the quality of the pages it
points to and the quality of those that point to it, which in turn
affects the scores of all those linked pages.
 &HT;    By repeating this circular process, the search engine quickly
locates the best hubs and authorities. Instead of relying on the
judgment of editors at index sites such as Yahoo or America Online,
CLEVER gathers the opinions of those who really matter _ the
millions of people who have created Web pages and added links to
their favorite sites.
 &HT;    Rajagopalan considers that an advance over the current Web
chaos. ``We're giving people access to the collective wisdom of the
Web,'' he says.
 &HT;    A group led by Bernardo Huberman and Lada Adamic of the Internet
Ecologies Group at Xerox PARC is pursuing a related approach using
data from Google, one of the most sophisticated of the current
search engines.
 &HT;    Natalie Glance of Xerox Research Center Europe in Meylan,
France, hopes to add to the collective wisdom by fostering more of
a sense of personal connection on-line.
 &HT;    ``There are possibly millions of people doing the same search as
you, so how can we bring in the power of the community to help?''
Her answer: a software program that acts as a community search
assistant by cataloging queries made by many people looking for the
same kind of information.
 &HT;    For example, a generic search for digital cameras might generate
a list of cameras other people are considering and pinpoint the
popular models.
 &HT;    Glance has also created an automated process, called Knowledge
Pump, which would make it possible for people to submit comments
about Web sites and receive recommendations based on past
preferences.
 &HT;    One surefire way to foster more community spirit is to make the
search process less forbidding. That advance means doing away with
endless, incomprehensible lists of text.
 &HT;    WebTheme, a cybergraphics program developed by Jim Thomas and
his colleagues at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in
Richland, Wash., displays search results as a glowing galaxy, in
which each point of light represents an individual Web page and
star clusters denote related topics. WebTheme can also represent
data as a topographical map on which peaks show the largest
subjects.
 &HT;    Some Web visionaries imagine a day when intelligent spiders will
weave together connections between related bits of the Web,
creating threads that become something meaningful in themselves _ a
cybertapestry. When many people weigh in on a topic, a process
called group filtering occurs, which yields predictions that tend
to be extremely accurate.
 &HT;    Robert Lucky, an electrical engineer and corporate vice
president of Telcordia Technologies in Morristown, N.J., compares
the phenomenon to the national point spread in football pools,
which often produce uncannily accurate predictions of game scores.
 &HT;    ``Somehow, this process of everybody contributing a guess
settles out to something that is statistically accurate,'' he says.
 &HT;    Lucky is confident a similar process will make searching the
Internet more fruitful.
 &HT;    ``A lot of information in the world isn't stuff written down in
books; it's nuances in people's heads. If you put them all
together, you can form something better than any individual
opinion. As they say, nobody is as smart as everybody.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 UNDER T.REX'S TOES  
 &HT;    Stephen Hasiotis was clambering around near Lake Powell, Utah,
in 1996 when he spied striking white structures jutting out of the
purple clay.
 &HT;    In the years since, he and his colleague Robert Wellner have
uncovered 100 more of the formations and identified them as
fossilized burrows dug by some of our mammalian ancestors 150
million years ago.
 &HT;    Back then, mammals had to compete against much larger dinosaurs.
 &HT;    ``If you were on the ground, you could be eaten or squashed. The
trees probably weren't very safe either. So, our best bet was
probably in the ground,'' says Hasiotis, a biogeologist at Indiana
State University.
 &HT;    The burrows have complex forms similar to today's mammal
hideouts. Each has several openings, spiral ramps, and three or
four chambers that may have served as living room, pantry, birthing
room and bathroom.
 &HT;    Based on the burrows' shapes, Hasiotis suspects the animals
looked like prairie dogs but with longer tails and extended snouts
for hunting insects.
 &HT;    So far, the researchers haven't found any fossils of the mammals
themselves, but Hasiotis plans to hunt for them this summer. To
uncover bones or teeth, he'll use hydrochloric acid to dissolve the
calcium carbonate deposits that have filled the once-empty burrows.
 &HT;    Soon, he predicts, we'll be looking at the actual remains of the
timid diggers who eventually took over from the dinosaurs.
 &HT;    
 HOMO INTOXICATUS  
 &HT;    Getting sloshed on a Saturday night may seem a uniquely human
tradition, but not if physiologist Robert Dudley is to be believed.
 &HT;    Dudley, a biologist at the University of Texas at Austin, claims
the taste for alcohol runs deep in animal evolution and is shared
with our close primate relatives: chimps, gorillas, and orangutans,
which have a known weakness for overripe fruit.
 &HT;    Ripe or rotting rain-forest fruits contain alcohol
concentrations as high as 5 percent, Dudley says. The odor attracts
birds, bats, butterflies and elephants.
 &HT;    Chimps and gorillas _ from which our hominid ancestors split
between 5 million and 7 million years ago _ will roam for miles
through tangled trees and creepers in search of fermenting fruit.
Sugar and alcohol provide primates with precious calories, and the
fruit in turn spreads its seeds far and wide.
 &HT;    Genes for alcohol addiction may have persisted in the human line
for the same reason that those for fat accumulation have, according
to Dudley's theory.
 &HT;    Modest amounts of alcohol are known to decrease heart disease
risk and may lengthen life. Animals predisposed to a little nip
would be better survivors, more likely to pass their DNA to the
next generation. That genetic heritage may no longer be helpful now
that alcohol, like high-fat food, is available on every corner.
 &HT;    ``Alcoholism is not just another addiction,'' Dudley says. ``It
is a by-product of our ancestral nutritional physiology. Once we
better understand the mechanism, we'll have a better shot at a
cure.
 &HT;    -----
 FRESH-SQUEEZED  
 &HT;    The blandness of canned orange juice is an unfortunate side
effect of the high heat and chemical preservatives needed to
prevent food poisoning. Now microbiologist Martin Cole of Food
Science Australia and others have developed a way to kill germs
without killing flavor.
 &HT;    Cole applies pressures of up to 100,000 pounds per square inch
to wipe out disease-causing bacteria _ including E. coli,
Salmonella, and Listeria _ in fruits, juices, fish and other foods.
 &HT;    The smothering pressure ruptures the outer membranes of bacteria
and breaks apart crucial proteins. The process also unravels animal
proteins, making raw meat look pale and cooked.
 &HT;    ``But people are looking at using the process to extend the
shelf life of meats that are already cooked and sliced,'' Cole
says.
 &HT;    Because of their rigid walls, plant cells suffer little damage
under intense pressure. Fruits maintain their texture, shape, and
taste, and juices taste fresh-squeezed after compression.
 &HT;    Flow International, a manufacturer in Kent, Wash., is readying a
commercial version of the technology. Pressure-preserved strawberry
jam, now on sale in Japan, proves the gastronomic benefits.
 &HT;    ``When you eat the jam, it is just like eating fresh
strawberries,'' Cole says.
 &HT;    -----
 ROBOT WATCH: THE BUCKSHOT BRIGADE  
 &HT;    A group of robots now roaming the University of Minnesota campus
can come to the rescue nearly as fast as a speeding bullet.
 &HT;    Richard Voyles and his colleagues at the university devised two
miniature rovers that can be shot en masse out of grenade
launchers.
 &HT;    One of them, called a Scout, is a wheeled cylinder that rolls
along like a soda can but has a spring-loaded ``foot'' to fling it
up stairs or over small obstacles.
 &HT;    A second rover, the TerminatorBot, has arms that unfold so they
can drag the rover along or pick up objects _ ideal for exploring
loose wreckage for survivors after an earthquake, Voyles believes.
 &HT;    -----
 POET OF THE PILL  
 &HT;    Working at Syntex, a private company in Mexico City, chemist
Carl Djerassi created norethindrone, a synthetic form of the
hormone progesterone, in 1951.
 &HT;    Soon after, norethindrone became an active ingredient in an oral
contraceptive _ famously known as ``the pill.''
 &HT;    In the 1980s, after years of biochemical research at Stanford
University, Djerassi switched gears and began writing about
scientific issues in fictional settings. He has published five
novels, including ``Cantor's Dilemma'' and ``Menachem's Seed.''
 &HT;    The first installment in a planned trilogy of plays, ``An
Immaculate Misconception,'' was broadcast on May 6 and 7 on the BBC
World Service and will soon be available on video from GlobalStage.
 &HT;    Josie Glausiusz talked to Djerassi about his dual life.
 &HT;     Q:  Why do you write fiction?
 &HT;     A:  I am trying to smuggle important scientific ideas out to
the general public. The vast majority of legislators haven't got
the foggiest idea about science or technology, and yet many of the
decisions they make are based on these things.
 &HT;     Q:  What are the key ideas in ``An Immaculate Misconception''?
 &HT;     A:  It deals with the ethical dilemmas we face as sex and
reproduction become increasingly separate. With in vitro
fertilization you can analyze the embryo and screen for all kinds
of diseases _ such as Down's syndrome or sickle-cell anemia _
before you put it back into the woman. But this is an expensive
procedure, and the only people who can afford it are affluent
people in affluent countries. We're creating another gulf between
the haves and the have-nots.
 &HT;     Q:  What will be the impact of a split between sex and
reproduction?
 &HT;     A:  It will change the power relationship between men and
women. Sexual reproduction was overwhelmingly in favor of the man,
who ran the show. But this reduces a man to what he really is: the
donor of a single sperm. That sperm a woman can now get without
sexual intercourse.
 &HT;     Q:  How will contraception change in the new century?
 &HT;     A:  I think that practically nothing will happen. I am
extremely dubious that we will have a male pill in the next 10 or
20 years, because the pharmaceutical industry is not interested. A
contraceptive vaccine is of least interest because there is no
money in it. The better such a vaccine is, the fewer times you use
it.
 &HT;     Q:  What about mifepristone (RU-486), the abortion pill now
available in some European countries?
 &HT;     A:  Scientifically it's one of the few, perhaps the only, real
major advances beyond the pill. Right now, nearly 50 million women
in the world have an abortion each year, and I think it behooves us
to give women various choices as to how to have an abortion, just
as we give people choices on what kind of contraception to use.
 &HT;     Q:  What is your greatest love?
 &HT;     A:  Curiosity. That's probably what keeps me young and active,
always wanting to get into new areas. That's why I want to become a
playwright. There aren't too many people who start writing plays at
age 75.

women. Sexual reproduction was overwhelmingly in favor of the man,
who ran the show. But this reduces a man to what he really is: the
donor of a single sperm. That sperm a woman can now get without
sexual intercourse.
 &HT;     Q:  How will contraception change in the new century?
 &HT;     A:  I think that practically nothing will happen. I am
extremely dubious that we will have a male pill in the next 10 or
20 years, because the pharmaceutical industry is not interested. A
contraceptive vaccine is of least interest because there is no
money in it. The better such a vaccine is, the fewer times you use
it.
 &HT;     Q:  What about mifepristone (RU-486), the abortion pill now
available in some European countries?
 &HT;     A:  Scientifically it's one of the few, perhaps the only, real
major advances beyond the pill. Right now, nearly 50 million women
in the world have an abortion each year, and I think it behooves us
to give women various choices as to how to have an abortion, just
as we give people choices on what kind of contraception to use.
 &HT;     Q:  What is your greatest love?
 &HT;     A:  Curiosity. That's probably what keeps me young and active,
always wanting to get into new areas. That's why I want to become a
playwright. There aren't too many people who start writing plays at
age 75.

 By THE EDITORS OF DISCOVER MAGAZINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 UNDER T.REX'S TOES  
 &HT;    Stephen Hasiotis was clambering around near Lake Powell, Utah,
in 1996 when he spied striking white structures jutting out of the
purple clay.
 &HT;    In the years since, he and his colleague Robert Wellner have
uncovered 100 more of the formations and identified them as
fossilized burrows dug by some of our mammalian ancestors 150
million years ago.
 &HT;    Back then, mammals had to compete against much larger dinosaurs.
 &HT;    ``If you were on the ground, you could be eaten or squashed. The
trees probably weren't very safe either. So, our best bet was
probably in the ground,'' says Hasiotis, a biogeologist at Indiana
State University.
 &HT;    The burrows have complex forms similar to today's mammal
hideouts. Each has several openings, spiral ramps, and three or
four chambers that may have served as living room, pantry, birthing
room and bathroom.
 &HT;    Based on the burrows' shapes, Hasiotis suspects the animals
looked like prairie dogs but with longer tails and extended snouts
for hunting insects.
 &HT;    So far, the researchers haven't found any fossils of the mammals
themselves, but Hasiotis plans to hunt for them this summer. To
uncover bones or teeth, he'll use hydrochloric acid to dissolve the
calcium carbonate deposits that have filled the once-empty burrows.
 &HT;    Soon, he predicts, we'll be looking at the actual remains of the
timid diggers who eventually took over from the dinosaurs.
 &HT;    
 HOMO INTOXICATUS  
 &HT;    Getting sloshed on a Saturday night may seem a uniquely human
tradition, but not if physiologist Robert Dudley is to be believed.
 &HT;    Dudley, a biologist at the University of Texas at Austin, claims
the taste for alcohol runs deep in animal evolution and is shared
with our close primate relatives: chimps, gorillas, and orangutans,
which have a known weakness for overripe fruit.
 &HT;    Ripe or rotting rain-forest fruits contain alcohol
concentrations as high as 5 percent, Dudley says. The odor attracts
birds, bats, butterflies and elephants.
 &HT;    Chimps and gorillas _ from which our hominid ancestors split
between 5 million and 7 million years ago _ will roam for miles
through tangled trees and creepers in search of fermenting fruit.
Sugar and alcohol provide primates with precious calories, and the
fruit in turn spreads its seeds far and wide.
 &HT;    Genes for alcohol addiction may have persisted in the human line
for the same reason that those for fat accumulation have, according
to Dudley's theory.
 &HT;    Modest amounts of alcohol are known to decrease heart disease
risk and may lengthen life. Animals predisposed to a little nip
would be better survivors, more likely to pass their DNA to the
next generation. That genetic heritage may no longer be helpful now
that alcohol, like high-fat food, is available on every corner.
 &HT;    ``Alcoholism is not just another addiction,'' Dudley says. ``It
is a by-product of our ancestral nutritional physiology. Once we
better understand the mechanism, we'll have a better shot at a
cure.
 &HT;    -----
 FRESH-SQUEEZED  
 &HT;    The blandness of canned orange juice is an unfortunate side
effect of the high heat and chemical preservatives needed to
prevent food poisoning. Now microbiologist Martin Cole of Food
Science Australia and others have developed a way to kill germs
without killing flavor.
 &HT;    Cole applies pressures of up to 100,000 pounds per square inch
to wipe out disease-causing bacteria _ including E. coli,
Salmonella, and Listeria _ in fruits, juices, fish and other foods.
 &HT;    The smothering pressure ruptures the outer membranes of bacteria
and breaks apart crucial proteins. The process also unravels animal
proteins, making raw meat look pale and cooked.
 &HT;    ``But people are looking at using the process to extend the
shelf life of meats that are already cooked and sliced,'' Cole
says.
 &HT;    Because of their rigid walls, plant cells suffer little damage
under intense pressure. Fruits maintain their texture, shape, and
taste, and juices taste fresh-squeezed after compression.
 &HT;    Flow International, a manufacturer in Kent, Wash., is readying a
commercial version of the technology. Pressure-preserved strawberry
jam, now on sale in Japan, proves the gastronomic benefits.
 &HT;    ``When you eat the jam, it is just like eating fresh
strawberries,'' Cole says.
 &HT;    -----
 ROBOT WATCH: THE BUCKSHOT BRIGADE  
 &HT;    A group of robots now roaming the University of Minnesota campus
can come to the rescue nearly as fast as a speeding bullet.
 &HT;    Richard Voyles and his colleagues at the university devised two
miniature rovers that can be shot en masse out of grenade
launchers.
 &HT;    One of them, called a Scout, is a wheeled cylinder that rolls
along like a soda can but has a spring-loaded ``foot'' to fling it
up stairs or over small obstacles.
 &HT;    A second rover, the TerminatorBot, has arms that unfold so they
can drag the rover along or pick up objects _ ideal for exploring
loose wreckage for survivors after an earthquake, Voyles believes.
 &HT;    -----
 POET OF THE PILL  
 &HT;    Working at Syntex, a private company in Mexico City, chemist
Carl Djerassi created norethindrone, a synthetic form of the
hormone progesterone, in 1951.
 &HT;    Soon after, norethindrone became an active ingredient in an oral
contraceptive _ famously known as ``the pill.''
 &HT;    In the 1980s, after years of biochemical research at Stanford
University, Djerassi switched gears and began writing about
scientific issues in fictional settings. He has published five
novels, including ``Cantor's Dilemma'' and ``Menachem's Seed.''
 &HT;    The first installment in a planned trilogy of plays, ``An
Immaculate Misconception,'' was broadcast on May 6 and 7 on the BBC
World Service and will soon be available on video from GlobalStage.
 &HT;    Josie Glausiusz talked to Djerassi about his dual life.
 &HT;     Q:  Why do you write fiction?
 &HT;     A:  I am trying to smuggle important scientific ideas out to
the general public. The vast majority of legislators haven't got
the foggiest idea about science or technology, and yet many of the
decisions they make are based on these things.
 &HT;     Q:  What are the key ideas in ``An Immaculate Misconception''?
 &HT;     A:  It deals with the ethical dilemmas we face as sex and
reproduction become increasingly separate. With in vitro
fertilization you can analyze the embryo and screen for all kinds
of diseases _ such as Down's syndrome or sickle-cell anemia _
before you put it back into the woman. But this is an expensive
procedure, and the only people who can afford it are affluent
people in affluent countries. We're creating another gulf between
the haves and the have-nots.
 &HT;     Q:  What will be the impact of a split between sex and
reproduction?
 &HT;     A:  It will change the power relationship between men and
women. Sexual reproduction was overwhelmingly in favor of the man,
who ran the show. But this reduces a man to what he really is: the
donor of a single sperm. That sperm a woman can now get without
sexual intercourse.
 &HT;     Q:  How will contraception change in the new century?
 &HT;     A:  I think that practically nothing will happen. I am
extremely dubious that we will have a male pill in the next 10 or
20 years, because the pharmaceutical industry is not interested. A
contraceptive vaccine is of least interest because there is no
money in it. The better such a vaccine is, the fewer times you use
it.
 &HT;     Q:  What about mifepristone (RU-486), the abortion pill now
available in some European countries?
 &HT;     A:  Scientifically it's one of the few, perhaps the only, real
major advances beyond the pill. Right now, nearly 50 million women
in the world have an abortion each year, and I think it behooves us
to give women various choices as to how to have an abortion, just
as we give people choices on what kind of contraception to use.
 &HT;     Q:  What is your greatest love?

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LARRY ROHTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Superlatives come quickly to mind when talking about Sao Paulo.
With 18 million people in its metropolitan area, this is the
largest city in Brazil, the largest in South America, indeed the
largest in the Southern Hemisphere.
 &HT;    It boasts of having the largest population of Japanese descent
of any city outside Japan, the largest of Lebanese descent of any
city outside the Middle East, the largest of Italian descent of any
city outside Italy, and more wealth than any city in what used to
be called the third world.
 &HT;    Paulistanos, as residents of the city are known, have always
taken pride in the cosmopolitan environment they have constructed
around them during the past century, but rarely more so than now.
 &HT;    All year long, Brazil is marking the 500th anniversary of the
arrival of the first Portuguese expedition to the New World, and
Sao Paulo, with a melting-pot population that personifies the
Brazilian ideal of racial democracy, is a focal point of the
commemorations.
 &HT;    Those who come to Sao Paulo expecting to find a laid-back
seaside tropical resort in the style of Rio de Janeiro or Salvador
are in for a shock. Sao Paulo is a very different kind of Brazil:
aggressive, sprawling and resourceful, with a different climate,
including temperatures that can drop to near-freezing at night
during the Southern Hemisphere winter (June through September).
 &HT;    Instead, Sao Paulo's charms are distinctly urban: restaurants,
museums, concerts, nightclubs, parks and window shopping along
Avenida Paulista, the main commercial boulevard. So are the
problems the city confronts, including poverty, crime and police
brutality. But even a confirmed Tropicalist like the pop singer
Caetano Veloso was forced to confess that, as he wrote in a homage
to the busiest intersection in Brazil's busiest city, ``Something
happens in my heart every time I turn the corner of Ipiranga and
Sao Joao.''
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The magnificent exhibition known as ``Brazil+500'' is the
largest show of Brazilian art ever assembled, spread over an area
larger than the Louvre in four separate buildings. With some 15,000
pieces on display, it is hard to talk about highlights, but the
sections focusing on Indian, folk and Afro-Brazilian art have drawn
especially lavish praise from local and international critics.
Admission is $5.75 on weekdays and $8.50 on weekends, at 1.8 real
to the dollar. Telephone (55-11) 573-6073. Until Sept. 7 at
Ibirapuera Park.
 &HT;    To mark the 500th anniversary of the Portuguese arrival, leading
Brazilian and Portuguese pop musicians are offering a monthly
series of free joint concerts at Ibirapuera Park. On July 30,
Gilberto Gil, Maria Joao and Mario Laginha will perform together,
with Ney Matogrosso and Marta Dias scheduled for Aug. 13 and Gal
Costa and Madredeus closing the series on Sept. 9.
 &HT;    Sao Paulo has numerous music halls featuring Brazil's top
artists, with performance schedules published in newspapers and
monthly English-language tourist guides. One winter highlight
promises to be a number of shows by the brilliant pop singer Marisa
Monte at the Palace, Avenida dos Jamaris 213 in Moema. She will be
performing weekends from July 27 through Sept. 9, with tickets $10
and up; (55-11) 5643-2569.
 &HT;    No rivalry in international soccer is more intense than that
between Brazil, which has captured the World Cup four times, and
Argentina, which has won it twice. The national teams of the two
countries will play each other on July 26 at the 80,000-seat
Morumbi Stadium, Sao Paulo's largest, at Praca Roberto Gomes
Pedrosa 1, Jardim Leonor, as part of the qualifying round for the
2002 World Cup. Call (55-11) 3749-8000 for information about
tickets (prices to be announced shortly before the match).
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    Ibirapuera Park is to Sao Paulo what Central Park is to New York
City: an island of green and calm amid traffic and skyscrapers. It
has numerous museums and pavilions, many of them designed by the
renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, and open spaces that
include lakes and playgrounds, which draw large crowds of families
on weekends. The planetarium, $2.85, is especially interesting
because it displays the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere.
The park is open daily, 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.; (55-11) 574-5177.
 &HT;    Exhibitions in which venom is extracted from snakes are no
longer offered to the public, but the Instituto Butantan, Avenida
Vital Brasil 1500 in the Butanta area, remains perhaps the city's
most popular tourist attraction.
 &HT;    One of the world's leading reptile research centers, it has a
collection of more than 60,000 animals, and its small museum
features live spiders and scorpions as well as poisonous snakes
with exotic names like jararaca and mussurana. Open Tuesday through
Sunday, 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Admission is 85 cents; 55 cents for
children; (55-11) 813-7222.
 &HT;    The Memorial to the Immigrant, at Rua Visconde de Parnaiba 1316
in Bras, is the Brazilian equivalent of Ellis Island. Nearly three
million people from 60 different countries, including the United
States, came through this processing center during the 91 years it
operated before closing in 1978, and their contributions to
Brazilian society are honored in thorough, fascinating exhibits in
a somewhat nondescript complex of brick buildings done in
neo-Classical style. Open Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission $1.15, half price for children; (55-11) 6693-0917.
 &HT;    Installed in one of the city's uglier buildings is its best
museum, known as the MASP, or Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo. The
collection here is said to be the largest and most impressive in
Latin America, with European masters like Rembrandt, van Gogh,
Goya, El Greco and Monet as well as leading Brazilian artists such
as Portinari, Anita Malfatti and Tarsila do Amaral. On Sunday an
antiques and arts and crafts fair is held on the square outside the
museum. Open Tuesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission
$5.75. Avenida Paulista 1578; (55-11) 251-5644.
 &HT;    Also on Sundays, the ``Discover Sao Paulo'' program offers three
bus tours departing from the Praca da Republica downtown. The Green
route shows visitors parks and gardens, the Cultural itinerary
visits the principal museums, and the Historic tour stops at old
homes and monuments. Tickets _ $2.85; $1.15 for children _ are sold
at tourist offices or through (55-11) 6971-5000.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    By Brazilian standards, Sao Paulo hotels can be absurdly
overpriced. Rates mimic those of New York, with service and
amenities that cost half as much in Rio de Janeiro or Salvador. But
on weekends, when business travelers leave, rates at major hotels
can drop by 30 percent.
 &HT;    Few of Sao Paulo's hotels are more reliable or convenient than
the Crowne Plaza, just off Avenida Paulista at Rua Frei Caneca 1360
in Cerqueira Cesar. Remodeled not long ago, it has 220 rooms and
large beds and bathtubs in which to sink at the end of a long day.
A standard double starts at $198 a night through the chain's
``Summer Options'' program. Telephone (55-11) 253-2244 or (800)
227-6963; fax (55-11) 251-3121.
 &HT;    In the 1970s, the Grand Hotel Ca D'Oro, Rua Augusta 129 in
Consolacao, was the most elegant place to stay in Sao Paulo. The
neighborhood has fallen on hard times, but the 265 rooms, most
still decorated in the same style as they were back then, are
large, and the Italian restaurant on the ground floor is one of the
best in town. Doubles are $150, breakfast included; (55-11)
236-4300, fax (55-11) 236-4311.
 &HT;    Budget: Sao Paulo is awash in what are known as ``flats,''
apartment hotels aimed primarily at the long-term business visitor
but also available to the tourist. One especially good option is
the Parthenon chain, which operates a score of these residential
hotels. Rooms at some, such as the Parthenon St. Germain on Rua
Padre Joao Manuel 202 in Cerqueira Cesar, start at $60, with
breakfast. The top price at this chain is $100. Call (800) 111790
for reservations; fax (55-11) 883-2476.
 &HT;    The Best Western Porto do Sol, Rua Tutoia 77 in Cerqueira Cesar,
is halfway between Avenida Paulista and Ibirapuera Park and
convenient to many good restaurants. Its 198 rooms, while simple,
are as clean and attractive as those of its much more expensive
neighbors. A double starts at $100, with an ample breakfast buffet
of tropical fruits and juices; (55-11) 3059-5000, fax (55-11)
3059-5193.
 &HT;    Luxury: Big, swaggering, always crowded and boasting such
curiosities as a restaurant specializing in Danish cuisine, the
Maksoud Plaza Hotel, Alameda Campinas 150 in Bela Vista, has become
something of a landmark since it opened 20 years ago. But the
imposing atrium and 415 rooms are starting to show their age, and
there is a certain air of snobbery that can be disconcerting.
Doubles from $350; (55-11) 253-4411, fax (55-11) 253-4544.
 &HT;    On the other side of Avenida Paulista, at Alameda Santos 1123,
sits the Inter-Continental Sao Paulo. The 193 rooms here are larger
than those at several other luxury hotels, the atmosphere is one of
cool efficiency, and there are many good places to eat within
walking distance. Doubles are normally $400, but some are available
through Sept. 15 at the ``Summer Options'' price of $200. Telephone
(55-11) 3179-2600 or (800) 327-0200; fax (55-11) 3179-2669.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Year after year, Baby-Beef Rubaiyat is the runaway winner in
every survey of Sao Paulo's best churrascarias, restaurants
specializing in grilled meat. The cuts may seem unfamiliar to the
American palate, but the meat here is extraordinarily tender and
lean, perhaps because the restaurant has its own ranch where it
raises cattle, hogs, sheep and chicken. Of the two branches, the
more convenient is at Alameda Santos 86 in Paraiso. Dinner for two
with beer, about $65; (55-11) 289-6366.
 &HT;    In theory, Antiquarius, Alameda Lorena 1884 in Cerqueira Cesar,
specializes solely in Portuguese cuisine. But one of its signature
dishes is a singular mixture of Lusitanian and Brazilian
ingredients: a startlingly delicate codfish moqueca, or stew, laced
with coconut milk. The atmosphere is charmingly rustic. Dinner for
two with a bottle of sparkling Portuguese vinho verde: about $125;
(55-11) 282-3015
 &HT;    The menu at Amadeus, Rua Haddock Lobo 807 in Cerqueira Cesar, is
devoted to seafood in all its forms, freshly caught just off the
coast less than 50 miles away. Traditional Brazilian sauces, which
make liberal use of coconut milk, palm oil, onions, tomato and
peppers, are the main feature, but a terrific shrimp curry is also
on the menu. Dinner for two with a bottle of Brazilian wine is
about $110; (55-11) 3061-2859.
 &HT;    In a city blessed with dozens of excellent Italian restaurants
and cantinas, Massimo, at Alameda Santos 1826 in Cerqueira Cesar,
stands at the head of the class. The osso buco is so tender it
almost melts off the bone, and the cheeses, eggplant, peppers and
olives used in the antipasto are extraordinarily fresh. Dinner for
two is about $125 (no credit cards accepted); (55-11) 284-3011.
 &HT;    For cheap, appetizing eating, Paulistanos often turn to
restaurants offering food by the kilogram, most of which charge
$4.50 to $5.50 a pound. There is a large concentration of these
self-service buffet-style cafeterias in Rua Augusta. One that
stands out for its varied menu and mouth-watering desserts is the
Parque Avenida Grill, Avenida Paulista 1776; (55-11) 283-0201.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By NICOLE KRAUSS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The first time I was in the Peloponnesus, it was midwinter, and
out of the low fog that was everywhere goatherds seemed to appear
and dissolve as if in a Theo Angelopoulos film. The narrow roads
etched into the mountainside threatened to fall off into clouds.
 &HT;    At every switchback turn, a small, mailbox-like shrine with
faded icon, biscuits and half-empty bottle of Fanta seemed placed
to ensure safe passage.
 &HT;    Despite the cool air, the orange groves along the roadside were
fragrant, and as I walked between the rows of trees, the silence
was punctuated by the thud of ripe oranges dropping. The
archaeological sites _ and often it seemed the peninsula itself _
were empty of people.
 &HT;    Aside from the phantom goatherds and the men in the kafeneia
smoking and fingering their knotted worry beads, the most evident
signs of life were the occasional smoldering heaps of rubbish that
slid down the mountainside like scree.
 &HT;    In that strange weather there was something almost threatening
about the loom and lunge of the mountains. Alone among the ruins of
Olympia or Epidaurus, I couldn't shake a feeling of eerieness and
half expected, at any moment, to encounter some ancient shade
walking among the broken columns.
 &HT;    It's no surprise that at times the Peloponnesus seems haunted.
The Isle of Pelops is named for the boy slaughtered and cooked by
his father, Tantalus, and served to the gods. Brought back to life
by the outraged Zeus, Pelops eventually became a king.
 &HT;    Later a curse was put on him by a man he tricked, so that for
generations the House of Pelops was plagued by murders and
vendettas, by the same grisly plots compulsively repeated.
 &HT;    But in spring the Peloponnesus changes. It is as if the curse
lifts with the fog and the valleys and hillsides suddenly flower.
With 6,000 species of flowering plants, Greece has some of the most
extensive flora of any European country. The fields fill with
larkspur, anemones and asphodel, with stalks of giant fennel in
whose slow-burning pith Prometheus brought fire to the Earth. Pink
and white oleanders hem the roads, and house fronts are decorated
with shocks of bougainvillea.
 &HT;    But despite the abundance of flowers and the bright sun, much of
the Peloponnesus retains a kind of severity year-round: even in
that fabled idyll, Arcadia, the barren mountain peaks are always
present. The occasional monasteries built into sheer cliff faces
remind the traveler of the isolation of the place.
 &HT;    This time I returned to the Peloponnesus in June, to rent a
house with a friend on the beach with no address or phone. Aside
from this, its most remarkable detail was the blowzy red lampshade
that hung, with its delusions of grandeur, over the kitchen table.
Everything else about the house was simple and rustic.
 &HT;    Its only luxury was the garden, so packed with oleanders, lemon,
fig and pomegranate trees that it threatened to engulf the cottage
in its green embrace. In Greece it is impossible to forget that
everything must eventually fall to ruin; what little remains
depends on freak chance or the serendipity of archaeologists.
 &HT;    Behind the garden walls that backed up onto a grove of
lime-washed olive trees, Ben and I spent whole days reading.
Clothes became mostly useless. Even as we read about ancient
Greece, civilization seemed to stall or slip a notch.
 &HT;    We told time by the constantly changing light or the sounds
around us: the clatter of cicadas or the bells from the small
church where the priest sang his drafty evensong, the doors on all
sides of the cruciform church thrown open to his congregation of
zero. Only in the evenings, when the stubborn heat finally began to
give in, would we venture out to swim in the clear Ionian Sea.
 &HT;    Our house was on the western coast of the Mani, the middle of
the three southern switchblades of land that jut into the sea. It
was partly Patrick Leigh Fermor's exhaustive book ``Mani,''
published in the 1950s, that originally drew us to the place; the
house we rented outside the little town of Stoupa was only a few
miles away from his.
 &HT;    Mr. Fermor describes the map of the southern part of the
Peloponnesus as ``a misshapen tooth fresh torn from its gum with
three peninsulas jutting southward in jagged and carious roots.''
The middle carious root _ a description that conjures not only its
shape but also its character _ is the Mani.
 &HT;    The sharp spine of the Taygetos mountain range rips down its
length, and on its hard, boulder-strewn plateaus a fierce and
passionate race of people lived in a perpetual state of war.
 &HT;    Descended from Spartans, Slavs, and Frankish crusaders, the
Maniots' way of life revolved around bloody family feuds waged with
yataghans (short Turkish sabers with double-curved blades), axes
and muskets; when a feud was on a Maniot could not leave his house
without dodging a volley of bullets.
 &HT;    The Maniots lived in austere stone tower houses, the better to
aim at and pick off a neighbor. They were feared by other Greeks,
many of whom still keep a wide berth of the peninsula. Not much
remains of the Maniots now, having killed off or tired each other
out, and their surviving progeny packed up and moved to Athens. The
wrecks of their domestic fortresses _ sometimes whole villages of
them _ seem outcroppings of the very rock that forms the wild and
lonely hills.
 &HT;    On weekends we explored the Peloponnesus _ often on overnight
trips _ in a car we rented in Stoupa, the town where Kazantzakis
created the larger-than-life character Zorba. On our first
excursion we headed south, deep into the Mani. We stopped for an
early breakfast at the Krifos Kipos taverna in the tiny fishing
village of Agios Nikolaos and watched the caiques come in, hung
with kerosene lanterns and laden with the morning's catch of fish.
 &HT;    The serenity was only occasionally punctured by cries of the
ubiquitous traveling salesmen who advertise their wares, whether
watermelons or plastic chairs, from megaphones mounted on the roofs
of their trucks.
 &HT;    After Agios Nikolaos the road climbs inland into the mountains
before cutting back to the coast to descend on the Bay of Limeni,
where the white-capped sea bites deeply into the cliffs. In the
Maniot town of Areopolis (named, appropriately, for the god of war)
the cobbled streets are lined with tower houses whose whitewashed
rooms look out onto slopes of prickly pear.
 &HT;    Nearby are the caves of Pirgos Dirou where, for less than the
mythical gold coin, a gruff Charon punted us on a skiff through the
miles of stalactite-hung grottoes said to extend inland as far as
Sparta.
 &HT;    After Areopolis the Mani becomes more desolate; this stretch of
the Taygetos is dubbed the Kakovounia, or Evil Mountains. In
summer, the temperature rises until it reaches the sort of heat
that breeds hallucinations or madness. Nothing much grows there
except for scrub or scorched grass, yet it is tremendously
beautiful.
 &HT;    At the highest points clusters of tower houses still stand vigil
above the sea. And everywhere the ruins of stout stone walls
criss-cross the plateaus: surreal boundaries that mark one share of
nothingness from the next. We passed a dust-covered mason breaking
stones by the roadside in the noonday sun, but he spoke no English
and we spoke little Greek and so we couldn't extract from him the
reason for that infinite network of senseless walls. But he happily
posed for a picture.
 &HT;    After the ghost town of Vatheia _ whose tower houses have been
converted into an eccentric hotel _ the peninsula narrows toward
its end, Cape Tainaron, the location of the mythical gates to the
Underworld. The beaches widen (Marmari is one of the most
beautiful) and the sea, surprisingly warm, breaks in tremendous
waves. By the time we arrived at the very tip of the cape it was
already evening.
 &HT;    Around the ruins of the Temple of Poseidon the wind bent the
gold grass toward the sea; directly above us the sky was stamped by
the first sliver of moon. Somewhere nearby was the cave where
Hercules supposedly descended to the Underworld to bring back the
three-headed dog, Cerberus. But we stopped short of finding it,
feeling some things are better left to the imagination.
 &HT;    The Peloponnesus has some of the finest classical ruins in the
world. The acoustics in the amphitheater of Epidaurus _ one of the
greatest sites _ are so perfect that even from the uppermost tier a
whisper from the stage is audible.
 &HT;    When I brushed my foot along the circle that marks center stage
a twang rang out as from an amplified steel guitar. Behind the
theater are the vast ruins of the spa where invalids came from all
over the Hellenic world to convalesce with the aid of therapeutic
baths, poultices and miraculous cures.
 &HT;    In the mountains of Arcadia, up a winding road of treacherous
hairpin turns, is the limestone Temple of Bassae, erected around
420 B.C. _ in the middle of nowhere _ by Ictinus, the architect of
the Parthenon. In Pylos, in the remains of Nestor's Palace, you can
stand in what's left of the great hall where Telemachus came to ask
for news of his father. The most remarkable surviving detail of the
ruins is an intact terra-cotta tub, last bathed in some 3,000 years
ago.
 &HT;    In the northeast region of the Peloponnesus is Mycenae, first
excavated in the 19th century by Heinrich Schliemann, the
indigo-merchant-turned-archaeologist who discovered Troy. Upon
opening the most elaborate of the royal tombs, he wrote to the King
of Greece, ``I have stared into the face of Agamemnon.''
 &HT;    From 1400 to 1200 B.C. Mycenae was the most powerful kingdom in
Greece. In the rooms of the ruined palace there, Clytemnestra and
her lover, Aegisthus, murdered her husband in a bath to avenge the
sacrifice of her daughter; her children Orestes and Electra, in
turn, murdered Clytemnestra.
 &HT;    To me, the most moving ancient site in the Peloponnesus is
Olympia. The first time I was there it was February and raining,
and I was alone in the place. It made such an impression on me
that, as the summer was running out, I insisted on a last trip to
see it again. Every four years, for almost 1,200 years, athletes
made a pilgrimage to this quiet grove of pines to strive to achieve
the heights of human strength, grace, speed and agility.
 &HT;    Although the hippodrome has long since sunk into the silt of the
Alfios River, the temples and most of the buildings remain, as does
the short-distance track. It is around 600 feet long, with hills
for specta tors on either side and stone slabs cut with grooves
where the runners crouched before the start signal. No one else was
around when we were there so we took our sandals off and raced each
other barefoot, neck and neck, pounding the ground packed down by
time and countless ancient races.
 &HT;    But history did not end on the Peloponnesus with the fall of
Greece. The landscape is scattered with signs of all who followed
the invasion of the Romans: Goths, Avars and Slavs, the Byzantines,
Franks, Turks and Venetians. After the perfection of Praxiteles'
sculptures or still-extant geometry of a Grecian temple, these
medieval ruins may seem crude and insubstantial.
 &HT;    But atop the rock of Monemvasia, inside the 13th-century
Byzantine church with its humbled frescoes, one suddenly feels the
illumination of those dark ages, sensing the very pattern of
history itself with its endlessly repeating eras of chaos and
order.
 &HT;    And even as one is constantly aware of all that has been lost,
there are also reminders of what is continuous: the
thousand-year-old monastery of St. John the Baptist outside the
mountain town of Stemnitsa, for example, where the monks waved down
to us from their hawk's perch to offer us coffee and a bowl of
Turkish de light.
 &HT;    At the end of each of our weekend excursions _ to the southern
tip of the Mani, to Monemvasia, Olympia, Arcadia _ we found
ourselves eager to return to our small house. After such a close
study of the ravages of time, there is a certain comfort in a place
where nothing seems to happen.
 &HT;    The day's only events were the start or finish of a book, the
evening baptism in the Ionian, and our meals at the house or our
favorite taverna, Agrogiali, usually accompanied by a carafe of
retsina, the local wine made with pine resin.
 &HT;    Under the influence of that good drink, with the sun gone down
leaving the houses glowing like lamps, a poem by Constantine Cavafy
came to mind.
 &HT;    ``That we've broken their statues,/that we've driven them out of
their temples,/doesn't mean at all that the gods are dead.'' The
poem ends with an ethereal figure in rapid flight, winging across
the hills: a further explanation, perhaps, for the occasional
ghostliness of the place.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: IN A LAND HAUNTED BY A LONG HISTORY  
 LOGISTICS  
 &HT;    The airport at Kalamata, around 30 miles from Stoupa, has
flights from Athens on Olympic Airways. Travelers can also fly into
Athens, then take a bus or rent a car. There are frequent (if
rickety) buses to all major towns. A hydrofoil connects Piraeus and
Monemvasia.
 &HT;    Some of the classical sites in the Peloponnesus can be reached
on a day trip from the Mani, but an overnight stay is needed for
Epidaurus and Mycenae.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The Peloponnesus is largely untouched by tourism, which means
there are almost no luxury hotels. Renting a house is probably the
best option. We found ours advertised in The New York Review of
Books.
 &HT;    There are also a number of small, charming and relatively
inexpensive inns. The Thomeas Travel Agency in Stoupa, (30-721)
77689; fax (30-721) 77571, can help with accommodations. A studio
for two people with bath and cooking facilities runs about $42 a
day in high season (July through September); a two-bedroom villa,
around $70 (at 360 drachmas to the dollar). Ask for Bob Barrow, an
English expatriate who published his own book about the Mani.
 &HT;    In the Mani, Limeni Village, near Areopolis, (30-733) 51111, fax
(30-733) 51182, perched on a cliff overlooking Limeni Bay, has
spectacular views. Its 35 rooms are in replicas of tower houses; a
restaurant with a terrace overlooks the sea. There is also a
swimming pool. Doubles cost $64 in July and August, with buffet
breakfast, $50 the rest of the year.
 &HT;    In Vatheia there are lodgings in restored ruins of tower houses
atop a rocky escarpment, with sweeping views down to the ocean.
Information: (30-733) 55244. A double is $44 in summer, $39 in
winter.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Lela's Taverna in Kardamyli, (30-721) 73541, is run by a
wonderful woman (and an excellent cook) who used to be the
housekeeper for Patrick Leigh Fermor, author of the fascinating
book ``Mani.'' The tables are under a grape arbor overlooking the
sea. Dinner for two with house wine, around $20. Dinner nightly;
open all day on weekends in summer.
 &HT;    The Rapteas family run Agrogiali, (30-721) 77335, formerly a
taverna and now an ouzeria serving drinks, snacks and sweets. It's
on the southern end of the main beach. At the Krifos Kipos taverna
in Agios Nikolaos, you can sit at a table on the marina or under
the enormous plum tree in the back garden.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The amphitheater at Epidaurus, built in the 4th century B.C., is
spectacularly well preserved, and the site also includes the ruins
of an ancient therapeutic center. Open daily from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.;
admission $4.15. There are also concerts in the theater during July
and August. Call (30-753) 22009 for a schedule.
 &HT;    Near the west coast of the Peloponnesus, the ruins at Olympia,
(30-624) 22517, are open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily except Monday, when
hours are noon to 7 p.m. The museum is also excellent. Combined
ticket, $5.55.
 &HT;    The site at Mycenae, (30-751) 76585, is open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.
daily; admission $4.35.
 &HT;    One of the most unusual medieval ruins is Monemvasia, built on a
massive rock that rises dramatically from the sea, off the east
coast of the Peloponnesus. For information, call the local tourist
agency, Malvasia Travel, (30-732) 61752.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY JERRY HAINES  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    However unfashionable it may be to admit it, I like to fly on
commuter airlines. I like to feel the water when I swim, I like to
taste the food when I eat, and I like to feel as if I'm flying when
I fly.
 &HT;    This is not a knock on the big airlines or their efficiency in
transporting billions of passengers or their safety records. But,
really, as you pass from the passenger lounge to the ``people
eater'' to the plane, and then back again at your destination, can
you really say that you have flown? Wasn't it more like being in a
series of large rooms?
 &HT;    It's just that in one of them they project movies of aerial
scenery outside the windows, and once in a while a burly stagehand
bounces the room on the director's cue of ``Looks like we're gonna
have a little turbulence, here, folks.''
 &HT;    Personally, I am delighted when I note on my itinerary the
asterisk that leads me to the footnote, ``Operated by
Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of Airlines'' _ notwithstanding the big
corporation's logo on the plane or the masthead on the in-flight
magazine.
 &HT;    My expectations are validated when, at some stopover, I am
advised that my connecting flight is at D-78. At the very end of
the concourse, I take the escalator down, and suddenly it's as if
I'm in a different airport. There are no admirals' clubs or sports
bars here; the ceilings are low, and there is no music system. In
contrast to the gates upstairs, which are city blocks apart, the
gates here are all in one big room.
 &HT;    The boarding announcements override one another, like competing
rug merchants shouting out bargains in a bazaar. (I expect them to
try to talk me out of my destination: ``You don't want Duluth, my
friend. Evansville is right for you. I could take 30 percent off
that fare.'') There are no monitors or electronic signs. Rather,
gate agents manually insert cardboard numbers on a display board.
 &HT;    The only available food here is from vending machines. But the
food upstairs is overpriced, underseasoned and hyperfatty _ even if
it does come on a lettuce leaf. Eat your Cheez Doodles and drink
your Dr Pepper.
 &HT;    Passengers in the bullpen seats strain to sort out the
information about their respective flights. (``Did she say,
'Wichita' or 'Wichita Falls'?'') When we do board, there is little
ceremony. There is no separate loading of celebrities into first
class (indeed, the concept of first class on a commuter flight
would provoke giggles), and the entire process takes only about 10
minutes. Often the gate agent will walk us to the plane. I wonder
whether the agent is going to fly the plane, too.
 &HT;    I love these walks out to the plane. Like kindergarten kids on a
field trip, we stay close together as we follow our agent across
the Tarmac. And we're actually on the Tarmac. Little tractors and
baggage carts zip around us like deerflies as we keep a wary eye
out for approaching Airbuses. We can hear the plane engines and the
yelling of crew members. We can smell the jet fuel and feel the
prop wash. It's a sensory experience that has all but disappeared
as the airline industry strives to make air travel as
nonthreatening as possible.
 &HT;    The seating inside the plane is cramped, but at least it makes
sense to have 20 cramped seats on a small plane instead of hundreds
of them on a 747. And there are no middle seats; in fact, sometimes
a seat is both ``aisle'' and ``window.''
 &HT;    It is true that there is less space for carry-on luggage and
that we'll end up checking it. But, unlike passengers on the big
planes, I can see the guys loading it. And they can see me seeing
them. Further, when I get to where I'm going, I will just pick up
my luggage at planeside and roll through the terminal to the taxi
stand, while the people from those big planes stare at the empty,
revolving carousel and curse.
 &HT;    Many of the planes are prop jets, so that I actually can see the
engines start and the propellers begin to spin. (I wish they were
real propeller engines, though, so that starting them would sound
like that climactic moment in ``Casablanca,'' where the plane
engine starts with a whining kick.)
 &HT;    Like their counterparts on the airborne cruise ships, flight
attendants on these planes (usually only one) do the little drill
about seat belts and emergency exits and seat cushions that are
usable as flotation devices, but people actually pay attention
here. The attendant then plops into the jump seat and the plane
taxis out toward the runway.
 &HT;    As with the boarding, the taxiing seems more efficient. This
plane doesn't need help pushing back from its parking space any
more than a cabdriver needs help pulling away from the curb. The
pilot just puts down the flag on the meter and we're off for a
drive across the concrete.
 &HT;    A lot of the passengers appear to be regulars _ sales
representatives, tech reps and other itinerants who have gotten to
know the flight attendants and who kibitz with them. The plane
shudders in the backwash of a launching wide-body, then it's our
turn, and we are effortlessly airborne.
 &HT;    The flight itself is closer to the ground, and we can see the
scenery. (I had flown dozens of times into Ronald Reagan National
Airport, for example, but not until I flew there by commuter plane
was I truly impressed by Washington's memorials, the Pentagon and
those bobsledlike turns that planes must take as they approach
along the Potomac.)
 &HT;    Of course that same low altitude means that in bad weather, the
pilot can't get us above it. We are simply in it, and we can only
endure it. We macho types pretend not to be alarmed as the contents
of our soda glass hover above the glass momentarily when we hit an
air pocket.
 &HT;    ``Hey, at Busch Gardens you'd have to pay 10 bucks for a ride
like this,'' we joke (and then resume mumbling prayers). I try to
think of it as my Authentic Flying Experience. Real mashed potatoes
have lumps; real flying has bumps.
 &HT;    Soon we sense the impending landing (in our ears --
pressurization sometimes is a scarce commodity), and we return our
seat backs to their full upright position (as opposed to the
91-degree position we used for relaxing).
 &HT;    We're down quickly, the pilot does that little prop-reversal
thing that halts the plane on a dime, and we chug over toward the
terminal, where we stop several yards from the building. I expect
the pilot to caution, ``Now, everyone remember where we parked.''
 &HT;    I wonder whether the pilots, flight attendants and gate agents
are happy here in the farm club. Do the pilots dream of setting
down a 747 at Narita or Charles de Gaulle or Leonardo da Vinci? Do
the flight attendants look enviously toward the big ships that have
entire teams to do all of the things that one person does on a
commuter flight? Do the gate agents aspire to a life upstairs where
one might see the sun and buy $6 pizza slices?
 &HT;    I surely hope not. I hope they enjoy it as much as I do. Now if
they'd only let me sit up front with the pilots.

 &HT;    Here's a selection of questions that recently crossed my desk.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    Your book, ``The Mature Traveler's Book of Deals,'' refers to
the French Carte Vermeil railroad pass, but I can't find any other
references to it. What can you tell me about it? _ Tom Lowell, San
Antonio, Texas
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DEAR MR. LOWELL:  
 &HT;    It's probably a bit hard to find since it has a new name, Carte
Senior, and it replaces the two earlier Carte Vermeil travel cards.
Travelers ages 60 and older can buy a Carte Senior for 290 francs _
the equivalent of about $42 U.S. _ at a French railway station to
get reductions of up to 50 percent off standard rail prices. The
pass is good for a year.
 &HT;    Carte Senior holders also are entitled to 30 percent off the
standard price for all train trips in 23 European countries that
use the Rail Europe Senior plan.
 &HT;    You will need to bring an identity photo in addition to your
passport when applying for a Carte Senior pass at the ticket
office. The Web site www.sncf.fr gives some background but does not
reveal a ticket price until you have made a reservation.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    I am planning a round-trip train ride to San Diego, Calif., in
August. Please help me with information about train travel. _ Tom
Ladner, Levittown, Penn.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MR. LEVITTOWN  
 &HT;    First, call Amtrak, (800) 872-7245, to see about travel dates
and fares. Amtrak discounts its railfares by 15 percent for those
ages 62 or older. However, the fare you pay depends on how full the
train is.
 &HT;    For example, when I recently checked with Amtrak, senior fares
for a chair ticket from your area to San Diego ranged from $356.50
to $898 _ and the latter price was for a nearly full train. Of
course, a compartment costs more.
 &HT;    Here are two possible routes:
 &HT;    Take the Amtrak Three Rivers from Trenton, N.J., to Chicago,
where you will transfer to the California Zephyr, which will take
you via Denver to Oakland. There you will board the Coast Starlight
to travel along the California coast to Los Angeles, where you will
get on the San Diegan for the last leg of the trip.
 &HT;    Or, take the Nutmeg to New York, where you will transfer to the
Three Rivers to go to Chicago. In Chicago, you will board the
Southwest Chief, which travels cross country via Albuquerque, N.M.,
to Fullerton, a Los Angeles suburb, where you will board the San
Diegan.
 &HT;    For more information, call the San Diego Convention and Visitors
Bureau at (619) 232-3101.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT: 
 &HT;    My wife and I have some travel questions that we hope you can
answer:
 &HT;    1) Whom should we contact to arrange traveling between England
and France by train?
 &HT;    2) What is the procedure for obtaining a National Parks Golden
Age Passport?
 &HT;    _ A.E. Lockert, Jr. Nashville, Tenn.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MR. LOCKERT:  
 &HT;    1) To book travel on Eurostar (under the English Channel),
contact your travel agent or Rail Europe, which is the North
American supplier of European rail products. Call (800) 438-7245,
or www.raileurope.com on the Web.
 &HT;    2) If you are 62 or older you can buy a lifetime Golden Age
Passport for $10. Passports are available at any national park, or
you can contact the National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127,
Washington, D.C. 20013; www.nps.gov.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    To whom should I write to get a travel itinerary for Helen, Ga.?
Your help is greatly appreciated.
 &HT;    _ Ethel Spade, West Palm Beach, Fla.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MRS. SPADE:  
 &HT;    First call your travel agent and ask about motorcoach companies
that plan trips to Helen. Or ask the agent if he/she knows a travel
club or church group going to Helen that you could call.
 &HT;    If the travel agent can't help, I would contact information
centers and ask which motorcoach companies include a Helen
itinerary.
 &HT;    Try contacting:
 &HT;    _ Alpine Helen-White County Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, P.O.
Box 730, Helen, Ga. 30545; (706) 878-2181.
 &HT;    _ Helen Welcome Center, City Hall - Chattahoochee St., Helen,
Ga. 30545; (706) 878-2521.
 &HT;    _ The Georgia Tourist Division, (404) 656-3595.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT: 
 &HT;    I read your column every Sunday and enjoy it very much. But I
have a suggestion: In future articles, could you give the distances
from major airports to town centers and include if public transport
is available? Many of us prefer not to rent cars.
 &HT;    One of your columns reads, ``Banff is easily accessible via
90-minute drive from Calgary airport!'' A 20-minute trip by cab,
bus or shuttle is a more reasonable distance. _ John Lancaster,
Doylestown, PA.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MR. LANCASTER:  
 &HT;    I will be happy to work airport/city center information into
future articles when it is appropriate. The handy reference book
``Salk International's Airport Transit Guide'' is also a great
help. For a current copy of the book, call Magellan's at (800)
962-4943. The price is $9.95 and includes shipping and handling.
 &HT;    The guide gives the kind of information you want and includes
average prices for shuttles and cabs as well as where to get them
and which routes are recommended.
 &HT;    Regarding the Banff to Calgary transfer: There are shuttles that
run regularly between the two points, giving you a chance to relax
and enjoy the scenery.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    My sister and I are planning a trip to New York to visit Ellis
Island to see our parents' names are on the immigrants' wall. We
want an escorted tour that lasts about three days. We'd like to be
escorted from the airport to our hotel and then to Battery Park,
etc. The only travel company I have located includes four extra
days in New York. Do you know of any of short length? _ Eileen
Wozneski, Palm City, Fla.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MS. WOZNESKI: 
 &HT;    I recommend that you work with Gray Line of New York, (800)
669-0051. Gray Line does offer airport transfers from each airport
to most hotels in Manhattan for rates ranging from $16 to $19 per
person.
 &HT;    And Gray Line has a number of escorted tours within the city.
Several incorporate visits to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island with other attractions.
 &HT;    For senior travelers, I always recommend the Big Apple Greeters,
(212) 669-2896. It's not a tour, but is made up of local volunteers
who showcase those parts of New York they know best.
 &HT;    The Greeters prefer to be contacted a minimum of 10 days before
any planned trip so they can match your needs with the available
volunteers' specialities.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions and comments to Adele
Malott, c/o The New York Times Syndicate, 122 East 42nd St., 14th

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are headed to Melbourne, Australia. Can you
recommend a culinary hot spot there?
 &HT;     A:  You couldn't find a more popular restaurant than the sleek
Radii at the Park Hyatt Melbourne, where chef Paul Wilson is
earning rave reviews.
 &HT;    This vibrant, multilevel experience with an open kitchen has a
wood-fired oven, bar and cigar lounge. Chef Wilson prepares what he
calls ``modern cuisine'' using quality produce true to its natural
flavor.
 &HT;    This is exciting food of superb quality. Expect dishes such as
scallops in a citrus beurre blanc; cassoulet of blue eye and clams;
and sauternes custard. There's also rotisseried leg of lamb,
risotto, roasted trout, grilled chicken and duck. The menu is
brave. Wines are fairly priced at Radii and service is impeccable.
All dishes are designed to share. Desserts are extravagant.
 &HT;    For more information, call 9224-1211.
 &HT;     Q:  I am planning a three-week trip to China in September. I am
having trouble finding anyone who understands the exchange rates
and how to do it. I am aware that you can bring a limited amount of
money in or out, but where do you get it? I am trying to avoid long
lines and hassles at the airport, and my bank tells me they do not
trade in this currency. Help!
 &HT;     : . Regarding the pre-purchase of Chinese currency, there are
two official names for the currency, renminbi (RMB) and kuai.
 &HT;    Our sources at Export International Currency Express do not
advise on pre-purchasing large amounts of RMB because the rate is
not very favorable compared to exchanging in China. The CITIC bank
in Beijing, on Jiangguomenwai Street, is very efficient.
 &HT;    However, Export International Currency Exchange can arrange for
a smaller amount to be made in advance to hold you over until you
can reach a proper bank. You can contact them at (888) 278-6628.
Best wishes for a wonderful trip through China.
 &HT;     : . My husband and I are looking for a quick getaway to the
Arizona desert. Do you know of any value-priced packages at nicer
resorts?
 &HT;     A:  The Royal Palms Hotel and Casitas is offering a variety of
well-priced packages for those seeking some rest and relaxation in
the desert. The Phoenix property is managed by Destination Hotels
and Resorts and is part of a collection of distinctive upscale
hotels and resorts known for their luxurious standards and
exceptional recreational opportunities.
 &HT;    The Royal Romance package, which costs $279 for two days and one
night, includes Plaza Suite accommodation and sensual amenities
such as champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries.
 &HT;    The Royal Tee, which starts at $269 for two days and one night,
includes daily breakfast and a round of golf at one of several top
golf courses in the area.
 &HT;    The Royal Treatment, $399 for two days and one night, includes
Plaza suite accommodation, and an in-room or cabana massage for
each guest, as well as complimentary use of the fitness center.
 &HT;    For those looking for accommodations only, the Royal Palms is
offering a summer promotional rate of $149 per room, per night. For
reservations or more information, call (800) 672-6011.
 &HT;     Q:  I've been to Africa once before, but I felt very much like
a tourist the entire time and left feeling unsatisfied. I'd like to
try again, but I really want to get a feel for the various local
cultures and really experience Africa. Any suggestions?
 &HT;     A:  The best way to experience local culture anywhere is to
just immerse yourself in it. Bush Homes of East Africa offers a
``true African experience'' by housing guests at private residences
and ranches so they can experience the personable hospitality of
Kenyans and witness their lifestyle.
 &HT;    Visitors get the chance to mix with villagers by learning about
local farming customs, regional wildlife, and join in with the
daily life of the nomadic Ndorobo people. This is definitely NOT
your average safari trip.
 &HT;    For more information on prices and locations, visit
www.bush-homes.co.ke on the Web.
 &HT;    This trip _ and more like it _ can be found in the Spring/Summer
2000 Specialty Travel Index, $10 per year for two issues. Send
orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My niece has been working at a quality golf resort, but she
feels her career is stalled. She has an excellent eye for design
and loves the sport. Any suggestions on how she might kickstart her
career and remain in this exciting industry?
 &HT;     A:  Your niece may be a perfect candidate for the new Master's
Degree in Golf Course Architecture at Edinburgh College of Art in
Scotland _ see www.eca.ac.uk. The one-year program has the full
blessing of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. With St. Andrews just
one hour from Edinburgh, students will carry out fieldwork at the
Old Course and many of Scotland's hidden gems. Tuition is
approximately $12,175.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Still haven't planned a summer family getaway?
 &HT;    Then get on the Web. There are some great sites out there that
are fast, efficient and can help save money. Some can help reveal a
cheaper airfare or car-rental deal. Others can aid in unearthing
the perfect hotel or inn. So take these steps to get the best
vacation value this summer.
 &HT;    For those who can't decide between a cottage by shore, a
national park visit, or a trip to Florida, do a little research.
Disney's site, Family.com (www.family.com), has vacation advice of
all kinds, helping travelers plan trips by location and by type.
 &HT;    Anyone looking for an inexpensive family restaurant in
Yellowstone National Park, a bed &AMP; breakfast in Vermont or a hotel
in Chicago that will accept the family dog should go to Fodor's
(www.fodors.com), the Web site of the famed guidebooks. It's
well-organized, detailed and opinionated.
 &HT;    Also have a look at Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel
(www.frommers.com), where there is loads of information about
underrated and inexpensive places such as Portugal and Greece.
 &HT;    Frommer and his staff seek out low-cost ways to take vacations
that just seem expensive, like beach holidays. They also look for
unusual and cost-saving options, such as volunteer vacations with
the Sierra Club.
 &HT;    Fodors travel guides are connected to Concierge.com
(www.concierge.com), the Web site of Conde Nast publications, a
good resource for bed &AMP; breakfasts, resort hotels and lakeside
retreats. For those who want a peek at more luxurious vacations,
``Travel + Leisure''s Web site (www.pathfinder.com/travel/TL) has
the current issue and back issues available through a good search
engine.
 &HT;    If a vacation paradise must include sand and palm trees,
Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays (www.pleasanthawaian.com) are
discounters who can put together a range of well-priced
air/hotel/transfer deals to the islands, utilizing a large stock of
hotels and condos. Their sister company, Pleasant Mexico Holidays,
can do the same south of the border.
 &HT;    For the world beyond, check out Time Out (www.timeout.com),
which is like going online with an English accent. This site takes
the best of Time Out's city guides and city listing magazines and
puts them on the web.
 &HT;    Rough Guides (http://travel.roughguides.com) are written with
the independent traveler in mind and Lonely Planet
(www.lonelyplanet.com) set the standards for such travel. Then look
at BootsnAll.com (http://216.110.36.72/cgi-bin/gt/index.shtml),
which refers to itself as ``The Ultimate Resource for the
Independent Traveller,'' with a host of first-person stories by
young people traveling cheaply around the world.
 &HT;    The Europe-bound should head to Rail Europe's site
(www.raileurope.com), a godsend for anyone who has tried to plan a
rail journey through Europe. This site has schedules and fares for
point-to-point train fares, Eurailpasses, multi-country passes,
single country passes and rail 'n' drive passes. They also offer
Eurostar tickets from London to Brussels or Paris.
 &HT;    For getaways to American cities, check out discount hotel
brokers like Quikbook (www.quikbook.com) and Hotel Reservations
Network (www.180096hotel.com). Figure on discounts from 15 percent
to 40 percent off published rates in major city hotels, based on
availability, of course.
 &HT;    Once the hotel is booked, have a look at CultureFinder.com
(www.culturefinder.com), which has thousands of listings for opera,
ballet or theater performances in dozens of cities around the
country. In some cases, event tickets can be ordered online. Both
Digitalcity (www.digitalcity.com) and Citysearch.com
(www.citysearch.com) have a city-by-city list of restaurants and
shops, as well as sightseeing, arts and other entertainment. These
sites can make a visitor feel like local.
 &HT;    Biking, hiking and multisport vacations with the family are a
terrific way to spend a week or two outdoors with like-minded
families. But it can be daunting to sort through and evaluate
hundreds of similar-sounding adventure companies. So visit G.O.R.P.
(www.gorp.com), an acronym for the Great Outdoor Recreation Pages,
which has adventure travel stories and links to dozens of
outfitters who offer hiking, biking, kayaking and white water
rafting trips.
 &HT;    For those who have to fly, check out upcoming deals and sales on
the Web sites of American Airlines (www.aa.com), Continental
(www.flycontinental.com), United Airlines (www.ual.com), Delta
(www.delta-air.com), TWA (www.twa.com), USAirways
(www.usairways.com) and Northwest (www.flynwa.com).
 &HT;    Both Expedia.com (www.expedia.com) and Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com) have fast and sophisticated fare-finders.
They also offer short-term deals, sale fares and specials. It's
relatively quick and easy to book an entire vacation on these
sites, from airline seats to hotel rooms and car rentals. But
price-sensitive shoppers should also take a look at Lowestfare.com
(www.lowestfare.com), 1Travel.com (www.onetravel.com) and
Cheaptickets.com (www.cheaptickets.com).
 &HT;    As for specialized tickets, such as around-the-world tickets and
discounted business class tickets, look at TicketPlanet.com
(www.ticketplanet.com). Finally, for those with a yen to go cheaply
to Japan, China or other Asian destinations, Chisholm Travel
(www.chisholmair.net) is the best source.

 (Color slides and B&AMP;W map available.) 
 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LARRY ROHTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Superlatives come quickly to mind when talking about Sao Paulo.
With 18 million people in its metropolitan area, this is the
largest city in Brazil, the largest in South America, indeed the
largest in the Southern Hemisphere.
 &HT;    It boasts of having the largest population of Japanese descent
of any city outside Japan, the largest of Lebanese descent of any
city outside the Middle East, the largest of Italian descent of any
city outside Italy, and more wealth than any city in what used to
be called the third world.
 &HT;    Paulistanos, as residents of the city are known, have always
taken pride in the cosmopolitan environment they have constructed
around them during the past century, but rarely more so than now.
 &HT;    All year long, Brazil is marking the 500th anniversary of the
arrival of the first Portuguese expedition to the New World, and
Sao Paulo, with a melting-pot population that personifies the
Brazilian ideal of racial democracy, is a focal point of the
commemorations.
 &HT;    Those who come to Sao Paulo expecting to find a laid-back
seaside tropical resort in the style of Rio de Janeiro or Salvador
are in for a shock. Sao Paulo is a very different kind of Brazil:
aggressive, sprawling and resourceful, with a different climate,
including temperatures that can drop to near-freezing at night
during the Southern Hemisphere winter (June through September).
 &HT;    Instead, Sao Paulo's charms are distinctly urban: restaurants,
museums, concerts, nightclubs, parks and window shopping along
Avenida Paulista, the main commercial boulevard. So are the
problems the city confronts, including poverty, crime and police
brutality. But even a confirmed Tropicalist like the pop singer
Caetano Veloso was forced to confess that, as he wrote in a homage
to the busiest intersection in Brazil's busiest city, ``Something
happens in my heart every time I turn the corner of Ipiranga and
Sao Joao.''
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The magnificent exhibition known as ``Brazil+500'' is the
largest show of Brazilian art ever assembled, spread over an area
larger than the Louvre in four separate buildings. With some 15,000
pieces on display, it is hard to talk about highlights, but the
sections focusing on Indian, folk and Afro-Brazilian art have drawn
especially lavish praise from local and international critics.
Admission is $5.75 on weekdays and $8.50 on weekends, at 1.8 real
to the dollar. Telephone (55-11) 573-6073. Until Sept. 7 at
Ibirapuera Park.
 &HT;    To mark the 500th anniversary of the Portuguese arrival, leading
Brazilian and Portuguese pop musicians are offering a monthly
series of free joint concerts at Ibirapuera Park. On July 30,
Gilberto Gil, Maria Joao and Mario Laginha will perform together,
with Ney Matogrosso and Marta Dias scheduled for Aug. 13 and Gal
Costa and Madredeus closing the series on Sept. 9.
 &HT;    Sao Paulo has numerous music halls featuring Brazil's top
artists, with performance schedules published in newspapers and
monthly English-language tourist guides. One winter highlight
promises to be a number of shows by the brilliant pop singer Marisa
Monte at the Palace, Avenida dos Jamaris 213 in Moema. She will be
performing weekends from July 27 through Sept. 9, with tickets $10
and up; (55-11) 5643-2569.
 &HT;    No rivalry in international soccer is more intense than that
between Brazil, which has captured the World Cup four times, and
Argentina, which has won it twice. The national teams of the two
countries will play each other on July 26 at the 80,000-seat
Morumbi Stadium, Sao Paulo's largest, at Praca Roberto Gomes
Pedrosa 1, Jardim Leonor, as part of the qualifying round for the
2002 World Cup. Call (55-11) 3749-8000 for information about
tickets (prices to be announced shortly before the match).
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    Ibirapuera Park is to Sao Paulo what Central Park is to New York
City: an island of green and calm amid traffic and skyscrapers. It
has numerous museums and pavilions, many of them designed by the
renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, and open spaces that
include lakes and playgrounds, which draw large crowds of families
on weekends. The planetarium, $2.85, is especially interesting
because it displays the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere.
The park is open daily, 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.; (55-11) 574-5177.
 &HT;    Exhibitions in which venom is extracted from snakes are no
longer offered to the public, but the Instituto Butantan, Avenida
Vital Brasil 1500 in the Butanta area, remains perhaps the city's
most popular tourist attraction.
 &HT;    One of the world's leading reptile research centers, it has a
collection of more than 60,000 animals, and its small museum
features live spiders and scorpions as well as poisonous snakes
with exotic names like jararaca and mussurana. Open Tuesday through
Sunday, 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Admission is 85 cents; 55 cents for
children; (55-11) 813-7222.
 &HT;    The Memorial to the Immigrant, at Rua Visconde de Parnaiba 1316
in Bras, is the Brazilian equivalent of Ellis Island. Nearly three
million people from 60 different countries, including the United
States, came through this processing center during the 91 years it
operated before closing in 1978, and their contributions to
Brazilian society are honored in thorough, fascinating exhibits in
a somewhat nondescript complex of brick buildings done in
neo-Classical style. Open Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission $1.15, half price for children; (55-11) 6693-0917.
 &HT;    Installed in one of the city's uglier buildings is its best
museum, known as the MASP, or Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo. The
collection here is said to be the largest and most impressive in
Latin America, with European masters like Rembrandt, van Gogh,
Goya, El Greco and Monet as well as leading Brazilian artists such
as Portinari, Anita Malfatti and Tarsila do Amaral. On Sunday an
antiques and arts and crafts fair is held on the square outside the
museum. Open Tuesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission
$5.75. Avenida Paulista 1578; (55-11) 251-5644.
 &HT;    Also on Sundays, the ``Discover Sao Paulo'' program offers three
bus tours departing from the Praca da Republica downtown. The Green
route shows visitors parks and gardens, the Cultural itinerary
visits the principal museums, and the Historic tour stops at old
homes and monuments. Tickets _ $2.85; $1.15 for children _ are sold
at tourist offices or through (55-11) 6971-5000.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    By Brazilian standards, Sao Paulo hotels can be absurdly
overpriced. Rates mimic those of New York, with service and
amenities that cost half as much in Rio de Janeiro or Salvador. But
on weekends, when business travelers leave, rates at major hotels
can drop by 30 percent.
 &HT;    Few of Sao Paulo's hotels are more reliable or convenient than
the Crowne Plaza, just off Avenida Paulista at Rua Frei Caneca 1360
in Cerqueira Cesar. Remodeled not long ago, it has 220 rooms and
large beds and bathtubs in which to sink at the end of a long day.
A standard double starts at $198 a night through the chain's
``Summer Options'' program. Telephone (55-11) 253-2244 or (800)
227-6963; fax (55-11) 251-3121.
 &HT;    In the 1970s, the Grand Hotel Ca D'Oro, Rua Augusta 129 in
Consolacao, was the most elegant place to stay in Sao Paulo. The
neighborhood has fallen on hard times, but the 265 rooms, most
still decorated in the same style as they were back then, are
large, and the Italian restaurant on the ground floor is one of the
best in town. Doubles are $150, breakfast included; (55-11)
236-4300, fax (55-11) 236-4311.
 &HT;    Budget: Sao Paulo is awash in what are known as ``flats,''
apartment hotels aimed primarily at the long-term business visitor
but also available to the tourist. One especially good option is
the Parthenon chain, which operates a score of these residential
hotels. Rooms at some, such as the Parthenon St. Germain on Rua
Padre Joao Manuel 202 in Cerqueira Cesar, start at $60, with
breakfast. The top price at this chain is $100. Call (800) 111790
for reservations; fax (55-11) 883-2476.
 &HT;    The Best Western Porto do Sol, Rua Tutoia 77 in Cerqueira Cesar,
is halfway between Avenida Paulista and Ibirapuera Park and
convenient to many good restaurants. Its 198 rooms, while simple,
are as clean and attractive as those of its much more expensive
neighbors. A double starts at $100, with an ample breakfast buffet
of tropical fruits and juices; (55-11) 3059-5000, fax (55-11)
3059-5193.
 &HT;    Luxury: Big, swaggering, always crowded and boasting such
curiosities as a restaurant specializing in Danish cuisine, the
Maksoud Plaza Hotel, Alameda Campinas 150 in Bela Vista, has become
something of a landmark since it opened 20 years ago. But the
imposing atrium and 415 rooms are starting to show their age, and
there is a certain air of snobbery that can be disconcerting.
Doubles from $350; (55-11) 253-4411, fax (55-11) 253-4544.
 &HT;    On the other side of Avenida Paulista, at Alameda Santos 1123,
sits the Inter-Continental Sao Paulo. The 193 rooms here are larger
than those at several other luxury hotels, the atmosphere is one of
cool efficiency, and there are many good places to eat within
walking distance. Doubles are normally $400, but some are available
through Sept. 15 at the ``Summer Options'' price of $200. Telephone
(55-11) 3179-2600 or (800) 327-0200; fax (55-11) 3179-2669.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Year after year, Baby-Beef Rubaiyat is the runaway winner in
every survey of Sao Paulo's best churrascarias, restaurants
specializing in grilled meat. The cuts may seem unfamiliar to the
American palate, but the meat here is extraordinarily tender and
lean, perhaps because the restaurant has its own ranch where it
raises cattle, hogs, sheep and chicken. Of the two branches, the
more convenient is at Alameda Santos 86 in Paraiso. Dinner for two
with beer, about $65; (55-11) 289-6366.
 &HT;    In theory, Antiquarius, Alameda Lorena 1884 in Cerqueira Cesar,
specializes solely in Portuguese cuisine. But one of its signature
dishes is a singular mixture of Lusitanian and Brazilian
ingredients: a startlingly delicate codfish moqueca, or stew, laced
with coconut milk. The atmosphere is charmingly rustic. Dinner for
two with a bottle of sparkling Portuguese vinho verde: about $125;
(55-11) 282-3015
 &HT;    The menu at Amadeus, Rua Haddock Lobo 807 in Cerqueira Cesar, is
devoted to seafood in all its forms, freshly caught just off the
coast less than 50 miles away. Traditional Brazilian sauces, which
make liberal use of coconut milk, palm oil, onions, tomato and
peppers, are the main feature, but a terrific shrimp curry is also
on the menu. Dinner for two with a bottle of Brazilian wine is
about $110; (55-11) 3061-2859.
 &HT;    In a city blessed with dozens of excellent Italian restaurants
and cantinas, Massimo, at Alameda Santos 1826 in Cerqueira Cesar,
stands at the head of the class. The osso buco is so tender it
almost melts off the bone, and the cheeses, eggplant, peppers and
olives used in the antipasto are extraordinarily fresh. Dinner for
two is about $125 (no credit cards accepted); (55-11) 284-3011.
 &HT;    For cheap, appetizing eating, Paulistanos often turn to
restaurants offering food by the kilogram, most of which charge
$4.50 to $5.50 a pound. There is a large concentration of these
self-service buffet-style cafeterias in Rua Augusta. One that
stands out for its varied menu and mouth-watering desserts is the
Parque Avenida Grill, Avenida Paulista 1776; (55-11) 283-0201.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By NICOLE KRAUSS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The first time I was in the Peloponnesus, it was midwinter, and
out of the low fog that was everywhere goatherds seemed to appear
and dissolve as if in a Theo Angelopoulos film. The narrow roads
etched into the mountainside threatened to fall off into clouds.
 &HT;    At every switchback turn, a small, mailbox-like shrine with
faded icon, biscuits and half-empty bottle of Fanta seemed placed
to ensure safe passage.
 &HT;    Despite the cool air, the orange groves along the roadside were
fragrant, and as I walked between the rows of trees, the silence
was punctuated by the thud of ripe oranges dropping. The
archaeological sites _ and often it seemed the peninsula itself _
were empty of people.
 &HT;    Aside from the phantom goatherds and the men in the kafeneia
smoking and fingering their knotted worry beads, the most evident
signs of life were the occasional smoldering heaps of rubbish that
slid down the mountainside like scree.
 &HT;    In that strange weather there was something almost threatening
about the loom and lunge of the mountains. Alone among the ruins of
Olympia or Epidaurus, I couldn't shake a feeling of eerieness and
half expected, at any moment, to encounter some ancient shade
walking among the broken columns.
 &HT;    It's no surprise that at times the Peloponnesus seems haunted.
The Isle of Pelops is named for the boy slaughtered and cooked by
his father, Tantalus, and served to the gods. Brought back to life
by the outraged Zeus, Pelops eventually became a king.
 &HT;    Later a curse was put on him by a man he tricked, so that for
generations the House of Pelops was plagued by murders and
vendettas, by the same grisly plots compulsively repeated.
 &HT;    But in spring the Peloponnesus changes. It is as if the curse
lifts with the fog and the valleys and hillsides suddenly flower.
With 6,000 species of flowering plants, Greece has some of the most
extensive flora of any European country. The fields fill with
larkspur, anemones and asphodel, with stalks of giant fennel in
whose slow-burning pith Prometheus brought fire to the Earth. Pink
and white oleanders hem the roads, and house fronts are decorated
with shocks of bougainvillea.
 &HT;    But despite the abundance of flowers and the bright sun, much of
the Peloponnesus retains a kind of severity year-round: even in
that fabled idyll, Arcadia, the barren mountain peaks are always
present. The occasional monasteries built into sheer cliff faces
remind the traveler of the isolation of the place.
 &HT;    This time I returned to the Peloponnesus in June, to rent a
house with a friend on the beach with no address or phone. Aside
from this, its most remarkable detail was the blowzy red lampshade
that hung, with its delusions of grandeur, over the kitchen table.
Everything else about the house was simple and rustic.
 &HT;    Its only luxury was the garden, so packed with oleanders, lemon,
fig and pomegranate trees that it threatened to engulf the cottage
in its green embrace. In Greece it is impossible to forget that
everything must eventually fall to ruin; what little remains
depends on freak chance or the serendipity of archaeologists.
 &HT;    Behind the garden walls that backed up onto a grove of
lime-washed olive trees, Ben and I spent whole days reading.
Clothes became mostly useless. Even as we read about ancient
Greece, civilization seemed to stall or slip a notch.
 &HT;    We told time by the constantly changing light or the sounds
around us: the clatter of cicadas or the bells from the small
church where the priest sang his drafty evensong, the doors on all
sides of the cruciform church thrown open to his congregation of
zero. Only in the evenings, when the stubborn heat finally began to
give in, would we venture out to swim in the clear Ionian Sea.
 &HT;    Our house was on the western coast of the Mani, the middle of
the three southern switchblades of land that jut into the sea. It
was partly Patrick Leigh Fermor's exhaustive book ``Mani,''
published in the 1950s, that originally drew us to the place; the
house we rented outside the little town of Stoupa was only a few
miles away from his.
 &HT;    Mr. Fermor describes the map of the southern part of the
Peloponnesus as ``a misshapen tooth fresh torn from its gum with
three peninsulas jutting southward in jagged and carious roots.''
The middle carious root _ a description that conjures not only its
shape but also its character _ is the Mani.
 &HT;    The sharp spine of the Taygetos mountain range rips down its
length, and on its hard, boulder-strewn plateaus a fierce and
passionate race of people lived in a perpetual state of war.
 &HT;    Descended from Spartans, Slavs, and Frankish crusaders, the
Maniots' way of life revolved around bloody family feuds waged with
yataghans (short Turkish sabers with double-curved blades), axes
and muskets; when a feud was on a Maniot could not leave his house
without dodging a volley of bullets.
 &HT;    The Maniots lived in austere stone tower houses, the better to
aim at and pick off a neighbor. They were feared by other Greeks,
many of whom still keep a wide berth of the peninsula. Not much
remains of the Maniots now, having killed off or tired each other
out, and their surviving progeny packed up and moved to Athens. The
wrecks of their domestic fortresses _ sometimes whole villages of
them _ seem outcroppings of the very rock that forms the wild and
lonely hills.
 &HT;    On weekends we explored the Peloponnesus _ often on overnight
trips _ in a car we rented in Stoupa, the town where Kazantzakis
created the larger-than-life character Zorba. On our first
excursion we headed south, deep into the Mani. We stopped for an
early breakfast at the Krifos Kipos taverna in the tiny fishing
village of Agios Nikolaos and watched the caiques come in, hung
with kerosene lanterns and laden with the morning's catch of fish.
 &HT;    The serenity was only occasionally punctured by cries of the
ubiquitous traveling salesmen who advertise their wares, whether
watermelons or plastic chairs, from megaphones mounted on the roofs
of their trucks.
 &HT;    After Agios Nikolaos the road climbs inland into the mountains
before cutting back to the coast to descend on the Bay of Limeni,
where the white-capped sea bites deeply into the cliffs. In the
Maniot town of Areopolis (named, appropriately, for the god of war)
the cobbled streets are lined with tower houses whose whitewashed
rooms look out onto slopes of prickly pear.
 &HT;    Nearby are the caves of Pirgos Dirou where, for less than the
mythical gold coin, a gruff Charon punted us on a skiff through the
miles of stalactite-hung grottoes said to extend inland as far as
Sparta.
 &HT;    After Areopolis the Mani becomes more desolate; this stretch of
the Taygetos is dubbed the Kakovounia, or Evil Mountains. In
summer, the temperature rises until it reaches the sort of heat
that breeds hallucinations or madness. Nothing much grows there
except for scrub or scorched grass, yet it is tremendously
beautiful.
 &HT;    At the highest points clusters of tower houses still stand vigil
above the sea. And everywhere the ruins of stout stone walls
criss-cross the plateaus: surreal boundaries that mark one share of
nothingness from the next. We passed a dust-covered mason breaking
stones by the roadside in the noonday sun, but he spoke no English
and we spoke little Greek and so we couldn't extract from him the
reason for that infinite network of senseless walls. But he happily
posed for a picture.
 &HT;    After the ghost town of Vatheia _ whose tower houses have been
converted into an eccentric hotel _ the peninsula narrows toward
its end, Cape Tainaron, the location of the mythical gates to the
Underworld. The beaches widen (Marmari is one of the most
beautiful) and the sea, surprisingly warm, breaks in tremendous
waves. By the time we arrived at the very tip of the cape it was
already evening.
 &HT;    Around the ruins of the Temple of Poseidon the wind bent the
gold grass toward the sea; directly above us the sky was stamped by
the first sliver of moon. Somewhere nearby was the cave where
Hercules supposedly descended to the Underworld to bring back the
three-headed dog, Cerberus. But we stopped short of finding it,
feeling some things are better left to the imagination.
 &HT;    The Peloponnesus has some of the finest classical ruins in the
world. The acoustics in the amphitheater of Epidaurus _ one of the
greatest sites _ are so perfect that even from the uppermost tier a
whisper from the stage is audible.
 &HT;    When I brushed my foot along the circle that marks center stage
a twang rang out as from an amplified steel guitar. Behind the
theater are the vast ruins of the spa where invalids came from all
over the Hellenic world to convalesce with the aid of therapeutic
baths, poultices and miraculous cures.
 &HT;    In the mountains of Arcadia, up a winding road of treacherous
hairpin turns, is the limestone Temple of Bassae, erected around
420 B.C. _ in the middle of nowhere _ by Ictinus, the architect of
the Parthenon. In Pylos, in the remains of Nestor's Palace, you can
stand in what's left of the great hall where Telemachus came to ask
for news of his father. The most remarkable surviving detail of the
ruins is an intact terra-cotta tub, last bathed in some 3,000 years
ago.
 &HT;    In the northeast region of the Peloponnesus is Mycenae, first
excavated in the 19th century by Heinrich Schliemann, the
indigo-merchant-turned-archaeologist who discovered Troy. Upon
opening the most elaborate of the royal tombs, he wrote to the King
of Greece, ``I have stared into the face of Agamemnon.''
 &HT;    From 1400 to 1200 B.C. Mycenae was the most powerful kingdom in
Greece. In the rooms of the ruined palace there, Clytemnestra and
her lover, Aegisthus, murdered her husband in a bath to avenge the
sacrifice of her daughter; her children Orestes and Electra, in
turn, murdered Clytemnestra.
 &HT;    To me, the most moving ancient site in the Peloponnesus is
Olympia. The first time I was there it was February and raining,
and I was alone in the place. It made such an impression on me
that, as the summer was running out, I insisted on a last trip to
see it again. Every four years, for almost 1,200 years, athletes
made a pilgrimage to this quiet grove of pines to strive to achieve
the heights of human strength, grace, speed and agility.
 &HT;    Although the hippodrome has long since sunk into the silt of the
Alfios River, the temples and most of the buildings remain, as does
the short-distance track. It is around 600 feet long, with hills
for specta tors on either side and stone slabs cut with grooves
where the runners crouched before the start signal. No one else was
around when we were there so we took our sandals off and raced each
other barefoot, neck and neck, pounding the ground packed down by
time and countless ancient races.
 &HT;    But history did not end on the Peloponnesus with the fall of
Greece. The landscape is scattered with signs of all who followed
the invasion of the Romans: Goths, Avars and Slavs, the Byzantines,
Franks, Turks and Venetians. After the perfection of Praxiteles'
sculptures or still-extant geometry of a Grecian temple, these
medieval ruins may seem crude and insubstantial.
 &HT;    But atop the rock of Monemvasia, inside the 13th-century
Byzantine church with its humbled frescoes, one suddenly feels the
illumination of those dark ages, sensing the very pattern of
history itself with its endlessly repeating eras of chaos and
order.
 &HT;    And even as one is constantly aware of all that has been lost,
there are also reminders of what is continuous: the
thousand-year-old monastery of St. John the Baptist outside the
mountain town of Stemnitsa, for example, where the monks waved down
to us from their hawk's perch to offer us coffee and a bowl of
Turkish de light.
 &HT;    At the end of each of our weekend excursions _ to the southern
tip of the Mani, to Monemvasia, Olympia, Arcadia _ we found
ourselves eager to return to our small house. After such a close
study of the ravages of time, there is a certain comfort in a place
where nothing seems to happen.
 &HT;    The day's only events were the start or finish of a book, the
evening baptism in the Ionian, and our meals at the house or our
favorite taverna, Agrogiali, usually accompanied by a carafe of
retsina, the local wine made with pine resin.
 &HT;    Under the influence of that good drink, with the sun gone down
leaving the houses glowing like lamps, a poem by Constantine Cavafy
came to mind.
 &HT;    ``That we've broken their statues,/that we've driven them out of
their temples,/doesn't mean at all that the gods are dead.'' The
poem ends with an ethereal figure in rapid flight, winging across
the hills: a further explanation, perhaps, for the occasional
ghostliness of the place.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: IN A LAND HAUNTED BY A LONG HISTORY  
 LOGISTICS  
 &HT;    The airport at Kalamata, around 30 miles from Stoupa, has
flights from Athens on Olympic Airways. Travelers can also fly into
Athens, then take a bus or rent a car. There are frequent (if
rickety) buses to all major towns. A hydrofoil connects Piraeus and
Monemvasia.
 &HT;    Some of the classical sites in the Peloponnesus can be reached
on a day trip from the Mani, but an overnight stay is needed for
Epidaurus and Mycenae.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The Peloponnesus is largely untouched by tourism, which means
there are almost no luxury hotels. Renting a house is probably the
best option. We found ours advertised in The New York Review of
Books.
 &HT;    There are also a number of small, charming and relatively
inexpensive inns. The Thomeas Travel Agency in Stoupa, (30-721)
77689; fax (30-721) 77571, can help with accommodations. A studio
for two people with bath and cooking facilities runs about $42 a
day in high season (July through September); a two-bedroom villa,
around $70 (at 360 drachmas to the dollar). Ask for Bob Barrow, an
English expatriate who published his own book about the Mani.
 &HT;    In the Mani, Limeni Village, near Areopolis, (30-733) 51111, fax
(30-733) 51182, perched on a cliff overlooking Limeni Bay, has
spectacular views. Its 35 rooms are in replicas of tower houses; a
restaurant with a terrace overlooks the sea. There is also a
swimming pool. Doubles cost $64 in July and August, with buffet
breakfast, $50 the rest of the year.
 &HT;    In Vatheia there are lodgings in restored ruins of tower houses
atop a rocky escarpment, with sweeping views down to the ocean.
Information: (30-733) 55244. A double is $44 in summer, $39 in
winter.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Lela's Taverna in Kardamyli, (30-721) 73541, is run by a
wonderful woman (and an excellent cook) who used to be the
housekeeper for Patrick Leigh Fermor, author of the fascinating
book ``Mani.'' The tables are under a grape arbor overlooking the
sea. Dinner for two with house wine, around $20. Dinner nightly;
open all day on weekends in summer.
 &HT;    The Rapteas family run Agrogiali, (30-721) 77335, formerly a
taverna and now an ouzeria serving drinks, snacks and sweets. It's
on the southern end of the main beach. At the Krifos Kipos taverna
in Agios Nikolaos, you can sit at a table on the marina or under
the enormous plum tree in the back garden.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The amphitheater at Epidaurus, built in the 4th century B.C., is
spectacularly well preserved, and the site also includes the ruins
of an ancient therapeutic center. Open daily from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.;
admission $4.15. There are also concerts in the theater during July
and August. Call (30-753) 22009 for a schedule.
 &HT;    Near the west coast of the Peloponnesus, the ruins at Olympia,
(30-624) 22517, are open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily except Monday, when
hours are noon to 7 p.m. The museum is also excellent. Combined
ticket, $5.55.
 &HT;    The site at Mycenae, (30-751) 76585, is open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.
daily; admission $4.35.
 &HT;    One of the most unusual medieval ruins is Monemvasia, built on a
massive rock that rises dramatically from the sea, off the east
coast of the Peloponnesus. For information, call the local tourist
agency, Malvasia Travel, (30-732) 61752.

 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 CORRECTION  
 &HT;    A recent Mature Traveler column reported that Hilton's Senior
HHonors program has been extended to include Doubletree, Hampton,
Homewood Suites and Embassy Suites. This is incorrect. The Senior
HHonors membership program for those ages 60 and older is valid
only at Hiltons and Conrad International Hotels. For more details,
call (800) 432-3600, or visit www.hilton.com on the Web.
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    I love to hear from readers _ especially when their questions
are ones that will benefit many mature travelers.
 &HT;    Here's a selection of questions that recently crossed my desk.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    Your book, ``The Mature Traveler's Book of Deals,'' refers to
the French Carte Vermeil railroad pass, but I can't find any other
references to it. What can you tell me about it? _ Tom Lowell, San
Antonio, Texas
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DEAR MR. LOWELL:  
 &HT;    It's probably a bit hard to find since it has a new name, Carte
Senior, and it replaces the two earlier Carte Vermeil travel cards.
Travelers ages 60 and older can buy a Carte Senior for 290 francs _
the equivalent of about $42 U.S. _ at a French railway station to
get reductions of up to 50 percent off standard rail prices. The
pass is good for a year.
 &HT;    Carte Senior holders also are entitled to 30 percent off the
standard price for all train trips in 23 European countries that
use the Rail Europe Senior plan.
 &HT;    You will need to bring an identity photo in addition to your
passport when applying for a Carte Senior pass at the ticket
office. The Web site www.sncf.fr gives some background but does not
reveal a ticket price until you have made a reservation.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    I am planning a round-trip train ride to San Diego, Calif., in
August. Please help me with information about train travel. _ Tom
Ladner, Levittown, Penn.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MR. LEVITTOWN  
 &HT;    First, call Amtrak, (800) 872-7245, to see about travel dates
and fares. Amtrak discounts its railfares by 15 percent for those
ages 62 or older. However, the fare you pay depends on how full the
train is.
 &HT;    For example, when I recently checked with Amtrak, senior fares
for a chair ticket from your area to San Diego ranged from $356.50
to $898 _ and the latter price was for a nearly full train. Of
course, a compartment costs more.
 &HT;    Here are two possible routes:
 &HT;    Take the Amtrak Three Rivers from Trenton, N.J., to Chicago,
where you will transfer to the California Zephyr, which will take
you via Denver to Oakland. There you will board the Coast Starlight
to travel along the California coast to Los Angeles, where you will
get on the San Diegan for the last leg of the trip.
 &HT;    Or, take the Nutmeg to New York, where you will transfer to the
Three Rivers to go to Chicago. In Chicago, you will board the
Southwest Chief, which travels cross country via Albuquerque, N.M.,
to Fullerton, a Los Angeles suburb, where you will board the San
Diegan.
 &HT;    For more information, call the San Diego Convention and Visitors
Bureau at (619) 232-3101.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT: 
 &HT;    My wife and I have some travel questions that we hope you can
answer:
 &HT;    1) Whom should we contact to arrange traveling between England
and France by train?
 &HT;    2) What is the procedure for obtaining a National Parks Golden
Age Passport?
 &HT;    _ A.E. Lockert, Jr. Nashville, Tenn.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MR. LOCKERT:  
 &HT;    1) To book travel on Eurostar (under the English Channel),
contact your travel agent or Rail Europe, which is the North
American supplier of European rail products. Call (800) 438-7245,
or www.raileurope.com on the Web.
 &HT;    2) If you are 62 or older you can buy a lifetime Golden Age
Passport for $10. Passports are available at any national park, or
you can contact the National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127,
Washington, D.C. 20013; www.nps.gov.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    To whom should I write to get a travel itinerary for Helen, Ga.?
Your help is greatly appreciated.
 &HT;    _ Ethel Spade, West Palm Beach, Fla.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MRS. SPADE:  
 &HT;    First call your travel agent and ask about motorcoach companies
that plan trips to Helen. Or ask the agent if he/she knows a travel
club or church group going to Helen that you could call.
 &HT;    If the travel agent can't help, I would contact information
centers and ask which motorcoach companies include a Helen
itinerary.
 &HT;    Try contacting:
 &HT;    _ Alpine Helen-White County Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, P.O.
Box 730, Helen, Ga. 30545; (706) 878-2181.
 &HT;    _ Helen Welcome Center, City Hall - Chattahoochee St., Helen,
Ga. 30545; (706) 878-2521.
 &HT;    _ The Georgia Tourist Division, (404) 656-3595.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT: 
 &HT;    I read your column every Sunday and enjoy it very much. But I
have a suggestion: In future articles, could you give the distances
from major airports to town centers and include if public transport
is available? Many of us prefer not to rent cars.
 &HT;    One of your columns reads, ``Banff is easily accessible via
90-minute drive from Calgary airport!'' A 20-minute trip by cab,
bus or shuttle is a more reasonable distance. _ John Lancaster,
Doylestown, PA.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MR. LANCASTER:  
 &HT;    I will be happy to work airport/city center information into
future articles when it is appropriate. The handy reference book
``Salk International's Airport Transit Guide'' is also a great
help. For a current copy of the book, call Magellan's at (800)
962-4943. The price is $9.95 and includes shipping and handling.
 &HT;    The guide gives the kind of information you want and includes
average prices for shuttles and cabs as well as where to get them
and which routes are recommended.
 &HT;    Regarding the Banff to Calgary transfer: There are shuttles that
run regularly between the two points, giving you a chance to relax
and enjoy the scenery.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    My sister and I are planning a trip to New York to visit Ellis
Island to see our parents' names are on the immigrants' wall. We
want an escorted tour that lasts about three days. We'd like to be
escorted from the airport to our hotel and then to Battery Park,
etc. The only travel company I have located includes four extra
days in New York. Do you know of any of short length? _ Eileen
Wozneski, Palm City, Fla.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MS. WOZNESKI: 
 &HT;    I recommend that you work with Gray Line of New York, (800)
669-0051. Gray Line does offer airport transfers from each airport
to most hotels in Manhattan for rates ranging from $16 to $19 per
person.
 &HT;    And Gray Line has a number of escorted tours within the city.
Several incorporate visits to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island with other attractions.
 &HT;    For senior travelers, I always recommend the Big Apple Greeters,
(212) 669-2896. It's not a tour, but is made up of local volunteers
who showcase those parts of New York they know best.
 &HT;    The Greeters prefer to be contacted a minimum of 10 days before
any planned trip so they can match your needs with the available
volunteers' specialities.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions and comments to Adele
Malott, c/o The New York Times Syndicate, 122 East 42nd St., 14th
Floor, New York, N.Y. 10168. Send Adele a postcard from your trip
with ideas, questions and information on the bargains you find for
seniors.
 &HT;    Questions may also be sent to Adele by electronic mail. The
address is MatureTrav(at)aol.com. (For (AT) use the symbol on your

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are headed to Melbourne, Australia. Can you
recommend a culinary hot spot there?
 &HT;     A:  You couldn't find a more popular restaurant than the sleek
Radii at the Park Hyatt Melbourne, where chef Paul Wilson is
earning rave reviews.
 &HT;    This vibrant, multilevel experience with an open kitchen has a
wood-fired oven, bar and cigar lounge. Chef Wilson prepares what he
calls ``modern cuisine'' using quality produce true to its natural
flavor.
 &HT;    This is exciting food of superb quality. Expect dishes such as
scallops in a citrus beurre blanc; cassoulet of blue eye and clams;
and sauternes custard. There's also rotisseried leg of lamb,
risotto, roasted trout, grilled chicken and duck. The menu is
brave. Wines are fairly priced at Radii and service is impeccable.
All dishes are designed to share. Desserts are extravagant.
 &HT;    For more information, call 9224-1211.
 &HT;     Q:  I am planning a three-week trip to China in September. I am
having trouble finding anyone who understands the exchange rates
and how to do it. I am aware that you can bring a limited amount of
money in or out, but where do you get it? I am trying to avoid long
lines and hassles at the airport, and my bank tells me they do not
trade in this currency. Help!
 &HT;     : . Regarding the pre-purchase of Chinese currency, there are
two official names for the currency, renminbi (RMB) and kuai.
 &HT;    Our sources at Export International Currency Express do not
advise on pre-purchasing large amounts of RMB because the rate is
not very favorable compared to exchanging in China. The CITIC bank
in Beijing, on Jiangguomenwai Street, is very efficient.
 &HT;    However, Export International Currency Exchange can arrange for
a smaller amount to be made in advance to hold you over until you
can reach a proper bank. You can contact them at (888) 278-6628.
Best wishes for a wonderful trip through China.
 &HT;     : . My husband and I are looking for a quick getaway to the
Arizona desert. Do you know of any value-priced packages at nicer
resorts?
 &HT;     A:  The Royal Palms Hotel and Casitas is offering a variety of
well-priced packages for those seeking some rest and relaxation in
the desert. The Phoenix property is managed by Destination Hotels
and Resorts and is part of a collection of distinctive upscale
hotels and resorts known for their luxurious standards and
exceptional recreational opportunities.
 &HT;    The Royal Romance package, which costs $279 for two days and one
night, includes Plaza Suite accommodation and sensual amenities
such as champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries.
 &HT;    The Royal Tee, which starts at $269 for two days and one night,
includes daily breakfast and a round of golf at one of several top
golf courses in the area.
 &HT;    The Royal Treatment, $399 for two days and one night, includes
Plaza suite accommodation, and an in-room or cabana massage for
each guest, as well as complimentary use of the fitness center.
 &HT;    For those looking for accommodations only, the Royal Palms is
offering a summer promotional rate of $149 per room, per night. For
reservations or more information, call (800) 672-6011.
 &HT;     Q:  I've been to Africa once before, but I felt very much like
a tourist the entire time and left feeling unsatisfied. I'd like to
try again, but I really want to get a feel for the various local
cultures and really experience Africa. Any suggestions?
 &HT;     A:  The best way to experience local culture anywhere is to
just immerse yourself in it. Bush Homes of East Africa offers a
``true African experience'' by housing guests at private residences
and ranches so they can experience the personable hospitality of
Kenyans and witness their lifestyle.
 &HT;    Visitors get the chance to mix with villagers by learning about
local farming customs, regional wildlife, and join in with the
daily life of the nomadic Ndorobo people. This is definitely NOT
your average safari trip.
 &HT;    For more information on prices and locations, visit
www.bush-homes.co.ke on the Web.
 &HT;    This trip _ and more like it _ can be found in the Spring/Summer
2000 Specialty Travel Index, $10 per year for two issues. Send
orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My niece has been working at a quality golf resort, but she
feels her career is stalled. She has an excellent eye for design
and loves the sport. Any suggestions on how she might kickstart her
career and remain in this exciting industry?
 &HT;     A:  Your niece may be a perfect candidate for the new Master's
Degree in Golf Course Architecture at Edinburgh College of Art in
Scotland _ see www.eca.ac.uk. The one-year program has the full
blessing of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. With St. Andrews just
one hour from Edinburgh, students will carry out fieldwork at the
Old Course and many of Scotland's hidden gems. Tuition is
approximately $12,175.
 &HT;    Contact Edinburgh College of Art, Edinburgh, Scotland. telephone

 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the

SHOPPING AROUND: PLANNING FAMILY TRAVEL ON THE WEB

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Still haven't planned a summer family getaway?
 &HT;    Then get on the Web. There are some great sites out there that
are fast, efficient and can help save money. Some can help reveal a
cheaper airfare or car-rental deal. Others can aid in unearthing
the perfect hotel or inn. So take these steps to get the best
vacation value this summer.
 &HT;    For those who can't decide between a cottage by shore, a
national park visit, or a trip to Florida, do a little research.
Disney's site, Family.com (www.family.com), has vacation advice of
all kinds, helping travelers plan trips by location and by type.
 &HT;    Anyone looking for an inexpensive family restaurant in
Yellowstone National Park, a bed &AMP; breakfast in Vermont or a hotel
in Chicago that will accept the family dog should go to Fodor's
(www.fodors.com), the Web site of the famed guidebooks. It's
well-organized, detailed and opinionated.
 &HT;    Also have a look at Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel
(www.frommers.com), where there is loads of information about
underrated and inexpensive places such as Portugal and Greece.
 &HT;    Frommer and his staff seek out low-cost ways to take vacations
that just seem expensive, like beach holidays. They also look for
unusual and cost-saving options, such as volunteer vacations with
the Sierra Club.
 &HT;    Fodors travel guides are connected to Concierge.com
(www.concierge.com), the Web site of Conde Nast publications, a
good resource for bed &AMP; breakfasts, resort hotels and lakeside
retreats. For those who want a peek at more luxurious vacations,
``Travel + Leisure''s Web site (www.pathfinder.com/travel/TL) has
the current issue and back issues available through a good search
engine.
 &HT;    If a vacation paradise must include sand and palm trees,
Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays (www.pleasanthawaian.com) are
discounters who can put together a range of well-priced
air/hotel/transfer deals to the islands, utilizing a large stock of
hotels and condos. Their sister company, Pleasant Mexico Holidays,
can do the same south of the border.
 &HT;    For the world beyond, check out Time Out (www.timeout.com),
which is like going online with an English accent. This site takes
the best of Time Out's city guides and city listing magazines and
puts them on the web.
 &HT;    Rough Guides (http://travel.roughguides.com) are written with
the independent traveler in mind and Lonely Planet
(www.lonelyplanet.com) set the standards for such travel. Then look
at BootsnAll.com (http://216.110.36.72/cgi-bin/gt/index.shtml),
which refers to itself as ``The Ultimate Resource for the
Independent Traveller,'' with a host of first-person stories by
young people traveling cheaply around the world.
 &HT;    The Europe-bound should head to Rail Europe's site
(www.raileurope.com), a godsend for anyone who has tried to plan a
rail journey through Europe. This site has schedules and fares for
point-to-point train fares, Eurailpasses, multi-country passes,
single country passes and rail 'n' drive passes. They also offer
Eurostar tickets from London to Brussels or Paris.
 &HT;    For getaways to American cities, check out discount hotel
brokers like Quikbook (www.quikbook.com) and Hotel Reservations
Network (www.180096hotel.com). Figure on discounts from 15 percent
to 40 percent off published rates in major city hotels, based on
availability, of course.
 &HT;    Once the hotel is booked, have a look at CultureFinder.com
(www.culturefinder.com), which has thousands of listings for opera,
ballet or theater performances in dozens of cities around the
country. In some cases, event tickets can be ordered online. Both
Digitalcity (www.digitalcity.com) and Citysearch.com
(www.citysearch.com) have a city-by-city list of restaurants and
shops, as well as sightseeing, arts and other entertainment. These
sites can make a visitor feel like local.
 &HT;    Biking, hiking and multisport vacations with the family are a
terrific way to spend a week or two outdoors with like-minded
families. But it can be daunting to sort through and evaluate
hundreds of similar-sounding adventure companies. So visit G.O.R.P.
(www.gorp.com), an acronym for the Great Outdoor Recreation Pages,
which has adventure travel stories and links to dozens of
outfitters who offer hiking, biking, kayaking and white water
rafting trips.
 &HT;    For those who have to fly, check out upcoming deals and sales on
the Web sites of American Airlines (www.aa.com), Continental
(www.flycontinental.com), United Airlines (www.ual.com), Delta
(www.delta-air.com), TWA (www.twa.com), USAirways
(www.usairways.com) and Northwest (www.flynwa.com).
 &HT;    Both Expedia.com (www.expedia.com) and Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com) have fast and sophisticated fare-finders.
They also offer short-term deals, sale fares and specials. It's
relatively quick and easy to book an entire vacation on these
sites, from airline seats to hotel rooms and car rentals. But
price-sensitive shoppers should also take a look at Lowestfare.com
(www.lowestfare.com), 1Travel.com (www.onetravel.com) and
Cheaptickets.com (www.cheaptickets.com).
 &HT;    As for specialized tickets, such as around-the-world tickets and
discounted business class tickets, look at TicketPlanet.com
(www.ticketplanet.com). Finally, for those with a yen to go cheaply
to Japan, China or other Asian destinations, Chisholm Travel
(www.chisholmair.net) is the best source.

&HT;     LINCOLN SHEDS ITS FOGYISH IMAGE WITH THE NAVIGATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the luxury-car lines of Ford and General Motors have
struggled to draw flush-with-cash baby boomers into their dealers'
showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged consumers have tended to associate Lincoln and
Cadillac products with their parents and have generally left the
cars those divisions produce to the older generation.
</P>
<P>
   But that is changing now. Lincoln Mercury showrooms are busy
places these days, thanks to boomers' love affair with sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigator is an upscale version of the popular full-size
Ford Expedition SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced for the 1998 model year, the Navigator takes the
Expedition to a higher level with a revised exterior that includes
lots of chrome, an interior flush with leather and wood trim, and a
$42,000-plus base price with two-wheel drive or $46,000-plus with
four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle, about 15 inches shorter than the Chevrolet/GMC
Suburban, is priced to compete against the other large, upscale
SUVs: the Toyota Land Cruiser and its clone, the Lexus LX 470; the
Range Rover; the Mercedes-Benz ML55; and the BMW X5. All of these
vehicles list for $50,000 or more when equipped the way most people
would buy them, but the Navigator is the least expensive of the
bunch.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean it's any less of a luxury SUV, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigator has a giant plus in its favor: Underneath, it's
really a Ford F-150 pickup, which is the nation's best-selling
vehicle and has a well-deserved reputation for toughness,
reliability and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   There is a down side to that, though. Being an F-150 underneath,
the Navigator is a truck, not a car. The ride, therefore, is not as
smooth as you would expect from a Town Car or Continental, or even
the new Jaguar-based Lincoln LS.
</P>
<P>
   It's not bad, though, thanks in part to the standard
load-leveling air suspension. But if your bones are already getting
somewhat creaky, you might want to go with a plush sedan instead.
</P>
<P>
   Even with creaky bones, though, a sport utility such as the
Navigator is just fine for me, and this is one of the best on the
market. You could save $6,000 to $12,000 by choosing a less cushy
and less well-equipped Expedition, of course, but if you can afford
the extra fare, the Navigator offers just about everything you
could want in a luxury SUV.
</P>
<P>
   It's powered by Ford's 300-horsepower, 5.4-liter, 32-valve V-8
engine, connected to a smooth-shifting four-speed automatic
transmission. There is plenty of power to push this 5,700-pound
vehicle along. The engine cranks out 355 foot-pounds of torque at
2,750 rpm, enough to move the Navigator off the starting line with
the rest of the SUV pack.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're used to a similar V-8 engine powering a
sedan that is 1,500 pounds lighter, you might be a bit
disappointed. But those of you used to driving trucks and SUVs will
be pleased with the Navigator's power.
</P>
<P>
   Handling is what you'd expect from a large vehicle like this;
it's not really nimble, but it's not as clunky as some other
truck-based SUVs, such as the previous-generation Suburban. And it
will fit in the standard garage and downtown parallel parking
space, unlike the Suburban and Ford's even-bigger SUV, the
gargantuan Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is plush with leather, with nice burled-walnut trim
in the dashboard and thick pile carpeting throughout. There are
consoles in the floor and overhead, and the lower one, between the
two front occupants, has two large cup holders.
</P>
<P>
   Standard seating includes bucket seats up front and in the
second row; a bench seat is in the third row, seating an additional
three people for a total of seven. The bucket seats in the center
row are separated by a console with cup holders.
</P>
<P>
   My only real complaint with our test vehicle is the two bucket
seats in the center row, which made it essentially a four-passenger
vehicle, unless someone wanted to climb into the rear to access the
third seating row. Adults don't like doing this, I found out, and
since we had two child seats hooked up in the middle-row bucket
seats, anyone else riding with us, other than up front, had to
crawl into the rear.
</P>
<P>
   If I were ordering a Navigator, I would choose the optional
three-passenger bench seat for the middle.
</P>
<P>
   With the third seat in place for passengers, there is not much
luggage space either. That's where the Navigator comes up short
compared with the Suburban; that extra 15 inches in the Suburban is
tacked onto the cargo area. The Navigator's third seat can,
however, be folded down easily to increase luggage space if you
don't need the seat for people.
</P>
<P>
   Loading is easy; you can open the whole tailgate by lifting it
up, or open just the tailgate window to sling grocery bags into the
back.
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle came with the full-time four-wheel-drive system
and carried a base price of $46,410 (plus $690 transportation). The
two-wheel-drive model carries a base price of $42,660 (plus
transportation).
</P>
<P>
   For my money, I would go with the four-wheel drive. I have
tested the two-wheel-drive version, and I found the tail end
slipping and sliding on wet pavement and losing traction in turns.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems were completely gone in our four-wheel-drive test
vehicle. This system can be set in automatic mode to bring the
front wheels on line when rear-wheel slippage is detected. Besides,
why buy half a truck when you can get a whole one for $4,000 more?
</P>
<P>
   Although this really is an Expedition underneath, it looks like
a Lincoln, thanks to the chrome-edged, turbine-vane signature
grille.
</P>
<P>
   Safety equipment includes power four-wheel disc antilock brakes,
second-generation (depowered) driver and front-passenger air bags,
side-door protection beams, and rear-door child-safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic climate control is standard; our vehicle came with the
optional rear air-conditioning/heating unit ($715) to keep even the
rearmost passengers comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Navigator is a truck, sound-deadening materials
have made the interior nearly as quiet as that of a luxury sedan.
That makes it easy to carry on a conversation or enjoy the nice
AM/FM/cassette stereo with the optional six-disc remote
compact-disc changer ($595).
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features on ours included cruise control, 17-inch
aluminum wheels, dual six-way power seats, digital clock, dual
power mirrors, fog lights, power door locks with remote control,
leather-wrapped tilt steering, power windows, rear privacy glass,
rear defroster, 3.73-ratio limited-slip rear axle, luggage rack and
a trailer-towing package.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the CD changer and rear climate control, options on our
vehicle included the reverse-parking aid ($255), which warns the
driver when the vehicle is approaching an object while backing up;
the GPS satellite navigation system ($1,995); and
climate-controlled front seats ($595).
</P>
<P>
   Total price for our test vehicle was $51,255, including
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 12 mpg in the city and 17 mpg on
the highway. The tank holds 30 gallons of fuel.

&HT;     SHORT-LIVED TUCKER DRAWS OGLING CROWDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ There was a Tucker in town recently.
</P>
<P>
   The car was brought here by its owner, Francis ``Fuzzy'' Fruzyna
of Green Bay, Wis., and the occasion was the annual convention of
the National Tucker Automobile Club. This, however, was the only
Tucker that made it to the event.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Tucker, for whom the car was named, started his car
company in 1947, and it produced only 51 of these giant, oddball,
rear-engine luxury cars before going belly-up in 1948. All of them
are 1948 models, and of them, 47 are still accounted for, according
to the club, whose total membership numbers more than 800.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we don't all own Tuckers, because there aren't
enough to go around,'' said member Bob Niles, also of Green Bay,
who was baby-sitting Fruzyna's Tucker in the parking garage at the
downtown Menger Hotel the weekend of June 24-25 as hordes of people
stopped by to look it over. ``Most of us couldn't afford one
anyway; the last one that was sold, about a year ago, went for
$425,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark green Tucker made quite a splash during its visit here.
</P>
<P>
   ``One family came by and said they had been walking all over San
Antonio all morning, had been to the Alamo and everything else
downtown, but that this was the most exciting thing they had
seen,'' Niles said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 47 Tuckers still around, most are in museums where they
have been on display for years and are not considered to be in
running condition, club members said. But there are about 15 of the
cars that are still running, including Fruzyna's.
</P>
<P>
   And it will run, Fruzyna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put about 1,500 miles on it in the six years I've owned
it, so it now has a total of about 7,800 miles on the odometer,''
he said. ``I drove it as fast as 97 mph once, but was afraid I
would get a ticket if I went any faster. Top speed is supposed to
be 130.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Willeford, a tour guide at the Alamo who dropped by the
Menger to check out the Tucker, said he was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really something else,'' he said. ``I saw the Tucker in
the film, but never had seen one up close. This is just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The film he was referring to was the 1988 Francis Ford Coppola
flick, ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' starring Jeff Bridges as
Preston Tucker. (Tucker died in 1956 at age 53.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Preston Tucker was a car-crazy kid who hung around auto
speedways and grew up to create an automobile _ the Tucker _ that
was years ahead of its time,'' said the cover of the book ``The
Indomitable Tin Goose'' by Charles T. Pearson. ``He was a man of
pioneering spirit, ingenuity, and daring, who revolutionized
Detroit in the 1940s with his stunning car of tomorrow. It was
streamlined, futuristic, and fast _ the car every American dreamed
of owning, at a price most people could afford.''
</P>
<P>
   That assessment isn't fully based on fact; the car's styling was
controversial, and the sticker price, $2,450, was a lot of money
for a car in those days. Of course, if you had bought one then and
held onto it, you would have quite an investment on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Dorsey of San Antonio visited the Tucker and said he
couldn't believe his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real classic, for sure,'' he said, walking around the
car and stopping here and there for a closer look. ``They ought to
still be making cars like this. I certainly like its looks, and I
would be proud to drive it down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance would put a crimp in anyone's budget, though, with
the car's value approaching $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   On hand to talk about the Tucker with visitors was Bill Whipple,
79, of Seattle, one of the last surviving employees of the Tucker
Automobile Co.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple said he was a mechanic millwright who helped convert the
Tucker factory in Chicago from a World War II bomb-making plant to
an automobile plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had stayed in business, I was on the list to get the
148th car built,'' he said. ``But obviously I never got mine.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whipple has been on national TV as a former Tucker employee and
even has his paycheck stubs and plant employee badge to show
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the car itself, ``she rides and drives good,'' Fruzyna
said. ``I think I'll keep her for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Tucker club, here are the answers to the most
frequently asked questions about the car:
</P>
<P>
   _ This ``Car of Tomorrow'' was the vision of Preston Thomas
Tucker (1903-1956) of Ypsilanti, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-one were built, of which 47 survive now (and many are on
display to the public).
</P>
<P>
   _ This fastback sedan was styled by Alex S. Tremulis. The car
was put together by chief mechanic John Eddie Offutt, who had
worked with Tucker and Harry Miller at the Indianapolis Speedway.
Offutt's cars won twice at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The car is called the Tucker 48 (for its model year). It was
called the Tucker Torpedo as it was being designed and promoted.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Tucker 48 was designed in Michigan and built in Chicago in
a vast factory that is now the site of the ``Ford City Mall'' on
Cicero Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Tucker 48 pioneered automotive features and ideas that
became standard later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fiberglass replica bodies are available for building Tucker
replicas, which use Cadillac chassis and Northstar engines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tucker 48 specifications: engine, horizontally opposed
six-cylinder, 335 cubic inches, 166 horsepower, 372 foot-pounds of
torque; size, 128-inch wheelbase, 219-inch overall length, 60-inch
height, 79-inch width; weight, 4,200 pounds; performance, 0-60 mph
in 10 seconds, estimated top speed 120 mph.
</P>
<P>
   _ Original price, $2,450; current value: from about $250,000 to
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it could go into reverse. (The prototype, with a Cord
automatic transmission, did not have a reverse gear.)

&HT;     BEEFED-UP VOLVO CROSS COUNTRY TAKES AIM AT SUV MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News

<P>
   Wagons may be on the verge of extinction, having been mostly
replaced first by the minivan in the 1980s and then the
sport-utility vehicle in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. There may be new life in these vehicles, thanks to
some smoke and mirrors and a crafty marketing strategy created by
automakers such as Volvo that are not fortunate enough to have
minivans and SUVs in their lineups.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the idea: Suppose we take a station wagon, beef it up a
bit, add four-wheel drive, then call it a sport-utility vehicle or
at least promote it as a vehicle that is every bit as good as, if
not better than, the typical truck-based SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's not really such a bad idea. Why not take an existing
product and modify it, rather than spend a billion dollars or more
to develop a whole new truck product to satisfy the consumers' need
for sport-utilities?
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for this.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru has gotten away with it for several years. In fact, it
hasn't only gotten away with such a strategy; it has been wildly
successful at it _ with such popular products as the midsize Legacy
Outback Wagon and Sedan, compact Impreza Outback Wagon, and the
Forester, a beefier version of the Impreza Outback, all of which
come with full-time all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Even Honda and Toyota have taken existing car platforms and
turned them into SUV-like products. For Honda, it is the CR-V,
based on the compact Civic; for Toyota, it is the RAV4, built on
the chassis of the previous-generation Celica hatchback.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac, also hungry for an SUV but with only a minivan in the
truck category, has turned its former Trans Sport minivan into a
sport-utility of sorts, called the Montana. Unlike the others,
though, the Montana has no all-wheel-drive option. But that doesn't
stop Pontiac from pushing the vehicle as a sport-utility, even
though Chevrolet still sells the same vehicle as the Venture
minivan, and Oldsmobile as the Silhouette. All of those TV
commercials showing grizzled cowpokes driving the Montana as though
it were a sport-utility have made it into an SUV at least in some
consumers' minds.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not so outlandish that Volvo, that Swedish builder of
premium sedans and station wagons, would presume to turn one of its
wagons into an SUV-like product.
</P>
<P>
   That's old news, of course, to you who know Volvo products. The
company, now a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co., introduced the V70
Cross Country Wagon, with all-wheel drive, nearly three years ago,
and has enjoyed sales success while marketing this vehicle as at
least an alternative to the traditional truck-based SUV. The
company sold 17,500 of these wagons last year, a vehicle that Volvo
marketing executives call a ``premium car-based crossover
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   This vehicle, which began as a 1998 model and continues as a
2000, is based on the Volvo 850 wagon, renamed the V70 in the
mid-90s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Volvo is taking the V70 Cross Country to an
entirely new level with the 2001 model, which goes on sale this
fall at U.S. dealerships, and later in the year in other world
markets.
</P>
<P>
   This all-new version of the Cross Country is based on the
chassis platform of Volvo's newest and best luxury sedan, the S80,
introduced two years ago. Quite unlike any Volvo ever before, the
S80 is a fine European luxury sedan on par with vehicles such as
the Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz E-class and BMW 5-series, as well as the
Lexus GS 300 and Acura RL.
</P>
<P>
   As a wagon-turned-SUV, the new V70 Cross Country puts carlike
comfort and road handling in a package that rivals some of the most
popular sport-utilities, such as the Mercedes-Benz M-class, Lexus
RX 300 and Jeep Grand Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the all-wheel-drive system won't take this vehicle into
the deep woods like that of the Grand Cherokee, because it doesn't
have the low-range gearing that Jeep and many other SUVs offer for
serious off-roading. But some of the other premium SUVs _ such as
the RX 300, Oldsmobile Bravada and Mercury Mountaineer _ don't have
such low-range gearing either, which limits their off-road
capabilities. In comparison with those, the new V70 Cross Country
appears to be every bit as much of an SUV, with more creature
comfort (thanks to its smoother-riding car-based chassis).
</P>
<P>
   What about ground clearance? It's a whopping 8.2 inches in the
2001 V70 Cross Country, as much or more than most popular SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo designed the new Cross Country from the ground up as an
SUV contender, taking the best features of popular sport-utilities
and combining them with the best attributes of the utterly
fantastic S80 sedan. From the side, the V70 Cross Country even
looks like an SUV; it's similar in appearance to the new Jeep Grand
Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   What this all means is that even automakers that don't build
trucks can play in the SUV market, as the lines between sedans and
SUVs, wagons and SUVs, and minivans and SUVs continue to get
blurred.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent media rollout for the new V70 Cross Country, Mark
LaNeve, Volvo's North American marketing chief, declared that the
vehicle was creating its own special market segment, ``combining
the European premium-car experience with the function and
capability of an SUV,'' along with ``Volvoness, which includes
safety and environmental values.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting price will be $34,900. But well-equipped _
including leather interior _ the car will list for $36,900, which
is $1,400 less than the average transaction price of the current
V70 Cross Country. It's also virtually the same price as many
competing premium SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo anticipates selling 20,000 of the new Cross County in the
United States in the first full year. The typical buyer will be age
35-45, married, and college-educated, with a median household
income of $175,000 annually, Volvo says. Those buyers will have
active lifestyles that include such pastimes as hiking and biking,
LaNeve said.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo acknowledges that it went after the Grand Cherokee in
designing the new Cross Country.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get the Jeep look, we needed very Jeepy wheels, so we went
up two sizes over the current Cross Country,'' said Lars Erik
Lundin, Volvo's vice president for the Cross Country project.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle is beefier than before, too. It is two inches
longer, four inches wider and two inches higher. And its wheel base
is four inches longer.
</P>
<P>
   The new Cross Country is powered by a 197-horsepower, 2.4-liter,
light-turbo inline five-cylinder aluminum engine, and comes with
either a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. It
will go from zero to 60 mph in 8.4 seconds with the automatic, or 8
seconds even with the manual. Top speed is 130 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It is fuel-efficient, too, especially when compared with the
current crop of competing SUVs. EPA ratings are 20 miles per gallon
in the city and 25 mpg on the highway, according to preliminary
figures.

&HT;     THINGS OFTEN NOT SAID IN RESTAURANT REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BONNIE WALKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody's a critic _ especially when it comes to eating in
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   With diners eating out more often and paying more for the
privilege, it's no wonder restaurant critics are as thick as nuts
on a Texas sheet cake these days.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who get to write down our opinions about restaurants
have the advantage of getting to be picky in print. But here's a
secret: Most reviewers are way, way more picky than our reviews
usually let on.
</P>
<P>
   So here are some easy, inexpensive suggestions about things
restaurateurs should avoid at all costs _ so that their
restaurant's first impressions aren't worst impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes restaurants post a menu in a little window outside the
front door. Isn't this helpful? I wish everybody did it. But, if
that menu is tattered and fly-specked, hanging by one tack or
displayed in a window smudged with what resemble noseprints from
beagles, who will be tempted to walk in? Who even wants to touch
the door-knob?
</P>
<P>
   What about littered parking lots, especially if some of the
parking is around that stinky Dumpster out back? Restaurateurs own
(or lease) this property and pay dearly for it. Send someone out
there to pick up litter halfway through a busy night.
</P>
<P>
   Dingy and tacky interiors depress me. A fresh coat of paint on
the walls easily remedies dinginess, as does replacing burned-out
light bulbs, straightening the art and keeping the floor clean and
vacuumed. Speaking of lights, we also really hate to see the
shadowy corpses of insects, especially roaches, lying up in those
sheets of waffled plastic under the fluorescent light fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   Tackiness is a little more difficult to remedy. If you must have
fake plants, get good-quality ones and keep them dusted. No
dust-encrusted gumball machines, please. No racks of ``adult''
newspapers and, for heaven's sake, no framed copies of ``Footprints
in the Sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Need we say those sticky tabletops, stained tablecloths, rickety
chairs, wobbly tables and so forth are unacceptable?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we do need to say it, because nearly every restaurant I
have ever entered seems to be plagued with one or more of these
things.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we are seated, the pet peeves really start coming thick
and fast. Here are some of ours:
</P>
<P>
   Butter that's been stored uncovered (or loosely wrapped) for two
or three days next to, say, a leftover pot of lamb stew. Butter
picks up flavors faster than a kid picks up measles. I've
experienced this in restaurants I'd consider among the very best _
and it's so easy to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   The noise question: I understand that many restaurants these
days are designed to have a bright, busy, clattery sound to suggest
how energized it is. Surely there must be a compromise for those of
us who like to converse (without yelling) with one another at
dinnertime. Could we have a ``quiet'' section, in addition to the
``smoking'' section?
</P>
<P>
   Salt shakers that don't shake out salt in a brisk manner are a
problem for me. (Conversely, a fellow reviewer hates rice in her
salt shakers.) I'd rather have the rice and get the salt than not
get the salt at all, but then I am a salt freak, she's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's that food tasting tonight?'' Sound familiar? I am not
sure why this is such an irritating question. I don't mind a server
asking me if he can bring me anything else or if there is anything
further she might help me with. But, ``how is that food tasting?''
seems so intrusive. I always want to say, ``hey, that's between me
and my taste buds, buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   We are very sensitive about getting other people's calcified
leftovers on our silverware or plates. Keep those water and soap
spots off, too.
</P>
<P>
   Food-stained, dog-eared or tattered menus. Why worry about
what's coming out of the kitchen when the menus took away your
customers' appetites right off the bat? Also, menus that list every
last ingredient in the dish, or describe an item that bears no
resemblance to what finally comes out of the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Dried out, brown-tipped lemon and lime wedges with iced tea,
fish or anything else. Few things are more appetizing than a
bright, fresh slice of citrus, and few things more unappetizing
than a crusty one.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for flower garnishes. A brown-edged, bedraggled rose
atop a salad is not special.
</P>
<P>
   Lukewarm soup. (Unintentionally) wilted salad. ``Fresh'' fruit
garnish or side dish that was cut two days ago and looks it.
</P>
<P>
   Soft drink (served in can) that's not been refrigerated. The ice
in the glass is nice, but a warm Coke will melt it in a minute.
Especially in hot weather, which is when you really need that drink
to be cold.
</P>
<P>
   Garnishes that don't complement the dish. Why put a slice of
orange on a plate of Italian spaghetti or huevos rancheros? The
colors usually don't look good together and the flavors clash, too.
</P>
<P>
   Food and service that slack off toward the end of the serving
period. If I go out to lunch at 1:30 p.m., I pay the same and
expect the same quality as the people who came in at noon. Warm up
that soup, put on a fresh pot of coffee, whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Servers who take a wine order from a woman at the table, then
show the bottle and pour the test taste for the man.
</P>
<P>
   You knew we had to talk about bathrooms, and we can all say this
together: Keep 'em clean _ especially the floors.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes other little things come up, though. One of my
colleagues hates to find toilet tissue rolls sitting on the tank.
Another hates those hand blow-dry machines instead of paper towels.
Another is ready to walk out of the restaurant when she sees a
plunger in plain sight in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   I'm just happy if there are no pictures of precious puppies or
kittens on the wall. It's a restroom, OK? Just keep it clean.
</P>
<P>
   Dear servers: We are now in the year 2000. It's a very dated
practice to set the bill down in front of the alpha male at the
table. He may not be the one paying. Put it in a neutral spot in
the center, unless you have been notified that the man is, in fact,
paying.
</P>
<P>
   Also, this is not Europe. In the States, we generally want to
see our check in a reasonable time frame after dessert has been
served. In a very European restaurant, the service might adhere to
the tradition of only bringing the check when it is specifically
requested. Even then, they might keep an eye on customers who might
love the restaurant but not have a clue about the Continental
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   We don't need anyone to call us or send flowers the day after
we've dined in their restaurant, but it is nice to be treated in a
respectful, friendly way as we walk out _ just as we were, ideally,
when we walked in. Even if the last person to see you out the door
is a serving assistant (once known as busboy), he or she should be
instructed to smile and say, ``It was nice to have you. Please come
back.''

 &HT;    RESENDING FOR ALL NEEDING
 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Nader's biggest threat is to an apathetic public
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the vanity of third-party candidates to believe that
because the political distance between them and the major parties
is so great, the narrower differences between Democratic and
Republican candidates is trivial.
</P>
<P>
   That was the subtext of the Alabama Gov. George Wallace's
white-backlash presidential campaigns. To yahoo cheers, the
combative states'-righter would declare that there ``isn't a dime's
worth of difference'' between the Republican and Democratic
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar will no doubt be coming from the demagog Pat
Buchanan once he starts running as the nominee of the Reform Party.
(Where is Ross Perot when you really need him?)
</P>
<P>
   And Ralph Nader is keenly huckstering the cliche as the
candidate of the Green Party's muddle of romantic and zealous
environmentalism, well-intentioned but ill-considered do-goodism
and unlikely economic leveling.
</P>
<P>
   The passive nominee of the Greens four years ago, Nader, gadfly
consumer advocate and hairshirt to heedless capitalism, is running
actively this time.
</P>
<P>
   Nader dismisses Gore and Bush as ``Republicrats.'' The only
difference between them, he says, ``is the velocity with which
their knees hit the floor when the big corporations knock on the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nonsense, as Nader's own campaign implicitly acknowledges
when he incidentally urges the election of a Democratic Congress.
How can party differences that matter so much in the House and
Senate not matter in the White House?
</P>
<P>
   Republicrats? Democrats would upgrade education by punching up
the resources of public schools. The preferred GOP answer is to use
tax-money vouchers substantially to replace public schools with
private, often sectarian ones.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore would shore up Social Security in strikingly
different ways. (Neither of them, by the way, fully credible.) Bush
is willing unilaterally to abrogate the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty; Gore seeks only to fine-tune it. Their environmental
records could not be more different.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on and the distinctions are not just superficial
or ones of only degree rather than of kind.
</P>
<P>
   And because the distinctions matter, Nader's claim is finally
not just nonsense but pernicious nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing it as he does, Nader is unlikely to bring voters
clamoring to his candidacy. Just the opposite. Americans prefer to
keep their political squabbles more over particulars than between
clashing ideological crusades.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's pitch most likely will just reinforce the dismissive
indifference by which a lazy electorate forfeits its democratic
franchise in stay-at-home apathy. The idea that Gore and Bush are
interchangeable fits the dangerous bill of goods we've sold
ourselves to the effect that politics doesn't matter; that it has
no consequences in our daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Out here in the real world, Nader won't talk many voters into
seeing him as offering a choice. Rather, he'll bolster the sorry
assumption that the realistic democratic choices don't matter.

WHO-DONE-ITS STEEPED IN BELIEVEABLE DETAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is, to my mind, an important difference between local
color and a sense of place. The first is an artificial pigment
applied, often too heavily, by a writer who is a bit insecure about
how to create a compelling story and who thinks an infinitude of
details, relevant or not, will carry the reader over some rough
patches; the result is often that the local color, however
interesting it may all be in the abstract, proves an annoyance. The
second grows out of a sense of confidence, and is provided by a
writer who truly understands the environment in which a book is
set. In the case of mystery and detective fiction, this means that
the locale (and the details used to bring the reader into that
locale) provides a reason rather than merely a setting for the
plot. I can't claim this distinction entirely escapes triteness,
but it served as the subject of rumination this month as I read a
number of new novels that seemed to me to prove my point.
</P>
<P>
   A fine example is ``Brigham's Day'' by John Gates (Walker,
$23.95). This first novel is one of the best debuts I have read in
a long time. The title refers in part to the protagonist, Brigham
Bybee, a lawyer who is brought to the small southern-Utah town of
Kanab to be second counsel in what local authorities hope will be
an open-and-shut case. Bybee has made a mess of his life by
bringing a leader of the Mormon Church to trial on charges of rape
and assault and then failing to get a conviction, thanks to
arrogance and too much alcohol, losing his wife and children in the
process. But the title also refers to Brigham Young, the Mormon
leader who may, Gates suggests, have ordered the killing of 120
California-bound settlers in 1857. Known as the Mountain Meadows
massacre, this event is marked by a small monument in southwest
Utah, and it is the focus of much controversy among Mormons and
those who dislike them for one reason or another. Bybee is a ``Jack
Mormon,'' a man who has left the church but still understands the
language, and he begins to believe that his client is innocent and
that the murder with which he is charged had to do with a document
that would reveal the truth about the events of 1857. Gates handles
the air of suspicion extremely well, and he plays against
stereotypes. Bybee is by no means a whole person; the fat and
sloppy (and certainly unethical) lawyer he is to back up proves to
be a far better investigator than one might imagine; and the
villains in the piece are often complex beneath simplistic
surfaces. Gates is a lawyer himself, and he uses his professional
and local knowledge (he was raised in Kanab) to tell a persistently
compelling story.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McGarrity does not write so well as Gates, but he too
tells a taut and convincing story in ``The Judas Judge'' (Dutton,
$23.95). The setting is the mountains of southern New Mexico,
between Carrizozo and Alamagordo, and the high desert is used to
great effect. McGarrity's series figure, police chief Kevin Kerney,
must deal with the apparently random murder of six individuals in
the campgrounds of this mountainous region; one of them is a
powerful local judge. Kerney kills a fellow officer early in the
action, which turns several members of the police against him.
McGarrity never lets the reader forget this high, dry, dramatic
land, or the Mescalero Apaches who live on it, or the nature of
life in communities that are taken for cities in their region
though they are, in fact, small towns. I read this one in a single
sitting, even forgiving the author for locating Creede, Colo.,
northeast of Alamosa, when it is well to the northwest (they are
two towns I know and care about from a previous age, when all that
mattered to me was beating them in high school football).
</P>
<P>
   Brent Monahan moves us to a far richer and more complicated
society in ``The Jekyl Island Club'' (Minotaur, $23.95), set on
that once idyllic Georgia coast that so attracted the rich at the
turn of the last century. A member of the club dies in a hunting
accident; the local sheriff must take on the members of a club who,
in 1899, controlled one-sixth of the nation's wealth. J. P. Morgan
and Joseph Pulitzer, President McKinley, and other top politicians
all figure in the action, and behavior, speech, and place are
lovingly presented.
</P>
<P>
   I also like ``Poison Apples'' by Nancy Means Wright (Minotaur,
$24.95), set in a wonderfully observed Vermont. Moira and Stan
Earthrowl are having a hard time of it, as their apple orchard (and
source of income) is going down the tubes. When poisoned fruit
kills a Jamaican picker, Moira has to call in help, in the form of
Vermont farmer Ruth Willmarth. Theme and setting could be cutesy,
folksy, or local-colored to death, but Wright doesn't put a foot
wrong in this well-wrought mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is ``Escape from Kathmandu'' by Kim Stanley
Robinson (Tor Books, $13.95 paperback), which is a delight. I have
never encountered Robinson before, despite a long list of credits
(mainly in science fiction, which I do not like). But I am an
instant convert. This is a straightforward adventure novel based on
the premise that in the high mountain valleys of Nepal the yeti, or
Abominable Snowman, actually exists. Nepal is a home away from home
to scores of American and British climbers, aging hippies,
occasional businessmen, and scientists who simply love the
Himalayas. Two of them link up to rescue a captured yeti and return
it to the wild. Former President Carter, any number of intriguing
Buddhists, and the yeti itself figure in the kind of romp that, a
century ago, might have been written by John Buchan or H. Rider
Haggard. In this century, Robinson is a terrific storyteller who
knows why shaggy-dog yarns survive, and the tale he tells could not
happen anywhere else.

ARE YOU WATCHING `BIG BROTHER' WATCH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It began to snowball last August with ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' and gained renewed force last month with another
summer phenomenon, CBS's ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``Big Brother,'' CBS is poised to turn another group
of previously anonymous Americans into TV stars while capitalizing
on the tube's hottest trend of the moment: ``reality'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The face of television has changed drastically in the last 12
months,'' said CBS Television president Leslie Moonves. ``And it
will continue to change.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, after weeks of relentless promotion, CBS
will unveil ``Big Brother.'' Slated to air five nights a week for
three months, it will showcase 10 contestants ranging in age from
early 20s to mid-40s, leaving behind their normal lives to be
cooped up together in a two-bedroom house built on a studio lot. As
they interact, 28 cameras and 60 microphones will record every move
they make and every word they utter.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they are denied access to newspapers, television,
phones, or the outside world, they will be subjects of what CBS and
partner America Online hope will be a multimedia event. Apart from
the nightly televised dose of ``Big Brother,'' AOL will allow
Internet users to monitor the goings-on in the house via streaming
video. Every two weeks, viewers will vote by telephone to expel one
person from the house. (AOL plans to offer live chats with each
contestant as he or she leaves the house). On the next to last
episode, viewers will choose a winner from the three remaining
housemates. And on Sept. 30, that winner will receive a check for
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never done a show remotely like this before,'' said
Moonves. ``We're treading in uncharted territory for an American
network. . . . It's exciting and scary at the same time because of
the newness of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   John de Mol, cocreator of the ``Big Brother'' series in Holland
and Germany, predicted that viewers of the US version ``will get
involved and intrigued with the people in the house and the
situations they are in.'' The contestants, he added, are ``people
you will mostly love and sometimes hate.''
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dog-eat-rat view
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But programs like ``Big Brother'' and ``Survivor'' have kindled
concerns about the invasion of privacy they seem to encourage.
Critics say the shows, with their arrangements designed to induce
tensions, appeal to a dog-eat-dog view of human nature. Moreover,
some say, the reality programs encourage the basest kind of
voyeurism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it is voyeuristic TV,'' conceded Moonves. But he said,
``I don't think it's necessarily bad. People are interested in what
other people will do in this situation. . . . There are 500
channels. You don't like it, change the channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, CBS is hoping that viewers don't touch that remote.
Moonves says ``Big Brother'' could be ``an even bigger event'' than
``Survivor,'' which is saying something. In its third episode, for
instance, ``Survivor'' drew an average of 23 million viewers, more
than the other five broadcast networks combined. Long known as the
broadcast home of older viewers, CBS has been ``totally
transformed'' by the blockbuster ratings and appeal to young
viewers of ``Survivor,'' according to Moonves.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first network to be transformed by a single show.
Last season, ``Millionaire'' revived the quiz-show genre _ which,
while different from ``reality'' programs, also relies on average
citizens as its stars _ and single-handedly propelled ABC from
third to first place in the ratings. ``Survivor'' and ``Big
Brother'' might reap similar dividends for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Big Brother,'' ``Survivor'' and ``Millionaire'' were
imported from Europe. So, inevitably, ABC recently announced that
it will produce an American version of ``The Mole,'' a reality
series from Belgium that follows a group of contestants assigned to
complete difficult tasks while unaware of a saboteur in their
midst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eyes of America were opened when `Millionaire' started the
trend,'' said Moonves. ``We were a little closed-minded. Americans
always assumed we were the exporters, not the importers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joining the club
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The race for reality programs promises to become even more
heated. NBC president Robert Wright, irked that the Peacock Network
is being left out of the trend while ratings for its dramas and
sitcoms dip, has reportedly ordered NBC programmers to come up with
a reality series, and soon. At CBS, Moonves does not rule out
airing ``Big Brother'' six nights a week, though five nights a week
is the planned schedule. De Mol, the chairman of Endemol
Entertainment, says the ``Big Brother'' format will expand to 25
countries in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the States, Moonves said, ``people are beating
down our doors with the most ridiculous rip-offs of `Big Brother'
and `Survivor' you've ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Although you'd never know it from the suggestive commercials CBS
has been running, Moonves and De Mol say there will be no nudity or
profanity in ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 contestants will share two small bedrooms and one
bathroom in a one-level house. They will do mundane chores _
maintain a vegetable garden, prepare dinner, do laundry _ and must
also fulfill a weekly ``challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, De Mol said, in Dutch and German versions of ``Big
Brother'' contestants were required to keep a fire burning in a
fire pit for a full week, to ride a stationary bicycle for hours at
a time, and to collaborate in the construction of a 3,000-piece
jigsaw puzzle that forms a picture of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, ``Big Brother'' will listen in as the
contestants pour out their hearts to each other. ``There will be a
lot of conversation,'' said De Mol. ``If you picture a normal soap,
like `The Bold and the Beautiful,' it's all conversation. But this
is real.''

ASSISTING AFRICA'S DILEMMA MEANS ACKNOWLEDGING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What if tomorrow the news media reported that 20 percent of the
United States' population is infected with HIV, the AIDS virus?
Outraged, panicky, and scared Americans from California to
Massachusetts would be up in arms, demanding that the government
take immediate steps to combat this epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Then suppose that, the next day, the media reported that more
than 50 percent of America's 15-year-olds would die from AIDS. The
result would likely be a quickly organized march of millions of
panic-stricken and angry citizens on Washington, demanding that our
leaders do something to reverse the deadly trend.
</P>
<P>
   The panic and anger in the United States would spread if, on the
third day, the media reported that in neighborhing Canada and
Mexico, one-fifth of the populace was infected with HIV _ as was
more than one-third of the population in nearby Puerto Rico. Or
that in Texas, 2,000 people were dying each week from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   This nightmare scenario is, of course, just that, and is not
true in this part of the world. But it is very real in South
Africa, where 20 percent of the population, or 4.2 million people,
are HIV positive; and in Botswana, where one in three adults is
infected with HIV; and in Zimbabwe, where 2,000 people are dying of
AIDS each week.
</P>
<P>
   Africa's sad story spreads even farther: to 16 sub-Saharan
African nations, where more than one-tenth of the population
between the ages of 15-49 has HIV, and where in seven countries, 20
percent of the population is infected.
</P>
<P>
   Apply Botswana's HIV infection rate to the United States, and it
would mean that 90 million of our 270 million would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the staggering enormity of the epidemic in Africa,
the world has not shown anywhere near the the anger, the outrage _
or even just the concern _ that would have been registered if the
statistics applied to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When other tragedies befall Africa _ such as when innocents are
slaughtered at the hands of warring rebels and troops _ the media
at least takes note, or raises questions about the motive. But
reports of a scourge as devastating as the Black Plague that ripped
across Europe and Asia in the 14th century don't seem to spark even
a moderate level of interest in the United States and other Western
nations.
</P>
<P>
   True, this country has its own HIV and AIDS problem to deal
with. And despite making some progress in this area, we seem to be
backsliding. A sharp decline in the AIDS death rate here _ it
dropped 42 percent from 1996 to 1997 _ has since slowed to half
that rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
In real numbers, AIDS killed more than 17,000 people in the United
States last year.
</P>
<P>
   The decline has leveled off in part because AIDS drugs have
apparently lost much of their effectiveness. And, as one doctor
noted, ``AIDS drugs don't work for everyone, and are not a cure for
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17,000 Americans killed by AIDS last year were
disproportionately African-American, according to the CDC. While
blacks make up 13 percent of the US population, they accounted for
49 percent of AIDS deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Helen Gayle, director of HIV prevention at the CDC, made an
important point during a recent MSNBC interview. ``In many ways,''
she said, ``the story of how well we do in HIV and AIDS will be
told by how well we do with the African-American population.''
</P>
<P>
   It could also be said that how well we do with HIV and AIDS will
be told by how well the United States and other Western nations do
with the AIDS epidemic in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   UN representatives attribute the explosion of HIV and AIDS in
southern Africa to the legacy of apartheid, the racially segregated
system that separated men from their families in rural areas and
sent them to work in towns where prostitutes also worked.
</P>
<P>
   But they also blame the governments for ignoring the problem for
far too long. What has happened in southern African, they add,
should be a lesson for other regions, including Asia, Eastern
Europe and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also important that the United States, Canada, and
other nations in the world pool their financial and educational
resources to combat this still-growing epidemic. Thus far, AIDS has
killed 19 million people worldwide, and orphaned 13 million
children. Another 34 million are HIV-infected.
</P>
<P>
   As parts of the world once needed the Marshall Plan to keep
millions of people in Europe from starving, the nations infected
with the HIV/AIDS epidemic need a massive plan to keep millions of
adults and children from dying.
</P>
<P>
   They had best begin now, or the news media may someday be
reporting on how HIV and AIDS is destroying the US population as
fast as destroyed the people of southern Africa.

GENE THERAPY EFFORT STALLS IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE DEMBNER AND LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Skittish patients, safety issues, and concerns about
financial conflicts are forcing a reduction and rethinking of gene
therapy experiments in New England, just as the mapping of the
human genome opens endless research possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat in a field involving hundreds of New England
researchers and patients may slow development of life-saving
treatments in diseases ranging from cystic fibrosis to cancer. It
also represents a setback to prominent medical centers working to
establish leadership positions in the field and may threaten small
biotech companies that could run out of capital before their
therapies are proved successes or failures.
</P>
<P>
   A Globe survey found that as many as 10 out of the approximately
30 gene therapy experiments underway or recently concluded in New
England are on hold or have had trouble recruiting patients.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, a researcher recently gave up on a trial in ovarian
cancer because she could not persuade enough people to participate.
Two doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital said progress on
their experiments slowed when they, too, enrolled fewer
participants than expected.
</P>
<P>
   At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, meanwhile, safety
concerns raised by a Harvard oversight committee blocked a planned
experiment. And a clinical trial that might have been held in
Boston is being conducted in England, in part because of a
Massachusetts General Hospital researcher's desire to avoid a
financial conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Major studies at two other hospitals in Boston remain on hold _
at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center because of FDA concerns about
inadequate protection for participants, and at Beth Israel
Deaconess because of an institutional review of the experiment's
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, similar problems are affecting experiments seeking
to treat a variety of diseases by inserting genes into the body to
replace missing or defective ones. Several trials that had been
placed on hold because of FDA or institutional concerns have been
discontinued, while others have resumed enrolling participants with
additional safeguards. Many are struggling to enroll participants.
The University of Pennsylvania, where an 18-year-old became gene
therapy's only official fatality last September, has yet to resume
human gene trials.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to be months before all the trials are back on
track.
</P>
<P>
   Some ethicists and scientists say the field needed shaking up
because the research had expanded far too fast and without thorough
patient protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field is chastened in a way that will ultimately help
it,'' said Dr. David T. Scadden, codirector of the Massachusetts
General Hospital AIDS Research Center and principal investigator of
several gene therapy experiments for HIV. ``The problems have
slowed things down and cast a shadow over what many in the field
regard as a promising new area for therapeutics. The more we can do
to avoid ethical or safety issues that undermine the science the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Scadden and other New England gene researchers said they do not
and would not conduct human experiments with any product in which
they have a financial interest, because of the potential for
conflict. At both UPenn and St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, the
institutions and the researchers overseeing the trials had a
financial stake in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Pennsylvania death, there have been numerous
others in nearly 400 gene therapy experiments nationally, although
none definitively caused by the therapy itself. Many of the deaths
and other serious side effects were not properly reported to
federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting issues were among the problems at St. Elizabeth's,
where two of 45 participants died, and at Beth Israel, where three
of six died. In both cases, the participants had long histories of
serious illness. Researchers said they believe the patients died of
those illnesses and not of the gene therapy, although the timing of
the deaths has raised questions.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of human gene experiments in New England, who number
more than two dozen, say they have strengthened safety measures,
expanded information given to participants about potential risks,
and become much more vigilant about reporting problems to oversight
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Based on safety concerns, a Harvard committee overseeing gene
therapy trials twice this spring rejected a proposed experiment in
which genes would be injected into the hearts of people with
serious heart disease to stimulate blood vessel growth. The two
people who died in the St. Elizabeth's experiment underwent a
similar procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Onderdonk, a pathology professor and chairman of the
Harvard Biosafety Committee, said Genzyme Inc.'s protocol did not
call for a control group _ patients injected with a placebo _ that
would help them determine whether side effects were due to the drug
or the disease. He said neither the national climate of opinion nor
the deaths at St. Elizabeth's had anything to do with the
committee's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the Department of Health and Human Services ordered
tougher protections and expanded safety plans, and both the Food
and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health
launched programs to inspect more ongoing research. The 70
additional FDA inspections will be made at sites with small gene
trials, and the NIH has selected 10 of the largest sites conducting
all types of human research, including Harvard Medical School. The
Harvard visit will be July 19-20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to welcome all public scrutiny. That will just make us
better,'' said Dr. Antonio E. Chiocca, a surgeon at Massachusetts
General Hospital who is the principal investigator of a gene trial
for patients with advanced brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But concern about the risks of gene therapy is taking its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tracey Weisberg of the Maine Center for Cancer Medicine in
Scarborough said she canceled the center's gene therapy trial for
ovarian cancer in April because of low enrollment. Primary care
doctors in the region were not referring many patients, and the
dozen who were referred were too worried about harmful side effects
to enroll, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the news in the paper, they weren't willing to take
that kind of risk,'' Weisberg said. The trial is continuing in
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   At MGH, Scadden said he enrolled only half the number of
participants he had planned for in a study using genetically
altered stem cells to fight HIV. ``There was a lot of concern about
potential toxic effects,'' he said. ``Unless people are in a
position where this is their only hope, they're not willing to go
through it until they can be sure there are going to be no adverse
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Scadden said there was one death in his study and that he
believes it was unrelated to the gene transfer. The man had
treatment-resistant lymphoma and suffered a relapse of the tumor in
his brain, Scadden said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was closed last month by its sponsor, SyStemix, a
subsidiary of the drug company Novartis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results did not meet what they would see as a commercially
viable level of success,'' Scadden said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, a decade of human gene experiments has resulted in
only glimmers of success. This spring, French scientists reported
that gene treatment of four babies with severely defective immune
systems had resulted in nearly complete recovery. The prognosis for
a fifth infant was not as good.
</P>
<P>
   Combining with safety issues, much of the national concern about
gene transfer experiments has arisen from the financial investment
of some researchers in their own work and questions about whether
that would bias them or lead them to bypass safety rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the two most prominent instances of potential conflict, both
UPenn and St. Elizabeth's have denied that financial motives
affected the studies. But UPenn has barred its Institute for Human
Gene Therapy from conducting any clinical trials. St. Elizabeth's
has said that Dr. Jeffrey M. Isner, who helped found a company to
develop gene therapy, will not take part in final tests of that
therapy. In addition, the hospital's financial interest will be
disclosed to all future test subjects, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But that may not go far enough. The American Society of Gene
Therapy adopted a policy in April that bars its members from any
involvement with human experiments sponsored by companies in which
they have equity. The society's immediate past president, Savio
Woo, said the society was monitoring Isner's situation to see
whether the hospital allows him to resume oversight of early human
tests. If so, the society would consider expelling Isner unless he
divests, Woo said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Elizabeth's ``should probably turn over those trials to
other medical centers,'' said Dr. Mel H. Epstein, a Brown
University neurosurgeon who oversaw one of the first gene therapy
trials nationally to reach the final stages _ a test of genetically
altered herpes simplex virus in brain tumors called glioblastomas.
``I don't think anyone should own stock in a company and
simultaneously be testing that product in patients. And I don't
think public disclosure changes that,'' Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Across New England, there appear to be few others with such
direct potential conflicts, although much of the research is funded
by pharmaceutical or biomedical firms.
</P>
<P>
   Chiocca, of MGH, said he avoided such a conflict by not
participating in human experiments that were testing an approach he
developed along with researchers at Boston University and the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. That approach was licensed to Oxford
BioMedica, a British company, and the hospitals and researchers
received fees and royalties. The trial is being conducted in
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role (as experiment leaders) is to determine whether
something is an exciting new treatment or toxic to patients,''
Chiocca said. ``We have to make that judgment in the most unbiased
manner. . . . If the success of my trial would make me rich, or if
there's any suggestion I would benefit financially, then I should
not be doing the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Scadden said he believes it's critical that gene researchers
exercise special vigilance about potential conflicts. ``The field
is being affected in a negative way, and we don't want to have it
stalled because of these concerns,'' he said. ``This is a field
that needs to be squeaky-clean.''

SAVING HOME HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ In the language of government programs, they
call it home health care.
</P>
<P>
   To Senator Susan Collins in Maine, it has human faces that mock
the dry terminology _ a couple in their 80s up in Caribou, the area
in northern Maine she comes from, who have been married more than
50 years and only want to be together in their home in their final
years. A professional who visits them to provide care makes that
life possible.
</P>
<P>
   But for 7,000 of the Republican senator's elderly and disabled
constituents, that simple yearning is no longer possible, the
result of a government goof of colossal proportions that now
borders on the intentional because it has been allowed to go
uncorrected for three years. In addition, there has been a 30
percent drop in actual visits to homes by professionals and a 26
percent plunge in Medicare payments to the state's home health
agencies. None of it is justified.
</P>
<P>
   To Representative Jim McGovern in Massachusetts, home health
care means another retired couple in his native Worcester living in
an apartment nowhere near public transportation. The husband is
ailing but can be treated less expensively by a visiting
professional in their home than in a nursing home. They are facing
the loss of this care, which is likely to send the husband to that
nursing home and make Herculean his wife's task simply to visit
him.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes the Democratic congressman think of a guy in
Upton, a multiple sclerosis patient who can still get by with home
treatment. All it will take is staff reductions at the outfit
serving him (a distinct likelihood) to leave him with no
alternative to institutional care.
</P>
<P>
   For national perspective on this mess, Senator John Kerry says
that since the government goof in 1997, more than 2,500 agencies
delivering health care to people's homes have had to close, robbing
more than a half-million people of services that are the threads in
their safety net. The cause is direct: Three years ago the federal
government was spending $17.5 billion on home health care; since
then the figure has been slashed more or less in half. The
Congressional Budget Office estimates that between 1998 and 2002,
some $69 billion will have been taken away from a system that was
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing the industry,'' he told me. ``We're losing a
vital component of the health care community; the plugs are getting
yanked out of this system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand it when government directly creates harm,''
Collins says with refreshing anger.
</P>
<P>
   Three New England legislators are leading the effort in Congress
to replace the Clinton administration's Band-Aids for providers of
Medicare and Medicaid services with a full restoration of home
health care's status. Collins is a moderate Republican, McGovern a
liberal Democrat, and Kerry a New Democrat _ the natural coalition
supporting this cause is that broad.
</P>
<P>
   Collins and Kerry in the Senate and McGovern in the House late
last month joined forces to push for an end to the cutbacks, which
began with the balanced budget agreement of 1997. Collins is
leading an effort to forestall an additional reduction of 15
percent for home health care as of late next year. So far, 52
senators agree with her.
</P>
<P>
   New England, along with the Midwest, is the jewel in the home
health care system, with strong traditions of well-run, nonprofit
service providers. Cases of excessive payments to fast-buck artists
have been concentrated elsewhere, especially in the South. What
happened three years ago was a classic case of babies and
bathwater.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare went on the table in the final stages of the budget
talks. What was portrayed as an easily absorbable nick in payments
to Medicare's providers _ home health care agencies, teaching
hospitals, and nursing homes _ turned out to be something else
again. The estimate of savings in the payment system for home
health care providers was about $16 billion; the last time anyone
checked, the actual reduction was at least four times that.
</P>
<P>
   That's ridiculous. Clinton last month proposed that some
additional money go to providers next year. Something similar
happened a year ago with the huge pot of desperately needed funds
lost by teaching hospitals. But the president's approach is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot stopgap this thing,'' Kerry told me. ``It's worse
than Band-Aids; it's triage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ours is population that is aging rapidly. It is simply nuts to
eviscerate the basic infrastructure for the services seniors and
the disabled depend on through Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, to take the last steps to a balanced budget,
Clinton and Congress made a colossal mistake. Collins, Kerry, and
McGovern are right: The time has come to fix it.

CRITICS FIRE AT NEW NASA ROCKET EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA is about to embark on its biggest new program since the
high-priced and perpetually delayed space station. But hardly
anyone seems to have noticed it, except some critics who say the
program could actually stall attempts to develop the space
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet analysts expect Congress to approve the five-year, $4.4
billion plan within the next few weeks, virtually without debate.
</P>
<P>
   It is called the Space Launch Initiative, aimed at developing
new rockets that could eventually replace the aging space shuttle.
The five-year program is just the first stage of a 40-year plan the
agency has mapped out. Though it is the largest program the agency
has initiated since it began working on the $60-billion-and-growing
space station project in 1982, it remains virtually unknown to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which
announced the plan in February, says it is intended to bring
together various plans within the agency aimed at improving the
safety, reliability, and affordability of launch vehicles. The
program focuses on development of a ``second generation'' reusable
launch vehicle that would eventually replace the fleet of space
shuttles, with a goal of increasing safety a hundredfold and
slashing costs by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes smaller projects to develop rockets that could
help ferry supplies to the International Space Station, and to test
concepts for new technology.
</P>
<P>
   And, the agency says, its aim is to foster the commercialization
of the space launch business and to encourage competition. Toward
that end, it intends to provide contracts to multiple companies,
leading to perhaps a whole family of piloted and unpiloted
configurations for the replacement shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   But critics are skeptical, contending that while NASA is saying
the right things in public, the documents spelling out the details
of the plan suggest that its effect could be to impede the very
competition it purports to promote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is NASA's next giant mistake,'' said Robert Zubrin, an
aerospace engineer and president of the Mars Society, an advocacy
group for space exploration. ``The first was the shuttle, and
abandoning all the Apollo-era hardware. The second was the space
station. This is the next, and it is a program to basically
replicate capabilities we already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many advocates for increased exploration, Zubrin thinks the
shuttle and space station programs have devoured most of NASA's
budget and thus precluded more ambitious programs with the
potential to generate both important scientific data and public
enthusiasm, such as human missions to Mars. Others suggest the
priority should be on fostering the development of low-cost ways to
reach orbit, enabling a gold rush of space-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the space station project generated intense debate and
annual attempts by Congress to kill it, so far there has been
virtually no political or public opposition to the new initiative,
which NASA describes as its third-highest priority (after the
shuttle and space station).
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, say critics, is that any person or company
involved in the aerospace business is so dependent on NASA that few
are willing to criticize the agency's plan in public. But, they
say, concerns about the new plan run deep when aerospace people
talk in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably get fired'' for talking about it, said Tim
Kyger, a Washington lobbyist for Universal Space Lines, during an
interview with the Globe. But, he said, the plan is so threatening
to the prospects for a new generation of low-cost, reusable space
vehicles that he felt compelled to take the risk.
</P>
<P>
   While touted as a means to foster the development of a new
generation of rockets, the plan will actually stifle it, Kyger
said. For one thing, NASA is insisting that any vehicles developed
under the plan be 15 percent larger in payload capacity than the
shuttle _ a size most analysts think precludes most possible
private, commercial uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's forward into the past,'' Kyger said. Under the plan, he
said, ``we will keep doing the same thing we have been doing.'' And
the plan could take on a life of its own and dominate the space
agency's budget for decades, he said. ``It literally sets up a plan
which they have sketched out through 2040. . . . What it will
produce is another shuttle or station program that goes on and on
forever, and sucks up all the agency's resources.''
</P>
<P>
   One major concern is that by spelling out a plan under which it
would take NASA 10 to 15 years to begin producing a new, reusable
launch vehicle, the agency will cast a pall on any financing
prospects for the several companies trying to develop low-cost
launchers much faster than that. But others caution that much
depends on the details, and the plan could end up being of some
help to some of the companies if it provides small launch contracts
to them, as is envisaged under part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Smith, NASA's deputy director of space transportation at
Marshall Space Flight Center, defends the program and says it is
intended to foster just the kind of commercialization and
competition for launch vehicle companies that the critics advocate.
He said in an interview that the program was developed with
extensive consultation with representatives from industry, and that
in defining requirements for vehicles developed under the program
NASA intends to ``make sure they are as applicable to commercial
needs as to NASA's needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plan is ``fatally flawed'' and based on ``fundamentally
wrong assumptions,'' according to an analysis by the Space Access
Society, an advocacy group that has been calling for investment in
research aimed at ``cheap access to space.''
</P>
<P>
   The society, along with many independent aerospace engineers and
about a dozen small startup companies, believes that it is possible
within just a few years to produce rockets that could slash the
cost of launching hardware into space by 90 percent, and that even
reductions to as little as one one-100th of present costs are
ultimately feasible. When that happens, they say, whole new
industries will rise up to take advantage of that access, including
same-day package delivery to anyplace on Earth, manufacturing of
high-value products such as pharmaceuticals and microelectronics,
and even space tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say that regardless of what NASA does or
doesn't do, the efforts of small companies to create a new
generation of launch vehicles using private financing are doomed.
``Stepping aside and waiting for the private sector is not going to
work,'' said John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute
at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no investment money for these little innovative
companies,'' Logsdon said. This is not NASA's fault, he says, but
rather a result of the general Wall Street aversion to risk, and
recent space-related business failures such as the Motorola-backed
Iridium global satellite cell-phone system, which declared
bankruptcy earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That market has kind of collapsed,'' Logsdon said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Smith agreed, saying that market projections for the
launch business ``have changed dramatically'' in the last few
years, and are ``nowhere near what they were,'' requiring NASA now
to take a more active role in supporting the development of
next-generation rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The critics counter that NASA itself has helped to chill the
investment climate, partly by choosing the riskiest of three
contenders for its X-33 project to develop a reusable demonstration
rocket.
</P>
<P>
   As many engineers predicted, that project has been plagued with
problems, is behind schedule and over budget, and has had serious
problems with the development of advanced composite-materials tanks
for liquid oxygen. Originally scheduled to fly this year, the
vehicle has been postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's long-range plan, said aerospace engineer and consultant
Charles Lurio, a longtime advocate of the development of
inexpensive rockets, ``is a sequence of 10-year programs with the
proclaimed goal of slashing launch cost each decade, yet showing
every sign of building ever-higher the barriers'' to such cost
reduction. With its inclusion of far-flung technologies like
antimatter propulsion and long electromagnetic catapults, he said,
the plan is ``like saying in 1930 that we need a supersonic
transport before we start carrying passengers through the air at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   What is needed instead, many engineers think, is a
less-expensive, faster, but less-glamorous series of small research
vehicles and ground-based tests to establish basic, reliable
technology, such as simple, long-lived rocket engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they need is boring research and development to make
robust technology,'' Lurio said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is accusing the space agency of deliberately thwarting
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they're doing the right thing, they really do,''
said Kyger. But ``they don't see the unintended consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   And in this case, he said, the consequence could be disastrous
for the many startup companies hoping to build inexpensive reusable
rockets. ``What SLI will do,'' he said, ``is make sure all the new
guys don't get to build anything.''

   NADER-SPOILER (Washington) _ The spoiler scenario has been a
recurring theme during this presidential campaign. Earlier,
Republicans were concerned that Patrick Buchanan would erode
conservative support for Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Now Vice
President Al Gore faces a threat from the left _ Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader. But Nader rejects the idea that he could
take enough votes from Gore to ruin the Democrat's chances. ``I
don't view myself as a spoiler, but as a reformer,'' Nader says. By

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ In his dissent from the Supreme
Court ruling that the Boy Scouts may bar gays as troop leaders,
Justice John Paul Stevens quotes the legendary Justice Louis
Brandeis: ``We must be ever on our guard lest we erect our
prejudices into legal principles.'' The majority, who found that
the Scouts could not be forced to accept troop leaders they do not
want, was more worried about the group's freedom of expressive
association. It was a classic conflict of rights, and the high
bench made the wrong pick. By MARIANNE MEANS.

<P>
   Rose-colored glasses too cliche? Try yellow, green, purple, or
blue in oversized aviators, retro styles, or futuristic frames for
eyeshade chic this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But fashion shouldn't be the only guide when choosing a tint.
Think neutral-colored lenses, such as gray or green, for the most
versatile protection and comfort. For driving cars (or golf balls),
try brown because it offers definition, the easier to find that
Titleist in the rough. Yellow and amber lenses work best where
depth perception is important _ and if you insist on wearing your
shades when the light is low.
</P>
<P>
   As for the season's trendiest tones, pink and blue, they distort
color. However, the sales pitch goes, the former can be pretty on
certain skin tones and blue can soothe.
</P>
<P>
   Polarized coatings block normal and horizontal rays that hit the
eye from reflected surfaces, making these lenses among the most
comforting to the eyes, especially when on the beach or in a boat.
</P>
<P>
   Keep those mirrored lenses around next winter for the ski slopes
because they block additional light.
</P>
<P>
   There's a common myth that darker lenses offer the most
protection _ from the sun or being recognized. But if the tint's
too dark, it can impair vision.
</P>
<P>
   That sorted, what's the difference between a $10 pair of
sunglasses and a $400 pair? It's not as simple as KMart or Gucci.
After all, you can find sunglasses with 100 percent protection
against ultraviolet rays _ which can cause cataracts and wrinkles
around the eyes _ even in some of the least pricey models. And all
glasses must meet the same government standard for shatter
resistance and lens retention.
</P>
<P>
   Some plastic designer glasses are handmade of cellulose acetate,
which is more likely to lose its shape if left on the dashboard of
a hot car, says Foster Grant's Mark Flanagan. And glass lenses,
heavier and costlier, are not as shatter-proof as plastic, although
they provide the clearest view and can reduce the likelihood of
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, high-end retailers insist design detail, lens
quality, fit, frame material and overall durability can be worth
the extra expense. To say nothing of the logo.

ACTIVISTS PLAN TO COUNTER THE CONVENTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's an unconventional approach to presidential
politics, but that's the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed that the Republican and Democratic national conventions
have become ``coronations,'' a loose coalition of political
activists, religious leaders, and social satirists has decided to
hold its own.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia and again in Los Angeles, the plan is to talk
issues during the day and party into the night, to make Americans
think hard about certain issues and then make them laugh out loud.
</P>
<P>
   The Shadow Conventions will feature mothers barely making ends
meet, real people with real problems, mixed in with multimedia
presentations intended to inform and amuse.
</P>
<P>
   US Senator John McCain is slated to speak on the East Coast,
``Politically Incorrect'' host Bill Maher on the West. Academy
Award winner and presidential tease Warren Beatty is also expected
to put in an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities aside, the emphasis will be on what convention
planners view as the government's failed drug policy, the growing
gap between rich and poor, and the need for serious campaign
finance reform, as well as the possibility of taking the nation
public by selling stock in America.
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan hosts plan to carry the shadow conventions live
on the Internet, enabling anyone with a computer to participate in
the discussions and possibly allowing them to vote, via
``bozometer,'' on the usually long-winded speeches at the major
party conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying that the other conventions are going to be
scripted events addressing themselves to a shrinking audience, a
shrinking voting public, a shrinking engaged public,'' said
political columnist Arianna Huffington, who helped galvanize the
shadow conventions. ``Ours are going to be substantive, not satire
driven. Celebrities are only going to be included if they have a
real position on our issues. But we're also going to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Part politics, part performance art, the shadow conventions will
run in August on the same days as the traditional conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But the upstarts hope to get a jump on the nation. Their
substantive sessions will be held from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., before
the major parties get going and, organizers hope, before national
ennui sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the Republican and Democratic conventions are
invited to attend the shadow events, which will be held nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aim is that in the morning we'll put on some of our
headliners and have some new people speaking out and that in the
evening we'll focus much more on providing entertainment,'' said
Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith Center, a drug policy
institute and another of the conveners.
</P>
<P>
   Between the comedy and concerts, of course, the conveners have
some points to make. Charging that the major parties are too timid
or too political even to address issues of concern to many
Americans, organizers promised that they will not shy from tough
discussion. Instead, funded by foundation grants, the shadow
conventions are intended to hark back to the days when national
conventions were about debating issues and setting agendas.
</P>
<P>
   While the major party conventions feature success stories,
shadow convention organizers say theirs will emphasize the people
left out of the economic recovery, among them former welfare
mothers now working for minimum wage and small business owners
struggling to meet their payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   According to high-tech wizard Peter Hirshberg, who conceived the
shadow conventions with Huffington at a California technology
conference, impoverished youngsters and other children will be
invited to tell their stories, as vans carrying the latest in video
equipment roll out across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventions will highlight people who have done well;
we'll have the people who haven't done so well,'' said Jim Wallis,
editor in chief of Sojourner magazine and head of Call to Renewal,
a faith-based coalition that has made the elimination of poverty a
priority. ``Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore want the support of our
members. We're saying, `If you want us at the table, you have to
put poverty on the agenda.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another emphasis at the shadow conventions will be the
disproportionate number of blacks and Hispanics serving lengthy
prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenses, as well as the
failure of the nation's drug policy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The third focus will be the campaign finance reform that
conveners said neither Republicans nor Democrats have shown any
real interest in bringing about. One day will be devoted to each of
the three issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventions today are glorified money drives and showcases
for coronations,'' said Scott Harshbarger, the former Massachusetts
attorney general who is now president of Common Cause, a national
organization that advocates for campaign finance reform and is a
convener of the Shadow Conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that they're working very hard not to deal in any
way with issues that are controversial,'' Harshbarger said. ``We'll
provide a stark alternative, not liberal or conservative, left or
right, just willing to do what conventions used to do, and that's
to be a forum for debate, discussion, and also for proposing
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Conveners said they realize that they first have to grab the
nation's attention, in an era when even the major television
networks see no reason for gavel-to-gavel coverage of the
conventions and barely half of all eligible voters bother to cast a
ballot in presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   So after the Rev. Jesse Jackson speaks, after the workshops
conducted by academics, policymakers, and political activists,
after, in a sense, the medicine goes down, the poetry readings and
cultural events will begin.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can participate. They can even run for president
themselves, complete with campaign commercials and offers to sell
out for big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the shadow conventions came about at a breakfast
where Hirshberg had just unveiled an Internet game that pokes fun
at the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Called Ipocracy, and expected to launch shortly before the
Republican National Convention, the game involves a mock public
stock offering in the US government, with the proceeds used to help
pay down the national debt. Would-be candidates have to pick their
political affiliation, from Nikita S. Khrushchev on the far left to
Regis Philbin in the middle to Benito Mussolini on the far right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ipocracy just got us talking about the reform movement that
McCain kicked off,'' Hirshberg said. ``We were talking about how
the energy would be lost soon and how the conventions would be same
old, same old. . . . It occurred to us that there had to be an
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   In both Philadelphia and Los Angeles, the alternatives get
underway the night before the traditional conventions open. But the
greater the success, the less likely there will be a second set of
shadow conventions in four years. As Huffingon explained, conveners
hope that their unconventional conventions will force the major
parties to rethink their own conventions next time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to make ourselves unnecessary very quickly,'' she
asid. ``If the two parties address our issues seriously, we'd be
happy to be rendered redundant.''

MAMZELLE DRAGONFLY 
By Raphael Confiant (translated, from the French, by Linda
Coverdale) 
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 169 pp., $22 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the tree, Adelise tells her secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the far end of her mother's garden, the flowering
mangrove tree is her confidant, her soul mate. For hours at a time,
Adelise wraps her arms around its trunk, her heart pounding against
its bark, her feet planted near the roots where her mother buried
her umbilical cord. Such is their bond that each new dawn, Adelise
even eats some of the tree's small white blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother chastises her preoccupation with the tree, accusing
Adelise of being oblivious to reality, of breezing through life
``like dragonflies fluttering over waterlilies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You must learn every evening to think on all the things you
promised yourself to accomplish during the day, and if you happened
to succeed perfectly with a single one, then you can give into
contentment,'' her mother says. ``That's the lesson life teaches
us, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyrical yet unsentimental, Raphael Confiant's ``Mamzelle
Dragonfly'' tells of the harsh lessons life teaches Adelise, a girl
on the tenuous edge of womanhood. Set amid the social and political
restlessness of a 1950s Martinique clamoring for independence from
France, this is a novel of hardship endured, and about how a girl
learns to separate her mind and body from the circumstances and
people who threaten to tear her apart.
</P>
<P>
   Adelise is only 14 when she first goes to work for the
blanc-pays _ rich white landowners on her West Indian island. ``In
the middle of the sun's fierce dance,'' she would toil with the
other children _ ``the li'l gangs'' _ tying together bundles of
sugar cane felled by the relentless cutlasses of the men. Though
her mother warns Adelise about the boys, it is the adult field
commanders who pose the biggest threat to the girls, raping them
repeatedly in the rough grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wondered why Rosalie claimed that making love was
a thing as sweet as honey-dipped sugar. I didn't understand because
I felt absolutely nothing. Nothing at all,'' Adelise says. ``I'd be
lying on the bare ground, watching the men's eyeballs roll back,
listening to their chuffing in their throats, while their hands
stroked all over my skin and their loins thrust roughly into mine.
What pleasure could they possibly take in that?''
</P>
<P>
   Here, Adelise learns to escape her own body, to become ``harder
and harder, hard as iron.'' It is an ability that serves her well
when she is sent from her tiny hamlet to Fort-de-France, a mean,
teeming city, to live with her aunt Philomene. Though Adelise's
mother is the younger sister, Philomene is everything Adelise's
mother is not. She is chatty and bawdy, full of stories and advice
for Adelise.
</P>
<P>
   Philomene is also a prostitute. She tells her niece, ``just
because I'm a whore doesn't mean you have to become one too. I
didn't choose this trade, I was dragged into it by poverty and bad
luck _ they're what brought me to the life.'' But within a year,
Adelise, now 17, is turning tricks as well because, as Philomene
tells her, ``It's not pretty, but what can I say? When you're born
hard up, there's stuff you've got to do to survive.'' There's much
money a ``little black virgin'' can make among ``the big
bourgeois,'' Philomene says to Adelise.
</P>
<P>
   And so Adelise detaches herself, allowing men time and again to
take her body, while she keeps her spirit pure and whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dolled myself up in elegant dresses, cancan petticoats,
streetwalker kicks, colliers-chou, and all kinds of fancy
fripperies, but they didn't matter to me,'' Adelise says. ``Not a
snap. My body did not belong to me, I'd lost it with the passing
days, only my heart remained mine, and what brooded there was
heartache beyond measure for my tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Confiant's searing writing recalls the work of Edwidge Danticat,
the acclaimed young Haitian-American author of ``Krik? Krak!'' and
``The Farming of Bones.'' There is a similar wonder and beauty
here, one that never quite softens his most difficult passages, but
wraps them in the sad, lovely poetry of a wounded yet resilient
soul.
</P>
<P>
   In his native Martinique, Confiant has published several
award-winning novels, and is considered an important figure in
French literarature. With ``Mamzelle Dragonfly,'' Confiant's first
novel translated into English, the rest of the world may soon
understand why.

THE MONK IN THE GARDEN 
The Lost and Found Genius of Gregor Mendel, the Father of
Genetics. 
By Robin Marantz Henig. Houghton Mifflin. 292 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The race to map the human genome reached fruition last week,
with promises of a revolution in medicine spurred by reading out
the genetic scripts in our own DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project has been the epitome of Big Science:
scientific teams collaborating across vast distances, costly
supercomputers and robot gene-readers, published papers with dozens
of authors' names.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes the timing of Robin Marantz Henig's excellent book
about the ``father of genetics'' just about perfect. The work of
Gregor Mendel, who lived from 1822 to 1884, was rediscovered just a
century ago this year: It had lain ignored for 35 years after he
reported his revelations about heredity, which ultimately
galvanized a new generation of biologists who went on to discover
genes, chromosomes, and DNA _ all unknown to Mendel.
</P>
<P>
   Mendel's story, as delightfully told in ``The Monk in the
Garden,'' is miles away from Big Science. It's the tale of a
solitary researcher, a rotund, cigar-loving (as many as 20 a day)
cleric who carried out his experiments while leading a simple life
in a monastery. He had, and needed, little equipment except pen and
paper, seeds and a sunny garden, and penetrating intelligence _ as
well as immense patience.
</P>
<P>
   Mendel's historic work was carried out in the St. Thomas
monastery in Brno, in what is now the Czech Republic. In tediously
systematic breeding experiments between 1857 and 1863, Mendel
examined more than 28,000 pea plants in an effort to understand how
individual traits _ like height, seed shape, seed pod color, and so
forth _ were passed along from one generation to another.
</P>
<P>
   The question was of more than academic interest. Agricultural
improvement was a hot topic, but scientists could not yet predict
what succeeding generations of sheep or fruit trees, for example,
would look like. It was mainly a trial-and-error process.
</P>
<P>
   The going theory was that if you crossed (bred) strains of
plants or animals with differing traits, the offspring would
display ``blended'' or intermediate traits: tall plants crossed
with short ones would yield medium-sized offspring, contrasting
colors would converge toward an in-between hue.
</P>
<P>
   Mendel disproved this. His hard-won insights, which would point
the way toward the discovery of chromosomes and genes in the traits
are inherited as pure units _ not blended _ and the traits reappear
in successive generations in mathematically predictable ratios.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Mendel, the two units of each trait, one from
the father and one from the mother, are passed randomly to the
offspring. That is, any offspring can have any combination of
paternal and maternal traits. He showed that some ``factors'' _
what we now call genes _ are dominant and determine the offsprings'
appearance, even though recessive factors persist and will show up
in future generations.
</P>
<P>
   But his work, conveyed in two reports to a local society and in
a few letters, was virtually ignored until 35 years later. As one
contemporary put it, ``not a soul believed his experiments were
anything more than a pastime, and his theories anything more than
the maunderings of a harmless putterer.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, three researchers independently made similar findings
and discovered they had been beaten to them by Mendel.
</P>
<P>
   Henig's account of Mendel and the conflicting scientific
currents of his time is rich, clear, and filled with wonderful
evocations of Mendel's world. In her research, she gleaned so many
details of place, weather, sounds, and sights that the book has an
unexpectedly sensual texture making it as pleasurable to read as a
superbly written travelogue.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is she afraid to speculate about the many unresolved issues
surrounding Mendel, most of whose papers were burned. What did he
think he was pursuing in his experiments? Did he believe in
evolution? Did he fudge his data or perhaps even do all his
experiments on paper, not bothering to crossbreed the plants?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the questions are unanswerable, yet arguing and
speculation continue to this day, reflecting the fascination that
still surrounds Mendel, whom Henig calls, ``a gentle
revolutionary'' born a generation too soon to be understood in his
time.

THE KID WIZARD GEETS EVEN BIGGER

   Harry Potter, meet Bugs Bunny. Bugs, meet Harry.
</P>
<P>
   When the fourth Harry Potter novel is released this Saturday
amid a feeding frenzy of young and not-so-young fans, it will mark
the fourth chapter of the astounding tale of a once-obscure author
who has sold some 20 million books in the United States in less
than two years. But the feverish midnight unveiling will not begin
to equal the carefully planned, long-term campaign of Potterabilia
that will eventually put Scottish author J. K. Rowling's kid wizard
on everything from the silver screen to boxer shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros., the company that brings us Looney Tunes and Batman
among others, has not merely cut a deal for the movie rights to the
first of four of what Rowling says will eventually be seven Potter
tomes. One of the company's divisions, Warner Bros. Worldwide
Consumer Products, has licensed more than 45 companies _ including
toymaking giants Hasbro Inc. and Mattel Inc. _ to produce Harry
Potter paraphernalia aimed largely at 8- to 13-year-olds. Thus the
day isn't far away when they can eat Harry Potter candy, slip into
Harry Potter socks, sit on Harry Potter furniture, drink from Harry
Potter mugs, peer through Harry Potter sunglasses, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a big one,'' said James Mammarella, editor
and associate publisher of License!, a trade magazine. A few
moments later, Mammarella bestowed perhaps an even higher
compliment upon Warner Bros.' new franchise: ``It's toyetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyetic?
</P>
<P>
   ``It translates well into toys and games,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, people are already wild about the untoyetic Harry.
About 21 million copies of J. K. (for Joanne Kathleen) Rowling's
trio of yarns about the boy who wears owlish glasses and attends
the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry have been printed
in the United States. Scholastic Press has ordered an initial run
of 3.8 million copies of the upcoming, 752-page ``Harry Potter and
the Goblet of Fire,'' making it what the company says is the
largest first printing in the history of domestic book publishing.
And Rowling, an unpublished author when she wrote the beginnings of
the first Potter book on scraps of paper in an Edinburgh cafe, has
become an international literary cult figure.
</P>
<P>
   But reviews of the selling of Harry Potter _ the movies, the
T-shirts, the coffee mugs, and so forth _ are mixed. At the East
Boston branch of the Boston Public Library, children's librarian
Anne Kelly says she worries that the November 2001 release of the
movie ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' will rob young
readers of their own inventiveness. ``Now kids will be shown what
Harry looks like instead of imagining him,'' Kelly lamented. ``And
nobody knows what he really sounds like. But now they will.''
</P>
<P>
   But although Kelly says she finds the array of upcoming Potter
products ``cheapening,'' she doesn't think they will drive young
readers away from the books. ``Kids are just so used to everything
arriving in an integrated package,'' she said. ``Besides, someday
the merchandise will die away, and the kids will just have the
books. And they'll read them.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be good news to Lisa Burkin, advertising and
promotions manager at WordsWorth Books in Cambridge, Mass. Burkin,
who has seen merchandise effectively promote such children's
literary characters as the mischievous monkey Curious George and
the young sleuth Tintin, cautions that Potter could conceivably die
from overkill. ``If they dump everything into the market all at
once, I don't think that would be great for the books,'' she said.
``Too much of a good thing kills the golden goose. And whatever
they merchandise should be smart and attractive. It should fit with
the ambience and the mood of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Rowling has said she did not want her books and
their characters to be overwhelmed by related merchandise. This
week she declined, through the office of her London agent,
Christopher Little, to discuss upcoming Potter-related products and
movies, as did Little himself. Scholastic Press, meanwhile, played
down the notion that the literary Potter will be lost in the wake
of the toyetic Potter. ``The books are so unique and distinct that
we're confident they'll last forever,'' said Chris Moran, a company
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Warner Bros. is describing a slow-build,
three-wave campaign to bring Harry Potter merchandise into American
homes. Since acquiring the rights to all things Potter in mid-1998,
about a year after the first volume was released in England but
about three months before it was published in the United States,
the company has bided its time waiting until its movie is on the
horizon. The first wave will arrive in August with items connected
to the first book (a.k.a. ``the literary property'') being sold in
the 140 Warner Bros. Studio Stores. The next wave involves selling
similar items in upscale specialty and department stores beginning
in October. And, finally, Wave III: As release of the movie version
of the first book (``the film property'') approaches next year, a
batch of new items will be released in mass-market stores.
</P>
<P>
   (Those who can't wait are already bidding on Internet auction
sites for Warner Bros. and Scholastic Press trade promotion items
such as baseball caps, tote bags, and candy.)
</P>
<P>
   All this may seem to add up to a tidal wave, but George Jones,
president of worldwide licensing and Warner Bros. Studio Stores,
calls the plan ``judicious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've turned down tons and tons of proposals and products that
weren't true to the book,'' Jones said. ``A Harry Potter potty seat
was actually proposed, for example. But we want to be true to the
audience that loves this book. And in certain key categories,
within our licensing arrangements, we've put limitations in our
contracts on the numbers of units that can be shipped. That assures
us we won't have overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. contends that Rowling has a significant role in the
oncoming stream of Potterabilia. ``She is a creative and business
partner in every aspect of the project,'' said Barbara Brogliatti,
the company's vice president of corporate communications. ``She's
involved in everything. It's a unique Hollywood partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Potter movie will begin filming in England in October
and is budgeted at between $90 million and $100 million. It will be
directed by Christopher Columbus, who directed ``Home Alone'' and
``Mrs. Doubtfire.'' Steve Kloves, who wrote ``The Fabulous Baker
Boys,'' will adapt the book to the screen. Despite rumors, Warner
Bros. says no stars have been signed for the movie, not even the
thousands of applicants who have responded to the company's
Internet casting call. ``We are looking for British children,
between the ages of 9 and 11,who look like Harry Potter, Ron
Weasley or Hermione Granger,'' the studio's Harry Potter Web site
declares, referring to the book's main characters. ``You can become
a Junior Talent Scout by urging them to send a recent picture and
videotape to us!''
</P>
<P>
   The acknowledged measure of a successful merchandising push such
as the one being planned for young Harry Potter is $1 billion in
revenues. According to Sandie Hatch, executive vice president of
the Licensing Industry Merchandisers Association, the boy wizard is
considered a good bet to achieve this benchmark, and has earned a
new name in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the trade,'' said Hatch, ``they're already calling him a
billion-dollar boy.''

<P>
   &UR; !!! &LR;  ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' Another TV
cartoon makes it to the big screen. Jay Ward's flying squirrel and
moose pal have been reinvented, via computer, in color and 3-D.
They play against real actors Jason Alexander and Rene Russo as
Boris and Natasha, still henchmen to their old boss turned
capitalist, Robert De Niro. Sunny, funny and fresh, it revels in
its airhead buoyancy. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  ``The Patriot'' Mel Gibson makes all the difference in the
American Revolution. Loosely modeled on Francis Marion, the
so-called Swamp Fox who mired the Redcoats in guerrilla warfare,
he's a South Carolina widower farmer with seven children who hangs
back as the war begins, but gets involved when his idealistic sons
do. The heroics are sheer Hollywood cornball, the combat scenes
often bloody _ but the film works rousingly. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  1/2 ``The Perfect Storm'' The working-class ``Titanic'' _ and
then some. Closely following Sebastian Junger's bestseller about
what happened to a boatful of Gloucester fishermen when three storm
systems collided in the North Atlantic in 1991, it unleashes a
spectacular screenful of storm effects. But what makes it special
is the determination of the cast, headed by George Clooney and Mark
Wahlberg, to depict the fishermen and their world with veracity and
respect. (PG-13)

<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' (DVD) _ Alain Delon's
stunning performance in ``Purple Noon,'' the 1960 adaptation of
Patricia Highsmith's novel, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' clouds my
feelings about this latest version. Matt Damon's Mr. Ripley is
satisfactory, but his performance isn't as dark and deep as
Delon's. Jude Law should have played the title role instead of the
supporting one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Divine Trash'' (DVD) _ This affectionate, appreciative look at
the films of John Waters also contains a commentary by George
Mansour, a Boston film booker and longtime Waters fan. What's
interesting is that as Waters's movies had commercial success, they
became less offensive. Consequently, his aggressive bad taste has
evolved into more comfortable acceptabilty.

<P>
   NEW ON DVD: ``Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter
Jr.'' _ When will the nutty awards people finally grant Errol
Morris the respect he deserves? Not soon. This nonfiction film
documents the story of Fred Leuchter Jr., an electric-chair
repairman who also denies the Holocaust. Instead of pushing and
hammering the misguided Lechter into a convenient pigeonhole,
Morris allows his subject the full range of his eccentricity.
That's what makes this film so terrific. Morris doesn't tell us
what to think, he just allows us to share his intellectual
astonishment. And what could be better _ or less likely to win an
Oscar _ than that?

   SYPHILIS-ERADICATE (Nashville, Tenn.) _ The new jail inmate had
intimidating arms, thick as thighs. But he extended one meekly when
a nurse, Jean Graves, told him: ``I have to give you a tuberculosis
skin test. I also have to draw blood for syphilis, O.K.?'' As she
slid the needle into his skin, Nashville took one more small step
in a sweeping national program: a push by health authorities to rid
the country of the ancient scourge of syphilis, spirochete
bacterium by spirochete, chancre sore by chancre, once and for all.
Even here, where the syphilis rate is second-highest in the country
among major cities, topped only by Indianapolis, the numbers are
less than staggering: Only 250 cases of new _ and thus still
infectious _ syphilis turned up last year. Nationwide, they dropped
below 7,000, down from the most recent peak of 50,000 in 1990. But
that is the very point, health officials say. Now, when new cases
are at an all-time low and so concentrated that about half of them
come from just 25 of the country's 3,100 counties, is the time to
try to wipe it out altogether. They are prosecuting a multipronged
attack that includes heavy reliance on community activism and
stepped-up detective work to track down carriers and those at risk,
as well as expanded clinical and laboratory services. By Carey
Goldberg.

JOHN WILLIAMS LISTENS TO THE SONG OF A TREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Williams has composed a new concert work for the opening
weekend at Tanglewood, ``TreeSong'' _ a work inspired by the
composer's favorite tree in the Public Garden. Williams, violinist
Gil Shaham, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra will premiere the
work during Saturday night's concert in the Shed.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams was in town a few weeks ago to conduct the Pops,
he posed for photographs next to his beloved dawn redwood,
Metasequoia glyptostroboides, and came to lunch to talk about the
piece, and about some of his other recent activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years,'' Williams said, ``I loved to take walks in the
Public Garden, and I grew infatuated with this Chinese tree, the
dawn redwood, which stands in the southwest corner. It not only
looked lovely, but it seemed animate, even intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``serendipitous'' experience followed for Williams. Through
the Boston Symphony's physician, Dr. Eng-Hwi Kwa, he met Dr.
Siu-Ying Hu, a retired Harvard University botanist. One afternoon,
he was taking a walk through the Arnold Arboretum with Hu. ``I was
speaking to her about the tree I loved so much in the Public Garden
when she stopped me. `Is it like this one?' she asked, pointing to
a nearby tree. I said it was, and she said, `I planted them, back
in the 1940s.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1945, Metasequoia was thought to be extinct; it was known
only in fossil specimens. ``But then, in the western part of China,
near Tibet, some standing forests of these trees were discovered,''
Williams said _ fewer than 1,000 of them, according to botanists.
``When Dr. Hu came to America, she brought a pound of seeds and the
trees have flourished here; she helped insure this survivor from
the Jurassic era.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Shaham recorded Williams's Violin Concerto for
Deutsche Grammophon. There has been considerable discussion about
what to use to complete the CD; Williams rejoiced in the
opportunity to write ``TreeSong'' about his favorite dawn redwood.
The 18-minute piece is in one continuous movement divided into
three sections. The first is his response to Hu and the
Metasequoia; the second evokes the ``trunk, branches, and leaves''
of the tree; the third is called ``The Tree Sings.'' Williams says
there is nothing in the music to suggest the Asian origin of the
tree, ``but I hope people will hear that there is a sylvan
atmosphere! The orchestration calls for 2 harps, 2 keyboards, and 4
flutes, along with a lot of delicate percussion. I hope the
Tanglewood stage will be good for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's most recent film score was for ``The Patriot,'' which
opened last week. ``We finished about two weeks before I came to
Boston for the Pops. I think it is a wonderful film, and a useful
film _ I think most of us are better-informed about the Civil War
than we are about the Revolutionary War. It's a big score, about
100 minutes of music, and I spent about three months on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The next picture will be ``AI'' (for ``Artificial
Intelligence''). ``This was a script that Stanley Kubrick was
working on. Steven Spielberg knew about it, and at one point,
Kubrick said to him, `You know, you should direct this picture.'
After Kubrick died, Steven bought the material; he's going to start
shooting next month, and the picture will be out a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of other things are in the works, but I'm not free to
talk about them yet,'' Williams continued. ``You can never predict
what you're going to get when you embark on a film project. You
think you have controlled everything and then an extra element
creeps in, the elusive part of the magic. If you could control that
factor, every film would be a masterpiece. In music, sometimes a
player brings less than what you had imagined in your mind's ear;
then there are those occasions when the player brings you more than
you had ever imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to spend most of the summer in the little cottage he
rents near Tanglewood. ``I will do one concert at the Hollywood
Bowl, but I've planned a light summer for performing. After the
opening weekend concert with the Boston Symphony, I will do two
Pops concerts later in the season. One of them will be a film
night, and the other an end-of-summer concert.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The millennium man &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For film night, Williams hoped to revive one of his major
projects of last year, ``Millennium 2000,'' which was performed on
New Year's Eve in Washington, D.C. with a prestigious narrator,
President Clinton. ``I met Hillary Clinton in Washington at the
time of the premiere of `Amistad,' and she talked to me about
working with Steven Spielberg to create some special event for the
millennium. A year went by and we heard no more about it, but early
last year we got the go-ahead to develop a 20-minute film about
America in the 20th century. The film is in several tableaux. The
first section is about building _ the Empire State Building, the
interstate highway system, and things like that. The second was
about the wars of the century, and Steven found some spectacular
footage of aerial battles during World War II. There was then a
section about entertainment and sports that featured everybody from
Joe DiMaggio to Mark McGwire. The film closed with civil rights and
women's issues. All of us agreed that the film would stress flight
as the greatest achievement of the century. Some of the text came
from Lincoln and other great figures, but we also asked for new
texts by three contemporary poets, Robert Pinsky, Rita Dove, and
Maya Angelou.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams led excerpts from his score with the Pops, but thinks
it unlikely that he will be able to carry through his plan to link
film to score at Tanglewood. ``Most of the footage became available
to Steven on a one-time-use basis, and at the special request of
the White House. It's not possible to use it again, even for a
fund-raising event, although I'm still trying. Fortunately, the
score is performable without the film, and I've recorded it for
Sony with a freelance orchestra in LA. In Washington, we wound up
with the Baltimore Symphony because neither the National Symphony
nor the Boston Symphony was avaialable. The Baltimore Symphony is a
very good orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   The forthcoming Sony CD will also include some of Williams's
other occasional music. ``It will have the variations on `Happy
Birthday' that I wrote for the `Three Birthdays' concert at
Tanglewood _ Yo-Yo Ma's 40th, Itzhak Perlman's 50th, and Seiji
Ozawa's 60th _ and a piece I wrote for Seiji's worldwide satellite
hookup from Japan, and another piece called `Jubilee 350.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One of Williams's most prestigious premieres was the Cello
Concerto he composed for Yo-Yo Ma to play at the opening of Seiji
Ozawa Hall in 1994. Ma has recorded many of the concertos written
for him, but not yet Williams's. The composer is now ready for it
to happen _ dissatisfied with the original finale, Williams has
written a new one. ``When the opportunity to perform the work at
the opening of the hall arose, I was in a frenzy to finish it in
time. Once I heard it, one of the things I wanted to do was reduce
the orchestration and adjust the balances. When Yo-Yo was engaged
to play the concerto with Leonard Slatkin in Washington, D.C., I
worked on it, and then embarked on a major rewrite of the finale,
putting in more extended lyrical themes, more opportunities for
Yo-Yo to play singing, cantilena lines. I am now much happier about
the piece. I hope we can record this for Sony within the next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams plans to keep composing throughout his Tanglewood
summer. He has two major commissions for concert works to complete:
He's writing a horn concerto for Dale Clevenger and the Chicago
Symphony, and Seiji Ozawa has asked him to compose a Concerto for
Orchestra to mark his farewell as music director.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a lot to do,'' Williams says, and from the
sound of it, having a lot to do is what makes him happy.

TOO MANY PASSWORDS, TOO LITTLE (HUMAN) MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Password'' was a 1960s TV game show in which contestants
guessed at a hidden word while their partners fed them clues.
Imagine the show retooled for today's numerically overloaded world:
Win cash for reciting your computer passwords, ATM PINs, calling
card numbers, and home-security codes in 60 seconds or less.
</P>
<P>
   No clues. No crib sheets. Final answer?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even remember my own cell phone number,'' moans Art
Jahnke. ``Two of my computer passwords are kept in an online
repository, but I forget the password to that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jahnke, Web editorial director for CIO.com, counts five computer
passwords to go along with his bank PIN, his wife's phone and fax
numbers, and a home alarm system whose entry code he can't
remember, either. He mostly picks names of dependents, Jahnke says,
but even that strategy has its limits. Because he keeps blanking on
how to access his online Wall Street Journal account, he
re-registers under new user IDs _ to the point that he would now
need octuplets to keep up with the Dow Joneses.
</P>
<P>
   Others favor the unrequited-love angle to password mnemonics.
For her bank PIN, says consultant Gina Addis of ML Strategies, ``I
use my old boyfriend's phone number at a Bar Harbor, Maine, bar
where he worked in 1983. I remember it because the guy was such a
louse that I was always trying to chase him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston TV investigative reporter Hank Phillippi Ryan relies on a
popular device frowned on by most computer security experts: the
one-key-fits-all approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I can manage the password problem is to just
flatly make them all the same,'' says Ryan. ``Without
standardization, I'd be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   For her computer, Ryan settled on the name of a childhood pet.
When most passwords grew longer than four letters, ``I'd add
something like NYT for my New York Times account,'' she says.
``Since I kept forgetting those, now I just use the pet's name
twice.''
</P>
<P>
   If all this PIN-dropping makes you feel as if you're retaking a
high school trigonometry final, take heart. Professional organizer
Elaine Bloom of Maplewood, N.J., says even pros like her are
singing the Password Overload Blues these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't figured out any good way of dealing with the problem
either for myself or my clients,'' Bloom admits. ``I tend to make
them all similar types of things, but I know experts say that's not
the smartest thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Arnold of Passlogix suggests a service like his company's
free download system (www.passlogix .com). One password leads you
to a customized icon that opens all online accounts, says Arnold,
who cofounded the company three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood in the parking lot of a CompUSA store for three days,
asking people how many passwords they had,'' says Arnold. ``The
average person had seven or more, so clearly there was a problem
there.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more good news. Several companies are working on
fingerprint, face-, and voice-recognition technology that could
soon make passwords obsolete. Also, the IRS has begun issuing
5-digit PINs for online filing. Should you forget the number,
agents will track down that ex-boyfriend for you, so you won't have
to file late. As for the garage-door code, IRS officials say,
you're on your own.

</P>
<P>
   in apartmentThe discovery of three bodies in a Tempe apartment
Saturday touched off an intense investigation and left residents in
this quiet community scared and seeking answers.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe police released little information about the three males
found dead inside an apartment at the Mariner at 1525 E. Baseline
Road, west of McClintock Drive.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment complex abuts the popular and well-maintained
housing community called the Lakes. Residents said the area has a
good reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had any problems,'' said Connie Belperio, who
lives at the Mariner. ``We've never had to call the police for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Belperio, a five-year resident of the complex, said she knew
nothing about the tragedy in the adjacent building until officers
knocked on her door about 4 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was freaked,'' Belperio said. ``I haven't slept since.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before 1 a.m., a woman called police to say there ``were
victims down'' inside the apartment, said Sgt. Wil Price. Police
said the caller learned of the bodies from someone else but would
not go into detail.
</P>
<P>
   Officers pushed open an unlocked door and discovered the bodies.
The door appeared damaged, but officers were unable to say whether
it was related to the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Preble Ware, whose back yard faces the apartment complex, was
grilling hamburgers outside about 8:15p.m. Friday when he heard a
scream. Several seconds later, Ware said, he heard a pop. Then
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think anything of it at the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ware doesn't know whether what he heard was tied to the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not give an approximate time or motive for the
deaths. They also did not release the names of the victims, but
said they appear to be in their 20s.

   Three people died Saturday morning after an 18-wheeler slammed
into a minivan, sending it rolling and crashing over a median onto
eastbound Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the van's passengers, a man and woman, were ejected and
died immediately, authorities said. The third person in the van was
flown by helicopter to Maricopa Medical Center, where he died a few
hours later. The driver of the tractor-trailer truck wasn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The 9 a.m. rollover accident just south of Firebird Lake snarled
traffic on both sides of I-10 for about two hours, shutting down
the high-speed lanes in both directions, said Kevin Wood, a
Department of Public Safety spokesman. The interstate in that area
has two lanes in each direction.
</P>
<P>
   None of the victims was identified, but the van had California
license plates.
</P>
<P>
   The rig and van were westbound when the truck began moving into
the left lane,
</P>
<P>
   Wood said. The rear of the rig clipped the van's passenger side,
which flipped the van over the median.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was still under investigation.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, July 4:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GREEK-FOSSILS (Undated) _ A classical folklorist and
independent scholar has dug deep into the past and found literary
and artistic clues _ and not a few huge fossils _ that seem to
explain the inspiration for many of the giants, monsters and other
strange creatures in the mythology of antiquity. Greeks'
perceptions about fossils, she discovered, were quite amazing for
prescientific people. Her years of research thus challenge the
widely held view that natural historians in classical Greece and
Rome lacked the knowledge to interpret large vertebrate fossils as
organic remains of the past. By John Noble Wilford. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT5.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PROTEIN-SHAPES (San Diego) _ With the human genome sequence
nearly complete, scientists are gearing up for a follow-on project
that some say could be every bit as ambitious. The endeavor is
known as structural genomics and involves trying to determine the
three-dimensional shapes of thousands upon thousands of proteins,
much as genomics determined the sequences of genes en masse.
Knowing the shape of the protein lock could make it easier to
design drugs that act as keys, binding to some particular protein
and turning it on or off. By Andrew Pollack. (2100 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PROTEIN-XRAY (Undated) _ Protein shapes are usually
discerned by X-ray crystallography, a process that in some ways
resembles a CAT scan. An X-ray is taken from multiple angles and a
computer uses that data to calculate a three-dimensional image. By
Andrw Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SAGE-GROUSE (Undated) _ A new species of bird has emerged
from research in the sagebrush ecosystem of western Colorado and
eastern Utah, according to scientists working there. The bird, the
Gunnison sage grouse, named for the area of Colorado where it was
discovered, has been in plain view all along _ seen, hunted as a
game bird and, most spectacularly, heard at sunrise every spring as
part of one of the avian world's oddest courtship rituals. But it
had long been assumed to be the same species as the related
northern sage grouse, even though the two differ starkly in size,
appearance, behavior. By Jon Luoma. (1600 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ENVIRON-RIVETS () _ In trying to illuminate what humans are
doing to the natural environment, scientists and conservationists
over the years have come up with a number of descriptive images.
One of the best known is the metaphor of the rivets. In this
formulation, an ecosystem is likened to an airplane: each act of
environmental destruction _ the extinction of a species of plant or
animal, for instance _ is akin to removing a rivet from the plane.
At first, the losses make little difference, because there are lots
of rivets. But if enough are removed or a few are taken away at
crucial spots, the plane will crash. An essay by William K.
Stevens. (1370 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-YOUNG-FISH () _ The typical saltwater fish's childhood is
something of a lost time, at least for scientists trying to study
it. Not much is known about what happens during most fishes' larval
stages, when they are tiny and floating in the plankton in the
swirling waters. And that has led to a great question in marine
ecology: are fish populations open, with young fish shuttling in
and out across great distances, or closed, with juveniles largely
settling back where they were born? By Henry Fountain. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on meteor
flashes, using balloons to get equipment to the edge of space and
using fruit flies to study malaria. By Henry Fountain. (675 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VIRTUAL-MEDICINE (Seattle) _ Virtual reality now is being
used in medicine: it's helping distract burn patients so they feel
less pain, it's being used to alleviate phobias and it's even
helping people to relax and unclog blood vessels. By Jim Robbins.
(1560 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LOCAL-ANESTHESIA (Undated) _ Doctors recently performed a
heart bypass on a patient using only a local anesthesia. It was
believed to be the first such operation in the United States, but
some doctors are optimistic that many more now can be done, at
least in certain circumstances, like a single bypass. By Denise
Grady. (1075 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PSYCHIATRY (Undated) _ A complex but pervasive problem in
psychiatry. It can be frustrating and, at times, nigh impossible,
to sort out where ``reality'' lies in the no man's land between the
patient's preconceptions and distortions of reality and those of
the therapist. In the strange, delicate, dyadic relationship
between patient and therapist, the events of the outside world can
become surprisingly elusive. The case of a patient claiming to be a
famous European artist illustrates the point. By Anna Fels, M.D.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal health column: Hiking
has loads of health benefits, but veterans and beginners alike
should prepare to avoid catastrophes, pain and inconveniences. By
Jane E. Brody. (1225 words0
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CANCER-BOOK (Undated) _ Books on Health: With thousands of
cancer patients seeking alternative and complementary medicine,
``The Journey Through Cancer'' by Dr. Jeremy Geffen seems a timely
addition to the medical bookshelf. By Laurie Tarkan. (420 words)

<P>
   SCI-GREEK-FOSSILS (Undated) _ A classical folklorist and
independent scholar has dug deep into the past and found literary
and artistic clues _ and not a few huge fossils _ that seem to
explain the inspiration for many of the giants, monsters and other
strange creatures in the mythology of antiquity. Greeks'
perceptions about fossils, she discovered, were quite amazing for
prescientific people. Her years of research thus challenge the
widely held view that natural historians in classical Greece and
Rome lacked the knowledge to interpret large vertebrate fossils as
organic remains of the past. By John Noble Wilford. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT5.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PROTEIN-SHAPES (San Diego) _ With the human genome sequence
nearly complete, scientists are gearing up for a follow-on project
that some say could be every bit as ambitious. The endeavor is
known as structural genomics and involves trying to determine the
three-dimensional shapes of thousands upon thousands of proteins,
much as genomics determined the sequences of genes en masse.
Knowing the shape of the protein lock could make it easier to
design drugs that act as keys, binding to some particular protein
and turning it on or off. By Andrew Pollack. (2100 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PROTEIN-XRAY (Undated) _ Protein shapes are usually
discerned by X-ray crystallography, a process that in some ways
resembles a CAT scan. An X-ray is taken from multiple angles and a
computer uses that data to calculate a three-dimensional image. By
Andrw Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SAGE-GROUSE (Undated) _ A new species of bird has emerged
from research in the sagebrush ecosystem of western Colorado and
eastern Utah, according to scientists working there. The bird, the
Gunnison sage grouse, named for the area of Colorado where it was
discovered, has been in plain view all along _ seen, hunted as a
game bird and, most spectacularly, heard at sunrise every spring as
part of one of the avian world's oddest courtship rituals. But it
had long been assumed to be the same species as the related
northern sage grouse, even though the two differ starkly in size,
appearance, behavior. By Jon Luoma. (1600 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ENVIRON-RIVETS () _ In trying to illuminate what humans are
doing to the natural environment, scientists and conservationists
over the years have come up with a number of descriptive images.
One of the best known is the metaphor of the rivets. In this
formulation, an ecosystem is likened to an airplane: each act of
environmental destruction _ the extinction of a species of plant or
animal, for instance _ is akin to removing a rivet from the plane.
At first, the losses make little difference, because there are lots
of rivets. But if enough are removed or a few are taken away at
crucial spots, the plane will crash. An essay by William K.
Stevens. (1370 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-YOUNG-FISH () _ The typical saltwater fish's childhood is
something of a lost time, at least for scientists trying to study
it. Not much is known about what happens during most fishes' larval
stages, when they are tiny and floating in the plankton in the
swirling waters. And that has led to a great question in marine
ecology: are fish populations open, with young fish shuttling in
and out across great distances, or closed, with juveniles largely
settling back where they were born? By Henry Fountain. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on meteor
flashes, using balloons to get equipment to the edge of space and
using fruit flies to study malaria. By Henry Fountain. (675 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VIRTUAL-MEDICINE (Seattle) _ Virtual reality now is being
used in medicine: it's helping distract burn patients so they feel
less pain, it's being used to alleviate phobias and it's even
helping people to relax and unclog blood vessels. By Jim Robbins.
(1560 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LOCAL-ANESTHESIA (Undated) _ Doctors recently performed a
heart bypass on a patient using only a local anesthesia. It was
believed to be the first such operation in the United States, but
some doctors are optimistic that many more now can be done, at
least in certain circumstances, like a single bypass. By Denise
Grady. (1075 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PSYCHIATRY (Undated) _ A complex but pervasive problem in
psychiatry. It can be frustrating and, at times, nigh impossible,
to sort out where ``reality'' lies in the no man's land between the
patient's preconceptions and distortions of reality and those of
the therapist. In the strange, delicate, dyadic relationship
between patient and therapist, the events of the outside world can
become surprisingly elusive. The case of a patient claiming to be a
famous European artist illustrates the point. By Anna Fels, M.D.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal health column: Hiking
has loads of health benefits, but veterans and beginners alike
should prepare to avoid catastrophes, pain and inconveniences. By

``The Journey Through Cancer'' by Dr. Jeremy Geffen seems a timely
addition to the medical bookshelf. By Laurie Tarkan. (420 words)

<P>
   SCI-MEDICINE-SUPERSTITION (Undated) _ Don't take the scientist's
objective observation for granted, cautions Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland
in ``The Mysteries Within.'' Until the 19th century, the greatest

supernatural powers, superstition, fanciful spirits and energies to

 &HT;    July 4 the ideal time to promote individual independence
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - What better day to promote independence than July
4?
</P>
<P>
   The steps we take toward our own independence are significant _
whether we're an infant rolling over for the first time, a teen
coping with disability or a widow or widower rebuilding a life
after the loss of a spouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independence is a Western value, not a universally held
value,'' explains clinical psychologist Judith Schwartzman. ``In
other cultures around the world, the emphasis is on the well-being
of the group, the family, society as a whole rather than the
well-being of any one individual.''
</P>
<P>
   But the United States, she says, was built on a platform of
individual liberty. ``It was a value of the individuals who founded
and shaped this nation and it is strongly ingrained our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are products and services designed to foster
independence at every age and every stage of our lives. We've
assembled a few in honor of the holiday:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  It isn't just E.T. who should know how to phone home. Kids
need to know as well. The Teaching Telephone from Pretend &AMP; Play is
a programmable telephone on which little ones can practice dialing
911 as well as their own home phone ($39.99 at Zany Brainy).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Taking a course at a college or community center can teach
skills that will help us stand on our two feet. Colleges offer
courses ranging from home car repair to PC keyboarding and from
Internet skills to career planning.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Learning to read is a terrific way to promote independence,
and summer is the perfect time to pick up a book. Kids can sign up
for one of the reading clubs at bookstores and libraries where
specially themed programs and incentives are offered.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of terrific books and products to help someone
learn to read. Among them: the Bob Books for beginning readers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Swimming is fun, great exercise and may even save a life.
Check out lessons at local YMCA's, private clubs and community
centers. If you're an adult who's afraid of the water, private
classes can be arranged.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Author John Cassidy has come up with an innovative way to
teach kids how to tell time in The Time Book (Klutz, $12.95).
Attached to the book is a battery-included kid's watch. The sturdy
wire-bound book is cleverly illustrated by Roger Bollen and
includes lots of interesting ``Time Factoids''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The inventive mind behind ``Arthritically Correct'' belongs to
Frank Halstead, a California entrepreneur who has come up with a
group of products for those who need a helping hand. Items, priced
from $2 to $7 each, range from Comfort Clips (small
elastic-and-nylon clips that replace shoelaces) to the EZ-KEY, a
key-turning device that eliminates the pain involved in turning a
key in a balky or sticky lock. Halstead also makes citrus peelers,
a patented handle and more. Check out his website at
www.arthritisstoreusa.com. or call toll-free (888) 511-7367.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Potty training is an important step on the road to
independence. In addition to the little seats, there are videos and
books designed to make the job easier. At Toys R Us, check out
his-and-hers versions of ``Once Upon a Potty'' in either book and
video form. The video is $13.99, the book sells for about $6. The
Duke Family Series''''It's Potty Time'' video is approved by Duke
University Medical Center ($13.99).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``WE'' magazine is a terrific resource for people with
disabilities and their families. The upbeat glossy magazine
features lifestyle articles on subjects ranging from sports and
travel to fashion and the arts, and profiles individuals with
disabilities, including Michael J. Fox, Muhammad Ali and Itzhak
Perlman. The bimonthly magazine is available at bookstores; you can
also call (800) 936-2426. A subscription is $12.95 a year. Check
out the Web site at www.wemedia.com. The company will launch a
shopping mall soon with products ranging from clothes and books to
wheelchairs and adaptive equipment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A lot of our books are written in such a way that children
are able to complete the crafts and activities with little or no
help from adults,'' says Kellie Cullihall of Kids Can Press in New
York. In `` kids learn to grow tomatoes, build a composter, make a
scarecrow, plan a peace garden or build a sunflower fort. In ``The
Kids Can Press Jumbo Cookbook,'' they learn to whip up tacos,
pizza, lasagna roll-ups, vegetable curry or brownies ($14.95 each).
The company also publishes a Kids Can Do It craft series, a Kids
Can Easy Craft series and a Starting With Science Series.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``An important part of the learning process is for children to
learn to do things on their own,'' says Rochelle Hartigan, general
manager of a Zany Brainy.
</P>
<P>
   One example: Taking those first steps is fun with V-Tech's First
Steps Plus. The activity walker is designed for children ages 6 to
36 months. After they are walking, the activity board can be
detached; it includes letters, numbers, a phone and more ($49.99 at
Zany Brainy).
</P>
<P>
   Another toy that promotes walking: Elmo's Bubble Tunes from
Fisher Price. The push-along bubble maker is ideal for backyard
fun. Kids push Elmo in his ice-cream truck and bubbles come out
while music plays. For children 18 months and older; available at
toy stores ($19.99).

BISHOP BARRED BY POPE FROM GAY PRIDE EVENT SPEAKS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Skirting a Vatican order to withdraw from a gay pride
seminar on religion and homosexuality, Bishop Jacques Gaillot sat
on a couch outside a hotel conference room Monday and explained
where he thinks the Roman Catholic Church has erred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church should not have second-class citizens,'' said
Gaillot of France. ``Homosexuals have the same right to tolerance
and dignity as any other group.'' He explained that he was called
on Sunday by his French superiors and told that the pope had asked
that he not participate in the event, part of the seven-day gay
pride festival called World Pride Roma 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am being loyal and obedient to the pope,'' said Gaillot, who
skipped the seminar but instead discussed the order with the press.
``But the pope has done me a great service in creating an event out
of me.'' Gaillot, who was removed from his diocese in Evreux in
1995 for his leftist views, added, ``Nobody would be asking me for
interviews had it not been for the pope's intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   World Pride Roma 2000, which opened on Saturday, was timed to
coincide with a Holy Year of the Roman Catholic Church. Vatican
opposition elevated the Roman event into a tense political
battleground, pitting church leaders and many right-wing groups
against organizers and defenders of gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's efforts to postpone the festival, and most
recently, its effort to silence a bishop whose views do not reflect
the Vatican's, has focused attention less on gay pride than on the
state of tolerance inside the Holy See.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big difference in how the Vatican and American
church leaders approach homosexuality,'' said Francis De Bernardo,
a member of New Ways ministry, a religious association for gay
Catholics. ``U.S. bishops want outreach.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not surprised by Rome's cold shoulder, citing the
Vatican's efforts to silence Jeannine Gramick and Robert Nugent, a
nun and priest who were ordered to end their ministry to gay men
and lesbians in 1999. ``But this thing with Bishop Gaillot is
disturbing. It shows there is not going to be even the hint of a
conversation between the church and the gays gathering here.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has mainly been conflict between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as the Italian movie star Maria Grazia Cucinotta
cut a rainbow-colored ribbon, alongside Vladimir Luxuria, Italy's
best known drag queen, at the opening ceremony in the garden of the
Philharmonic Academy in Rome, about 700 demonstrators marched
trough central Rome with the neofascist group Forza Nuova. As riot
police looked on, the group paraded noisily, with fascist salutes
and banners that read, ``No Gay Pride.''
</P>
<P>
   A Catholic association, Centro Culturale Lepando, and a
right-wing party, National Alliance, organized a torchlit
seven-mile walk by 1,000 people to offer ``penance'' for the gay
pride event.
</P>
<P>
   At the Church of Santa Teresa d'Avila in Rome, a small group of
believers organized by the Committee for a Christian Rome recited a
rosary to atone for the city's decision to allow the gay pride
event.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police and bomb squads on Monday lined the entrance of the
Hotel Cicerone, near the Vatican, where gay pride meetings were
being held.
</P>
<P>
   The event, which organizers expect to draw more than 200,000 gay
men and women to Rome, was planned three years ago and initially
won the support of the city. But after the Vatican protested
earlier this year, Mayor Francesco Rutelli tried to persuade World
Pride organizers to postpone the event for a week. He contended
that its schedule _ which includes conferences, drag fashion shows
and a parade through Rome on Saturday _ could disturb the church's
events for this special jubilee year.
</P>
<P>
   When the organizers refused, Rutelli said the events would go on
as planned, but he withdrew the city's endorsement and its logo
from the banners. Prime Minister Giuliano Amato broke with many
leaders of his own center-left coalition by stating that the timing
of the gay pride festival during a Holy Year was ``inopportune.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church does not teach that homosexuality is a
sin, but that homosexual acts, as with adultery, are sinful. And
the Vatican views the timing of the gay pride event as an offense
to the church and to family values _ as well as a political cudgel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pains me to see that young people are being told that the
church is their enemy,'' said Cardinal Ersilio Tonini, an emeritus
archbishop who was one of the few church officials to address the
issue on television over the weekend. ``For us, they are always our
brothers and sons. But shouting about pride in this public event is
not right. The church has to tell the truth, even if that truth is
not fashionable.''
</P>
<P>
   The event expected to draw the most protest is Saturday's gay
pride parade, and the Coliseum has become the focus for the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say they will march to the Coliseum and form a ring
around it in defiance of the city, which refused to approve the
streets around it as part of the parade route.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing groups have said they will block marchers from
surrounding the structure, which they view as a shrine to Christian
martyrs. The Coliseum also has been adopted this year by human
rights groups and the Catholic Church as their symbol in their
fight against the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say that no early Christians were actually fed to the
lions in the Coliseum, but church lore and Hollywood movies have
kept the legend alive. At Saturday's neofascist counter
demonstration, protesters held up banners that read, ``Gays at the
Coliseum? Only with Lions!''

   _ From a 1996 rant by Comedian Dennis Miller, hired last week by
ABC-TV's ``Monday Night Football''
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 4, 2000. The St. Louis Rams host the Denver Broncos in the
regular-season opener of ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   AL MICHAELS: ``Welcome back to `Monday Night Football'
everybody, where the Denver Broncos are leading the St. Louis Rams
21-17 with one minute remaining in the game and the Rams taking
over on their own 14-yard-line, first and 10.''
</P>
<P>
   DAN FOUTS: ``That's a long way to go with only one timeout
remaining, but if anyone can do it, Kurt Warner is the man. He's a
can-do guy.''
</P>
<P>
   DENNIS MILLER: ``Did you just use the phrase can-do? Wow,
cha-cha, you're really cutting edge there! Let me do my Bette Davis
and fasten my ------- seatbelt so I can keep up with the lingo,
Fouts-meister.''
</P>
<P>
   MICHAELS: ``Warner drops back, he's looking over the middle but
now he just has to throw the ball away to avoid the sack as Nathan
Davis sends him sprawling. Not only was there a strong rush by
Davis, but the pass coverage by the Denver secondary was once again
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   FOUTS: ``All night long, the Broncos have conceded the run and
have forced Kurt Warner to throw into deep zone coverage, and he
hasn't been able to make the necessary adjustments, and that's
coming back to haunt him now.''
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: ``I'll tell you what's haunting me, it's that beard Hank
Williams Jr. wears in the opening montage. Is he Amish now or
something? Memo to Hank: The 21st century stopped by and would like
you to return its call, babe. And if that's ------- country music
then I'm a Denver Broncos cheerleader _ and you don't see me in
midriff-baring outfits and high-heeled boots, unless you're
attending the Annual Miller Family Reunion and I've had a few too
many mimosas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Country music is more doomed than a Texas inmate awaiting a
mercy call from George W. Bush. Now I don't want to get off on a
rant here, but to me country music is Johnny Cash singing about
doing hard time or George Jones singing a love song in between SUV
wrecks and chugs of Jack Daniels _ it's not some doofus named
Bosephus doing an ersatz Daddy thing while a bunch of Carmen
Electra-looking cheerleaders jump around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, real country music scares the ---- out of radio
executives, who are nothing but Florsheim salesmen with better
haircuts. Faith Hill and Shania Twain aren't country singers,
they're midriff-baring masturbatory fantasies who look like the
daughters of one of the Golddiggers on the old `Dean Martin Show,'
babe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   MICHAELS: ``By the way, Kurt Warner was injured on that last
play, it appears he twisted his ankle.''
</P>
<P>
   FOUTS: ``Take a look at the replay and you can see where Warner
just got tangled up in his own feet as Davis came in.''
</P>
<P>
   MICHAELS: ``So now here comes Trent Green, once considered to be
the future of this franchise before he was injured and Warner came
out of nowhere to have that magical season last year.''
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: ``Here's what gets me. Everyone on the Rams now accepts
Green as the quarterback; they just forget about the other guy! It
reminds me of when the second Darrin showed up on `Bewitched' and
he started nailing Sammy and bantering with Endora, and nobody
said, `Hey, you can't fool a bunch of witches, what the ---- did
you do with the other Darrin?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I don't want to get off on a rant here, but the substitute
is never as good as the real thing, whether we're talking about
Parkay masquerading as butter or George Lazenby trying to fill
Connery's tux as Bond or Peter Bogdanovich marrying Dorothy
Stratten's little sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   MICHAELS: ``You might notice on your television set that the
entire Rams team is jumping around in the end zone. That's because
Trent Green just connected with Isaac Bruce on a 98-yard touchdown
pass with no time remaining, in one of the most astounding finishes
ever. Do you believe in miracles?''
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: ``Sure, I believe in miracles, because there's no other
way to explain why Matt LeBlanc makes more money blowing his nose
between takes on `Friends' than the entire Royal Shakespeare
Company earns in a good decade, cha-cha. Now I don't want to get
off on a rant here ...''

&HT;     UPSTART INTERNET COMPANIES GET A DOSE OF REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VANESSA HUA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sink, swim or change direction.
</P>
<P>
   That is what some Internet companies are doing, making changes
to their product, business plans and even their raison d'etre as
the market shakeout eliminates or consolidates weaker dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 months, for example, the founder of portal
Myownempire.com was forced to admit his nascent kingdom was
crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   His $500,000 in funding, given on faith from friends, family and
investors, was nearly gone in January, said founder Bob Haya, who
carried the job title ``king'' at the Redwood City-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Though he paid some of the workers in stock only, he had to pare
back his staff. The site, which promised shares of the company as
an incentive to users, wasn't attracting visitors fast enough, Haya
said. A meta-portal, Myownempire.com allowed users to search
multiple job, portals, and auction sites all at once, but it
suffered from a false perception that his on-line stock giveaways
were fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than stick to the original concept, though, Haya salvaged
the parts that worked and transformed the company into an
information software developer, Coportal.com. From its high of 20
staffers and contractors, six stayed on. Soon after Haya's company
changed course, incubator CreateLabs in San Francisco bought the
personalization, rules-based software company.
</P>
<P>
   Haya considered seven different directions, including
application service provider, business tools maker and private
portal developer, before settling on his newest plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some neat stuff we didn't know we were sitting on, used
in the making of the site itself,'' said Haya, who brainstormed
with his workers on what to save. ``What a shame it would have been
to let that go to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies who launched in new directions include San
Francisco-based Vergesoft.com, an information software company that
turned into Xmarksthespot.com, an on-line marketing company; Santa
Clara-based Beyond.com, a computer software e-tailer that now
develops software to build online stores; and Menlo Park-based
Mambo.com, a Net invitation site that spun off PayPlace.com, an
electronic payment site in April.
</P>
<P>
   In reinventing themselves, the companies may avoid the fate of
upscale e-tailers such as the British Boo.com and Foofoo.com,
on-line video merchant Reel.com in Emeryville and the Viacom-owned
toy store Redrocket.com, which shut down, sold off or licensed
their expensively developed technology and brand name at fire sale
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The rising dot-com body count _ driven by increased pressure for
profits, rabid competition and the lure of better prospects _ is
propelling the change, industry watchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurs and investors assumed that they would get it
right the first time and grow in record time on Internet models not
proven or known,'' said Robert LaBatt of the Gartner Group, a
technology market research firm. ``But that hasn't happened, by and
large.''
</P>
<P>
   Change is part of the nature of startups. Yet the rise and fall
of Internet companies happens more quickly and dramatically when
compared with other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional companies have time and space to grow slowly and
manage their growth, but lots of dot-coms felt they had no choice
but to have big-bang growth,'' said Andrew Bartels, an analyst at
Giga Information Group, a technology research firm. ``They're
playing with a lot more money, which requires them to adapt more
rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the need for change reflects the consequences of
too-easy funding for underdeveloped business plans, especially
during last year's glut of initial public stock offerings and
venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazy capital funded companies it shouldn't have been
funding,'' said Dan Beldy, partner at Hummer Winblad, a San
Francisco venture capital outfit. ``When push came to shove, those
companies were faced with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how detailed their projections, how thorough their
research, companies often may falter, or may stumble upon an
unforeseen opportunity even greater than the original, once they go
live.
</P>
<P>
   The key is to stay focused on building a business but still
adapt to roiling market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those realizations don't happen until you go out and start
talking to customers and learn what the environment is about,''
said Neil Cohen, co-founder and chief marketing officer of Campsix,
a business incubator in San Francisco. ``Changing a business model
can help turn around an average or mediocre concept. It's a good
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and other analysts point to the success of companies that
reworked their business plans, such as the former Netscape
Communications, where revenues first came from selling its
browsers, then its servers and then as a portal.
</P>
<P>
   They also point to its acquirer, America Online, the Internet
service provider where revenue came initially from subscribers'
monthly charges. Since then it has added income from advertising
and from fees that other businesses pay to be featured on the
portal. The latest round of rebirths comes at a time of intense
scrutiny on Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to show profitability. Everyone has an eye on the
bottom line, whether an investor or analyst or a CEO,'' said
Merideth Medland, analyst at Jupiter Communications, an Internet
research firm.

   ECOM-JAPAN _ Hiroshi Mikitani's e-ecommerce site, called
Rakuten, has become Japan's largest online bazaar. The site,
www.rakuten.co.jp, draws about 95 million hits a month as a gateway
to about 2,800 merchants around the country selling everything from
eggs to kimonos. Merchants pay 50,000 yen a month, or about $469,
to link their Web sites to Rakuten. In exchange, they receive tips
on jazzing up those sites and access to Rakuten's database and
software, which contain information about customers and their
predilections. Rakuten also offers them low-cost advertising. A
report. By Stephanie Strom.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Like a character actor who takes roles as a
serial killer after years of playing the kindly uncle, civic
boosters here are trying to shed the cardigan sweater and the
sensible shoes. There is a palpable desire to be a technology hot
spot.
</P>
<P>
   But how? Over the last couple of years, Technophilly,
SiliconPhilly, Silicon ValleyForge, (at)Philly and Philacon Valley
have been floated in efforts to raise the region's brand awareness,
on the theory that recognition and corporate dollars would follow.
Some names have Web sites or printed materials behind them, but not
one of the monikers has stuck.
</P>
<P>
   As any athlete knows, nicknames are given, not manufactured.
Philadelphia is not as complacent and dowdy as its critics say. It
has its power lunchers, its venture capitalists who chat casually
about jaw-dropping sums. But it is not the technology mecca
envisioned by its boosters.
</P>
<P>
   And when the city was omitted from a Wall Street Journal list of
the top 20 technology areas last November, the slight touched off a
quest for attention that would have made the region's Quaker
settlers twitch uncomfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Civic leaders want an e-business scene, just as earlier civic
efforts tried to recognize the city's movie, restaurant and film
notables.
</P>
<P>
   The actor Will Smith, Ben Vaughn, a rocker, and the rap group
The Roots are hometown heroes, but the enduring reputation is ``The
Sound of Philadelphia,'' soul and pop music created by Kenny Gamble
and Leon Huff two decades ago. Movies recently filmed here include
the creepy ``Twelve Monkeys'' and ``The Sixth Sense,'' hardly the
stuff shown by the chamber of commerce to foster corporate
relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia has long had an identity crisis, flanked on the
north by New York's financial and media capital and on the south by
the political capital, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Defining the region is exasperating because of its diversity,
said David Thornburgh, the executive director of the Pennsylvania
Economy League, a public policy and research organization. The
region encompasses some of the former steel towns of Pennsylvania
and the shore resorts of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Las Vegas or Detroit, where tourism or automotive
industries serve as bellwethers, Philadelphia companies enjoy a
strong reputation in credit, finance, insurance, medical education
and care, biotechnology and pharmaceutical research, among other
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no image defined in the public psyche since
`Rocky,''' Thornburgh said. ``But we could become the buckle on the
East Coast's money belt because of our location. And our strength
is in putting things together as an integrator.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as in San Francisco or Boston, there is no single
technology epicenter in the city. Philadelphia's downtown lofts and
19th-century storefronts now house computer graphics or e-business
start-ups and electronic-art galleries.
</P>
<P>
   That streetscape contrasts with acres of suburban office parks
where companies vie for room to grow alongside countless
consultants, training firms and support-service providers. Devon
Consulting, in the Main Line borough of Wayne, uses the parking lot
for advertising. A Plymouth Prowler sporting the company's logo
reminds clients that a successful referral may bring a week's use
of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Many argue that the region's reputation as a technology center
will grow as more companies migrate to the Internet. There are now
companies that excel in particular applications, among them SEI
Investments in Oaks, Pa., which provides technology services and
asset management for banks and investment companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we've never been able to birth a megacompany
like AOL, Microsoft or Sun Microsystems,'' said Howard Ross, an
adviser to emerging companies since the 1980s and a principal in
LLR Equity Partners, a new venture fund. ``But this area could wake
up and surprise itself.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Ross' optimism is his argument that Boston and
San Jose, Calif., had the first significant concentrations of
venture capital, but the capital that creates companies is now
flowing into other areas.
</P>
<P>
   In just the last three years, more than $50 billion in wealth
was created on paper by three local companies. The charge has been
led by the Safeguard Scientifics Corp. of Wayne, Pa., a publicly
traded venture-capital investor, which backed two of the most
successful public offerings in 1999, Internet Capital Group and
VerticalNet.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the e-commerce activity is in the business-to-business
market, where less glamorous companies make the consumer dot-coms
look good by providing the systems and fulfillment processes that
power consumer Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Major corporations based here include QVC Network Inc., the
Comcast Corp., SAP Americas Inc. and Aetna U.S. Healthcare. Yet
there are several obstacles to growth, said Stephen Mullin, a
former commerce director for the City of Philadelphia who teaches
college courses on e-commerce and is a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   He points to a city tax structure that punishes companies by
taxing both wages and net profits as one explanation as to why most
of the expansion has been in the suburbs instead of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to distinguish itself, a study found that Philadelphia's
cost of living, relative to a technology professional's salary,
ranked third lowest, behind Dallas and Chicago, among 15 cities.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hollebeek, a data-mining expert, found the region was in
a top spot in the number and density of colleges and universities.
The residents of those 88 institutions, however, are transient,
with one-quarter of the population coming and going each year, many
taking business plans with them.
</P>
<P>
   Innovative start-up ideas are being exported from Temple,
Villanova and Drexel universities and the University of
Pennsylvania, where the first electronic computer was created, in
1946.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it was announced that eTechtransfer.com, a
business-to-business marketplace for the life-sciences industry,
won the 2000 Wharton Business Plan competition. The prize was
$15,000 cash and a $10,000 investment from Safeguard Scientifics.
The 1999 winner, Paymybills.com, got snapped up by a California
incubator, which disappointed local technology leaders.
</P>
<P>
   To help stem the talent flight, the Eastern Technology Council,
a regional industry group, has supported a program of scholarships,
financing assistance for start-ups and using mentoring efforts to
keep students here after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia's business plans are farther along than other
cities', but the ideas that emerge here are going other places,''
said George Boyajian, a managing director of RoundTable Partners,
which advises emerging companies. ``As more `smart money' comes
into the area, more deals are getting done. But the traditional
Quaker banking, insurance and real estate money is remarkably risk
averse.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the buzz of entrepreneurship is growing louder. At a
student-entrepreneur forum organized by Boyajian at the University
of Pennsylvania, 40 of the 60 undergraduates there said they had
started a company.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the search for a glamour tag continues. One local
entrepreneur has tried out the idea that the area could be billed
as being twice as important as Silicon Valley, whose technology
companies are clustered around Route 101. Philadelphia's straddle
Route 202.
</P>
<P>
   (David J. Wallace, a business and technology writer, has moved
to Boston from the Philadelphia area.)

Pennsylvania, where the first electronic computer was created, in
1946.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it was announced that eTechtransfer.com, a
business-to-business marketplace for the life-sciences industry,
won the 2000 Wharton Business Plan competition. The prize was
$15,000 cash and a $10,000 investment from Safeguard Scientifics.
The 1999 winner, Paymybills.com, got snapped up by a California
incubator, which disappointed local technology leaders.
</P>
<P>
   To help stem the talent flight, the Eastern Technology Council,
a regional industry group, has supported a program of scholarships,
financing assistance for start-ups and using mentoring efforts to
keep students here after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia's business plans are farther along than other
cities', but the ideas that emerge here are going other places,''
said George Boyajian, a managing director of RoundTable Partners,
which advises emerging companies. ``As more `smart money' comes
into the area, more deals are getting done. But the traditional
Quaker banking, insurance and real estate money is remarkably risk
averse.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the buzz of entrepreneurship is growing louder. At a
student-entrepreneur forum organized by Boyajian at the University
of Pennsylvania, 40 of the 60 undergraduates there said they had
started a company.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the search for a glamour tag continues. One local
entrepreneur has tried out the idea that the area could be billed
as being twice as important as Silicon Valley, whose technology
companies are clustered around Route 101. Philadelphia's straddle
Route 202.
</P>
<P>
   (David J. Wallace, a business and technology writer, has moved
to Boston from the Philadelphia area.)

<P>
   TOYKO _ More than 400 years ago, a warlord named Nobunaga Oda
revolutionized the Japanese marketplace by taking control of the
powerful trade associations and throwing it open to all would-be
merchants for a nominal flat fee.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of the open market were so radical and so popular that
central Japan, Oda's stronghold, became the dominant center of
commerce in Japan for a while, and the name of his revolutionary
policy, ``rakuichi to rakuza,'' which means ``free markets and free
guilds,'' still resonates with Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroshi Mikitani certainly had Oda-San in mind when he named
Rakuten, now Japan's largest e-commerce site. Operating an online
bazaar under virtually the same principles that underpinned Oda's
marketplace, www.rakuten.co.jp draws about 95 million hits a month
as a gateway to about 2,800 merchants around the country selling
everything from eggs to kimonos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Rakuten to be the best place to sell anything,'' said
Mikitani, who founded the site three years ago. ``The marketplace
is what we focus on, the exchange between buyers and sellers, while
most others focus on being a shop or a collection of shops.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchants pay 50,000 yen a month, or about $469, to link their
Web sites to Rakuten. In exchange, they receive tips on jazzing up
those sites and access to Rakuten's database and software, which
contain information about customers and their predilections.
Rakuten also offers them low-cost advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically a bricks-and-mortar business because all of
our stores are real bricks-and-mortar stores,'' Mikitani said,
although most of Rakuten's customers never set foot in those shops.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the vendors on Rakuten are established companies looking
to pare stale inventory without undercutting sales of their
merchandise that is sold at full price. They can put their old
inventory online at bargain-basement prices without much risk that
the news will reach customers who frequent their stores.
</P>
<P>
   Other Rakuten vendors are merely trying to overcome Japan's
notoriously layered distribution system, or to sell their customers
the freshest fish and produce.
</P>
<P>
   Rakuten has also created a sense of community among its users,
who chat online about the virtues and transgressions of Rakuten
vendors and can participate in online auctions. The site's
Rakuten's Free Market, a sort of mini-eBay, where sellers list
items for sale for a fee of 100 yen, or 94 cents, plus 5 percent of
the eventual sale price, is often a lively window onto customer
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The communities that Rakuten creates are important in Japan,
where the Internet has taken off largely as a means of social
interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce here has a much greater social component than in
the United States,'' said Jiro Kokuryo, a professor who specializes
in the study of information technology and systems at Keio
University's business school in Yokohama.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Rakuten's business model that has made it a darling of
investors in the six weeks since it went public, smack in the
middle of a sharp decline in global demand for Internet-related
investments. The stock trades on Jasdaq, Japan's over-the-counter
market. The decline for Internet stocks was as sharp here as it was
in the United States when Rakuten went public; Japanese markets
reflect movements in the American markets.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Rakuten has been profitable, earning $1 million
on sales of $5.6 million last year. That's an impressive 17.8
percent profit margin, largely unheard of in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Mikitani had the advantage of studying the business models of
Amazon.com and eBay, and quickly decided that Rakuten would be much
better off as a hybrid, leaning more toward the eBay model than
toward Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he is unimpressed with Amazon.com. He just wants to
avoid the costs and liabilities of inventory and distribution. And
Rakuten has never advertised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really a retail company,'' Mikitani said. ``We sell
retailers the use of our servers, and there's a big difference.''
(In addition to the monthly membership fees, which provide 80
percent of Rakuten's revenue, 10 percent of the revenue comes from
advertising and the rest comes from auction.)
</P>
<P>
   Mikitani has limited Rakuten's risk by assuming the least
liability possible for the business conducted on the site, but he
pays attention to customer service. Shops are carefully monitored,
and a few have been asked to leave Rakuten for business practices
that were considered shady.
</P>
<P>
   Mikitani contends that Japan will be a better market for
e-commerce than the United States, mostly because of the medium's
ability to spark a consumer revolution in a country known for its
high prices.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Internet allows merchants to circumvent the many
layers of middlemen who clog this country's distribution system,
adding costs every time merchandise changes hands.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you buy an obi, the sash worn with a kimono, at
the retailer Kyoto Kimono Ichiba, it will cost 138,000 yen, or
about $1,300. Buy it from Kyoto Kimono's shop on Rakuten, and it
costs 13,800 yen, or an affordable $130.
</P>
<P>
   Or think of it this way, which is Mikitani's favorite
illustration of the power of the Internet here: Buy a share of
Rakuten through a traditional Japanese stockbroker, and pay
commissions equal to 3 percent of the share's value, which is about
1,065,000 yen at current prices, or $10,000. Buy it online from
Monex, a securities broker here, and pay a $10 commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S., you use Schwab's online brokerage and you get a
price break for sure,'' Mikitani said. ``But it's not anything like
the savings you get in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Mikitani predicted, the Internet ``is going to
completely rebuild the Japanese economic system, much more so than
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks that Japan's more homogeneous population, with
its flatter distribution of wealth and stronger sense of community
than in the United States, provides the country with e-commerce
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese people like to communicate with each other, and it's
much easier to do that on the Net,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, Mikitani
became a banker at the Industrial Bank of Japan, one of the
country's most blue-blooded financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   He took a break from banking to go to Harvard Business School,
returning to the bank in 1993 with a master's of business
administration and a newfound respect for entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I went to business school, I thought my choices were to
either work my way up Japanese style to become a director of the
bank, or to go into investment banking at a Western firm and make a
lot of money,'' Mikitani said.
</P>
<P>
   But he opted for a third approach, striking out on his own to
become a consultant, which led to his foray into e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Mikitani toyed with selling educational services, financial
advisory services and other things online but chose Rakuten
``because it was scalable,'' which he defined as requiring lots of
technology and relatively little human input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could service 2,800 customers with Rakuten,'' he
said. ``Giving 2,800 people financial advice would have been
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rakuten has had no marketing costs so far, although it plans to
use some of the $430 million it raised in its stock offering to do
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky,'' Mikitani said. ``We got famous fast. The
first mover always has an advantage, and we were the first mover.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that others are not moving fast. Curio City,
another virtual mall that Mitsui &AMP; Co. started about the same time
that Rakuten opened, has said it plans to increase the number of
stores affiliated with its site to 10,000 from the current 800 by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But out-Rakutening Rakuten is not easy. WomenJapan.com, which
offers a forum in which Japanese women can seek out and exchange
information and advice about careers, finance, health,
entertainment and family issues, experimented with the online
bazaar concept at Christmastime.
</P>
<P>
   The site featured two shops, one selling pashmina wraps and
other items, and the other selling wine. Neither vendor was an
actual store, and WomenJapan.com found the logistics of
distribution and inventory management cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   The result? ``E-commerce in Japan is still a big question mark
in my mind,'' said Grace Fromm, the chief marketing officer at
WomenJapan.com.
</P>
<P>
   But WomenJapan.com has not given up on e-commerce. Rather, it
took a page from Rakuten's book, signing up two vendors for
Mother's Day _ Tower Records and Hibiya Kadan, a well-known Tokyo
florist _ that could handle orders on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Mikitani's success has made him something of a celebrity, and
government officials and politicians seek his advice about
e-commerce, although some people worry that the government is more
interested in regulating the Internet than in encouraging it.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth remembering that free and unfettered markets have
been the exception in Japan, not the rule. Nobunaga Oda, after all,
committed ritual suicide under threat of assassination by a vassal
turned enemy.
</P>
<P>
   But Mikitani is not afraid. ``What can they do? Shut down a
server?'' he asked. ``All you have to do is move the server to the
U.S., and you're back in business.''

INTERNET COMPANY CONCLUDES LARGEST TAKEOVER BATTLE IN ASIAN
CORPORATE HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ For Richard Li, the thirty-something tycoon whose
deal-making has riveted Hong Kong, Act One ended Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Minority shareholders of Cable and Wireless HKT voted
overwhelmingly to be acquired by Li's Internet company, Pacific
Century Cyberworks. The deal must be ratified by a judge on July
25, but analysts say Monday's vote guarantees that Li, 33, will
soon own Hong Kong's flagship telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Act Two.
</P>
<P>
   Having won the largest takeover battle in Asian corporate
history, Li must demonstrate that he can run an empire as
effectively as he acquired it. On Friday, at an
uncharacteristically modest news conference in London, Pacific
Century introduced its new television and online service. Known as
Network of the World, it is the centerpiece of Li's effort to
combine broadcasting with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the first product from Pacific Century, which has
become one of the most celebrated Internet companies in Asia
largely on the reputation of its brash founder. Analysts say they
will now evaluate Li's company on the performance of the new
service, which will be rolled out over the next 18 months to a
potential audience of 136 million households in Asia. It will later
expand elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to succeed at rolling out the broadband service, and
the economics of that haven't been illustrated yet,'' said Greg
Feldberg, a communications analyst at Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities
here.
</P>
<P>
   Feldberg recently lowered his rating on Pacific Century to a
hold from a buy because he believes the company's assets _ even
after the acquisition of Cable and Wireless HKT _ do not justify
its market value of $20.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are struggling to assess Network of the World because
its ambitions are so vast and its starting point is so modest.
Pacific Century, which owns no programming and has only a handful
of licenses for sporting events like Indian cricket, plans to
develop a service that, it declares, will be a ``revolutionary new
medium for the new generation of consumers in the digital age.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, Network of the World, or NOW, consists
of four hours of original programming a day on a single television
channel, beamed via satellite to Asia and the Middle East. The
companion Web site (www.now.com) contains information that builds
on the video programming.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one program features computer-game players squaring
off against each other as a host offers play-by-play commentary.
Viewers can apply to be contestants by going to a the web site,
where they will be interviewed by one of the show's ``virtual''
producers. If they prefer to sit on the sidelines, they can create
an electronic persona to be inserted in an audience.
</P>
<P>
   The network's top producer, who works in a slickly designed
studio in London, acknowledges that such programming ideas may seem
oddball. But he is confident that young viewers will respond in
droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people watch TV and surf the Internet at the same
time,'' said the executive creative director, Michael Johnson.
``This is a very comfortable space for the computer literate, and
it is completely incomprehensible to older viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the network's shaky debut illustrates, however, even
traditional television programming is challenging. NOW had hoped to
roll out the service last weekend with simultaneous TV and Internet
coverage of the Wimbledon tennis championships. But Johnson said
the network canceled the plan at the last minute because it feared
problems with the production quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be there next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century plans to invest $1.5 billion in Network of the
World over the next five years. Some of that will go to opening
programming studios in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Bombay. The rest will
go to securing distribution. Li plans to beam Network of the World
to cable operators in China, India and other Asian countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In building an interactive service, Pacific Century is trying to
succeed where other, much larger companies, have failed. Time
Warner shut down its vaunted cable service in Orlando, Fla., in
1997, after spending millions of dollars and signing up less than
10,000 customers. Several regional Bell telephone companies teamed
up to start interactive media companies _ only to abandon them a
few years later.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts contend that NOW will fall to the same weaknesses
that doomed those ventures: inadequate technology and programming
that does not beguile viewers. The service's Web site, for example,
currently cannot be accessed by an Apple computer or with a
Netscape browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people want are reliable, high-capacity networks for
accessing existing content,'' said Joseph Sweeney, the research
director of Gartner Group of Hong Kong, a research firm. ``The NOW
network is probably ahead of its time. It's very hard to see how it
is going to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a longtime television producer who helped start the
Star TV cable network for Li, rejects those comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Time Warner TV project really focused on technology,'' he
said, ``and the attempt to push movies down phone lines was done by
phone companies, which are not famous for knowing audiences.''

&HT;     SWISS ARMY KNIFE: NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN FLINN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A desperate call came over the intercom on a
USAir flight to Memphis a few years ago: An elderly passenger was
choking to death on a piece of steak. Was there a doctor on board?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Plotkin, an anesthesiologist from North Carolina,
rushed to the man's seat, opened his trusty Swiss Army knife and
tried to perform an emergency tracheotomy. Alas, the 1 1/2-inch
blade on the physician's Classic model wasn't long enough for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Another call for help went out: Did anyone on the plane have a
knife with a longer blade? Half a dozen passengers rushed forward,
each offering their own Swiss Army knives. Using the 2 1/2-inch
blade on a Camper model, Plotkin cut a breathing hole in the
choking man's neck and saved his life.
</P>
<P>
   What Plotkin didn't know at the time was that Victorinox Cutlery
Corp. makes a Swiss Army knife model with a curved, surgical blade
specifically designed for emergency tracheotomies.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a travel emergency that cannot be remedied with a Swiss
Army knife? Has a more useful, versatile, perfect tool ever been
invented? Is there a self-respecting traveler who doesn't carry
one?
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago I asked readers to reveal the little
knickknacks and gizmos they find essential while on the road, and
the one item that showed up on virtually everyone's list was a
Swiss Army knife.
</P>
<P>
   I've used my Climber model to carve apples and Emmental cheese
next to a Swiss glacier, to change camera batteries in the Masai
Mara, to cut moleskin for blisters in the shadow of Mount Everest
and to uncork a bottle of Cotes du Rhone in Provence. Its tweezers
have extracted thorns picked up in the Australian bush; its leather
punch amended my belt in Russia when a bout of the Trotskies made
me skinnier than I've been since high school.
</P>
<P>
   Every U.S. president since LBJ has ordered a batch engraved with
the presidential seal to be distributed as White House souvenirs.
NASA issues the 17-tool Master Craftman model to all astronauts,
who routinely use them to make zero-gravity repairs to the space
shuttle. Swiss Army knives have been to both poles and the summit
of Everest. When Gary Powers was shot down over the USSR in his U-2
spy plane in 1960, the Soviets exhibited his knife as ``CIA
equipment.'' There's a 33-tool Swiss Champ model on permanent
display in the New York Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   All this from such humble beginnings. The original knife, with
six blades and a red handle to make it easier to spot if dropped in
a snowbank, was patented by Swiss cutlerly maker Cark Elsener in
1897. At first Elsener made just two models: one with a corkscrew
for Swiss Army officers, one without for enlisted men. The company
Elsener founded, Victorinox, is today run by his grandchildren in
the Swiss town of Ibach, a small village an hour's drive south of
Zurich, in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. The Victorinox
factory turns out 34,000 knives a day on average.
</P>
<P>
   In 1908, Wenger S.A., a rival cutlery firm in Delmont, in the
French-speaking part of Switzerland, began manufacturing an almost
identical knife. The Swiss being, well, Swiss, adopted a policy of
strict neutrality, and to this day the army buys exactly half its
stock from Victorinox and half from Wenger. (Actually, the Swiss
army isn't buying knives from either company this year. Downsizing
as left them with a surplus, and they don't expect to purchase any
new ones until 2002.)
</P>
<P>
   A practiced eye can spot the difference between the two brands:
a different shield around the Helvetica cross on the case.
Victorinox bills itself as the ``original'' Swiss Army knife,
Wenger as the ``genuine'' Swiss Army knife. Victorinox controls
about 80 percent of the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the brand, the knives have achieved almost a cult
status among travelers and outdoorspeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an aura of cleverness and resourcefulness about the
Swiss Army knife,'' said Rick Wall, a San Diego teacher and founder
of the now-defunct Swiss Army Knife Society. ``There may be more
practical tools, but nothing with the panache of the Swiss Army
knife.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years Wall published a newsletter, the ``Crimson Cutter,''
filled with folksy testimonials from Swiss Army knife fans around
the world. One grateful owner used his to fix a broken toilet on a
train from Moscow to Leningrad, another to slice blueberry pie in
Vermont. A letter carrier in the San Francisco area repaired the
window crank in his mail truck; a British man spliced a ruptured
fuel line in his Rover.
</P>
<P>
   Wall compiled much of this lore in a book, ``The Swiss Army
Knife Companion,'' which is now out of print but available on line
from www.borders.com.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are more than 400 varieties of Swiss Army knife in
circulation. There's a model for golfers, with a tool for replacing
divots; one for equestrians, with a blade for removing stones from
horses' hooves; one for speakers, with a laser pointer. A model for
auto mechanics comes with a tiny flashlight, tire pressure gauge
and fuse-puller. There's even a new $75, 34-function Cyber Tool
model for computer users, with a device for prying open the cases
of laptops and a ``DIP switch setter.'' Whatever that is.
</P>
<P>
   What model to buy? I can vouch for the $35 Climber, with a large
blade, small blade, can opener, screwdriver, bottle opener,
scissors, leather punch, toothpick, tweezers and corkscrew. (But,
alas, no tracheotomy blade.) It sounds like a lot of tools, but
it's roughly in the middle of the size spectrum. The one blade I
miss is a serrated knife for cutting tomatoes and bread.
</P>
<P>
   It's important, say Wall and other experts, to avoid being
seduced by tool-chest models bristling with divot removers, cigar
cutters, fish scalers, wire strippers, socket wrenches and other
impedimenta if you're unlikely to use them. Buy the smallest model
that has the tools you absolutely need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything more than that,'' says Wall, ``and you're just
showing off.''

&HT;     WHAT? NO SECOND BANANA? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As speculation mounts about potential running mates
for Al Gore and George W. Bush, a contrarian view is now offered:
Who needs a vice president anyway? Let's get rid of that useless
appendage!
</P>
<P>
   There's a small constitutional problem with this suggestion, but
what the heck. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
</P>
<P>
   The author of this revolutionary idea is former Minnesota Sen.
Eugene McCarthy, a Democratic presidential candidate in the
tumultuous Vietnam-era year of 1968. He lost, of course, but for a
time he was the center of excitement, defying incumbent President
Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy's year of fame having long passed, we haven't heard
much from the 84-year-old politician lately. He's been writing
books and thinking. But with McCarthy, known for a wicked wit and
an impish intellect, thinking can be dangerous to the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   His latest brainstorm is perfectly in character. McCarthy has
always danced to a different drummer.
</P>
<P>
   The way he outlines his idea, eliminating the post of vice
president almost sounds like a sensible move. Can he really be
serious?
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was once in the running for the job himself. In 1964,
Johnson made a public fuss over McCarthy and hinted that a
Minnesota senator would be perfect as his running mate. Then he
picked Minnesota's other senator, Hubert Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy muses wryly that ``I lost by one vote'' _ Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy surfaced last week at a media luncheon to try out his
idea and promote his new book, ``American Beastiary,'' which
equates politicians with animals in a light-hearted way.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of leaving a president veep-less, with nobody of
high rank to cover his behind or do his bidding and his dirty work,
is pretty hard going. We are accustomed to a Constitution that
clearly calls for the election of a vice president who is to
succeed any president too disabled to continue his executive
duties.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution originally provided that the person who
received the second-largest number of votes in the presidential
election should be named vice president. After this proved
politically awkward, the provision was amended in 1804 to provide
that presidential and vice presidential candidates be named
separately on the same ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But McCarthy has never been intimidated by tradition. ``On every
ground the job is a nuisance,'' he says. Since the everyday duties
and responsibilities are not defined, most vice presidents have
wound up underappreciated, underemployed and unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore has been luckier than his predecessors.
President Clinton has not only given Gore specific, substantive
tasks but allowed him considerable influence in policymaking across
the board. Gore's role may not set a permanent precedent, however.
It is strictly up to the next president to decide how much access
and authority to give his second banana.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy also grumbles that however wasteful the post, it puts
the holder first in line to be the next president. Sometimes the
veep is chosen for the wrong reason, such as his ability to deliver
a specific state, and isn't up to running a country. Dan Quayle, a
foolish choice by George Bush, comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   That second name on the ballot just ``clutters up the
campaign,'' McCarthy observes. Nobody knows what vice presidents do
anyway, except to wait around for the president to fall ill. So
what to do in such a disaster if there's no fall-back person? Throw
it to the Electoral College, says McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   The qualities of a good second banana _ discretion, patience,
loyalty and playing second fiddle to the boss _ are not those that
matter most in a good presidential candidate. ``What a vice
president does as vice president doesn't count in a presidential
race,'' McCarthy says. That is part of Gore's problem and why he
has been constantly trying to re-invent himself.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years he has spent at Clinton's side, many
voters still don't know who he is or what he has done.
</P>
<P>
   Given McCarthy's fey sense of humor, you can never be sure when
he is pulling your leg or whether he has really had a political
epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   But watching the current presidential candidates wrestle with
lists of possible veeps that contain no stars and no obvious
choices, you have to wonder if they wouldn't be better off making
their race alone. The basic rule about picking running mates is
that the person shouldn't hurt the ticket. If he or she is of some
help that's a plus, but it's not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy would spare them the agony of that choice. It might not
be such a bad idea after all.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a constitutional amendment that bars federal officials
from receiving money or favors from foreign interests, under
penalty of loss of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might just be that the American people would really support
such a thing,'' said Michael Paulsen, law professor at University
of Minnesota. ``If so, there is nothing to keep this amendment from
being ratified.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because it already was submitted to Congress and
approved, as the 13th Amendment, in 1810. Back then, as now,
amendments first pass through the House and Senate and then proceed
to the states for their approval, or ratification. Three-quarters
of the states must ratify for an amendment to become part of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   No one argues that the House and Senate failed to approve the
13th Amendment, also known as the Titles of Nobility Amendment. The
controversy arises over the ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government recorded 12 states that ratified, four
states that rejected, and Virginia as a ``no reply.'' And so an
amendment forbidding slavery went on to be ratified as the current
13th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's reply may have been lost during difficulties in
communication during the War of 1812, scholars say.
</P>
<P>
   But now a group of advocates, calling themselves Project 13,
insist they have evidence that the original 13th was ratified.
</P>
<P>
   It's but one of several ``failed amendments,'' concerning
everything from states' rights to women's rights, that supporters
and constitutional scholars say are still alive. These are
amendments that were approved by the House and Senate, didn't get
enough states to ratify and -- this is key -- have no time limits
on ratification.
</P>
<P>
   That original 13th Amendment is eerily appropriate now, with the
Senate Judiciary Committee examining foreign influences in the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a dead letter,'' said Paulsen, who has written about
time limits and the amendment process. ``It's still out there,
kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   The last amendment to the Constitution, named for its author,
James Madison, proved that ``lost'' amendments can be ``found,'' as
it were. Concerning the timing of congressional pay raises, the
Madison Amendment was ratified as the 27th Amendment in 1992 --
more than 200 years after it was first submitted.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   That means the Equal Rights Amendment is still alive, its
backers say. They've used Madison's success to push the ERA in the
Missouri General Assembly, where it's nearing a vote. Were the
effort to succeed, the ERA theoretically would need only two more
states for ratification.
</P>
<P>
   (ERA advocates must also overcome the argument that the proposed
amendment expired, after a congressional extension, in 1982.
Backers say that because the date appears in the proposing clause,
not in the text of the amendment itself, it does not apply.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the failed amendments are now unnecessary. Regulation of
child labor, the subject of a 1924 proposed amendment, now is
handled through federal laws. And a proposed amendment from 1789
concerning the size of the House of Representatives would be moot,
as that number of members -- 200 -- already has been exceeded.
(There are 435 seats in the House.)
</P>
<P>
   Another proposed amendment, barring any law interfering with the
``domestic institutions'' of states, including slavery, is cited in
literature from the League of the South, which champions states'
rights. Some scholars say that although that proposal remains
technically viable, its main thrust was nullified by a later one
(the current 13th) that outlawed slavery.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The Titles of Nobility Amendment, fans say, is not only still
viable, but necessary and important.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dunn, a former Baltimore police officer now retired in
Albion, Maine, has spent the last 20 years researching it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it from a historical perspective,'' Dunn said,
``it's an internal Monroe Doctrine, where foreign influence is not
only checked but the persons involved lose their positions in
government and their citizenship.'' The Monroe Doctrine, enacted in
1823, forbade European nations to interfere with American affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Titles of Nobility Amendment was indeed similar in intent.
It was submitted at a time when there was great concern over
American citizens accepting foreign titles. One example was
Napoleon Bonaparte's younger brother, Jerome Bonaparte, and his
wife, Baltimore socialite Elizabeth Patterson. They made Congress
especially nervous, as rumors were rife that France was considering
granting them titles -- and, thus, power.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the Titles of Nobility Amendment reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``If any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim,
receive or retain any title of nobility or honor, or shall, without
the consent of Congress, accept and retain any present, pension,
office or emolument of any kind whatever, from any emperor, king,
prince or foreign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen of
the United States, and shall be incapable of holding any office of
trust or profit under them, or either of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn has visited libraries across the country, poring over
thousands of books, law dictionaries, encyclopedias and documents.
He is convinced that the Titles of Nobility Amendment was indeed
ratified and should be recognized as part of the Constitution.
Along the way he's met other researchers with his same passion;
they all formed Project 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a subterranean type of movement,'' Dunn said. ``We've
never received that much publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   One piece of their evidence is a letter from John Quincy Adams
in the early 1800s to a citizen who wanted to assist the German
government. ``Adams specifically mentioned the 13th amendment'' as
forbidding him to do so, Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said he's also found the amendment listed in many books.
</P>
<P>
   John Vile, however, is dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Vile, head of the political science department at Middle
Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, is the author of
several books on the amending process, including ``Encyclopedia of
Constitutional Amendments, Proposed Amendments, and Amending
Issues, 1789-1995.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because it's in books, Vile said, does not mean the
original 13th was ratified. ``Communications were a lot different
then,'' Vile said; perhaps the publisher simply assumed the
amendment would be ratified before it was. ``The best scholarship
suggests it was not adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes numerous law-journal papers, such as one titled
``The Missing 13th Amendment: Constitutional Nonsense and Titles of
Nobility'' in a recent Southern California Interdisciplinary Law
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn and his colleagues remain undaunted. They've launched a Web
site (www.13th-amendment.org) to publicize the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   And what does Congress have to say about all these amendments?
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., submitted a resolution that
all the failed amendments ``are hereby declared to have lapsed''
and were no longer subject to ratification.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the resolution unanimously, 99-0, and referred
it to the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was never heard from again.

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Husband cheating on line? Catch him with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   With those seven words, software developer Doug Fowler hit the
jackpot. He posted the words in an eBay auction solicitation, in
July 1999, advertising Internet surveillance software that could
help you nab that straying spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Within four hours, 500 people had clicked on the posting. Within
a week, 5,000 had perused the offer. Sales tripled in the weeks
following the auction, and Fowler's company is now growing at a
healthy clip of 15 to 25 percent per month.
</P>
<P>
   With those seven salacious words, a software star was born. And
like many stories of overnight success, the breakthrough was
accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler, a software developer in Vero Beach, Fla., was trying to
pump up the sagging sales of his Spector software, which records
computer and Internet activity, much like a camcorder, and lets
users play back the recorded information.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the ``husband'' posting, Fowler had targeted two
primary fields: parents monitoring children and employers
monitoring employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We originally thought parents and employers would be our
original markets, and marketed to them exclusively for about 6
months,'' said Fowler, who is president of SpectorSoft Inc. ``Then
we got a letter from a woman who caught her fiance meeting several
women a day on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a fringe use at first, until a couple of
months later when we got more letters. That's when we ran the
auction. Essentially, sales tripled over night after the eBay
auction.''
</P>
<P>
   Spector's spying software can be installed in ``stealth mode,''
masking it from a child, an employee or spouse. The software acts
like an invisible video recorder pointed at the computer monitor,
secretly taking snapshots as frequently as once per second, or as
sporadically as one per half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Spector retails for $49.95.
</P>
<P>
   Because it can take pictures so frequently, Spector can capture
all chat conversations, instant messages, e-mails sent and
received, all Web sites visited, all documents, all keystrokes
typed.
</P>
<P>
   The original user accesses the results by typing in a four-key
access code, as well as a password.
</P>
<P>
   And as you can well imagine, those results can be explosive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fowler, one SpectorSoft customer believed his wife
was having an affair. Within a few days of using the software, he
not only confirmed his suspicions, but also discovered that his
wife and boyfriend were plotting to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard a lot of stories about what people have found out,
but that is certainly the most chilling one,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Pierce, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation
in San Francisco, said SpectorSoft reveals some pretty serious
societal issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are trust issues here,'' said Pierce, whose nonprofit
organization champions privacy and free speech rights in relation
to technology. ``Obviously people are not trusting their kids,
spouses or employees. To not tell someone they're being monitored
can be very detrimental to any relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said people who have privacy concerns should not use his
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that some people may interpret this as an
invasion of privacy,'' he said, ``but, generally, people are in a
situation that they suspect something is going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone would argue with parents or employers
(using Spector). As far as the spousal situation, it comes down to
a question of whether it's better to have the knowledge of someone
cheating on you ... or whether it's better to protect someone's
privacy.''

 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore has a new theme, ``Prosperity and Progress.'' Thus he
distinguishes himself from the candidates running on widespread
penury and decline. The retooling of Gore is intended to capitalize
on all those bounteous budget surpluses. His advisers are recasting
Al as the symbol of fiscal fecundity, the Gorenucopia from which
all bounty flows.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to put it another way: Vote for Gore, and he guarantees to
tax you more than it takes to run the government.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists wonder why Gore doesn't get credit for
this booming economy. Simple: Americans obviously don't think he
had anything to do with it. Ditto Bill Clinton. It's what they
didn't do. Didn't nationalize any industries. Didn't put laughing
powder in Alan Greenspan's drink, making him giggle uncontrollably
and squirt milk out his nose while discussing ``irrational
exuberance,'' thereby reducing confidence in his stewardship.
Didn't establish the Department of Triplicate to oversee the newly
created Office of Duplication. Didn't come clean on Monica, which
resulted in the impeachment drama, also known as the Lawyer and
Pundit Full Employment Act of 1998. Didn't invade too many
countries and kill too many people.
</P>
<P>
   They did, however, push that little health care proposal. It
gave so many people bone-deep heebie-jeebies that they voted in the
GOP Congress in '94 and forever changed the character of Clinton's
tenure. Ever after he dressed on the right and contented himself
with a small scrap of socialism over here, an offstage war there.
Having done nothing, he leaves Gore unable to claim any role in the
prosperity -- unless Gore wants to insist he was right by Clinton's
side when the president declined to tax e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's latest makeover might be the dullest yet, and it might be
DOA like the others. Retooling doesn't work. In 1996, for example,
handlers tried to turn Bob Dole into -- well, it's hard to say; the
entire campaign was one long senior moment. But they tried to make
him Ronald Reagan's long-lost half-brother -- a war hero, a tax
cutter, a moral bulwark. They played down Dole's snarky wit and
played up his gravitas, hoping it would make Clinton look like a
callow playboy. But people already saw Clinton as a callow playboy.
They weren't in the mood to elect Dad -- no matter how the handlers
remade him.
</P>
<P>
   Whether voters want to elect Frat Brother remains to be seen.
Supposedly voters will turn to Gore once they learn the details of
George W. Bush's proposals, but this presumes the voters have any
interest in details. They don't. Gore people say: ``Sure, on
defense issues Bush has a 40-point lead among men ages 11-92. But
once voters realize that Bush favors a 14 percent reduction in
average boot-heel density and a repainting of all ships in a
slightly duller shade of gray, we feel that his numbers will drop
off considerably.'' Sorry. Doesn't work that way. If all your
details dovetail perfectly with the desires of the electorate but
the polling data show that you ``strongly remind people of runny
cheese,'' you aren't going to win.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean Gore is dead. Anything can happen. But Bush is
popular enough to have a three-gaffe margin. If he says something
really stupid (``I'm looking forward to meeting the king of
Canada''), his supporters will think, well, everyone makes a
mistake. Gaffe No. 2 (``Well, your right to swing your fist ends at
my right to say `Fire' in a crowded theater''), people will think
the press is picking on him. Gaffe No. 3, voters will think: What's
up with this idiot, anyway? But Bush is too tightly run and too
well spun to make bright, screaming mistakes. We'll get the crinkly
grin and the fractured banter, all upbeat and positive -- except
for a sad tug at the corner of his mouth when Al goes negative.
</P>
<P>
   This absolutely has to drive Gore nuts. He knows the cheat sheet
for Gore jokes: ``Love Story,'' Love Canal, invented Internet,
slumlord, world's first wooden robot. And what's the cliche for
Bush? Stooopid. And he's leading. It's ... just ... wrong. Gore is
knowledge. Gore is details. He is RoboWonk. Smarter than Bush? No
doubt. Democrats always nominate smarter guys. And they lose to the
charming guys. And then fume like chess club presidents who can't
understand why Cindy Lou went to the prom with the quarterback
instead of choosing her intellectual superior.
</P>
<P>
   Reinvention is a doomed enterprise. If you have to reinvent,
they're already on to you.

LANGUAGE BOOKS TO SCHLEP ALONG ON VACATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

   You're on vacation. Your stress is disappearing but your brain
is vegetating. You long for intellectual meat with a spicy sauce.
Try a language book.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Ketchup on Your Muumuu,'' by Eugene Ehrlich (Henry
Holt, $24), is an etymologist's breezy look at foreign words that
have been gulped down by English speakers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ketchup &LR; , to begin: This word, meaning ``a condiment of pureed
tomatoes, onions, vinegar, etc.,'' is from the Chinese  &UR; kejap &LR;  or
 &UR; ke-tsiap &LR; , ``fish sauce,'' made of brine of pickled fish. The
author notes the variant spelling,  &UR; catsup &LR; , which is what Del
Monte labels used to say; my own research shows that since 1988 the
Del Monte marketers have fallen into step with Heinz and Hunt's in
calling their thick, red stuff  &UR; ketchup &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Muumuu &LR;  was adopted into English from the Hawaiian in the 1920s
and is ``the name of a dress, literally, a `cutoff,' so-called
because it has no yoke, the usual top section from which the rest
of the dress hangs.'' That fashion definition leaves me a little
confused (it's a colorful, loose-fitting variation of the
missionaries' Mother Hubbard dress), and I would not hyphenate  &UR; so
called  &LR; because it is not used here as a compound adjective, but
Ehrlich's etymology is sound.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the borrowings are familiar: the Tagalog  &UR; boondocks &LR; ,
the Sanskrit  &UR; guru &LR; , the Chinook  &UR; high muck-a-muck &LR; . The German
 &UR; Pickelhaube &LR; , however, was new to me.  &UR; Haube &LR;  is ``helmet,'' and
 &UR; Pickel &LR;  has a sense of ``pick ax''; a  &UR; Pickelhaube &LR;  is ``a German
army spiked helmet of a type worn before and during World War I.''
There's a word to spring on some unsuspecting historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word Court,'' by Barbara Wallraff (Harcourt, $24, and whatever
became of Brace? I'd like to see a firm of castaway founders, like
Brace, Roebuck, Pearce, Fenner &AMP; Beane.): Here is a usage guide in
question-answer form by the Atlantic magazine columnist and
longtime line editor. (A ``line editor'' is a copy editor with a
lust to rewrite. Most writers resent line editors because they show
us to be sloppy and lazy.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Try and &LR;  or  &UR; try to &LR; ? Wallraff advises against the colloquial
 &UR; try and &LR;  in formal writing and goes on to explain the informal
variant as an example of  &UR; hendiadys &LR; , ``a device used as a poetic
ornament in Greek and Latin.'' An example is  &UR; nice and warm &LR;  to
express  &UR; nicely warm &LR; . Try to keep that straight.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Gravitas &LR;  is a word that pundits such as William Safire and
William F. Buckley love to use,'' notes a questioner irritated by
his inability to find this weighty word for ``solemnity, high
seriousness'' in his limited dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Wallraff responds: ``You're quite right that it is unkind of
authors to use unfamiliar words that leave their readers guessing.
But aren't you glad that it's not only people with rings in their
bellybuttons and skateboards under their toes who are giving us
words for the dictionary makers to include in their next
editions?'' (Yes, some dictionaries treat  &UR; bellybutton &LR;  as one
word, but  &UR; belly laugh &LR; ,  &UR; belly flop &LR;  and  &UR; belly dance &LR;  as two. I
prefer to keep them all separate until Big Bellyup Day, when we
will squeeze them all together at once.)

Machina,'' subtitled ``Reconciling Darwin and Chomsky with the
Human Brain,'' a cross-discipline debate by the neurophysiologist
William Calvin and the linguist Derek Bickerton ($26.95).
</P>
<P>
   They try to (not  &UR; try and &LR; ) resolve ``the apparent paradox that
has  &UR; hag-ridden &LR;  the human sciences for centuries: that we were
produced by the same forces as other species, yet behave so
differently from other species.'' Great archaic word,  &UR; hag-ridden &LR; ;
means ``afflicted by nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Barzun's ``From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western
Cultural Life'' (HarperCollins, $36) is cultural history with an
attitude: My nonagenarian mentor condemns the severe effects of
anything-goes linguistics on education and derides the
loosey-goosey notion that ``no native speaker can ever make a
mistake.'' The legendary Columbia professor emeritus has turned out
a  &UR; tour d'horizon &LR;  that is at once a  &UR; tour de force &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Euphemism Watch
</P>
<P>
   In Shakespeare's time, they were called  &UR; gravediggers &LR; . Then
they got organized, raised prices and named themselves
 &UR; undertakers &LR; . When that acquired a too-gloomy connotation, they
changed it to  &UR; morticians &LR; . But now that caretakers have given way
to caregivers, and even  &UR; sharing &LR;  has been overtaken by  &UR; caring &LR;  as
the most pious participle, we have _ trumpeted in a reverential,
hushed ta-dah! _ the  &UR; deathcare industry &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The other major euphemism to burst forth this year is the
diplomatic replacement for  &UR; rogue state &LR; . The earliest use I can
find of this phrase was in a 1983 Wall Street Journal story noting
that smokestack industries have ``won Ohio a largely deserved
reputation as a  &UR; rogue state &LR;  on the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the columnist William Pfaff first applied it in
its current sense: ``The Soviet Union had deliberately isolated
itself. Its role was that of a  &UR; rogue state &LR; , a revolutionary power
that challenged all the others.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the phrase has been applied to states like
Libya, Iran, Iraq, Serbia, Sudan, Syria and North Korea that
supported or condoned the presence of terrorists. Last month,
however, on National Public Radio's ``Diane Rehm Show,'' Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright revealed an official smoothing-over:
``We are now calling these states  &UR; states of concern &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this new locution, state spokesman Richard Boucher
said of Iraq, a hard-core  &UR; rogue state &LR;  in the earlier formulation,
that it had become ``a state previously known as rogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem solved; worry removed. Of course, if one of those
 &UR; states of concern &LR;  gets hold of a nuclear or biological missile,
it could be a bonanza for the  &UR; deathcare industry &LR; .

   WASHINGTON _ In his dissent from the Supreme Court ruling that
the Boy Scouts may bar gays as members, Justice John Paul Stevens
quotes the legendary Justice Louis Brandeis: ``We must be ever on
our guard, lest we erect our prejudices into legal principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for the 5-4 majority
that found the Scouts had a right to accept only members they
wanted, countered by pointing out that the great Brandeis was also
a champion of free speech. The majority viewed this case as turning
on the First Amendment right of freedom of expressive association,
not on discrimination on the basis of sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   And there you have it. This was a classic case of conflicting
rights, each legitimate, each at loggerheads with the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court of New Jersey, where the case originated, had
declared the Scouts to be a sufficiently public organization to be
subject to the state's anti-discrimination law. But the U.S.
Supreme Court majority simply declared the organization to be a
private institution under federal law despite its use of
taxpayer-financed facilities in some places, frequent reliance on
public support for troop sponsorship and participation in
government-sanctioned charity drives.
</P>
<P>
   The high bench put great weight on the Boy Scouts' claim to
being dedicated to shaping young males into models of moral purity,
which to the Scouts included the rejection of a homosexual
lifestyle. There was not a lot of evidence pointing to a specific
anti-gay policy, except that Scouts were required to be ``morally
straight'' and ``clean.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scoutmaster Handbook does not mention sexuality. The
attitude of the Scout leadership, however, is to encourage boys to
be boys, with all the well-known implications, good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   But to justify its decision the court's majority had to find in
Scout doctrine a basic message that would be not just blurred but
definitely harmed by the admission of a gay scoutmaster. It was not
enough that a gay be present. There must be an unwanted message
about gay pride involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state interests (in forbidding discrimination) do not
justify such a severe intrusion on the freedom of expressive
association,'' Rehnquist wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice worried that the public presence of a gay
Scout leader would ``force the organization to send a message, both
to the youth members and the world, that the Boy Scouts accept
homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.'' That message
might also have been one of tolerance of diversity, but Rehnquist
and his four colleagues didn't get that one.
</P>
<P>
   Only ``severe intrusion'' would do to trump legally sanctioned
bigotry. So the court, by golly, found it.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, legitimate reasons for people to want to
associate with other people who share their thinking, their
background, their common goals. But that is appropriate only in
private groups, which do not seek the backing of public,
taxpayer-supported organizations for support.
</P>
<P>
   You want to build a tree house in your backyard and exclude
girls, okay. You pay for its construction and you sit there alone.
Your loss.
</P>
<P>
   But the Boy Scouts are not strictly private. If you have
children in school, the Scouts are constantly in your face,
recruiting youngsters under the banner of teaching good citizenship
and good fellowship. They go into the community to raise money.
They wear uniforms so they can be identified. They use churches,
schools and other public places in which to meet. Their
convocations are held in public parks with speeches by politicians,
bands and other attendant symbols of public support.
</P>
<P>
   The high bench, as it so often does, saw what it wanted to see.
It gave the Boy Scouts a green light to become a crusty, exclusive
organization isolated from a changing society.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts can react to this sensibly or arrogantly. If they
conclude that a ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy might work and
relax their fears of sexual subversion, all may yet be well. But if
not, they will become just another young boys' club in a world of
more interesting clubs. Stuffy doesn't cut it any more _ for any
age.

WILL SCOUTS LOSE SUPPORT BECAUSE OF STANCE ON GAYS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts of
America can legally ban homosexuals from serving as troop leaders.
The decision also strongly implied that the organization has a
right to exclude gay boys as members.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the court concluded that the BSA, as a
private organization, has the right to discriminate in choosing who
is permitted within its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   BSA officials proclaimed a great victory. But the decision could
backfire on the Irving, Texas-based organization in at least one
significant way.
</P>
<P>
   It could cause the growing numbers of corporations,
organizations and individuals who oppose discrimination against
gays to have second thoughts about contributing financially to the
Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations such as the United Way, which solicit donations
that support an array of organizations including the Boy Scouts,
could face pressure in some cities to remove local Scout councils
from their list of beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Some who contribute annually to the United Way through their
employers might also specify that they don't want their money going
to the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be taking that route because I don't believe in
discriminating against gays. I cannot in good conscience give money
to an organization that does.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, cities, corporations, universities and other
institutions are formally adopting enlightened regulations that
specifically ban discrimination against gays, such as in hiring and
benefits policies.
</P>
<P>
   Will many of these entities continue contributing to the Boy
Scouts if they have done so in the past? It would be inconsistent
and hypocritical to do so if they truly oppose discrimination
against gays.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the BSA should re-examine its position and voluntarily
end its policy of barring gays. But that's unlikely to happen any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   It's a safe bet that many gay boys will feel the lure of
Scouting and continue to join, just as they always have. They'll
probably be discreet about their sexual orientation _ if, indeed,
they already have a clearly established orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The BSA is, in most ways, a splendid organization. I have fond
memories of being a Scout in the early to mid-1960s in my small
hometown in northeast Texas. Camping out, playing basketball in a
school gym on Saturday mornings, taking a rigorous 20-mile hike
through the countryside and working on merit badges are activities
that I greatly enjoyed. I proudly wore my uniform and recited the
Scout Oath.
</P>
<P>
   BSA officials say that the organization snubs homosexuals
because they do not comply with the oath's pledge to be ``morally
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   When I was a Scout, I felt that ``morally straight'' meant being
honest, sincere, responsible and following the Golden Rule in
treating others as I would want to be treated. It never occurred to
me that the phrase might refer to sexual orientation, nor did I
ever give a moment's thought to whether anybody in our troop might
be gay.
</P>
<P>
   As a heterosexual, I don't fully know what it means to be gay.
But I know gay co-workers and community leaders whom I like,
respect and feel comfortable around.
</P>
<P>
   I have a gay relative who is one of the finest human beings I
know. He's intelligent, compassionate, hard-working, unselfish,
honest to a fault, and caring to friends and family. I consider him
more ``morally straight'' than 95 percent of the people I know.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, someday, the Boy Scouts will come to realize that there
are more important factors than sexual orientation in judging a
person's character, morality and fitness for membership in their
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Until they do, they'll lose support from increasing numbers of
Americans, myself included, who don't view homophobia as an
admirable personal or institutional trait.

government-sanctioned charity drives.
</P>
<P>
   The high bench put great weight on the Boy Scouts' claim to
being dedicated to shaping young males into models of moral purity,
which to the Scouts included the rejection of a homosexual
lifestyle. There was not a lot of evidence pointing to a specific
anti-gay policy, except that Scouts were required to be ``morally
straight'' and ``clean.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scoutmaster Handbook does not mention sexuality. The
attitude of the Scout leadership, however, is to encourage boys to
be boys, with all the well-known implications, good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   But to justify its decision the court's majority had to find in
Scout doctrine a basic message that would be not just blurred but
definitely harmed by the admission of a gay scoutmaster. It was not
enough that a gay be present. There must be an unwanted message
about gay pride involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state interests (in forbidding discrimination) do not
justify such a severe intrusion on the freedom of expressive
association,'' Rehnquist wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice worried that the public presence of a gay
Scout leader would ``force the organization to send a message, both
to the youth members and the world, that the Boy Scouts accept
homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.'' That message
might also have been one of tolerance of diversity, but Rehnquist
and his four colleagues didn't get that one.
</P>
<P>
   Only ``severe intrusion'' would do to trump legally sanctioned
bigotry. So the court, by golly, found it.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, legitimate reasons for people to want to
associate with other people who share their thinking, their
background, their common goals. But that is appropriate only in
private groups, which do not seek the backing of public,
taxpayer-supported organizations for support.
</P>
<P>
   You want to build a tree house in your backyard and exclude
girls, okay. You pay for its construction and you sit there alone.
Your loss.
</P>
<P>
   But the Boy Scouts are not strictly private. If you have
children in school, the Scouts are constantly in your face,
recruiting youngsters under the banner of teaching good citizenship
and good fellowship. They go into the community to raise money.
They wear uniforms so they can be identified. They use churches,
schools and other public places in which to meet. Their
convocations are held in public parks with speeches by politicians,
bands and other attendant symbols of public support.
</P>
<P>
   The high bench, as it so often does, saw what it wanted to see.
It gave the Boy Scouts a green light to become a crusty, exclusive
organization isolated from a changing society.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts can react to this sensibly or arrogantly. If they
conclude that a ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy might work and
relax their fears of sexual subversion, all may yet be well. But if
not, they will become just another young boys' club in a world of
more interesting clubs. Stuffy doesn't cut it any more _ for any
age.

STUDIES FIND YOUNG SALTWATER FISH RETURN TO THE FOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla. , Calif., Australia)   (The Science Times)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The typical saltwater fish's childhood is something of a lost
time, at least for scientists trying to study it. Not much is known
about what happens during most fishes' larval stages, when they are
tiny and floating in the plankton in the swirling waters. That has
led to a great question in marine ecology: are fish populations
open, with young fish shuttling in and out across great distances,
or closed, with juveniles largely settling back where they were
born?
</P>
<P>
   Now, research offers the first solid evidence that larvae can,
and do, go home again, that a population of fish retains a lot of
its offspring. The findings have great implications for managing
ocean fish stocks and developing marine reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the results are incredibly surprising,'' said Stephen
Swearer, a researcher at the University of California at Santa
Barbara and the lead author of a study of reef fish on the
Caribbean island of St. Croix. ``The paradigm was that marine
populations were open. But it seemed to me more logical that this
is what larvae were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Croix study and a study of fish on the Great Barrier
Reef by scientists at James Cook University in Townsville,
Australia, shed light on what happens to the larvae during the
pelagic phase, when they are out in the plankton amid the currents.
It is like finding out what happens to a needle in a haystack swept
up in a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers in both studies made use of a tiny ear bone
found in fish larvae to help trace their whereabouts. The bone,
called the otolith, is no larger than a grain of sand and adds
layers of calcium carbonate as the larvae develop, like a daily
version of a tree ring.
</P>
<P>
   But the two groups' approaches were vastly different. The
Australian scientists used brute force, tagging some 10 million
damselfish embryos collected around one island by soaking them in a
tetracyline solution. Fifteen of 5,000 juvenile fish collected over
the ensuing weeks had the tetracycline marker, which shows up as a
fluorescent stain under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't seem like a lot,'' said Dr. Geoffrey Jones, the
Australian team's lead researcher. But since only a tiny fraction
of the embryos around the island were tagged _ less than 2 percent
by the researchers' estimate _ the numbers mean that 15 to 60
percent of juveniles may be returning to the island. ``It tends to
suggest that these larvae have some sort of mechanism for staying
in the same area,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Barbara team, by contrast, ``tried to let nature do
the tagging for us,'' Swearer said.
</P>
<P>
   Using extremely sensitive mass spectrometry techniques, he
analyzed otoliths of bluehead wrasse fish for trace-metal content.
Coastal waters tend to be rich in trace metals _ from erosion and
pollution, among other things _ while the open ocean tends to be
depleted of such elements. So the trace-metal content of an otolith
tells a tale something like a flight recorder, showing in what
waters the larvae developed.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Croix results showed that many of the fish spent their
time in coastal waters, meaning that the larvae were retained
locally and did not cross the open ocean from somewhere else. ``We
found that retention is much more prevalent,'' Swearer said.
</P>
<P>
   The two studies, published in the journal Nature, ``were
essentially the first empirical evidence that fish with pelagic
larvae come back to natal areas,'' said Dr. Robert R. Warner, a
professor at Santa Barbara who worked on the St. Croix research.
</P>
<P>
   Warner has formed a group to study the issue, particularly the
question of how a fish larva, often thought of as a passive lump,
accomplishes the feat of returning home.
</P>
<P>
   One scientist studying the behavior of fish larvae is Dr. Robert
K. Cowen, a biologist at the University of Miami. In a recent paper
in Science, he argued that after they develop swimming ability,
some larvae can adjust their depth, avoiding strong offshore
currents and drifting in deeper water headed toward shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small larvae aren't going to have much effect trying to swim
against a strong current,'' Cowen said. ``But by going 10, 20,
maybe 30 meters in the vertical, they can end up in a current going
in a different direction. It doesn't take much behavior of the
larvae to get in that onshore flow.''
</P>
<P>
   How do they know which direction is toward shore, toward where
they were spawned? Cowen said that sense of hearing might play a
role. ``Reefs are very noisy places, with waves, snapping shrimp
and bubbles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The larvae might also be able to smell the reef through the
water. ``They might have the ability to pick up relatively small
gradients in these cues to be capable of finding where they want to
go from some distance away,'' Cowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how larvae do it, the evidence that they are
retained locally may result in a rethinking of how to manage fish
stocks and design preserves, said Dr. James Bohnsack, a research
biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in South
Florida. In the past, a fish spawning area might have been thought
of as helping to populate areas far away. But if a spawning reef is
largely repopulating itself, there may be a need for more
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bohnsack said, the new research is already being used
to formulate a fish conservation plan for the Tortugas area west of
the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to take the science and apply it to practical
problems,'' Bohnsack said. ``Now we understand a little bit more
about it, so hopefully we can do a little bit more about it.''

SORTING OUT DELUSIONS IN THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By ANNA FELS, M.D.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I spotted my new patient in the psychiatry ward
in the small hours of the morning, she was in the custody of two
police officers and was naked except for a toga made of brightly
flowered sheets.
</P>
<P>
   I instantly knew the diagnosis. When the patient informed me
irritably that she was a famous European artist, I thought to
myself, ``Right, and I'm Georgia O'Keeffe doing my night job.'' I
completed a perfunctory history and physical, gave the orders for
medication, and wrote up my summary: mania characterized by
delusions of grandiosity, impaired judgment, sleeplessness,
irritability. Then I went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, I found my new patient angrily snapping
photos with a disposable camera given to her by the occupational
therapist. She was clicking away at us through the glass partition
of the nurses' station and shouting at us to call her agent. The
head nurse rolled her eyes as we proceeded with morning rounds.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 a.m., however, the daily routine came to a grinding halt.
The phone lines in the nurses' station all lit up simultaneously
and my beeper went into its equivalent of intractable seizure
activity. An ambassador, two lawyers (one on each side of the
Atlantic), the agent and a non-English-speaking psychiatrist all
urgently needed to talk to me, the admitting psychiatrist, about
the care of the new patient.
</P>
<P>
   It quickly emerged that the patient was, in fact, a famous
artist. Her ``grandiose'' version of her life was correct and my
scribbled version of her story had been, in part, wrong. She was
manic and in need of hospitalization and medication. She was not,
however, psychotic and delusional.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it was an early lesson in a complex but pervasive
problem in psychiatry. It can be frustrating and, at times, nigh
impossible, to sort out where ``reality'' lies in the no man's land
between the patient's preconceptions and distortions of reality and
those of the therapist. In the strange, delicate, dyadic
relationship between patient and therapist, the events of the
outside world can become surprisingly elusive.
</P>
<P>
   In some contexts, distortions are an inevitable and even
productive part of the therapeutic process. There are areas of
insight-oriented therapy, for example, where exact historical truth
is neither attainable nor necessary. It has become widely accepted
by psychotherapists that a patient's narrative of her past is
constructed in the present and therefore necessarily influenced by
it. The remembered past is in constant flux.
</P>
<P>
   In many situations, however, an accurate assessment of the
patient's life is crucial for both diagnosis and treatment. With
the manic artist, outside sources of information were all too
abundant. By the end of her first day in the ward, the place was a
circus. The horde of visitors had supplied us with ample
information about her life.
</P>
<P>
   But with many patients such crucial data are in short supply.
The situation is particularly perilous for the therapist when
information is not just distorted, but omitted. Patients may
consciously wish to deny or hide aspects of their lives. More
commonly, they simply do not see the elided area as important or
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most common and worrisome omission in psychotherapy
is information about alcohol abuse. I learned this the hard way
when I first began my practice. An internist called to ask me how I
was handling the severe alcohol abuse of the patient he had
referred to me. Three months into therapy, the patient was happily
exploring memories of her narcissistic father, and I had no notion
that he was an alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   For the patient as well as for the therapist, bringing outside
sources of information into the therapeutic dialogue can add useful
new vantage points and can often overturn prior assumptions and
beliefs. It can be information from family members or physicians;
it can be patients' year-end work evaluations, or even their old
report cards.
</P>
<P>
   After the artist was discharged, she provided the hospital staff
with just such a new, outside vantage, but it was one from which to
view our own therapeutic world. She sent a photo to hang in the
ward.
</P>
<P>
   The image is one that I often recall when I am forcibly brought
up against the limits of psychotherapy. In the picture, the ward
staff sits huddled over a table surrounded by the plexiglass bubble
of the nurse's station. A pale reflection of the patient stares
back from the surface of the glass.

SOME PROBLEMS WITH ROCKER'S APOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The comments I made over six months ago offended many people
... I sincerely apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   _ John Rocker
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker's latest apology earned rave reviews from teammates
and some of the sports media _ if not from New York baseball fans _
but there were two problems with it.
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 1: The apology, which Rocker wrote in advance and
read to the media before Thursday's game between his Atlanta Braves
and the New York Mets, did not erase the impression that what he's
really sorry about is all the heat he's been taking.
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 2: He failed to apologize for intimidating and
threatening the sportswriter who first reported the demeaning
comments about New Yorkers that got Rocker into so much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Not being a Rocker fan _ you might even call me a Rocker
detractor _ I could be shortchanging the guy, of course. I could be
reading something between the lines that just isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the complete text of Rocker's statement, courtesy of
The Associated Press. Judge for yourself:
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I would like to say that I am happy to be back
in New York, believe it or not. I've been involved in some great
games and always seem to pitch well here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the situation has continued to escalate about
my presumed hatred for the people of New York. The comments I made
over six months ago offended many people. I am fully aware of this,
and for that I sincerely apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation, however, has become a distraction to many of
my teammates. Unfortunately, many members of the media have
overestimated my significance. I am merely a baseball player, guys,
and in the great scheme of things, my thoughts, opinions and
attitudes are of little importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, attempts have been made to make this situation
bigger than the game itself, and in every realm of sports, nothing
is bigger than the game. Not the players who play it, not the fans
who watch it and not the people who write about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, these circumstances have overshadowed a great year
being had by the Atlanta Braves as well as many of its players.
There is an exciting season going on, and it's time that that
received the media's full attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have apologized and have felt badly for anyone who took my
comments personally. My comments weren't made with intentions of
malice. However, many people perceived these comments to be
malicious, and for this, I apologize once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also feel that the people of New York as well as the media
have misjudged me. I am not the evil person that has been
portrayed. And when given the opportunity, many people who actually
know me have spoken out strongly on my behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also am fully aware that the overwhelming majority of the
people in this city are extremely charismatic and full of
personality, although a bit spirited at times, but, you know, that
doesn't make them bad people. I have always been completely aware
of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I will put this situation behind me. So please, allow the
fans, the Atlanta Braves, major league baseball and the city of New
York to move ahead. I think we would all appreciate that. From here
forward, I will discuss nothing but baseball. I would appreciate if
you all respect that request and asked nothing but baseball
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's teammates seemed pleased with his comments. The AP's
Ronald Blum quoted two fellow Braves:
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Chipper Jones: ``It was a lot better than the one
in spring training. It sounded like it came more from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher John Burkett: ``It sounded like he was sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Met fans were less pleased, according to news reports. When
Rocker's videotaped apology was played on the giant TV screen at
New York's Shea Stadium, the remarks were greeted with boos. When
Rocker entered the game in the eighth inning, he was greeted with
boos and flying objects.
</P>
<P>
   The love affair between Rocker and New York continues.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what anybody thinks of him, the Atlanta relief pitcher
is right about one thing. It's time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   But Rocker has to do his part. He has to shut up.

AFTER A LIFE IN THE SHADOWS, A BIRD GAINS STATUS AS A SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo., Ore.)   (The Science Times)  
 By JON LUOMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a new image suddenly materializing on a tapestry, a new
species of bird has emerged from research in the sagebrush
ecosystem of western Colorado and eastern Utah, according to
scientists working there.
</P>
<P>
   The bird, the Gunnison sage grouse, named for the area of
Colorado where it was discovered, has been in plain view all along
_ seen, hunted as a game bird and, most spectacularly, heard at
sunrise every spring as part of one of the avian world's oddest
courtship rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The Gunnison sage grouse had long been assumed to be the same
species as the related northern sage grouse, even though the two
differ starkly in size, appearance, behavior, and now, it turns
out, DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery is rare news in the world of avian taxonomy. This
appears to be the first instance in decades that a wholly new
species of bird has been described in the continental United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Banks, an ornithologist with the Biological
Resources Division of the U.G. Survey, said, ``People find new
species from time to time in South America, for example, on an
isolated mountaintop no one's been to before. But reporting a new
species in the U.S. is extremely unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks, who manages the official catalog of bird species for the
American Ornithological Union, said that no such event had occurred
in his career, and might well reach back to the end of the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   It is no small matter for bird-watchers seeking to add new
species to lists of species viewed. A few of the most savvy have
already begun pilgrimages to Colorado's Gunnison Basin in hope of
being among the first to add a new species to their life lists.
That trickle could turn into a flood after the bird is officially
listed as a new species by the American Ornithological Union in its
journal, The Auk, later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word has only barely gotten out,'' Banks said. ``It really
hasn't been publicized very much in public or in the popular
journals that get to the bird-watchers _ that will happen in very
short order, and people will be going en masse to add the bird to
their lists.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager bird-watchers may not want to wait too long. Even before
its status as a new species becomes official, scientists studying
the species say it has suffered sharp declines in this century, and
some environmentalists are already calling for the Gunnison sage
grouse to be listed as an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Taxonomists acknowledge that the very process of deciding when a
form constitutes a separate species can sometimes be a judgment
call. In the past, physically distinct but closely related forms
have either been ``lumped'' into one species, with each form
classified as a subspecies, or ``split'' into two species.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific committee of the American Ornithological Union
performs such hairsplitting based not only on differences in
physical appearance, but on evidence of free interbreeding between
two groups. Two groups that are not freely interbreeding are
presumed to be on separate evolutionary paths.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the Gunnison sage grouse was never even considered a
subspecies of the more widely distributing northern sage grouse.
There now appears to be little room for doubt that it is, in fact,
a wholly distinct species. The creature not only does not
interbreed with the northern sage grouse, the two are so strikingly
different in both appearance and behavior that it seems almost a
wonder that they could have ever been considered birds of the same
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, even more definitive evidence piled up, when detailed
studies of the two groups' DNA showed that they were far too
distantly related to be considered the same species. The findings
were reported by Dr. Tom Quinn and Dr. Sara Oyler-McCance of Denver
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the strongest cases that's ever been,'' says Dr.
Jessica Young, a biologist at Colorado's Western State College,
whose studies have been crucial to defining the species.
</P>
<P>
   Both the more common northern sage grouse and the Gunnison
species indulge in one of the animal world's most peculiar mating
routines. Male sage grouse are equipped with air sacs on their
breasts, which they use in the early predawn hours each spring,
making a racket as they congregate in large groups, called leks, or
strutting grounds. Their mating call, audible a mile or more away,
has been compared to the sound of bubbles, or gulps, underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the most dominant and aggressive males position
themselves in the center of the lek, fending off all pretenders to
this throne. One by one, females visit the lek, choosing a mate
based, as nearly as biologists can tell, on the quality of his
bubbly noise-making and vigor and quality of a rapid head-shaking,
strutting dance that accompanies it. The winner, almost always,
turns out to be one of the most dominant males at the center of the
lek, with one or two males often fathering almost all of the chicks
born in a given year.
</P>
<P>
   It was sound from the strutting grounds that provided some of
the first strong hints that the two groups might in fact be
separate species. As an undergraduate at the University of
California at San Diego in the 1980s, Young had found herself
listening to and trying to analyze hundreds of tapes of northern
sage grouse as part of a biology project. When some new tapes of
sage grouse arrived from the Gunnison Basin, Young was startled at
the differences in vocal patterns. While northern sage grouse
consistently pop their air sacs twice in each of the many brief
strut displays they perform, the Gunnison birds pop their air sacs
nine times, and the sounds they produced are notably deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Young said that once she heard the tapes, she rounded up video
and audio recorders, a mini-van, a portable bird blind, and her
mother, who drove with her directly to Colorado to make more
recordings. That outing turned into a career.
</P>
<P>
   Young continued to specialize in studies of the Gunnison grouse
while receiving a doctorate at Purdue and, later, after being named
to the faculty at Western State, which is in Gunnison.
</P>
<P>
   Her chief collaborator, Dr. Clait Braun, recently retired as
avian research program manager for Colorado Division of Wildlife,
says he began to suspect that the Gunnison grouse were a separate
subspecies, but not a full species, as early as the late 1970s,
when his surveys of sage grouse wings turned in by hunters proved
that grouse in the Gunnison Basin were remarkably smaller than sage
grouse shot elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But Braun says he was ``too conservative'' to come to the
extraordinary conclusion that the Gunnison grouse was a separate
species. He says Young, in time, simply compiled too much evidence,
including ``exquisite behavioral findings,'' to conclude otherwise.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Physically, aside from the differences in size, the Gunnison
grouse have different coloration and patterns in their feathers,
including white bands on their tail feathers. Beyond the
differences in vocal performances, the Gunnison males perform a
different sort of strut, tossing their elaborate neck feathers, or
filoplume, over their heads like pony tails, and wagging their tail
feathers at the end of the display. When Young tried to play
Gunnison grouse sounds in the territories of northern sage grouse,
the northern females actively shunned the area, repelled. The same
occurred when she tried to romance Gunnison females with the sounds
of northern sage grouse males.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really made the case that under all the concepts of what
makes a species, these birds were really different,'' Braun said.
``Her case eventually became overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two researchers also found that the species they had
just discovered was in serious peril. ``At the same time we
realized we had a distinct species, we also realized we had fewer
than 5,000 of them left,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the bird's survival problems preceded even its formal
designation as a species. In January, American Lands, an
environmental group in Portland, Ore., petitioned the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service for an emergency listing of the Gunnison
sage grouse as an endangered species, and that agency has begun a
review of the petition.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Randy Webb, a consulting biologist and lawyer in Eugene,
Ore., who prepared the petition for the environmental group, said
he was shocked at the state of sage grouse in general when the
group first asked him to look at the bird's status. Webb said
historical accounts suggested that across the great sweep of the
arid intermountain West, sage grouse were once extremely abundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are stories about them blackening the skies,'' he said.
``Of kids going out with a stick to round up grouse for dinner, and
of market hunters loading them up by the wagonload. This is a
species that in its ecosystem used to be an ecological dominant,
like buffalo or salmon.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb estimates that numbers of the more abundant northern sage
grouse have decreased by 90 percent or more, from somewhere beyond
one million birds in the West to perhaps 100,000. But the status of
the Gunnison sage grouse, he said, ``is much, much worse.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: GOOD PLANNING MAKES FOR GREAT HIKING
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ariz., Md.) By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last February, a friend and I (both 60-ish women who walk about
3 miles every morning) flew to Tucson, Ariz., for a week of hiking.
We went prepared with sunscreen, sun-blocking shirts and hats,
several water bottles each and a first-aid kit in our backpacks,
plus an ample supply of ibuprofen just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning before heading for the hills we filled sealable
plastic bags with orange and grapefruit sections for rest-stop
refreshment. After a substantial breakfast of cereal and fruit and
a vigorous morning hike of about four hours, a light lunch of soup
or salad sufficed. A late afternoon swim helped to relax tense
muscles and prepare us for dinners that were replete with
vegetables complemented by chicken or seafood and hearty bread.
</P>
<P>
   Several things amazed me. First, my ability to get to the end of
what seemed like endless uphill trails, and then down again.
Second, the lack of aches and pains either during the hikes or
after them. Third, the fact that I came home about 4 pounds
lighter, despite having eaten out two meals a day for a week. My
parting words to my friend were, ``When are we going to do this
again?''
</P>
<P>
   Hiking is more than a wonderful sport, it's an uplifting
experience. The desert scenery, wildlife and vegetation enhanced
the exhilaration of accomplishment. We encountered many hikers
younger and older (including a few with babies on their backs)
trekking up and down the Tucson hills, each at his or her own pace,
all having a grand time.
</P>
<P>
   But you rarely have to go so far from home to reap the joy and
health benefits of a hike. Wherever you happen to live, there is
probably an ideal place for a day hike within an hour's drive of
home. The American Hiking Society maintains a nationwide list of
hiking clubs; most have local trail maps and operate organized
guided hikes. For more information, visit the society's Web site at
www.americanhiking.org or contact the society at 1422 Fenwick Lane,
Silver Spring, Md. 20910, (301) 565-6704.
</P>
<P>
   As with any physical activity, the secret to a pleasurable hike
is to know how to accomplish it free of injury and illness. But
because accidents and upsets can happen even to the most
accomplished hiker, the wise trekker is prepared. Dr. Albert P.
Rosen of New Jersey, who for years has been writing a health column
for the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference newsletter, has
compiled much useful information in a book, ``Health Hints for
Hikers,'' published in 1994 by the New York-New Jersey Trail
Conference. The $5.95 volume (plus 80 cents for shipping and
handling) is available at 232 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016
or on its Web site, www.nynjtc.org.
</P>
<P>
   Before you go hiking, check local maps (including changes in
elevation) and select a trail appropriate to your age and ability.
If you are not used to long walks or hills, start with something
relatively flat at an altitude of no more than 5,000 feet and only
a few miles long. Save longer, higher climbs for later, when you're
in better shape.
</P>
<P>
   Buy or prepare a first-aid kit that is compact and waterproof.
Rosen says it should contain adhesive tape, sterile gauze pads,
alcohol preps, clear tape (Dermiclear or Transpore), bandages,
Telfa sterile pads, antihistamines, aspirin or acetaminophen or
ibuprofen, safety pins and Moleskin or Molefoam. Optional items
include a triangular bandage or large bandanna that could be used
as a sling, an Ace bandage, Second Skin, duct tape and tweezers
(for removing ticks and splinters).
</P>
<P>
   Take along _ and use _ plenty of sunscreen and insect repellent
(30 percent DEET is adequate for mosquitoes, gnats and ticks). If
anyone in the group is allergic to insect stings, a preloaded
syringe of adrenaline should always be handy.
</P>
<P>
   If you expect to become a regular hiker, you'd be wise to take
an American Red Cross first-aid course that includes instruction in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   Don't underestimate the amount of water you'll need. Dehydration
is the curse of endurance activities. It impairs performance and
can be very dangerous. It is best to carry in purified water, at
least two cups for every hour of activity. If that is not possible,
bring some method of water purification (do not drink straight from
a stream, no matter how pristine it may look) and know how to use
it properly.
</P>
<P>
   Wear ankle-high hiking boots _ not sneakers _ and break them in
before you take them trekking. A seasoned hiker warned me years ago
about ankle protection. She always wore boots, except one time, the
time she broke her ankle. Be sure your boots are long enough to
keep your toes from jamming as you go downhill. Tighten the laces
and stand on a downhill slant; if your toes slide into the tip of
the boot, you can permanently damage the nail bed, not to mention
the crippling pain of an injured toe.
</P>
<P>
   Check on expected climate conditions _ mountaintops can be
frigid, even in mid-summer _ as well as the local weather report.
Even in Tucson, I found that in the early morning I needed gloves
and ear covers. Avoid cotton clothing if you expect cold
temperatures. Wool or polyproylene fabrics are better at retaining
insulating properties when wet. Your backpack should be big enough
to allow you to shed and stow extra clothing. And don't forget a
brimmed hat to protect you from sun and heat. Heat exhaustion and
heat stroke (a life-threatening condition) are common in summer and
quickly can become medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Falls and accompanying injuries are possible even for the most
careful hiker. A walking stick (Europeans often use an umbrella,
not a bad idea if rain is a possibility.) can help hikers of any
age remain upright. Don't walk on ice without crampons. Avoid
stepping on mossy areas, wet leaves and wet rocks, and step over
logs, not on them.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a heart condition or a breathing disorder, you'd be
wise to limit your hikes to relatively low altitudes, say, below
5,000 feet, unless you can allow time to get acclimated to higher
altitudes before you start hiking. Be sure to stretch your leg
muscles before and especially after your hike to reduce the risk of
leg cramps.
</P>
<P>
   If you have allergies, a nonsedating antihistamine (available
only by prescription) is a good preventive. If you use an
over-the-counter antihistamine that can cause drowsiness, let
someone else drive to your destination.
</P>
<P>
   Tick protection is a common problem in many areas of the
country, and not just to prevent Lyme disease. Ticks also carry
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, borrelia
and other illnesses. Many experts advise wearing long sleeves and
long pants that are tucked into socks, then spraying the clothing
with DEET, which offers protection for days.
</P>
<P>
   Others who find hiking in long clothes very uncomfortable spray
their skin; protection lasts for 6 to 8 hours. Even with DEET,
however, it is critical to shower and rub your skin with a cloth
soon after your hike, and inspect your skin (better yet, have
someone else inspect it) for any sign of ticks, which should be
promptly removed with a tweezer.

MUZZLING KID ROCK AND OTHER AMUSING MUSICAL NOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thoughts, observations and blips on the pop-music radar:
</P>
<P>
   Am I the only one who thinks Kid Rock needs a muzzle? In a
recent Rolling Stone cover story, the Kid notes that he's in a
custody battle for his son Junior with the child's mother, and then
admits to using and selling crack (it's not as bad as most people
think, he says) and dabbling in heroin. Duh. Like that won't be
brought up in court.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Though I admire Sinead O'Connor, she hasn't scored any points
for a) her man-bashing on ``No Man's Woman'' but b) reversing her
field and saying that she actually ``loves blokes'' and doesn't
mean ``man'' in the sense of, you know, ``men.'' Yeah, right,
Sinead, guys are the only ones who make their partners miserable in
relationships. You just keep telling yourself that.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Odd _ and sad _ to see just how little attention was paid to the
death of Johnnie Taylor on May 31. The news of Tito Puente's death
the same day certainly played a part, but that still doesn't
explain how few obituaries and appreciations were on the national
wires that day.
</P>
<P>
   Tito, of course, deserves all the attention and accolades he
got, but Taylor's legacy as one of the great soul men was
definitely given short shrift. If you're interested in learning
more about him, the first place to stop is ``Chronicle _ The 20
Greatest Hits,'' a solid compilation of the many hits he cut for
Stax. Then go back and pick up 1967's ``Wanted: One Soul Singer.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   To combat bootleggers, Pearl Jam is recording all 26 of its
summer European shows and will release each as a double CD. The CDs
will be available no later than August at www.pearljam.com and
released in stores later.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Could someone please tell rappers that the old
wave-your-hands-in-the-air-like-you-just-don't-care shtick is over?
And has been for years? Kool Keith and his buddies tried this when
they opened for the Foo Fighters and the Red Hot Chili Peppers a
couple weeks ago, followed by basically every group on the bill,
from Jay-Z on down, doing the same at Summer Jam a couple weeks
back.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The rapid descents down the charts of the latest CDs by No Doubt
and En Vogue are no surprise. It's amazing that bands can't figure
this out: In an era when that Warholian 15 minutes of fame has been
cut to 10, taking three or four years between CDs is virtual career
suicide. Even when it's actually a good CD, as ``Return to Saturn''
and ``Masterpiece Theatre'' both are. In two years, Gwennie and her
band will be playing Deep Ellum Live in Dallas, which is where they
should have been all along.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Onetime Public Image Ltd. and Ministry drummer Martin Atkins has
formed an industrial supergroup with former or current members of
Ministry, Killing Joke and Pigface, according to the Pollstar Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   The Damage Manual also includes former Ministry vocalist Chris
Connelly, KJ guitarist Geordie Walker and former PiL bassist Jah
Wobble.
</P>
<P>
   The group will record a CD this summer and return with a tour
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Finally, good news for all fans of Irish music: Karan Casey,
former vocalist for premier Irish/American Celtic band Solas, has
just released ``Seal Maiden: A Celtic Musical,'' a retelling of the
classic Irish fable of a seal turning into a young girl. The CD is
out on the children's label Music for Little People, and it's
wonderful. Contributors read like a who's who of modern Irish
music: Martin Hayes, Dennis Cahill, Iarla O' Lionaird (Afro Celt
Sound System), Niall Vallely (Nomos) and Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh of
Altan.

 &HT;    Investors shake up the market value rankings
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Investors vote for and against companies by buying or
selling their shares, making market value _ share price times
shares outstanding _ the chief barometer of the public's perception
of a company's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how those perceptions have changed for a pair of
heavyweight in the latest - July 10 - Business Week ranking of
global corporate giants.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which topped the list of 100 biggest companies in
1999, dropped to fourth place this year after taking a drubbing in
a federal antitrust lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, whose troubles led to a top-level
management turnover, fell to 26th place this year from 11th a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Atlanta-based companies also moved in the rankings.
Home improvement retailer Home Depot moved up to 34th from 41st,
while BellSouth, the phone company, dropped to 49th from 36th.
</P>
<P>
   No home field advantage
</P>
<P>
   Corporations may get ego satisfaction by putting their names on
sports stadiums and arenas, but it can be hazardous to their stock,
says the July 3 Barron's. A notable exception is Philips, as in
Atlanta's Philips Arena, whose shareholders have done well.
</P>
<P>
   But the shares of 17 of the 47 firms that have slapped their
names on sports facilities in recent years have declined since the
openings. The worst showing was by Fruit of the Loom, whose Pro
Player sports apparel division paid to put its name on the home
field of the Miami Dolphins and the Florida Marlins. Fruit of the
Loom's stock plunged 99 percent and the company filed for
bankruptcy, Barron's notes.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco and Staples have also declined since the opening of
Conseco Fieldhouse, home of the Indiana Pacers, and Staples Arena,
home court of the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But Qualcomm, which put its name to Jack Murphy stadium in San
Diego in 1997, has seen its shares rise more than ninefold.
</P>
<P>
   In second place among winners is Philips Arena, home of the
Atlanta Hawks basketball and Thrashers hockey teams. Shares of the
Royal Philips Electronics have posted an annualized return of 98.6
percent since the Netherlands company bought naming rights last
year from Turner Broadcasting System, a Time Warner subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring (July) says April's technology sell-off shook the
venture capital industry ``to its foundations,'' but that it may be
a good thing by forcing lenders and investors back to basics.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune (July 17) says the federal court ruling to cut Microsoft
in half hasn't stopped the software giant from launching a daring
bid ``to rekindle growth by reinventing the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Playboy was one of the first magazines to grasp the Internet's
impact, going on the Web in 1994. But that has been a money-losing
venture, says eCompany Now (July), which is why Playboy Enterprises
expects to spin off 15 percent to 20 percent of Playboy.com as a
public company. Christie Hefner, daughter of founder Hugh Hefner,
anticipates $50 million in new working capital.

ANALYZING PROTEINS WITH X-RAYS, CRYSTALS AND SOME LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Protein shapes are usually determined by X-ray crystallography,
a process that in some ways resembles a CAT scan. An X-ray is taken
from multiple angles and a computer uses that data to calculate a
three-dimensional image.
</P>
<P>
   However, the process has several steps and each one could fail.
First the protein must be isolated and purified. This has been made
easier in recent years by gene sequencing and genetic engineering.
The gene for the protein can be spliced into bacteria, yeast or
other cells, which then make large quantities of the protein.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to form a crystal, in which molecules of the
protein are arranged in an orderly lattice. To do this, the protein
is dissolved in a solvent and then coaxed into precipitating into a
crystal. This is still something of a black art, and scientists try
numerous solvents, temperatures and other conditions in hopes of
achieving the desired result.
</P>
<P>
   The crystal is then X-rayed. Some of the X-rays are diffracted _
bent _ as they interact with electrons on their way through the
crystal. By analyzing the diffraction pattern using software,
scientists can make a map of the electron density in the crystal.
From that, the shape of the protein can be deduced using programs
that display the structure on a computer screen as a mass of
squiggly lines, ribbons and little balls. The shapes can be viewed
on the screen in three-dimensions using special glasses.
</P>
<P>
   A decade or two ago, analyzing one protein could take years.
Different versions of the crystal had to be made for comparison,
each with a different heavy metal in the lattice to provide
reference points.
</P>
<P>
   But new X-ray sources known as synchrotrons have reduced data
collection time to a few days or even less than a day.
</P>
<P>
   Synchrotrons, like the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne
National Laboratory near Chicago, create X-rays by using powerful
magnets to bend an electron beam around a circular track. These
synchroton operations, some the size of football fields, are to
conventional X-ray machines what a laser is to a flashlight. Their
beams are more powerful and focused. Also, the wavelength of
synchrotron X-rays can be changed. Using multiple wavelengths, a
technique pioneered by Wayne A. Hendrickson at Columbia University,
provides extra data that takes the place of the crystals with
different heavy metals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advances, it still takes weeks to go from a gene
sequence to a three-dimensional protein structure. So doing
thousands of structures a year, the goal of structural genomics,
will require large-scale automation. Instead of trying one thing
after another to grow a suitable a crystal, thousands of attempts
will be made in parallel, in hopes that a few completed structures
will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   At Syrrx, a structural genomics company, a robot places a tiny
drop of protein into 480 wells, each containing a different
chemical combination. The machine can do 11,000 crystallization
experiments in 24 hours. A new robot under development will be able
to do 130,000 a day, with a computer vision system checking one
million wells a day in search of the elusive crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Another technique, nuclear magnetic resonance, can determine
structures of proteins in solution, without the need for crystals.
But that technique, similar to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
used in medicine, works for only relatively small proteins. Japan
is beginning a big project that will use magnetic resonance to
determine protein structures.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Green Party candidate Ralph Nader is mounting a
serious presidential campaign that political observers say may
divert critical support from Vice President Al Gore and possibly
throw the November general election to Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Without the votes to win, Nader could play the role of spoiler,
a role he is quick to reject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view myself as a spoiler, but as a reformer,'' Nader
told a breakfast gathering of newspaper reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   The spoiler scenario has been a recurring theme during the 2000
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, who failed to generate much support with
Republicans, switched to the Reform Party, taking along some ardent
social conservatives and threatening to siphon votes away from
Bush, the Republican presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., emerged in New Hampshire as a serious
threat to Bush in the primaries. After his hard-charging campaign
against Bush fell short, McCain rejected numerous invitations to
mount a third-party challenge that could have undermined Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Now the focus is on Nader, 66, a consumer activist whose rise is
supported by an eclectic following of environmentalists, unions and
the politically disaffected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest surprise of the year has not been McCain's
showing, it's been Nader,'' said Larry Sabato, a University of
Virginia professor and an expert on campaigns and elections.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans blame Ross Perot's surprisingly strong independent
bid for the presidency in 1992 for drawing some Republican and
independent voters away from President George Bush in 1992, handing
the election to Bill Clinton, who himself won with less than 50
percent of the vote. At this point in the 2000 election, it appears
that Nader poses a bigger threat to siphoning liberal Democrats and
labor unionists away from Gore than Buchanan does drawing
arch-conservatives from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year, we thought Buchanan might grab
the presidency from George Bush. Now at midyear, it's looking like
Nader might grab the presidency from Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what it will look like in November, but Nader
is doing well enough that the Gore people have to be concerned,''
Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent national opinion polls show Nader favored by 6 percent of
those surveyed, well ahead of Buchanan at 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokesman downplayed the Nader threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This November, people who are serious about protecting the
environment, and want someone to fight for them, know the smart
vote is for Al Gore,'' said spokesman Jano Cabrera at the Gore
campaign headquarters in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, third-party candidates who rise in popularity
emerge in times when voters feel alienated by the major parties,
the candidates or the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, the Dallas billionaire, drew support from people who said
President Bush was complacent but who also lacked interest in
Clinton, the moderate Democratic governor from Arkansas. Perot won
19 percent of the vote with his straight talk about the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The same political dynamic is in place now, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people who are most alienated who will vote for
Nader,'' said Richard Winger, editor of Ballot Access News in San
Francisco, a nonpartisan newspaper that tracks election results for
minor political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people respond to an honest person, and Nader seems
honest,'' Winger said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader is best known for having taken on corporate powers and
championing such causes as auto safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I combine opportunity with alienation. There's a lot of
alienation around the country. The two parties are rapidly
converging, with the big corporation running the show,'' Nader
said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls also show that some of Nader's support comes from a lack
of interest in the major party presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Nader called Gore a ``gee-whiz, techno twit,'' a hypocrite and a
``plastic person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great environmental impostor,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, according to Nader, is ``beyond satire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His motto is: If polluters give to my campaign, they can
regulate themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Worthey, a San Antonio landscaper, said the public's blase
attitude toward the ``status-quo'' candidates has spurred interest
in Nader's presidential campaign and the fledgling Green Party in
that South Texas city.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are attracted to Nader for the same reason
they were attracted to John McCain,'' explained Worthey, 53.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see Nader as someone who has integrity. He is not bought
and paid for. A lot of people are concerned that people in politics
are owned by big money.''
</P>
<P>
   Worthey, like a other Green Party members, voted as a Democrat
in recent elections. He voted for Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Nader received 1 percent of the vote in 1996 as a Green Party
candidate. In Texas, he was a write-in candidate.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Nader will spend $5 million to get on the ballot in
Texas and 47 other states.
</P>
<P>
   To boost his candidacy, Nader has received donations from
celebrities such as singers Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt, actors
Paul Newman and Warren Beatty, and ice cream purveyors Ben Cohen
and Jerry Greenfield of Ben and Jerry's Homemade, Federal Election
Commission records show.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hightower, a radio personality and former Texas agriculture
commissioner, has signed up to ramrod the Green Party presidential
campaign in Texas. In a television interview, Hightower said Nader
is generating a buzz ``hotter than high-school love.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nader wins 5 percent of the vote in November, the Green Party
will receive federal funding for the 2004 election. The Reform
Party will receive $12 million in federal funds this year for its
presidential nominee, based on Perot's 8 percent showing in the
1996 general election.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Green Party officials say Nader needs to be included in the
presidential debates this fall to build on his support and poll
numbers, but the candidate faces a Catch-22.
</P>
<P>
   According to the rules established by the Commission on
Presidential Debates, a candidate must have a 15-percent standing
in the polls to be included in the televised presidential forum.
</P>
<P>
   To force his way in, Nader has sued to block corporate
sponsorship of presidential debates that exclude minor political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and the Libertarian Party also have sued to be included
in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Green Party officials believe exposure from the debates could
create a groundswell of support that would move him far past other
minor party candidates and make him a serious contender for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's rise as a potential challenger is bolstered by
Buchanan's recent decline, some say.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering questions about whether Perot will mount a third
campaign continue to overshadow Buchanan. The Reform Party
presidential nomination will be determined in August.
</P>
<P>
   In his third presidential campaign, Buchanan has failed to rally
supporters in the Reform Party as he did as a Republican candidate
in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sick of him,'' Sabato said. ``They view him as
offensive and his newly adopted party is falling apart.''
</P>
<P>
   With Buchanan's star diminishing, the disenchanted are looking
at Nader. Many of the disenchanted in the 2000 election are
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of old liberal Democrats who are tired of the
Clinton-Gore new Democrats,'' Sabato suggested. ``They hate welfare
reform. They don't support the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, a Bush spokeswoman, said Nader's rise in the polls
coincides with Gore's failure to unite the various factions within
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has some serious problems within his base,'' Hughes
said. ``According to the polling, some members of what would be
considered the Democratic Party are not happy with Al Gore as a
candidate and are looking towards Ralph Nader as an alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign is trying to distract away from the real
choice in November, and that is between Gore and Bush,'' Cabrera
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between those two candidates is night and
day,'' Cabrera continued, saying that Gore is trying to protect the
environment, while ``Bush has numerous slick ties to big oil
interests.''

   CHEROKEE
</P>
<P>
   Agency closes on land
</P>
<P>
   for research park
</P>
<P>
   The Cherokee County Development Authority has closed on the
purchase of 629 acres that will become a high-tech research park,
said Kevin Johns, vice president of the development authority.
</P>
<P>
   Canton Textile Mills sold the land. The development authority
purchased the land with funding from Cherokee County. The county
backed $6.5 million in bonds. The land is located on Canton's
northern edge, north of the RiverStone mall, and runs parallel to
I-575.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the land is the 300-acre Hickory Log Creek Reservoir,
being constructed by the city of Canton and the Cobb County Water
Authority. Technology Park Atlanta is to develop the park, which is
expected to bring 15,000 jobs to the county in the next two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   FAYETTE
</P>
<P>
   Developer seeks
</P>
<P>
   annexation of tract
</P>
<P>
   Developer Bob Rolader is requesting that his proposed 454-lot
Deer Pointe subdivision be annexed into the city of Fayetteville so
the houses can hook up to the city's sewer system.
</P>
<P>
   The property is now located just west of the city limits, south
of Lester Road. If the area is annexed, Rolader is offering 215
acres of the 610-acre tract to the city to be used as a park, as
well as access to several small lakes as a water source. If the
annexation is denied, Rolader has stated that he will develop the
tract, make lot sizes smaller and run the subdivision on septic
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The request will be discussed July 11 at a Fayetteville Planning
and Zoning Commission meeting. City officials have declined to
comment until they review of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   FULTON
</P>
<P>
   New office building
</P>
<P>
   at McGinnis Park
</P>
<P>
   Trammell Crow Co. and Triad Properties Corp. have started
construction on a second office building at their McGinnis Park
development in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   The four-story, 100,200-square-foot building will be completed
in January. Trammell Crow and Triad Properties began the building
after leasing 97 percent of the first building at McGinnis Park.
Tenants include Qwest Communications, Pilsner Urquel and Keebler
Foods Co. The master plan for McGinnis Park calls for three
buildings on 25 acres at Windward Concourse and McGinnis Ferry
Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Phases I and II were developed according to the
master plan of McGinnis Park, great flexibility exists in the
actual design and size of Phase III,'' said Penny Thompson, senior
associate at Trammell Crow.
</P>
<P>
   The final phase can accommodate the space requirements of a new
tenant or the expansion needs of a tenant in the first or second
building, she said.
</P>
<P>
   County to consider
</P>
<P>
   several projects
</P>
<P>
   The Fulton County Board of Commissioners will consider several
small-to-moderate-sized projects for the north Fulton area this
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the projects on the agenda will include a day care
center for 270 children, a 45-lot subdivision on Jones Bridge Road,
a 175-unit townhouse development on Morris Road and several other
small-to-medium housing projects. To see all the projects that were
considered by the county planning commission and will be heard on
Wednesday, go to www.fultonecd.org/zoning
</P>
<P>
   /current.htm and click on ``planning commission
recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   At the planning commission meeting June 20, several residents
turned out to ask that a seven-home subdivision proposal on Kimball
Bridge Road be reduced to six and its lots be bigger. When the
commission approved the seven-home plan, one of the angered
residents said ``they're on the take'' as he filed out. A couple of
board members glared angrily but said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   GWINNETT
</P>
<P>
   Multiuse project goes
</P>
<P>
   before Duluth council
</P>
<P>
   The final hurdle for a controversial multiuse development will
head before the Duluth City Council on July 10. Crossroads at
Gwinnett Place is an 80-acre development that combines office,
residential, retail and industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
   The project is estimated to spawn 2,500 jobs and $3 million in
taxes annually.
</P>
<P>
   Developer Steven Gaultney is attempting to move the project from
Gwinnett County into the city of Duluth _ a move that coincided
with a six-month county moratorium on new rezoning requests.
Gaultney said the moratorium wasn't the reason for this move.
Duluth has multipurpose permitting he desired for this project.
</P>
<P>
   The Duluth Planning Commission gave its approval to the project
last month. Many residents, though, are upset with the inclusion of
a road extension on the property _ North Berkeley Parkway _ which
they fear will increase traffic to nearby subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of 800 new apartments didn't sit well, either.
Gaultney and residents are discussing these concerns before the
final decision.

 &HT;    Peppier feel for Mazda's 626
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mazda claims to have made dozens of changes to its
family-oriented 626 sedan for the 2000 model year. The improvements
are striking, more so inside than outside.
</P>
<P>
   Revisions to the front and rear aren't so radical that the 626
stands out in a crowded parking lot. But start it up, and the
170-horsepower V-6 that comes with the LX and test ES versions is
quieter. Take it down the road and the ride, along with overall
driveability, is better.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Guide rates the 626 as a ``best buy,'' while Road &AMP;
Track notes that Mazda has addressed the characteristics that have
caused the enthusiast press to whip on the 626 for not being ``more
of a serious driver's car.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the 2.5-liter V-6 hardly turns the 626 into a performance
sedan, but couple it with the easy-shifting five-speed manual, and
the 3,000-pound sedan has good start-up acceleration. No need to
worry about the 626 leaping out from under you during routine
highway acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Prices start at $18,245 for the LX and $20,445 for the ES with
Mazda's 130-hp four-cylinder engine. The LX with V-6 is $19,445,
and the ES is $22,445. Basic equipment is reasonably good up and
down the line, with available options including side air bags and
traction control ($950), six-disc CD player ($225) and four-speed
automatic transmission ($800).
</P>
<P>
   One area in which the 626 distinguishes itself is interior
space. Mazda's design folks have made the 626 a compact car on the
outside (overall length is a modest 187.4 inches), but the cabin
has 97.1 cubic feet of room, with seating in the rear that's
generous enough for full-size adults.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches include the swinging center-dash vents that Mazda
has used for years, just enough chrome inside and out to give the
626 some character without making it garish, and stereo controls
that don't require technical expertise or awkward contortions to
reach and operate.
</P>
<P>
   The ease of operation extends to the major controls, with good
steering and brake feel for a car in the 626's class _ think
Passat, Galant, Alero and Altima. As other reviewers have pointed
out, the 626 is not an attention-grabber, but it does deserve a
second look by family-car shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Mazda 626 ES front-drive sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $24,070 (base: $22,445, plus $450 delivery)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 2.5-liter V-6 engine with 24 valves (170
horsepower), five-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, optional power anti-lock
brakes with traction control and dual front side air bags, $950;
side-impact beams; height-adjustable front shoulder belts
</P>
<P>
   Standard features include: leather-trimmed interior, CD/cassette
players, air conditioning, glass sunroof, power windows and locks,
keyless entry system, cruise control with steering-wheel-mounted
controls, height-adjustable power driver's seat
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: six-disc CD changer, $225
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 21 mpg premium unleaded city, 27 mpg highway

 &HT;    Tiny valve has big role in smog control
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dynamometer emission testing of older vehicles has been the
key in detecting the main contributor to ground-level ozone, oxides
of nitrogen, commonly referred to as NOx.
</P>
<P>
   This pollutant, produced when engine combustion temperatures
exceed 2,500 degrees, is spewed out of the tailpipe into the air.
When combined with hot, sunny conditions, it sets the stage for
ozone alert days.
</P>
<P>
   One MUMMI _ Miscellaneous Unscheduled Manufacturer's Maintenance
Item _ that has risen from obscurity to star status as a result of
this testing is the exhaust gas recirculation valve.
</P>
<P>
   EGR devices, which began making their appearances on engines in
the early 1970s, were developed for the sole purpose of controlling
NOx. They accomplished this task by cooling down the combustion
chamber during certain driving conditions.
</P>
<P>
   To understand how the EGR process works, you need to know two
basic concepts:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fuel is cool. This means when the proportion of fuel to air is
fuel-rich, the combustion chamber is naturally cooled. While this
would seem to solve the heat problem, there is a downside.
Fuel-rich mixtures produce a much more deadly pollutant than NOx,
carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of gasoline as high as it is, fuel-rich burning
means worse mileage and higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More air, more heat. Much like using a bellows on an open fire
to raise the temperature, the amount of oxygen pushed into the
intake manifold directly relates to the amount of heat produced
during combustion.
</P>
<P>
   The EGR valve does just what its name says. It opens a small
orifice between the engine's fresh air intake and exhaust
manifolds. When this passage is open, it permits a small amount of
exhaust gas to be recycled back into the intake manifold, where it
is mixed with the air and fuel entering the combustion chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Exhaust gas contains very little oxygen because it was used up
during the burning process. It displaces some of the oxygen in the
air/fuel mixture, allowing for a cooler burn inside the combustion
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   This accomplishes two things: It helps control oxides of
nitrogen, and it helps eliminate pinging, also the result of excess
or unplanned heat.
</P>
<P>
   The EGR valve is only effective during certain driving modes. It
should not be open when the engine idles or during acceleration.
Both of these conditions require a disproportionate cool-fuel
mixture, so EGR isn't needed anyway. If exhaust gas is allowed to
recirculate at these times, the lack of oxygen in the air/fuel
mixture will cause rough idle and driveability problems.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, during midrange cruising, the engine's need
for fuel decreases, and combustion chamber temperatures start to
climb. The EGR valve needs to be open.
</P>
<P>
   Externally, an EGR valve can appear to be working normally.
However, the hidden problem occurs between the exhaust and intake
orifices underneath the valve. Exhaust gases contain some carbon,
and over a period of time, the orifices and passages become plugged
with the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The only solution is to remove whatever is necessary for access
and clean out the carbon. Repairing this problem can range from
flushing the passages with a special cleaner to actually having to
burn the accumulation of crud out with a welding torch. Sometimes
the valve can be saved; sometimes it must be replaced.

 &HT;    Leasing still a valid option
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The juiciest deals may be gone, but millions of
Americans still choose to lease their new cars.
</P>
<P>
   Why would that many people want to make payments on a big-ticket
item, one they will use every day, when they know that they will
never own it?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is money. The upfront cost is usually cheaper, and
monthly payments can be a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot more for a little bit more money,'' said Chris
Consolmagno, a young Atlantan who sold his last car and leased a
Chevrolet S10 pickup truck. ``Besides, I like to have a new car
fairly often.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, leasing was even more attractive. ``Consumers
could get absolutely tremendous leasing deals,'' said David McKay,
a director in J.D. Power and Associates' analysis group.
</P>
<P>
   Ford popularized leasing, then many competitors rushed in.
``Then you got a flood of 2-year-old vehicles coming off lease,''
McKay recalled. Resale values were unexpectedly low, some lessors
took a bath, and leasing terms got less generous.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some consumers dropped out of the leasing market.
Some just didn't understand how the system worked, and some were
unhappy about lease-ending charges that they hadn't noticed before.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 4.4 million Americans leased a car or truck last year.
That means one out of four new vehicles was leased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly that's because people want more car for lower monthly
payments,'' said Linda Lee Goldberg. She is president of CarSource,
a car buying service in Larkspur, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience was another motivation. ``Most people like the idea
that they're renting a car and they don't have to do anything but
turn the car back in,'' Goldberg added. ``They can get a new car
every three or four years, and that's especially attractive on
expensive cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Leasing works best for careful shoppers who have predictable
lifestyles and are willing to do their research about how leasing
works, as well as about the car they want.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you might need to trade the car in before the lease
is up, perhaps to accommodate a growing family, leasing is not for
you.
</P>
<P>
   If predictability means owning rather than renting, or driving
the same car for many years and many miles, leasing won't work very
well. Finally, leasing may not be possible if you have a bad credit
record.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some leasing tips from experts:
</P>
<P>
   Read the contract. The paperwork can be confusing, and some
lessors have used that to overcharge customers. That's why the
government now requires a simplified disclosure form.
</P>
<P>
   Check for such things as numbers that don't add up or charges
that have not been made clear. ''It's a contract, and it's your
responsibility to make sure you understand your obligations,''
McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   You can find a sample disclosure form, along with other useful
information, at www.ftc.gov/ftc
</P>
<P>
   /consumer.htm. Click on Automobiles, then on Keys to Vehicle
Leasing.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a similar rundown by writing to Publications
Services, MS-127, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
Washington, D.C. 20551. Ask for a copy of the ``Consumer Guide to
Vehicle Leasing.''
</P>
<P>
   You may want to take a contract home to examine closely before
deciding to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-end leases are the most amenable for consumers. With this
type, you simply return your vehicle at the end of the lease and
have no other responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The leasing company estimates, upfront, what your car will be
worth at the end of the lease. If it's worth less, the company is
responsible for the difference, not you.
</P>
<P>
   With an open-end lease, the consumer takes all the risk and is
responsible for any gap between the anticipated value of the
vehicle, stated in the contract, and what it actually is worth at
the end of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   Open-end leases are used primarily for commercial business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a closed-end lease is what a client should have,''
Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't pay too much. A lease contract gives you the capitalized
cost, which is the price of the vehicle plus some fees. If it's
more than you would pay for buying the car, start over again on
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to the mileage limit in your contract. Often it
will be 12,000 to 15,000 miles per year. If you go over the limit,
excess mileage charges can add up very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Think seriously about gap insurance. This protects you if a
leased car is stolen or totaled. Some experts consider it a must,
but check the price.
</P>
<P>
   DECISION POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The choice between leasing and finance depends on the buyer's
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Lease if...
</P>
<P>
   _ You like a new car every two to four years.
</P>
<P>
   _ You know you can keep the car for the full term.
</P>
<P>
   _ You're easy on cars.
</P>
<P>
   _ You want a nicer car than you can afford to make payments on.
</P>
<P>
   _ You have good credit.
</P>
<P>
   _ You don't mind payments that don't build equity.
</P>
<P>
   Finance if...
</P>
<P>
   _ You want the same car for many years.
</P>
<P>
   _ You think you might have to give it up earlier.
</P>
<P>
   _ You put a lot of wear and tear on a car.
</P>
<P>
   _ You're on a Chevy budget and can accept a Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   _ You have a poor credit record.
</P>
<P>
   _ You want to own what you pay for.

 &HT;    The cat's meow
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ This morning dawned cool and clear. The
greens surrounding the treetop aerie where I sleep all summer, are
lush from spring rains, and as I stretch an arm out from under the
comforter to test the air, sounds of
</P>
<P>
   another day's beginning are all around.
</P>
<P>
   Mama bluejay is lecturing her babes on the use and abuse of back
yard feeders; a mourning dove is softly whooping to a friend on a
nearby limb who dutifully answers in kind, and Sheena, queen of the
squirrels, is scampering on
</P>
<P>
   the roof above me, occasionally swinging onto the old half-round
gutters to look in and ask when's breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   For one brief and shining Camelot moment, before the numbness of
sleep has washed from my awareness, all's right in a perfect world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mee-owww,'' a small voice calls from the doorway to my porch.
I roll over for a look. Biddy, my 11-year-old Siamese sits daintily
on the threshold awaiting our morning chat _ lopsided though it may
be. I tell her I'll be there in a minute and invite her into the
hammock for a snuggle. She refuses and chatters on.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy doesn't like my sleeping porch _ usually too chilly for
her heat-seeking Asian blood. Once in a while, though, I catch her
stretched out in a patch of late afternoon sun that has angled its
way onto the old canvas-covered floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``MEE-OWWW!'' Her final warning.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, I roll out and slip into the ragged elephant shirt
that hangs on a hook next to the door. Biddy leads the way
downstairs. I pad along in her wake, cautiously stepping around her
stair-by-stair ballet as she lures me to the kitchen and reminds me
her food dish is perilously low and the water in her big pink bowl
is a night old.
</P>
<P>
   As I scrape and wash, rinse and fill, I think what a perfect
morning it will be for tea and toast on the porch swing. Maybe I'll
ask Biddy to join me if she promises not to dive off the rail after
the first critter who moseys through
</P>
<P>
   the yard. Then I remember _ tea and tranquillity will have to
wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time for our medicine,'' I chant lightly. On the floor I line
up her vitamin drops, an antibiotic prescribed for a tummy upset, a
tube of hairball remedy, and a packet of chicken-flavored
toothpaste. Biddy has gone rigid.
</P>
<P>
   Down on all fours (mine) I go, stuffing the stiff cat's backside
back between my legs and crossing my ankles so she can't back out.
With my left elbow balanced on the floor and the forearm wrapped
around her chest, I reach for the
</P>
<P>
   first dropper.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy shrieks.
</P>
<P>
   An eternity later, woman and cat straggle onto the front porch.
Biddy has pasty antibiotic dribbling down her chin, and we're both
wearing a week's supply of Kitty Vita-Mite. An inch-and-a-half of
hairball remedy is stuck to my leg, and the chicken-flavored
toothpaste is history. I fell on it with my knee and squirted it
all over the butcher block leg.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy sits on a rocker, washing and grumping. I remind her that
I don't like poking stuff between her teeth _ particularly my
finger _ anymore than she does. She turns her back on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey!'' I say stooping beside her chair so we're eyeball to
eyeball. Remember me? I'm the goof who turned down a two-week
cruise in the Bahamas on a friend's boat because you have an upset
tummy.'' She looks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``And don't forget the long holiday weekend I spent alone, with
you, rather than riding bikes and toasting sunsets on Pelee Island
with my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems I've reached her. She turns, flashes those big Siamese
blues at me, and licks a glob of chicken-flavored toothpaste off my
right knee. I pat her head. She purrs. We're friends again.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great day after all.

   MEXICO-ELECTION (Mexico City) _ Ledeall: Vicente Fox, the
president-elect, met with President Ernesto Zedillo on Monday to
discuss Mexico's transition to a new government after Sunday's
election, which shattered the party that has governed Mexico for 70
years and opened the way for a virtual re-creation of the political
system. As Fox fielded congratulatory phone calls from world
leaders, election returns showed that his coattails in Sunday's
balloting helped his center-right party to impressive gains in both
houses of Congress but that no party would win majority control. By

   SYPHILIS-ERADICATE (Nashville, Tenn.) _ The new jail inmate had
intimidating arms, thick as thighs. But he extended one meekly when
a nurse, Jean Graves, told him: ``I have to give you a tuberculosis
skin test. I also have to draw blood for syphilis, OK?'' As she
slid the needle into his skin, Nashville took one more small step
in a sweeping national program: a push by health authorities to rid
the country of the ancient scourge of syphilis, spirochete
bacterium by spirochete, chancre sore by chancre, once and for all.
Even here, where the syphilis rate is second-highest in the country
among major cities, topped only by Indianapolis, the numbers are
less than staggering: Only 250 cases of new _ and thus still
infectious _ syphilis turned up last year. Nationwide, they dropped
below 7,000, down from the most recent peak of 50,000 in 1990. But
that is the very point, health officials say. Now, when new cases
are at an all-time low and so concentrated that about half of them
come from just 25 of the country's 3,100 counties, is the time to
try to wipe it out altogether. They are prosecuting a multipronged
attack that includes heavy reliance on community activism and
stepped-up detective work to track down carriers and those at risk,
as well as expanded clinical and laboratory services. By Carey
Goldberg.

   BROWNSTONE-REVIVAL (Portland, Conn.) _ Brownstone is back. That
somber yet elegant cloak for more than 50,000 row houses, from
Baltimore to Boston, was revered during the so-called Brown Decades
of the mid-nineteeth century, then reviled by the century's turn,
when gleaming white limestone and marble captivated the public. But
preservationists and planners are beginning to see a new future for
the formidable stone. Architects have started using it to give a
touch of historical sobriety to gaudy mansionettes, and
conservators have begun renewing the elegant facades of grand
monuments. But the revival has sparked a debate on whether
brownstone should be used at all. Because the terrible secret is
that brownstone isn't really much good as a building material. The
same quality that gives brownstone its charm, making it easy to
quarry and easy to sculpt, also makes it exquisitely vulnerable to
harsh weather and the passage of time. By Tracie Rohzan.

REVIVAL OF THE FITTEST: CD SERIES POLISHES BROADWAY'S OLD JEWELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Didier C. Deutsch, the recent spate of successful revivals
of classic Broadway musicals signifies an important change on the
Great White Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am much more gratified when I see shows like `Kiss Me Kate'
and `The Music Man'' attracting crowds again,'' he says. ``Perhaps
that might compel writers to go back to the drawing board and
create shows that have tunes that sing. Revivals are doing so well
on Broadway right now because people want to go to the theater,
enjoy themselves and leave the theater humming a tune.''
</P>
<P>
   This is important to Deutsch not only because he personally
prefers the traditional song-and-dance showmanship of old-style
musicals to the more complex storytelling of recent fare, but also
because revivals are his business _ revivals of Broadway musical
soundtracks, that is. Along with producers Darcy M. Proper, Tom
Shepard, Gary Schultz and Thomas Frost, Deutsch, a drama critic and
educator, is responsible for the Columbia Broadway Masterworks, a
series of reissues of classic musicals on CD.
</P>
<P>
   On May 30, five more titles hit the stores, bringing the total
since the series' inception two years ago to 14. The latest
releases are the original cast albums of ``Bye Bye Birdie,''
``Finian's Rainbow,'' ``Kismet'' and ``The Pajama Game,'' and the
1962 studio cast revival of ``Show Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously released titles in the series include ``Girl Crazy,''
``Company, South Pacific,'' ``A Little Night Music,'' ``On the
Town,'' ``Oh, Kay!,'' ``Cinderella,'' ``Flower Drum Song,''
``Gypsy,'' ``Mame,'' ``Sweet Charity'' and ``No, No, Nanette.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider so many wonderful shows and a plethora of
hit tunes,'' Deutsch says, ``you realize that there is a richness
there that needs to be exploited and brought to the forefront
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Remastered reissues of musical classics are nothing new. In
fact, these producers had worked on previous reissues of some of
the same titles _ while some had been involved with the original
records.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Columbia Broadway Masterworks unique are the
discs' combination of extras. Most of them have bonus tracks, from
alternate song versions to tracks cut before the show hit the
boards. Some feature behind-the-scenes interviews with the stars
and creators. Many of these were found on the original session
tapes and have been previously unreleased.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the series' release of ``Cabaret'' includes four
songs that did not make the final cut, performed by composer John
Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb.
</P>
<P>
   The booklets for each release include vintage cover art, rare
photographs from the original productions, comprehensive cast
listings, discographical annotations and newly commissioned liner
notes by musical-theater authorities. The ``Sweet Charity'' disc
features an interview with composer Cy Coleman; ``West Side Story''
has a remembrance from an original cast member. Some fans,
interested just in the tunes, might find such behind-the-scenes
details irritating; but for musical-theater aficionados, it's a
rare treat to experience the making of a live show that's long
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Much care is taken to perfect the quality of the original
recording, and in a few cases that evolves into a bit of tinkering
_ such as for the song Love, ``Look Away'' in Rodgers and
Hammerstein's ``Flower Drum Song.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The singer, Arabella Hong, at one point went from a head sound
to a throat sound, and that has always disturbed me,'' Deutsch
says. ``When I produced that reissue, I listened to the session
tapes, and there was another tape in which she did exactly the same
thing, but in reverse. I was able to splice together the two
performances and correct the flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take some liberties with the original recordings, but at
the same time, we give it a more natural feel. We remove some of
the reverb if that's in there. The recording sounds much better
than it ever sounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the titles originally had respectable runs on
Broadway, Deutsch says the committee of producers would consider
reissuing a soundtrack for a show that was not successful if it's
considered an important work, such as Stephen Sondheim's ``Anyone
Can Whistle,'' which had only nine performances in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``certainly a flop, but at least to my mind, it was one
of the most important shows of the early '60s, because it announced
the coming of Stephen Sondheim as a major voice in theater.''
Deutsch says. ``Some of the best elements you find in subsequent
shows by Sondheim are an embryo in `Anyone Can Whistle.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other shows being considered include ``Li'l Abner,'' ``House of
Flowers,'' ``Candide,'' ``Bells Are Ringing'' and Maury Yeston's
Tony-winning ``Nine,'' of which only excerpts were released on
record.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the better-known titles such as ``West Side Story''
and ``South Pacific'' sell better, but Deutsch says the great thing
about soundtracks is that they have longevity. Currently, he says,
12 of the 13 bestselling albums in the Sony Classical catalog are
Broadway cast albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not forget that titles like these will not sell as well
as, say, rock titles,'' he says. ``But in 10 years these will still
be selling.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THE PRIZE FOR REALITY IS $1 MILLION. ISN'T THAT
UNREAL? 
</HEADLINE>
   By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  It's a safe guess that few of the millions of young and
middle-aged fans of ``Survivor,'' the smash hit CBS specimen of
``reality television,'' have ever heard of Daniel J. Boorstin. Yet
the show's arrival certifies Boorstin as a prophet in his time.
(Speaking of prophecy, CBS is banking on a second reality series,
``Big Brother,'' which begins Wednesday and continues for five
nights a week, to give a further lift to its ratings.)
  It was in 1961 that Boorstin, then a history professor at the
University of Chicago who had won a Bancroft Prize for ``The
Americans: The Colonial Experience'' (Random House), came out with
a new work. ``The Image: Or What Happened to the American Dream?''
(Atheneum) took aim at the unreality of much that was being
marketed as the real stuff of American life. Although the
indictment was not entirely original, he applied it broadly and
forcefully, in particular to the delivery of ``reality'' in all its
dubious forms by television.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everywhere he looked, he found fake events, planted for the
profit of the planters and the delectation of a mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   But in his direst nightmares, even Boorstin, who would go on to
become the Librarian of Congress, apparently never envisioned a
show quite like ``Survivor,'' which under the guise of delivering
real experience serves up a voyeuristic feast drawn from adventure
tales, game shows, soap opera and anything else, be it bowel
movements or rat-eating, that might titillate the impressionable.
 &UR;  &LR; Where ``Survivor'' placed 16 scantily clad campers on a remote
island in the South China Sea, ``Big Brother'' installs 10 people
in a locked house under constant television scrutiny. Where the
cast members of ``Survivor'' get to choose which of them will be
knocked off the show each week, ``Big Brother'' gives the choice to
the audience. Both series trade in what Boorstin called ``synthetic
novelty.''
 &UR;  &LR; To borrow another of his favorite phrases, ``Survivor'' is a total
``pseudo event.'' Although the merchandise is presented as realism,
the essential criterion is simply whether it will pay off. So,
Boorstin charged in 1961, in a society dominated by television
techniques, authenticity is in short supply and getting shorter.
 &UR;  &LR; The success of ``Survivor'' four decades later is evidence of his
prescience: Millions are relishing, as examples of reality,
concoctions contrived to meet the market's taste. The Boorstin
rule: ``By this new Gresham's law of American public life,
counterfeit happenings tend to drive spontaneous happenings out of
circulation.''
 &UR;  &LR; On CBS, as Bill Carter wrote in The New York Times, the line
between news and entertainment is being further eroded by tacking
on a network news announcer, Julie Chen, to play the role of Big
Brother and to interview psychologists and sociologists who don't
mind lending their credentials to the enterprise.
 &UR;  &LR; ``Why are these people willing to do these things?''asks Susan
Zirinsky, referring to the contestants on the programs. Zirinsky is
the executive producer of the CBS news magazine ``48 Hours,'' which
adds to Wednesday's prime-time takeover by devoting a segment to
the ``Survivor'' participants.
</P>
<P>
   Why is an ostensible news program willing to do these things?
Well, there's the fact that CBS has paid $20 million for ``Big
Brother.'' Boorstin offered another answer: Overnight, the people
on a reality program or a game show or a chat show become the talk
of the tube, media-created creatures who, as Boorstin put it, are
known for their well-knownness.
 &UR;  &LR; The network publicity engines do their job. For a season or more
the audience is entranced by who will win the quiz show. Or, now,
it is enthralled by who will get kicked out of the locked house or
whether the former member of the Navy Seals, suddenly a national
figure by virtue of ``Survivor,'' will survive longer than the
truck driver and maybe end up with $1 million, which seems to be
the going rate for victory these days.
 &UR;  &LR;  Boorstin might have been aiming directly at ``Survivor'' and
``Big Brother'' when he wrote, ``The American citizen thus lives in
a world where fantasy is more real than reality.'' The time and
attention the nation lavishes on television and the popularity of a
series like ``Survivor'' lend weight to his assertion that ``in
American public life today pseudo events tend to drive all other
kinds of events out of our consciousness, or at least to overshadow
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Attributing the blurring of news and pseudo news to a
combination of technical virtuosity and audience democratization,
he wrote: ``The image, more interesting than its original, has
become the original. The shadow has become the substance.''
 &UR;  &LR; Are the many millions tuning into ``Survivor'' able to sort out
what is real from what is flagrantly exploitative? Does anybody
care? The soaring ratings seem to signal something more than just a
diverting hour a week and suggest that Boorstin was not giving way
to hyperbole when he wrote that images, synthetic and simplistic
yet vivid and believable, have become the nation's measure of what
is real.
 &UR;  &LR; In a sentence that the creators of ``Survivor'' and ``Big
Brother'' might borrow to promote their goods, Boorstin wrote: ``By
a diabolical irony the very facsimiles of the world which we make
on purpose to bring it within our grasp, to make it less elusive,
have transported us into a new world of blurs.''

U.S. AND CHINESE DISCUSS STEMMING FLOW OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash., N.Y.)  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The head of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service held talks here Monday with Chinese officials, hoping to
get ``a commitment for more international cooperation'' in the
agency's effort to stem the huge flow of illegal Chinese immigrants
into the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The visit, planned months ago, came just weeks after 58 Chinese
immigrants suffocated while being smuggled into England in the back
of a truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten cooperation, but it's been on a case-by-case
basis,'' said the head of the immigration service, Doris Meissner.
``But we'd like to see better cooperation not just from China but
also from transit countries as well.'' Most illegal Chinese
immigrants arrive in the U.S. via a third country, where they often
obtain fake travel documents.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said the United States had been ``quite successful'' in
some areas, such as slowing the number of illegal migrants who
arrive by boat. But she added that the international smuggling
rings that help Chinese sneak into the U.S. have been quick to
adapt, often creating new problems. She noted that as boat traffic
had dropped off, the number of illegal migrants arriving by air
with counterfeit documents had increased.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the service estimated it would intercept and send
back 4,000 Chinese arriving illegally at U.S. airports this year,
with many landing in Los Angeles, Seattle and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner's 14-member delegation, which includes top immigration
officials from those cities, will also visit the Fuzhou region of
Fujian Province, the home to the vast majority of Chinese who now
live illegally in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that tens
of thousands of Chinese are smuggled into the U.S. each year,
although Meissner said, ``We really don't have a good count.''
</P>
<P>
   Many western governments that are trying to thwart the trade say
that international criminal gangs are making huge profits in this
illegal human trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amounts of money that go into this and the level of
organization and the level of criminality and abuse puts Chinese
smuggling in a class by itself,'' Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said that one of the most effective weapons against the
illegal trade was the quick return of those who are intercepted.
That is ``the strongest signal that can be sent that taking the
risk and paying the money will not pay off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But quick repatriation is often not possible in the case of the
Chinese, since many apply for political asylum, and those claims
can take years to work their way through the system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although Chinese officials have said that the United States'
relatively liberal political asylum process had encouraged poor
Chinese to try their luck at emigration, Meissner said that
complaint had not come up in meetings here.
</P>
<P>
   She said that only about 13 percent of political asylum claims
by Chinese are successful, generally made by people who say that
they will face political or religious persecution if they are
returned to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   But many illegal immigrants disappear into the vast Chinese
networks in place in cities like New York before the asylum process
is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said Monday's talks were quite general, touching on an
array of cooperative ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to share analytic information, we need to work
together on fraudulent document use, and on public information so
that accurate information is getting into the sending societies and
communities,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Neither an archaeologist nor a paleontologist herself, Adrienne
Mayor has nonetheless done some digging deep into the past and
found literary and artistic clues _ and not a few huge fossils _
that seem to explain the inspiration for many of the giants,
monsters and other strange creatures in the mythology of antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have discovered that if you take all the places of Greek
myths, those specific locales turn out to be abundant fossil
sites,'' Mayor, a classical folklorist and independent scholar,
said in an interview. ``But there is also a lot of natural
knowledge embedded in those myths, showing that Greek perceptions
about fossils were pretty amazing for prescientific people.''
</P>
<P>
   Her years of research thus challenge the widely held view that
natural historians in classical Greece and Rome lacked the
knowledge to interpret large vertebrate fossils as organic remains
of the past. That conceptual breakthrough, representing the start
of the modern science of paleontology, was supposedly made by the
French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1806.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much like today's fossil hunters, Mayor found, ancient
Greeks and Romans collected and measured the petrified bones they
encountered and displayed them in temples and museums. They, too,
recognized fossils as evidence of past life, now extinct,
anticipating Cuvier by more than 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ancients often let their culture-bound imaginations
run in unscientific directions. In her book, ``The First Fossil
Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times,'' published in May
by Princeton University Press, Mayor draws on a close study of
classical texts to show that some of the more impressive and
mysterious fossils were used as evidence supporting existing myths
or creating new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Homeric legend of Heracles rescuing Hesione by slaying the
Monster of Troy, for example, may have a paleontological origin.
Mayor pointed out that in the earliest known illustration of the
Heracles legend, painted on a Corinthian vase, the monster's skull
closely matched that of an extinct giraffe. Such fossils are
plentiful on the Greek islands and western coast of Turkey and are
mentioned in classical literature.
</P>
<P>
   The vase painting from the sixth century B.C., Mayor concluded,
is most likely ``the earliest artistic record of a vertebrate
fossil discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossils found and displayed in antiquity on the island of Samos
probably inspired the story of savage monsters called Neades, whose
reverberating bellows were said to tear the earth apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks thus had a neat explanation for two perplexing
phenomena, the gigantic bones and the earthquakes that frequently
devastated their land.
</P>
<P>
   Other discoveries of huge mammal bones were viewed as
confirmation of the ancient Greek belief in ancestral heroes as
15-foot giants. Mastodon fossils on Samos were hailed as the
remains of the war elephants Dionysus is supposed to have deployed
in his mythic battle with the Amazons.
</P>
<P>
   Where did the idea of the griffin come from?
</P>
<P>
   Aristeas, a seventh-century B.C. traveler, wrote of the
gold-seeking Scythians who fought creatures in the Gobi Desert that
resembled ``lions but with the beak and wings of an eagle.'' These
fierce creatures presumably nested on the ground and guarded
deposits of gold. In reality, Mayor concluded, the griffin ``was
based on illiterate nomads' observations of dinosaur skeletons in
the deserts of Central Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor's success in piecing together the griffin legend
encouraged her to examine other Greek and Roman texts for ``the
world's oldest written descriptions of fossil finds,'' which had
been overlooked by most classics scholars and historians of
science. On a visit to Samos, she studied a rich collection of
prehistoric bones and skulls with which the ancients must have been
familiar. She began to put texts and fossils together and saw the
ancients in a new light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as a fossil is `petrified time,' so is an ancient
artifact or text,'' she wrote. ``The tasks of paleontologists and
classical historians and archaeologists are remarkably similar _ to
excavate, decipher and bring to life the tantalizing remnants of a
time we will never see.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mayor's interpretations may draw fire from some
scholars, the response to her book has so far been favorable. John
R. Horner, a dinosaur paleontologist at the Museum of the Rockies
in Bozeman, Mont., has called it ``the best account ever concerning
the real meaning of mythical creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   In a review in the journal Science, Dr. Mott T. Greene, a
historian of geology at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma,
Wash., praised Mayor's ``well-documented contention that the
ancients constructed their deep time as we have constructed ours,
through the discovery and analysis of the fossil bones of extinct
creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they told stories about these fossils that differ from our
own,'' Greene continued, ``they examined the fossils with the same
techniques we employ today: comparative anatomy, skeletal
reconstruction, paleogeography and museum display.''
</P>
<P>
   Art historians think that Mayor may well have solved the puzzle
of the Corinthian vase depicting Heracles shooting arrows at the
head of the monster of the Troy legend. The vase, on display at the
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, had mystified the experts because
its monster does not conform to the conventional serpentine image
of Greek sea monsters.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts like Sir John Boardman, an art historian at Oxford
University in England, suspected that the vase was the work of an
incompetent artist. But when Mayor called attention to the
similarity between the monster and the skull of an extinct giraffe,
Boardman agreed and invited her to expand on this interpretation in
an article, which was published in the February issue of The Oxford
Journal of Archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists also agreed that the skull of an extinct
giraffe, possibly Samotherium, often found eroding out of rock
outcrops in the region, may have been the artist's model and
perhaps even the inspiration for the original myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vase,'' Mayor wrote, ``is valuable evidence for the role
that observations of fossilized animal remains played in ancient
myths of monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kate A. Robson Brown, an anthropologist at the University of
Bristol in England, thinks that some of Mayor's fossil-myth
connections may be a stretch. As she noted in the current issue of
Natural History magazine, ``Many cultures around the globe have
colorful giant lore _ Norse fables and Australian creation stories
come to mind _ without the benefit of rich fossil deposits.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Mayor said her study of ancient texts revealed ample evidence of
a ``bone rush'' among Greeks in the fifth century B.C. Every
discovery of huge bones, it seems, prompted speculation that they
belonged to this hero or that giant. Many of these finds happened
to occur, Mayor said, at places where the gods and giants of
mythology had met in battle.
</P>
<P>
   She found in a second-century A.D. geography by the traveler
Pausanias an account of the excitement created by the discovery of
bones of heroic proportions that were taken to be those of mighty
Ajax, of Trojan War legend. ``Ajax's kneecaps were exactly the size
of a discus for the boys' pentathlon,'' Pausanias wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many scholars are not used to perceiving natural knowledge
expressed in mythological language,'' Mayor said. ``If the study of
fossils was not mentioned by Aristotle or Thucydides, and it
wasn't, then it just didn't exist for many classicists and ancient
historians.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in a recent lecture at Cornell University, Mayor contended
that bones of titanic mastodons at Samos inspired not just myths
but ``earthshaking concepts in early paleontological thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the monstrous Neades, she said, ``contains the germ
of the idea of extinction'' long before Cuvier; these fossils were
interpreted as the remains of strange, oversized creatures that
lived before humans, and were no more. In time, after large Indian
elephants became known, the myth of the Neades was abandoned. The
huge bones of Samos were then explained by invoking the myth of
Dionysus and the war elephants in battle against the Amazons.
</P>
<P>
   As Mayor said, the first myth showed that the perceptive
ancients were able to relate a fossil species to living animals,
well before modern paleontology. The revised myth of the war
elephants showed that they were responsive to new zoological
knowledge, adapting mythology the way scientists today sometimes
have to reshape theory.

LOST RIVETS AND THREADS, AND ECOSYSTEMS PULLED APART 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In trying to illuminate what humans are doing to the natural
environment, scientists and conservationists over the years have
come up with a number of descriptive images. One of the best known
is the metaphor of the rivets.
</P>
<P>
   In this formulation, an ecosystem is likened to an airplane:
each act of environmental destruction _ the extinction of a species
of plant or animal, for instance _ is akin to removing a rivet from
the plane. At first, the losses make little difference, because
there are lots of rivets. But if enough are removed or a few are
taken away at crucial spots, the plane will crash.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying assumption is that there are thresholds, or
limits, beyond which increasing pressure suddenly precipitates a
catastrophic ecosystem collapse. And from an environmentalist's
point of view, catastrophe is a spur to urgent action.
</P>
<P>
   But while it has recently become clear to many experts that the
stability of ecosystems depends at least partly on the varieties of
species they contain, it remains unclear at what point a collapse
may take place when species are removed one by one.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, it is not altogether clear what would
constitute an ecosystem collapse. Does it occur when a single
species of weed has driven out all other plants and their animal
dependents, for instance? Or does it require the obliteration of
all life?
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these difficulties, another metaphor is coming to
the fore: that of the biological world as a rich, diverse tapestry.
In this image, each act of environmental destruction is like
pulling a thread from the tapestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, the results are almost imperceptible,'' Carlos
Davidson, a conservation biologist at the University of California
at Davis, wrote recently in the journal BioScience. ``The function
and beauty of the tapestry is slightly diminished with the removal
of each thread. If too many threads are pulled _ especially if they
are pulled from the same area _ the tapestry will begin to look
worn and may tear locally.''
</P>
<P>
   In this way of looking at the situation, there is no clear
threshold of catastrophe, but rather a ``continuum of
degradation,'' from ``a world rich in biodiversity to a threadbare
remnant with fewer species, fewer natural places, less beauty, and
reduced ecosystem services.'' And while there may be multiple rips
and tears in the tapestry, any catastrophic collapses that might
take place (like the crash of a fishery) are relatively rare and
local.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even this metaphor seems incomplete. If the human impact on
the rest of nature is as pervasive and encompassing as many
scientists say, wear and tear by humans is not just fraying the
tapestry. Rather, Homo sapiens is reweaving it into entirely new
patterns, with a new mixture of colors and a new texture. And while
the new pattern may please many an ordinary eye, it is markedly
simpler, duller and less functional than the original.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog of human influence on the natural world is now well
known. Some ecologists say that nearly half the land surface of the
earth has been transformed by human activity. Development,
agriculture and logging continue to destroy and degrade natural
habitats. Wetlands are filled in. Grasslands become farm fields.
Forests become suburbs. Suppression of naturally occurring fires
throws many kinds of ecosystems out of kilter, changing their
species mixture and their very complexion. Wild species vanish
wholesale at the local scale and are being driven to extinction
globally at rates estimated at 100 to 1,000 times faster than the
long-term ``background'' rate.
</P>
<P>
   Innumerable hardy species of plants and animals are transplanted
willy-nilly around the world, crowding out more fragile local
varieties of life. Excess fertilizer use and burning of fossil
fuels have more than doubled the amount of nitrogen in the
environment. This huge shot of nature's universal fertilizer
stimulates choking blooms of algae and aquatic vegetation and also
enables plants that thrive in a high-nitrogen environment to expand
and drive other species out of local ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the natural world is becoming more simple, with
fewer species interacting with one another, and more homogenized,
as the same species populate ecosystems around the world, making
them look more and more alike. ``We're simplifying the world on a
mass scale, an unprecedented scale,'' said Dr. G. David Tilman, an
ecologist at the University of Minnesota. At the same time, said
Dr. Kevin S. McCann, a biologist at McGill University in Montreal,
the world is moving toward ``biouniformity'' as a result of the
mix-and-match of species interchanges taking place around the
globe. The colors of nature's great tapestry, it seems, are
bleeding into one another.
</P>
<P>
   Tilman, who has carried out a number of pioneering studies about
the relationship between reduced biological diversity and the
stability of ecosystems, finds the tapestry analogy interesting:
``When you go to low diversity you go to very coarse weaves.''
</P>
<P>
   But the analogy, he says, does not go far enough in addressing
the changes in ecosystem workings that accompany reductions in
biological variety and the consequent simplification of the
landscape. Those changes, he said, are ``more dramatic'' than the
tapestry metaphor allows.
</P>
<P>
   The tapestry metaphor also assumes that nature is in a static
state, says McCann, when in fact it is in constant dynamic flux.
Tearing the fabric sends ``waves' of dynamic change through an
ecosystem, and the waves get bigger as biological diversity
declines.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a decade ago, the level of biodiversity was
thought to be unimportant to ecosystem functioning. But now, Tilman
and McCann wrote separately in a recent issue of the journal
Nature, accumulating scientific evidence has made it clear that
species richness is directly related to the stability of an
ecosystem. In fact, Tilman wrote, diversity must now be added to
the list of factors that generally shape ecosystems and govern
their functioning, along with climate, soil type, moisture, fire
and storm.
</P>
<P>
   Diversity assures that in times of stress, as during a drought,
the whole plant community (the foundation, matrix and support of
animal life) will not be wiped out, and can spring back to normal
once the stress is removed. If there are only one or two species,
however, the entire system might crash, with disastrous
consequences for animal and microbial life. Diversity also prevents
one species from running amok and taking over the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence so far suggests that as species are eliminated from
an ecosystem, ``there is a tendency for a collapse,'' McCann said.
What is not known, he said, is ``how far we have to go until we see
a collapse.'' A collapse would not necessarily mean the conversion
of an ecosystem to a single-species plant community, or
monoculture. In fact, McCann said, the collapsed state may ``still
be productive from a human perspective.'' But it would be a pale
reflection of its former self, and more vulnerable to an outright
if temporary crash in a drought or other severe disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   If that is so, the rivet analogy may have some validity. But
Davidson cautions that research in this area is still in its
infancy, and that ``it is unclear that biodiversity loss will lead
to ecosystem collapse.'' Therefore, he argues, the tapestry
metaphor offers a more useful view of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there are no thresholds of collapse, he wrote in
BioScience, destruction of the natural world and loss of
biodiversity still matter:
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather, in calling for a stop to the destruction, it is the
losses themselves that count, not a putative cliff that humans will
fall off of somewhere down the road'' (yet another ecological
metaphor).
</P>
<P>
   It may be, as he suggests, that nature's complexities cannot be
captured by simple analogies. To the extent they can, the
tapestry-versus-rivets contest seems unlikely to be resolved until
the insights of hard science catch up with those of the poet's
imagination. And then some other metaphor altogether, undreamed
today, may emerge triumphant.

 &HT;    Stress management can cut sports anxiety

<P>
   His sand wedge descended from its slow, graceful arc and entered
the sand about 2 inches behind the golf ball. With a calculated
explosion of sand, the ball emerged from its resting place and
lifted above the putting surface _ coming to rest a few inches from
the cup. This whole procedure was finely executed in the mind's eye
of the golf professional who was preparing to execute this same
shot moments thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Such golfing greats as Jack Nicholas, Tom Kite and now Tiger
Woods use visual imagery to enhance and improve their proficiency
in a sport that epitomizes the term mind game.
</P>
<P>
   Visual imagery, sometimes referred to as mental rehearsal or
visualization, is the process of creating (visualizing) an
experience in the mind. This technique is used for relearning new
skills, practicing and refining existing skills and even preparing
psychologically for the whole sporting event or match itself.
</P>
<P>
   By lowering anxiety, increasing focus and self-confidence and
enhancing warm-up techniques, visual imagery is one of the many
techniques utilized in the growing area of sports psychology.
</P>
<P>
   This marriage between psychology and golf was spoken in the
1920s by golfing great Bobby Jones, who discussed the ``mental
game'' of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals in golf and other sports such as tennis,
basketball, football and bowling seek out the assistance of
professionally trained sports psychologists to enhance their
skills. Other psychological techniques used by sports psychologists
include relaxation and stress management.
</P>
<P>
   Intense competition, large crowds, television cameras and huge
monetary rewards can all contribute to a great deal of stress and
tension. Athletic performance is often improved by normal increases
in energy and arousal. However, many motor skills, especially those
fine motor skills utilized in activities such as putting, can be
greatly impaired by overarousal.
</P>
<P>
   By utilizing techniques such as self-hypnosis, athletes are able
to reduce tension and guard against overarousal, thereby increasing
their focus on desirable outcomes. Simply closing one's eyes
between shots can assist in focusing on the task at hand and screen
out undesirable external stimuli such as noisy crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Other psychological assistance such as anger management, fear
reduction of intrusive and unrealistic worries, and reframing of
emotions such as nervousness are taught by sports psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you go out for your weekend game of ``duffers''
golf, consider taking along the techniques taught by the sports
shrinks. Who knows, you might knock enough strokes off your game to
have something to brag about on the 19th hole.

&HT;     CRACKDOWN ON PRISON VISITATIONS IS CONDEMNED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN QUENTIN, Calif. _ The small, Spartan room within the
fortress of San Quentin State Prison has served as a lifeline for
nearly 20 years, not only for those incarcerated inside but for
myriad outside visitors hungry for contact with the denim-clad men
of California's death row.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the East Block visiting room, the utilitarian room
functions as social hall and as a wedding chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't a lot of activities, mostly you just sit and
talk,'' said Charlie Larsen of Fresno, whose stepson is on death
row. ``But I feel safer in that visiting room than on some Fresno
streets at night. Everyone is on their best behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the long, and largely safe, tradition of contact visits for
California's condemned inmates is facing possible termination.
</P>
<P>
   A visiting room fight between two death row prisoners on March
31, the first such clash in the room, triggered a suspension in
``contact'' visits.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been in a declared ``state of emergency'' ever
since, with relatives, friends and attorneys forced to scramble for
one-hour ``noncontact'' visits that take place between glass
partitions over telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The new restrictions are unduly harsh, say relatives and friends
of the condemned men, because they severely limit the number and
length of visits, because the prison's appointment system is a
scheduling nightmare _ previously, appointments were unnecessary,
visitors simply showed up _ and because all inmates are being
punished for the misconduct of two prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has never made it easy for us to visit, but now it
is more difficult than ever,'' said Donna Doolin-Larsen, a Fresno
resident whose son, Keith Doolin, convicted of two murders and four
attempted murders, has been on death row since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The call-in system is terrible, the line is always busy. You
just sit and redial, redial. It has taken me from 47 minutes to one
hour and 37 minutes to get through to make an appointment. And if
all the slots are full, we don't even know it because they stop
answering the phones. I'm devastated by this. To think I would
never again be able to touch my son . . . is almost too much for me
to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   But that might be the future awaiting her and many others whose
loved ones are under a judgment of death. The warden at San
Quentin, J.S. Woodford, is recommending that the current
restrictions become permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Woodford was appointed on June 8 by Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat,
and must be confirmed by the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that the actions of a few have disrupted an
entire program, but the trend toward violence in the visiting room
is alarmingly clear to me,'' Woodford wrote in May. ``It is time
for the department to take a second look at our program and decide
if the benefits outweigh the risks. I believe they do not.''
</P>
<P>
   California is one of only a few states that permit contact
visits for ``Grade A'' death row prisoners, a classification of
good behavior awarded to the majority of San Quentin's death row
dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   The visits were made possible by a federal consent decree 200
years ago that spelled out living conditions for condemned inmates,
including their right to exercise, shower, and eat two hot meals
and a bag lunch daily.
</P>
<P>
   Where before inmates and their visitors were confined to
plexiglass booths, now Grade A condemned men could freely mingle
with families and friends who underwent security checks, to hug and
sit with them in the general visiting room.
</P>
<P>
   Since the consent decree took effect in 1980 (a District Court
has since terminated it and the matter is on appeal), San Quentin's
condemned population soared to 551. The visiting room _ with a
93-person capacity _ had become increasingly packed, particularly
on weekends, since it opened in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Since the new crackdown, a maximum of seven visitors, including
attorneys, are permitted per hour, with a total of 96 slots
available each week.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking publicly for the first time, critics of the
restrictions say they fear an upsurge in prison violence if the
crackdown becomes permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the importance of visits on prison life,'' said Charla
Greene of Santa Rosa, a death row visitor for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a prize to prisoners, they are a protection against
violence. If they no longer allow contact visits, there will be
more violence. For families, to not be able to touch their loved
ones and to visit them, is mean-spirited. You are condemning the
families as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-minute altercation that led to the prison crackdown
involved rival factions of the Crips street gang. During the fight,
a 32-year-old inmate attacked a 41-year-old inmate with a
prison-made knife. Guards ordered the two to stop, then subdued
them with pepper spray. The inmates suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors blame San Quentin for permitting the two inside
the visiting room at the same time. They also fault prison staff
for failing to detect the weapon, for prisoners are strip-searched
before entering the visiting room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials did not take reasonable precautions,'' said Robert
R. Bryan, a San Francisco capital appeals attorney who represents
several condemned inmates. A death row visitor for nearly two
decades, Bryan has filed a motion in federal court protesting
various aspects of the new restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like putting an explosive device into a room then, when
it goes off, blaming others. One lieutenant later told me he was
very proud of the inmates. The fight did not escalate, they all got
out of the way and protected their loved ones. Those same people
are now being penalized over a situation created by San Quentin's
officials. The behavior in the visiting room has always been
exemplary.''

TRAVEL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: La., Va., Miss., Hawaii, Italy, France, Britain)   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By RAY CORMIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>

   U.S. LINES REDUX
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently saw an advertisement for United States Lines. Is
this a rebirth of the old cruise line of the United States and the
America? _ Jan Heck, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The United States Lines is returning to the high seas, but it
is not the line you remember. The name was acquired by the American
Classic Voyages  &UR; Co. &LR; , a holding company with a collection of
passenger lines: American Hawaii Cruises, the Delta Queen Steamboat
Co., Delta Queen Coastal Voyages and now, United States Lines. It
operates from the Robin Street Wharf in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview, Roderick K. McLeod, the chief executive
officer, said American Classic had acquired the rights to the name
from an heir of a former director of the old line, which last
carried passengers in 1969. It became a cargo business, then went
bankrupt in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   For the new line, American Classic has contracted for the first
new oceangoing passenger ships to be built in the United States in
45 years. These 72,000-ton vessels, to carry 1,920 passengers each,
are being built at Ingalls Shipbuilding Yard in Pascagoula, Miss.,
and are expected to sail in 2003 and 2004, McLeod said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also acquired the 1,212-passenger Nieuw
Amsterdam from Holland America; after some refitting, it will be
used for weekly seven-day cruises among the Hawaiian Islands,
starting Dec. 9. The ship has been renamed the Patriot, and will
fly the American flag and have an American crew. When ready, the
two new ships will also be used in Hawaii, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot will differ from other liners mainly in its American
ambience, McLeod said. ``Some of it will be in the food,'' he said.
``A lot of it will be related to the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes on the ship is the removal of the casino,
since Hawaii does not allow gambling; replacing it is a Hawaiian
cultural center. The old United States Lines will be evoked in the
names of lounges _ No. 1 Broadway, the old line's address, and
Digby's Bar, after the old telephone exchange of its headquarters.
The ship has two outdoor pools, and children's activity centers.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian cruises on the Patriot will leave Honolulu on
Saturday and dock at Nawiliwili, Kahului, Hilo and Kona, then
return to Honolulu. Rates are $1,599 to $4,249 a person, double
occupancy. Reservations and information: (877) 330-6871, and
www.unitedstateslines.com.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD WAR I SITES
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there travel agencies specializing in tours of World War
I battlefields in France? I am particularly interested in Verdun. _
Jack R. Siegelbaum, Ridgewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. Most American military tour specialists seem to deal with the
Civil War or World War II. But a Virginia company, Military
Historical Tours, has several tours that may interest you.
</P>
<P>
   According to Patrick Mooney, the company's executive vice
president, there will be four to six World War I tours next year,
including a two-week general overview in September 2001 that visits
Verdun.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company has a Western Front Battlefields tour
from Aug. 16 to 25. It doesn't go to Verdun but does visit the
Marne, the Somme, Flanders and Ypres Salient. The cost is $2,495 a
person, including round-trip air fare from Newark, hotels, buses
and at least two meals a day.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Military Historical Tours, 4600 Duke Street, Suite 420,
Alexandria, Va. 22304; (800) 722-9501, fax (703) 212-8567;
www.miltours.com.
</P>
<P>
   An American specialist in World War II trips, Valor Tours of
Sausalito, Calif., also represents a big British battlefield tour
operator, Holts Tours, which has several World War I tours each
year. This year's Verdun tour, Sept. 14 to 17, is booked, but
another is planned for June 2001. Details will be available in late
October, Holts says.
</P>
<P>
   Other Holts tours this year include Four Days in Ypres, Aug. 17
to 20, from $595 a person, double occupancy; A Weekend on the
Somme, Sept. 9 and 10, from $250 a person; and Armistice, Nov. 10
to 12, including a memorial service and poppy parade in Ypres, from
$400 (prices include transportation from London and back, hotel and
half board).
</P>
<P>
   To find out more, contact Valor Tours, 10 Liberty Ship Way,
Sausalito, Calif. 94965; (800) 842-4504, fax (415) 332-6971, or go
to Holts' Web site, www.battletours.co.uk.
</P>
<P>
   Another British operator, Midas Tours, Post Office Box 376, West
Byfleet KT14 7FB, has a walking tour of Verdun Sept. 1 to 4. This
will explore the terrain of the pivotal battle partly on foot, with
walks of about eight and four miles on two of the days. It starts
and ends in London and costs $600, including lodging and two meals
a day. Call (44-1932) 407-000, fax (44-1932) 405-000 or see
www.midastours.co.uk.

   CHURCH MUSIC IN ROME
</P>
<P>
   Q. In Rome, my wife and I will visit many churches, which we
know can seem like silent museums. Are there any where music can be
heard? _ Edward Kemp, Setauket, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. While it is true _ if surprising _ that Rome does not have a
big reputation for church music, many Masses are celebrated with
music. Here are a few churches with music at Sunday Masses (and
sometimes at weekday Masses, too):
</P>
<P>
   Chiesa Sant'Ignazio di Loyola, Piazza Sant'Ignazio 1; (39-06)

Wednesday and Friday, nuns play guitars, and on Thursday and
Saturday there is organ music.
</P>
<P>
   On the first and third Sundays of each month this year, except
August, the Benedictine monks of St. Anselmo are offering free
classical music concerts before Latin vespers at the Abbey of the
Aventine, Piazza Cavalieri di Malta 5; (39-06) 579-1319. The
concerts are at 6 p.m., with vespers at 7:15.
</P>
<P>
   To find out about church concerts that are part of the Vatican
Jubilee celebrations, call (39-06) 6988-7248, or see

NEW BOOK SPARKS DEBATE AMONG HOLLYWOOD WOMEN ABOUT HOW FAR THEY'VE
COME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood's hierarchy used to be easy to understand. Any woman
who wouldn't think of leaving the house in anything less than a
one-of-a-kind Edith Head gown was a force to be reckoned with. All
others were invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you're more likely to see the most powerful women in the
industry _ and not even recognize them.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the biggest movies each year still offer, at best,
a ``girlfriend'' role for a female lead, women offscreen have
larger, more fulfilling roles in Hollywood's boardrooms and
screening rooms. They're directing and producing movies. They're
writing movies. They're even running studios.
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't necessarily mean Tinseltown is embracing equality
between the sexes as much as it is ``dealing'' with it, say some
insiders.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after 20 years in the movie business, producer Joan
Hyler thinks there are two eternal truths about Hollywood: ``One,
you can't get a good bagel anywhere, and two, women don't get an
even break.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyler, owner of Hyler Management, a Los Angeles-based
management/production company, and a former senior vice president
of the William Morris Agency, says that ``though there has been
some improvement with women in executive positions, there is still
a lack of parity at every level.''
</P>
<P>
   That imbalance has been highlighted in a new book, ``Is That a
Gun in Your Pocket? Women's Experience of Power in Hollywood''
(Random House, $26.95), by Rachel Abramowitz. A former writer for
Premiere magazine, Abramowitz has ignited fierce debate in
Hollywood about women's roles in the business, and whether their
successes _ as well as the obstacles they continue to face _
reflect society as a whole. Abramowitz notes that less than 10
percent of all major studio films are produced or directed by
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly no surprise,'' says Hyler of the statistic.
``In a few cases, women may have gotten more powerful positions at
the studios, but overall we're still in the same historical
patterns. Men in Hollywood are the ones calling almost all the
shots. I think Rachel's book is very true, a very accurate social
history.''
</P>
<P>
   But not every prominent woman in the film industry agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no easier business for women to advance in than the
movie business,'' says Linda Obst, producer of ``Sleepless in
Seattle,'' ``One Fine Day'' and several other hit films. ``Women
coming out of college have equal opportunity with men for
entry-level jobs. Women have equal opportunity to be promoted.''
</P>
<P>
   Obst, a Fredericksburg, Texas, resident whose book ``Hello, He
Lied: And Other Truths of the Hollywood Trenches,'' was a
bestseller in 1998, believes ``the anecdotes (in Abramowitz's book)
are archaic. Yes, there is a ladder anyone in Hollywood has to
scale, but the rungs are the same for women and men.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, even among women in Hollywood, doesn't surprise
Abramowitz, who admits that generalizations are tough to make.
Gender, she says, was sometimes the only thing some of the women
she interviewed for the book had in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got these incredible contrasts,'' she says. ``Eventually,
I focused most on Sherry Lansing (chairman of the motion pictures
group for Paramount) and Dawn Steel (the late president of Columbia
TriStar Pictures, who died in 1997). Sherry is so feminine, so
sweet. Dawn Steel was tough. But they were the first women to
really make it to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyler and Abramowitz agree that women do have more opportunity
in some aspects of the movie industry than in the past, thanks to
the Lansing/Steel generation that forced its way to the front lines
by combining chutzpah and talent. But as in most industries, women
still have less executive presence, less ``clout,'' than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big moguls are still guys,'' Hyler says. ``Just name them
_ Diller, Eisner, Murdoch. The couple of women in suits at high
executive levels still have to report to them. The movie industry
mirrors the Fortune 500 business profiles. Traditionally, they may
move up some women into near-the-top rungs, but the top echelon is
male.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Despite her accomplishments, Lansing _ whose elevation to head
of production for Twentieth Century Fox in 1980 was so surprising
and novel that it made the front page of The New York Times _
exemplifies how successful women in Hollywood are still not given
credit for talent, Abramowitz says. In ``Is That a Gun in Your
Pocket?'' she quotes a male colleague snarling after a screening
that, ``Sherry worked the aisles like an airline stewardess,
hugging and kissing everyone she knew.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When is a woman ever judged objectively by her ability?''
Abramowitz asks. ``I have talked to Sherry since the book came out.
She said there were obviously things in it she didn't like, but
mostly she was incredibly complimentary.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   Hyler says she believes the obstacles Hollywood power brokers
place in front of women ``is not particularly intentional,'' and
it's driven as much as anything by the fact that teen boys and
young men have made up the largest and most predictable block of
moviegoers ever since ``Jaws'' and ``Star Wars'' began the
``blockbuster'' era in the mid-'70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conservatism rather than exclusionism,'' she says. ``When
you're talking about the costs of studio movies starting at maybe
$80 million, then the studios _ the men running the studios _ tend
to rely on what worked for them in the past. It turns into a
chicken-and-the-egg thing. With that much money involved, they
won't hire a woman who doesn't have extensive experience. But if
women don't get hired, they can't get any experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Where women now make their greatest impact on major studio
films, Abramowitz believes, is in pressuring male counterparts to
make movies that will attract female audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longest time, mostly movies were made by men for men,
with teen-age boys seen as the sort of optimum audience,''
Abramowitz says. ``Gradually, the message has gotten through that
adult women (moviegoers) can make movies successful _ `Ghost' was
that kind of movie. `Pretty Woman' another. `Titanic' finally made
it impossible to ignore. Getting women interested in your movie is
the best way to have a blockbuster now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that such recent successes have completely broken old
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laurie McDonald of DreamWorks told me this story,'' Abramowitz
says. ``She's one of their heads of production. They were having a
(story) meeting to plan `Gladiator,' and she told the writer and
director that there had to be an interesting woman character (to
attract female moviegoers). They put one in. Then she got called
away, had to leave the room, and when she got back a short time
later, they'd already killed off the female character.'' (McDonald
resuscitated the character.)
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences aren't just frustrating to the women involved,
says Abramowitz. The impact Hollywood has on culture and society
makes the presence of women in top Hollywood positions especially
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often (female) characters in movies reflect inherent sexism,''
she says. ``It can be a subtle thing, like making the hero's part
bigger while reducing the presence of his love interest. What they
do, essentially, to make him look good, is to dumb her down.''
</P>
<P>
   What's become common is for testosterone-fueled writers to try
to deflect criticism by making their jiggly dumb blondes nominally
intelligent by providing them with Ph.D.'s and impressive-sounding
jobs, even though they're not actually seen doing anything more
taxing than bedding down the male star. One of the more egregious
recent examples is the hot pants-wearing Dr. Christmas Jones played
by Denise Richards in ``The World Is Not Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When women are actively involved in the production, that's not
as likely to happen,'' says Abramowitz.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her book, Abramowitz alternates tales of distaff
professional problems with detailed looks at how Hollywood's
professional pressures affect women's personal lives more
powerfully than they do men's. Affairs, divorces and estrangements
between mothers and children are prominent. In one anecdote, author
Larry McMurtry says he based much of the Aurora-Emma
mother/daughter tension in ``Terms of Endearment'' on real-life
problems between production designer Polly Platt and her daughter
Antonia.
</P>
<P>
   Platt _ whose husband, director Peter Bogdanovich, left her for
Cybill Shepherd during the filming of ``The Last Picture Show'' _
admits she found the book's revelations about her personal life
difficult to bear, ``but in reading the book, seeing what sorts of
things had happened to other women, I began to feel less alone,''
she says. ``Women have a harder time succeeding in the (movie)
business. That's true. I told Rachel she should call her book `Few
Women Are Called and Fewer Are Chosen.'''
</P>
<P>
   And those who are called and chosen, Abramowitz says, often have
little tolerance for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   When Barbra Streisand read about herself in ``Is That a Gun in
Your Pocket?,'' she snatched up a telephone and called the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of surreal,'' Abramowitz recalls. ``It was a
Saturday night. My husband picked up the phone, said, `Yes, she's
right here,' and handed it to me. Barbra just called herself; she
didn't have a staff member do it. She wanted to blow off steam
about things, like my saying she had talent but had to get past
being `a funny-looking girl' (to succeed in the business). I said,
`Barbra, this book is about women in the movie business and their
flawed humanity. Get past the specific things about you, and look
at the big picture.' ''

   RENT A MOVIE AT THE AIRPORT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bored airline passengers have a new way to help pass the time
when they find themselves stuck in an airport because of delays or
a long layover. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They can rent a portable DVD player and watch a movie. Frequent
fliers who have seen just about every in-flight movie can watch the
film of their choice, and children can be entertained with movies
appropriate to their ages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   InMotion Pictures has opened kiosks in seven airports, where for
$10 a day travelers can rent a battery-powered DVD player with
movie, headset and extra battery. Additional movies rent for $4 and
extra headsets are $2.50. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The laptop-size DVD players fall under the same in-flight rules
that apply to other electronic equipment like computers and
cassette players. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One-way rentals are available if the destination airport has an
InMotion kiosk. Multiple-day rentals include additional movies _
one for each day. Travelers with their own portable DVD players or
people whose laptop computers have DVD capability can rent just the
movie disk for $5 and return the disk by prepaid mailer within five
days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 200 movie titles, including children's films, classics and
new releases, are available at InMotion kiosks at the airports in
Denver; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Philadelphia; Portland, Ore.;
Seattle-Tacoma; San Diego; and San Jose, Calif. The company expects
to open in La Guardia Airport as well as in Atlanta, Cincinnati,
Orlando, San Francisco and Jacksonville, Fla., within the next
several months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Movies can be reserved at (877) 383-8646. More information is
also available at www.inmotionpictures.com.  &QL;

<P>
   A FLORENCE ARISTOCRAT WELCOMES GUESTS AGAIN  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Savoy in Florence, Italy has reopened after an
extensive two-year restoration aimed at upgrading its amenities.
</P>
<P>
   In the central Piazza della Repubblica, once part of the city's
Jewish neighborhood, the Savoy was built in 1893 as the offices of
an Israeli banker. Soon after it was completed, it was sold, and
the new owners transformed it into a hotel that quickly became a
favorite of the aristocracy. This is the third time the hotel has
been completely restored; in 1958, a fifth floor was added,
providing panoramic views of nearby monuments, such as the
Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore and Giotto's Campanile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, part of the RF Hotels chain, has 98 rooms and nine
suites, each with air-conditioning, two-line telephones, voice
messaging and interactive satellite television that keeps an
account of your bill day by day and also leaves messages for you.
The room decor is luxurious but simple, employing rich pastel
colored fabrics. Marbles and hand-crafted mosaics decorate the
modern baths. The common rooms, some still with the original
boiserie, retain a fin-de-siecle, Old World elegance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hotel restaurant, L'Incontro, serves traditional Tuscan
cuisine, and in summer tables are set out on the piazza. Doubles
start at $325 and go up to $1,112 for the Repubblica Suite, plus
tax. Breakfast ranges from $15.50 to $22 a person. Contact Hotel
Savoy, Piazza della Repubblica 7, 50123 Florence; telephone
(39-055) 27351, fax (39-055) 273-5888. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAGAZINE OFFERS A COLD WAR TOUR  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Call it a look behind the Iron Curtain: American Heritage
magazine, inspired by the popularity of its first D-Day tour last
year, will offer its first cold war tour Sept. 20 to 30. It traces
the origins of the cold war with visits to Berlin and Dresden in
Germany, and to Prague. Francis Gary Powers Jr., the son of the U-2
pilot shot down by the Soviets in 1960, will lecture the group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tour costs $3,899 a person, double occupancy, and includes
air fare from New York. The American Heritage tours are organized
by Historic Tours, a company specializing in World War II trips.
Call (877) 992-8687 or (800) 222-1170. On the Web, it's
www.americanheritage.com; for Historic Tours, www.ww2tours.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PARENTS' NIGHT OUT IN ST. THOMAS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Family vacations are wonderful, but sometimes Mom and Dad want
time alone together. The Bolongo Bay Beach Club and Villas in St.
Thomas offers parents a Date Night, one free night of baby-sitting
for every week's stay. The program, available through Sept. 30,
uses Nannies in Paradise, a company with licensed child-care
professionals. Rates are $145 per room, with up to two children in
the room, including a Continental breakfast. Also, children 12 or
younger eat free in the resort restaurant when their parents dine
there. Call (800) 524-4746. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SYDNEY AIRPORT GETS DOWNTOWN RAIL LINK  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Sydney can now travel quickly to town from the
Kingsford Smith airport by train. The recently completed domestic
and international terminal rail stations are part of a new route
segment that feeds into the city's extensive CityRail network. The
train ride from the international terminal to Sydney Central, a
main downtown transportation hub, takes 11 minutes and costs $5.35.
Trains will run from about 5 a.m. to midnight daily. At peak hours
they will run every 10 minutes, at off-peak hours, every 15
minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The international terminal's rail station is directly beneath
the northern end of the terminal. The domestic terminal's station
is beneath a nearby parking lot; underground passages connect it to
both Qantas and Ansett baggage-claim areas. The Sydney public
transport InfoLine, when calling within the city, is 131-500; Web
sites are www.sydneytransport.net.au or www.airportlink.com.au. &QL;

   PAY-SEXES _ In the war between the sexes, women are starting to
get even. In pay, that is. Latest salary survey from Working Woman
magazine shows that women continue to close the gap in pay in many
industries. But some fields are still behind. FYI, women
journalists on average make $10,000 less than their male
counterparts. (Joyner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

While big, Atlanta and Georgia seem to be regionally important but
relative lightweight on the national level in terms of cargo. The
biggies: Chicago/Illinois, California, Texas, Ohio, Michigan, i.e.,
autos and intermodal. At least one expert says globalization will
add to Atlanta's role on this front, adding new jobs. Trucks, by
the way, account for 80-plus percent of Georgia cargo both by
weight and value (bad news for atlanta highways). (Grantham,

   PAY-SEXES _ In the war between the sexes, women are starting to
get even. In pay, that is. Latest salary survey from Working Woman
magazine shows that women continue to close the gap in pay in many
industries. But some fields are still behind. FYI, women
journalists on average make $10,000 less than their male
counterparts. (Joyner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   CARGO _Atlanta's connections via rail, truck and air cargo.
While big, Atlanta and Georgia seem to be regionally important but
relative lightweight on the national level in terms of cargo. The
biggies: Chicago/Illinois, California, Texas, Ohio, Michigan, i.e.,
autos and intermodal. At least one expert says globalization will
add to Atlanta's role on this front, adding new jobs. Trucks, by
the way, account for 80-plus percent of Georgia cargo both by
weight and value (bad news for atlanta highways). (Grantham,

&HT;     CATHOLIC CHURCH STRUGGLES TO RECRUIT, RETAIN HISPANICS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By J. MICHAEL PARKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Catholic parishes need huge numbers of Hispanic
lay leaders and youth ministers, and they need them now, a
nationwide study has found.
</P>
<P>
   That spells a major challenge _ and opportunity _ for San
Antonio Catholic institutions that train such leaders, particularly
the Mexican-American Cultural Center (MACC).
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops commissioned the
study, called ``Hispanic Ministry at the Turn of the New
Millennium,'' to help them prepare for a four-day gathering that
begins Thursday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encuentro 2000'' will cover a host of intercultural issues
arising from the church's absorption of new immigrants, including
Asians and Africans. But their increasing numbers in the U.S.
Catholic community make Hispanics the most pressing challenge for
church leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Most immigrants from Latin American are Catholic, but both they
and the church are unprepared for the cultural differences they
face, said the Rev. Jose Gomez of Houston, president of the
National Association of Hispanic Priests.
</P>
<P>
   And if Catholics don't adjust to those differences, there are
plenty of evangelical Protestant churches already attracting
immigrants that are ready to welcome others, church leaders here
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Latin America, nobody registers in parishes, so when they
come to U.S. parishes, they don't register. And immigrants don't
mind if they're a little late for Mass, but priests don't like them
coming at just any old time,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Too many Catholic parishes are more regulation-oriented than
Gospel-centered, and are not reaching out to nonparishioners, said
the Rev. Virgilio Elizondo, MACC's founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Latinos, especially recent immigrants, don't understand
that,'' Elizondo said. ``I see storefront (evangelical Protestant)
churches opening in increasing numbers both in San Antonio and
other cities across the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The study queried bishops and diocesan coordinators of Hispanic
ministry nationwide and surveyed in detail eight dioceses that have
well-established Hispanic ministry offices, including Fort Worth,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Among U.S. dioceses, San Antonio has the fifth largest Hispanic
population (behind Los Angeles, Miami, New York and
Galveston-Houston), and it has grown by more than 23 percent since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   But Hispanics are spreading out in large numbers across the
nation instead of concentrating in Florida, New York, California
and Texas as in the past, said Gilberto Hinojosa, dean of graduate
studies at the University of the Incarnate Word, whose work was
cited in the study.
</P>
<P>
   The five dioceses with the fastest-growing Hispanic populations
are in areas not usually associated with Hispanics: Charlotte,
N.C.; Reno-Las Vegas; Atlanta; Raleigh, N.C.; and Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   In these areas and others, the church must play catch up in
reaching Hispanics, serving their needs, and integrating them into
parish life, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge and very complex problem. In the 19th century
and into the 20th, the worldwide Society for Propagation of the
Faith funded these types of needs. But I don't see anything like
that now,'' Hinojosa said.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found many dioceses, including some with large
Hispanic populations, where lay Hispanics are not sufficiently
trained for ministry leadership. And fewer than one-third of all
dioceses offer youth ministry, lay leadership or retreat programs
geared to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of dioceses still don't know what to do with Hispanic
ministry. It's a golden opportunity for us to help them focus on
the needs of immigrants,'' said Sister Maria Elena Gonzalez, MACC's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what MACC does in response will be influenced by the Los
Angeles meeting. But Gonzalez said MACC, already a national
resource in multicultural training, could add lay leader and youth
minister training programs by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already trained 30,673 people for Hispanic pastoral
ministry both on and off our campus,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Teams from MACC have worked in 96 U.S. dioceses in the past year
alone, including 24 of the 25 with the fastest-growing Hispanic
populations.

</P>
<P>
   Carlos Sandoval, a part-time minister at La Iglesia Biblica El
Camino in San Antonio, said it was partly the lack of good Bible
studies that prompted him to leave the Catholic Church in 1990. He
joined El Camino five years ago. About 60 people worship there on
an average Sunday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of members at this church are former Catholics
who had similar experiences,'' he said. ``The Catholic Church
didn't have much in the way of teaching what the Bible says. The
priest would talk a little about it at Mass on Sunday, but that
wasn't nearly enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he studied the Bible from a nondenominational church,
Sandoval said, he began to disagree with Catholic doctrines that
weren't in the Bible or appeared to contradict it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic Church has a lot of good teachings, but I didn't
find much in-depth teaching. I really hungered for God's word,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also knows the conflict that can occur in traditional
Catholic families when members join evangelical Protestant
churches. He said his conversion deeply upset his father, a devout
Catholic, who refused to discuss his son's interpretations of the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not familiar enough with it and doesn't feel
comfortable,'' Sandoval said.
</P>
<P>
   MACC founder Elizondo, now the executive producer of Catholic
Television of San Antonio, said the yearning for more systematic
Bible study is a common complaint. He has produced a 13-part video
series on the Bible in Spanish, available at the MACC bookstore,
and the Rev. Juan Alfaro, a teacher at MACC, has been developing a
Bible study course for parish use.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo Cruz, who directs the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops' secretariat for Hispanic affairs, said the church has only
2,005 Hispanic priests serving nationwide, and only 500 Hispanics
are studying for the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio is getting a few more Hispanic priests, including
three ordained by Archbishop Patrick Flores this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David Cruz, who completed his six-year term as rector
of Assumption Seminary this month, said 16 of its last 24 graduates
are Hispanic, though most went to other dioceses. Of 47 seminarians
enrolled in the past year, 24 were Mexican or Mexican-American and
three Colombian. They will be spread among 13 dioceses once
ordained, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gomez said most U.S. seminaries aren't friendly to
Hispanics. And Elizondo noted that ``Protestant storefront churches
call people to ministry very quickly and then keep educating
them,'' a factor that adds to the attraction of those churches for
lay Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Lawrence Stuebben, vicar general of the San Antonio
archdiocese, said San Antonio is a natural place to develop
solutions for the multiple challenges of Hispanic ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assumption Seminary is the premier seminary in the country for
Hispanic ministry training, and MACC is a big part of that. That's
why eight religious orders have their formation houses in San
Antonio,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assumption was a national pioneer in requiring bilingual
seminary education 60 years ago, long before it became common
elsewhere, he said.

unleashed a new round of fighting their almost yearlong war against

   SURPLUS _ WASHINGTON _ Like Uncle Sam finding a $20 bill in the
pocket of his striped pants on laundry day, the U.S. government
last month came up with an extra $100 billion in revenue over the
next 10 years. While this boost in the projected federal surplus
certainly sounds like good news, it raises some disquieting
questions. How can revenue estimates change so quickly, and can
they go down as fast as they went up? And could the new revenues
lead lawmakers to create spending or benefit programs that would be
hard to roll back if the windfall evaporates? (Deans, Cox News

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ How would Southern politics change - or would it
change at all _ if we knew all the dire predictions about global
warming were really true? With all the scientific controversy over
that subject we can't be sure. But if there's one area which could
be looked at as a present-day laboratory for the consequences of
such an unprecedented crisis, it lies along the Carolina coastline.
That's because whether global warming affects it or not, there is
convincing evidence that over the next 30 years, storms like the
one which caused record flooding in North Carolina last year will
increase in frequency. That increases the potential like more
environmental disasters like the one last year in which North
Carolinians saw their rivers polluted with the carcasses of
thousands of drowned hogs. But it also brings a risk of political
disaster, as South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges found out last year
when he ordered the coast evacuated for a disaster which didn't
materialize. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   TRANSEXUAL-MINISTER _ The Rev. Erin Swenson's heart thumped
wildly. She was so close to panic that her fingertips tingled.
Facing her, the crowd crammed inside the Shallowford Presbyterian
Church in Atlanta stared at her in disbelief. Swenson, an ordained
minister and father of two daughters, had just walked to the front
of the church in a green dress, heels and an eggshell-white blouse.
She was going to speak publicly for the first time about a
49-year-old secret that had driven her to thoughts of suicide.
Swenson told the hushed crowd that she was a woman born in a man's
body. Now that she had taken steps to correct that, she made an
unprecedented request before the assembly of Presbyterian church
leaders: Allow her to retain her ordination as a minister. Five
years later, Swenson is stepping back in the spotlight. She _ along
with , her ex-wife, daughter and father _ is are finally talking
about the extraordinary journey _ as a family and as individuals _
they have taken together since that autumn morning. (Blake, Atlanta

   CUMMINGS-COLUMN _If you find a regular alarm clock or clock

   COVER _ The idea seems obvious, so why didn't anyone think of it
before? ``Women get to accessorize with great shoes and handbags,
so why shouldn't our Palm Pilot covers and planners express who we
are and be fabulous also?'' asks Sunny Knox. The Dayton native, who
now makes her home in Los Angeles, theorized that women would be
anxious to replace ``black and boring'' accessory covers with those
more funky and fashionable. She figured right. Today Sunshine Knox
(her business card simply reads ``Sunshine'') is the president and
designer of Sunny Kate, a 1-year-old company that's already sold
thousands of items and is quickly becoming known for its upscale
accessories for women.

   ADAMS-YOSEMITE _ Yosemite National Park draws a whopping 3.6
million visitors a year _ making it one of the busiest sites in the
park system _ and many credit Ansel Adams' majestic black-and-white
photographs for its popularity. ``Every year I have to have an
Ansel Adams calendar of the park,'' said the Rev. David Johnson, a
Welches, Ore., minister. ``Now I want to see the vantage points
firsthand.'' The park plays to the fascination visitors have with
Adams by offering camera walks filled with basic instruction and
nifty details on where some of his classic images were executed. We
took the walk but also hiked independently, trying to view this
magnificent land in a way similar to the great photographer.

   ADAMS-PLAN _ Everyone who visits Yosemite National Park loves
its wide open spaces, yet, ironically, room to roam becomes
precious in summer because of all the visitors. In response, U.S.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt recently unveiled a proposal for
Yosemite that would eliminate about 65 percent of parking spaces in
Yosemite Valley and reduce a lot of overnight accommodations.

   EARLE _ Renegade country rocker Steve Earle is the last artist
one would expect to be a Savior. After building a reputation as one
of the most gifted _ and angry _ musicians in Nashville (and years
of herion addiction), he has become the icon of Americana music, an
eclectic collection of alternative country artists too esoteric for
mainstream radio. Earle's new album, ``Transcendental Blues,'' sold
20,000 copies during its first week of release, and remains at the
top of the Americana charts. He kicks off his national tour in
Atlanta on Tuesday, in a week loaded with Americana performances,
including Shelby Lynne and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. We talk to Earle
about the rise of alternative country, and the future of Americana
as a vital format. (Longino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    NEA OKAYS PETITION DRIVE FOR GUN CONTROL.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The National Education Association voted Monday to
launch a petition drive for Congress to pass ``meaningful gun
control'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   After a vigorous debate, a clear majority of the more than 9,000
delegates supported the motion urging affiliates of the teachers
union to collect signatures on petitions favoring ``licensure,
registration, bullet imprinting, child safety locks, (and)
mandatory background checks including waiting periods.''
</P>
<P>
   With a membership of 2.5 million, equal to nearly 1 percent of
the
</P>
<P>
   U.S. population, they hope to gather millions of signatures and
submit them to Congress by Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came after a slain Florida teacher was memorialized in
20 seconds of silence observed by delegates at the convention here
of the 2.5-million-member NEA, and at the convention in
Philadelphia of the 1 million-member American Federation of
Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last minutes of the last day of this school year in
Lake Worth, Florida, a 13-year-old student shot teacher Barry
Grunow in the face and killed him,'' said NEA President Bob Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said that when he and AFT President Sandy Feldman attended
a memorial service for Grunow in Palm Beach County, they learned
that Grunow was ``a devoted father, an inspired teacher, (who)
shared his passion for literature with all his children _ at home
and in school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In respect to Barry, and to show the resolve of both our
unions to support common-sense gun laws _ our resolve to make
America safe for children and teachers _ we will now join with our
brothers and sisters in the AFT in a moment of silence,'' Chase
said.
</P>
<P>
   After that emotional moment, it was difficult for opponents of
the petition drive to keep the attention of other delegates during
the debate in the hall and in the surrounding hallways at Chicago's
McCormick Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than calling for gun control, we need to call for
parental control and responsibility,'' said Cindy Gaskins of
Gwinnett County, Ga. She said the law would let bureaucrats
endanger her family by trying to force her to keep childproof locks
on guns she kept in her home for self-protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that metal detectors are more useful than gun
control in protecting the schools,'' said David Trim, a hunter who
teaches English in a high school in Hattiesburg, Miss. ``It seems
to me it would be better to control TV shows and video games and
movies that promote violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But strong proponents of gun control were unmoved, and others
who didn't feel strongly went along with the leadership's request
for approval of a petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're such a small, out-of-the-way place, we just don't have
the violence problems,'' said Lorraine Mares, who teaches third
graders in the South Conejos school district in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people used to say that in my school district before last
month,'' responded Perra Unger of West Palm Beach, Fla., who taught
in the same system as Grunow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support gun control just as strongly as Bob Chase does,''
Unger said. ``We are teachers; we are not soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   When teachers stood to vote on the gun control petition drive,
supporters appeared to outnumber opponents by a ratio of more than
two to one.

AUSTRIA THREATENS TO BLOCK EU INTEGRATION IF SANCTIONS CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Austria's frustration over European Union sanctions,
which had largely degenerated into a long-distance cat fight
between Austria and France, led over the weekend to threats to
block European expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel of Austria said Monday that the
sanctions would have to be lifted before the 15-member European
Union could admit any new countries. Approval of any of the dozen
countries seeking admission must be unanimous, and other reforms
are planned for December, so Austria could play spoiler if it does
not get its way.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel's remarks echoed some made earlier Monday by Joerg
Haider, the dominant figure in Austria's rightist Freedom Party,
which is in a coalition government with Schuessel's party.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions were imposed in February, to punish the country
for letting Haider's party into government. The party opposes
immigration, and some charge that it is racist and xenophobic.
Haider, a popular governor of a southern province, is best known
for making several offhand remarks in the past that seemed to
defend the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions have had no serious economic effect on Austria and
amount to a refusal by Cabinet ministers from 14 European countries
to meet publicly with their Austrian counterparts. But the
sanctions rankle with Austrians.
</P>
<P>
   In elections last October, running on an anti-big-government
platform, Haider's Freedom Party got 26.9 percent of the vote,
ending in a virtual tie with Schuessel's People's Party. After
negotiations broke down between Schuessel and the Social Democrats,
which had the largest percentage of votes, he formed a government
with the Freedom Party. Many Austrians are openly infuriated that
other countries, led by France and Belgium, felt they could punish
a fellow country that _ in the eyes of those Austrians _ had done
nothing illegal or anti-democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been simmering since the sanctions were imposed
five months ago, but flared again over the weekend, when France
took over the rotating presidency of the European Union. Both Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin and President Jacques Chirac, putting aside
their usual snide disagreements with each other, said they did not
expect the sanctions to be lifted this year.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Haider said Monday on Austrian national radio that,
``Now that France has said nothing will change during the French
presidency, we say quite bluntly that nothing will move either.''
And, with his habitually unguarded tongue, he said France, as
president, would find itself ``a noisy giant, like Gulliver, held
in chains by many dwarfs, unable to move.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian government is making plans to hold a referendum in
October asking voters how they feel about the sanctions. Schuessel
recently dropped his objection to the idea.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last month, European Union officials suggested a face-saving way
out of the quandary created when the union applied the sanctions
with little warning and virtually no public debate. A group of
``three wise men'' appointed by the European Court of Human Rights
would examine the human rights record of Austria and the Freedom
Party, particularly on immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel said Austria would cooperate. The country has strong
laws against espousing Nazi ideals and virtually no recent history
of racist, anti-Semitic or neo-Nazi violence. It has also, he
contended, accepted more refugees per capita than any other
country.
</P>
<P>
   He did ask that the court's inquiry be finished by September.
Chirac on Monday declined to set a deadline, saying, ``It's up to
them to take the necessary time.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider has complained that submitting his party to an inspection
of its political correctness is insulting.
</P>
<P>
   Other Austrians have pointed out that France has a tarnished
record on its treatment of immigrants and minorities and that it
also has a xenophobic political party. And they say that Germany
and Britain have many more violent neo-Nazi incidents, and that
Austria's immigration policies are in line with policies of other
European Union members even though it is especially vulnerable
because it borders on impoverished Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the other fallout from the squabble, it has
strengthened parties in Britain, Switzerland, Scandinavia and parts
of Eastern Europe that oppose deeper involvement by their own
countries in the European Union.

Baltimore to Boston, was revered during the so-called Brown Decades
of the mid-nineteenth century, then reviled by the century's turn,
when gleaming white limestone and marble captivated the public. But
preservationists and planners are beginning to see a new future for
the formidable stone. Architects have started using it to give a
touch of historical sobriety to gaudy mansionettes, and
conservators have begun renewing the elegant facades of grand
monuments. But the revival has sparked a debate on whether
brownstone should be used at all. Because the terrible secret is
that brownstone isn't really much good as a building material. By

THE NEXT CHAPTER IN THE BOOK OF LIFE: STRUCTURAL GENOMICS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Ind., Conn.)  By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Now that scientists have effectively determined the
complete sequence of human DNA, research teams are gearing up for a
follow-on project that many say will be every bit as ambitious and
difficult _ but also full of promise for medical research.
</P>
<P>
   The new endeavor focuses on proteins, which are the substances
made by the body in response to instructions provided by the genes.
It is actually the proteins that form the body and carry out its
functions, so they are in some sense of more direct relevance to
medicine than the genes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project has led to the discovery of genes
coding for the production of tens of thousands of proteins. But in
most cases, the functions of these genes and their proteins remains
unknown. One clue, however, could be provided by the shape of a
protein, since proteins interact with other molecules based on
their three-dimensional configuration, like keys fitting into
locks.
</P>
<P>
   So the new effort, known as structural genomics, aims to
determine the three-dimensional structures of thousands upon
thousands of proteins, much as the genome project determined gene
sequences en masse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically the next step after the Human Genome Project,''
said Dr. Helen M. Berman, a professor of chemistry at Rutgers
University and director of the Protein Data Bank, a federally
financed database of protein structures. ``Instead of a list of
letters, we'll understand biology in a three-dimensional way.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides helping to determine the function of a protein, knowing
its shape could also make it easier to design drugs that bind to
the protein, turning it on or off. AIDS drugs known as protease
inhibitors were designed using this so-called structure-based
approach. But the technique has not been widely used until now, in
part because the structures of many interesting proteins are not
known.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the quest for the genome itself, structural genomics
is being pursued by a big publicly financed project that will make
its data public and by private companies that will sell their data,
raising the prospect of the kind of public-private rivalry that
marked the genome effort.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of structural genomics say structure determination is
now where the genome search was about 15 years ago, when scientists
began to envision sequencing the entire genome, without knowing the
functions of the genes in advance, rather than working on one gene
at a time. In the past it took years to determine the
three-dimensional structure of a protein by examining protein
crystals using X-rays. But new techniques _ particularly powerful
X-ray generators known as synchrotrons _ have reduced the time to
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building tools that will allow us to solve structures at
a historically unprecedented rate,'' said Dr. Nathaniel E. David,
director of business development at Syrrx, a new structural
genomics company based here in San Diego. It has hired former
General Motors engineers to design robots to automate the process
of preparing and examining protein crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one believes it will be cheap or easy. ``This is big
science,'' said Dr. Tim Harris, president of Structural GenomiX
Inc., a year-old company also based here. Harris, who likens his
company to Celera Genomics, the private company that raced the
public consortium in the genome effort, expects to spend $100
million to $500 million to determine 5,000 protein shapes in five
years. ``This is not for the faint-hearted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the National Institutes of Health and Britain's
Wellcome Trust sponsored the first international structural
genomics meeting to discuss plans for the public project. The two
organizations are also the sponsors of the Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months the NIH will award grants for four to six
pilot projects in its Protein Structure Initiative. Total financing
for the five-year pilot phase could reach $100 million, said Dr.
Marvin Cassman, director of the National Institute of General
Medical Sciences, the NIH division coordinating the project. If the
pilots work, financing could grow much beyond that, though a final
figure is not known, he said. Projects are also getting under way
in Germany, Japan and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The striking parallels between structural genomics and genomics
raise questions about whether there will be the competition and
petty sniping that accompanied the efforts by Celera and the Human
Genome Project until their recent truce. ``I think everybody's
aware of it and everybody's thinking about it,'' said Dr. Raymond
C. Stevens, a professor of molecular biology at the Scripps
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   For now, both academic scientists and corporate ones say this
will not be the case. Celera and the genome project are pursuing
the same target, the complete human genetic code. But no structural
genomics company or laboratory will be able to do more than a small
subset of all proteins. And they will choose their targets
differently.
</P>
<P>
   The private companies will pick proteins that are medically
useful. The public project aims to determine the shapes of a wide
variety of proteins to understand protein structures better.
``We're choosing our targets on the basis of trying to cover as
much of the protein landscape as we can,'' Cassman said. ``That's
not the same thing as choosing your targets based on medical
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some applicants for NIH grants want to focus on medically
useful proteins. And the potential for conflict is there because
the public project calls for the structures to be placed in the
Protein Data Bank, freely available to all researchers. But the
private companies say they will offer most of their data only to
subscribers and will patent the structures and functions they
discover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to lock up as much of that proteome as we can,'' said
Dr. John Chiplin, president of GeneFormatics Inc., a start-up
company based here. The term ``proteome'' refers to all proteins
produced by a species, much as the genome is the entire set of
genes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The patenting of protein structures could be as disputed as the
patenting of genes. The federal Patent and Trademark Office has
begun granting patents on the three-dimensional coordinates of a
protein in a computer readable form. But new Patent Office
guidelines make it unlikely that patents will be granted on protein
structures unless the protein's function is known.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the public-private issue is that many of the
scientists seeking the NIH grants are also the founders of
companies. Stevens at Scripps is a co-founder of Syrrx, which is
being spun out of a Novartis research center here. Structural
GenomiX was founded by Dr. Wayne A. Hendrickson and Dr. Barry
Honig, both of Columbia University. Another company, Structure
Function Genomics in Princeton, N.J., is being started by Gaetano
T. Montelione and Stephen Anderson, both professors at Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is more conflict within the academic community
than between the public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists oppose the public project, saying that blindly
determining structures, rather than working on proteins of known
interest, is neither useful nor intellectually challenging. ``It's
really hack money,'' said Dr. Michael G. Rossmann, professor of
biological sciences at Purdue University. ``The concepts are to do
things very quickly without thinking, and I don't think that
creates good science.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of structural genomics point out that similar
objections were raised at first to the Human Genome Project. But
now, they say, most scientists agree that having the entire gene
sequence is extremely valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Structural genomics is just one endeavor spawned by completion
of the genome project. Another related one is proteomics, which
involves determining which proteins are in different cells and how
the proteins work together.
</P>
<P>
   The genome project is expected to lead to the discovery of tens
of thousands of genes, providing the input for structural genomics
and also the need for it. The challenge now is to figure out what
the genes do. Looking at the shape of the protein produced by a
gene is one way to do that. ``Form and function are tightly
coupled,'' said Sung-Hou Kim, a professor of chemistry at the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, scientists knew that a protein dubbed Tubby was
connected with obesity but did not know how it worked. So Dr.
Lawrence Shapiro and colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine determined the structure of the Tubby protein. Its shape
and positively charged face led them to deduce that the protein
binds to DNA, turning a gene on. With that clue, scientists can now
begin searching for the gene regulated by Tubby.
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics challenge how valuable structural genomics will
be. The shape can provide clues only about the type of molecule a
protein is, for instance, that it binds to DNA, but not what
metabolic pathway or disease it is associated with.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas A. Steitz, a professor of molecular biophysics and
biochemistry at Yale University, said that in many cases scientists
cannot tell anything about function from the shape. He also said
that many proteins are interlaced with others in the body, so the
shape they have when isolated is not the same as they are in the
body.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, structural genomics will tackle only a tiny subset of
all protein structures, making it far less comprehensive than the
Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because there are more proteins than genes, since
a single gene can make more than one protein variant and because
proteins can change shape as they act. Some experts think there are
several hundred thousand human proteins even though there are only
about 100,000 genes. Including plants, animals and micro-organisms,
there are millions of proteins.
</P>
<P>
   And it is almost impossible to determine the shapes of some
proteins because they cannot be made into crystals needed for the
X-ray crystallography. Proteins embedded in cell membranes _
estimated to be about a third of all proteins _ are almost
impossible to crystallize. And many of these are the very proteins
to which drugs bind.
</P>
<P>
   Also, even with the more efficient techniques, it can still take
weeks and cost tens of thousands of dollars to determine a single
structure. Structural GenomiX's slogan is ``5,000 proteins in 5
years.'' The NIH effort aims at about 10,000 to 20,000 proteins
over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some question how valuable such limited samples would be. ``With
a population of 6 million sequences, 5,000 structures in five years
doesn't cut the mustard,'' said Chiplin of GeneFormatics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of X-ray analysis, GeneFormatics plans to use computers
to predict the shape and the function of proteins, at the rate of
thousands of proteins a day. But computer analysis has its own
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Proteins are made of building blocks known as amino acids that
are arranged like beads on a string. But the string then folds into
a complex shape. A three-letter genetic sequence codes for each
amino acid, so it is straightforward to predict the amino acid
sequence from the gene. But no one has yet been able to predict how
this string of amino acids will fold.
</P>
<P>
   IBM Corp. is building a computer 500 times faster than any
available today to predict how a protein will fold by calculating
the atomic forces acting on the amino acid chain. Even with that
computer, it is expected to take an entire year of number crunching
to simulate the folding of a single protein, a job the body does
almost instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
   However, if a protein shares more than 30 percent of its amino
acid sequence with a protein with a known shape, computers can
estimate the unknown protein's shape reasonably well. Indeed, the
NIH project is based on the assumption that there are only several
thousand different classes of protein folds. Determining the
structure of several examples of each class would provide the data
necessary for computers to model virtually any other protein.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, structures estimated by computers are not
likely to be precise enough to use in drug design. So there will be
a need for physical structure determination.
</P>
<P>
   So both the public and private projects are going forward and
hoping to avoid the conflict that has marked genomics. ``One would
hope there might be some lessons learned,'' said Berman of Rutgers.
``One would hope.''

   MOSCOW _ Chechen suicide bombers have set off a series of
devastating blasts throughout the breakaway republic, killing at
least 37 Russian soldiers and wounding 74, Russian officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a carefully coordinated rebel attack late Sunday night, five
trucks laden with explosives exploded in towns and cities
ostensibly under Russian control. The bombings caught the Russian
military unprepared and took place just a week after the Russian
military declared the war all but won.
</P>
<P>
   As the toll of dead and wounded continued to climb _ one
unofficial count put it at 44 soldiers killed and 120 injured _
Moscow vowed to break the back of the rebel resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one thing that can be done, to find and crush
them,'' said Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, the deputy chief of staff of
the Russian forces, who called off a trip to Britain because of the
attacks. ``Talks will not help. You can see what is happening
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels said they were planning still more bombings, and
Grozny, the Chechen capital, was rife with rumors that it was about
to be attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The use of suicide bombings represents a new and bloody stage of
the war. In the nine months of fighting, Russian forces have swept
through the northern plains, seized the ruined capital of Grozny,
taken the major cities and towns in the Chechen lowlands and
pursued the Chechen rebels in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   What they have not been able to do is pacify the restive
population and weed out the enemies in their midst. Unable to take
on the heavily equipped Russian military on its own terms, the
rebels are mounting a guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels have infiltrated the major towns, drawing support from
local Chechens, embittered by the indiscriminate Russian attacks.
Col. Gen. Gennady Troshev, the commander of Russian forces in
Chechnya, insisted that he had recently instructed his troops to be
especially vigilant, particularly in inspecting trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But trucks full of explosives operated by suicide drivers still
managed to elude Russian checkpoints on Sunday and approach several
major towns, possibly leaving from a base near Serzhen-Yurt, a
settlement the Russians said they had seized last week in a fierce
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of the Russian laxity was painfully evident Monday.
In Argun, a town east of Grozny, which has been fought over several
times during this year, a truck filled with explosives smashed into
a dormitory housing militia from the region of Chelyabinsk in the
Ural Mountains. The militia's tour of duty had just ended, and they
were set to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, at least 30 died in the blast, which created a huge
crater, five yards deep and ten yards wide. Russian officials
conceded that the dormitory had been poorly protected.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The dormitory building was not well enough defended from the
outside,'' said Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Russian government
spokesman. ``As far as I know, the entrance to the territory was
blocked only by a Kamaz truck. There were no concrete barricades.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gudermes, which functions as the administrative capital of
the region, the Russian military was more successful. Two trucks
full of explosives were stopped at the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers were killed, and a Russian as well as Chechen
soldiers were killed when the trucks exploded. One of the suicide
truck drivers was believed to be trying to kill Akhmad Kadyrov, the
Chechen official picked by Russian President Vladimir Putin to
govern Chechnya, according to Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Another truck full of explosives, also believed headed for
Gudermes, was stopped near the settlement of Novogroznensky. It
rammed into an interior ministry unit, killing three and wounding
20.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another truck bomb exploded near the office of the military
commandant in Urus-Martan. The truck blew up as it tried to ram the
building, killing two soldiers in a concrete shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians later announced that they had detained 18 people
suspected of involvement in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,100 Russian soldiers have been killed and 6,000
wounded since Oct. 1. The nation is weary of the war, but not to
the point where the Russian public is willing to cede control of
Chechnya to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   With each bombing or ambush, the Russians seem to be become more
embittered. And with each air strike or artillery barrage, the
Chechen public seems to have become angrier at its Russian masters.
</P>
<P>
   On the Russian side, the Chelyabinsk region is an example. It
had promised to help restore the town of Argun, one of the targets
of Monday's bombings. But stung by the loss of its fighters, its
governor said it would no longer do so, ensuring that the
restoration of Chechnya would take longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they kill our guys I won't give them a ruble,''
said Pyotry Sumin, the governor of the Chelyabinsk region. ``And
nobody will make me do this.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Chechens, much of their enmity is directed not only at
the Russians but also at those Chechens who are cooperating with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Aslan Maskhadov, the separatist president of Chechnya before the
Russian intervention, essentially called for the death of Akhmad
Kadyrov, the Russian-appointed leader of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In an address that is recorded on videocassette and available in
Chechnya, Maskhadov called Kadyrov ``the main enemy of the Chechen
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people will appreciate the services of the one who manages
to remove him more than all the heroic deeds performed by Chechen
fighters in all wars in the course of the last 400 years,''
Maskhadov said.

NEW CHAPTER FOR MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Wednesday, July 05, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vicente Fox Quesada's victory in the Mexican presidential
election marks the defeat of a system of governance that has long
outlived its usefulness. The greatest accomplishment of the
defeated Institutional Revolutionary Party in recent years has been
the opening of the Mexican political system so that an outsider of
Fox's caliber could finally prevail.
</P>
<P>
   This party, known as the PRI from its Spanish initials, was
essential to the evolution of Mexican politics from the warlordism
of the 1910s and 1920s. By the 1980s, its rule had degenerated into
corruption and incompetence, unchecked by a strong opposition. The
party ought to have lost power to an insurgent candidate,
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, in 1988, but PRI control of the vote count
insured that its own candidate prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI had the good sense to gradually open up Mexico at levels
below the national government. Candidates for the Action National
Party, or PAN, took governorships, including in the state of
Guanajuato, won by Fox in 1995. Cardenas, from the leftist Party of
the Democratic Revolution, was elected mayor of Mexico City in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas ran again for president this year, but he was outpaced
by the charismatic Fox and the PRI's Francisco Labastida Ochoa. Fox
promises to increase funding for education and decentralize
government, but there isn't much else to set him apart from
Labastida. Both support foreign investment and free trade.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has deep roots throughout the country, but it has never
had to exist as a minority. Its greatest challenge now is to
reinvent itself.
</P>
<P>
   Through unions and land redistribution initiatives, the PRI was
supposed to represent the great mass of impoverished Mexicans, but
over the past 20 years it has drifted rightward. Poverty increased
in the 1990s despite growth in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Fox needs to address economic inequities without compromising
his free trade positions. If he does not, he should encounter
strong opposition from the left, perhaps from a reformed PRI. The
new openness in Mexican politics, happily, means that no man or
party will be able to get a lock on power.

&HT;     CLINTON AND LAZIO BOTH FACE TOUGH QUESTIONS ON CAMPAIGN
FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., voted against the use of
so-called soft money in federal elections and says he would
overhaul the nation's campaign finance system. Yet last month he
accepted such funds to pay for a television in his race for the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, has her own
campaign finance woes. Sullied by the 1996 White House fund-raising
scandal, although there is no evidence that she acted improperly,
Clinton is the subject of complaints to the Federal Election
Commission about her soft money intake.
</P>
<P>
   On the hustings, both the Democratic first lady and the
four-term congressman from Long Island support reforms to the
campaign finance system. Yet both will likely accept millions of
dollars in soft money, legal but unregulated and unrestricted
back-door donations, in a race in which the level of this funding
is expected to dwarf that in past statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was already set when Clinton was facing Republican New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said attorney Don Simon of the
non-partisan watchdog group Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to believe that fund-raising, with Lazio
replacing Giuliani, is going to be anything less than it was
before,'' Simon said. Although Giuliani bowed out May 19 amid
health and marital problems, ``this is still the hottest, most
contested race in the country. ... The candidates seem to be on
track to raise an unlimited amount of soft money. This is a
fund-raising frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has raised $5.1 million since April 1, while Lazio, who
had $3.5 million in his House war chest when he entered the race
May 20, has raised $4.5 million over the last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be immediately determined how much soft money
Clinton and Lazio received over the last three months. But watchdog
groups predict each one will ultimately rake in millions.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Lazio has not formed a joint fund-raising account with
the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which could pump soft
money into the race _ mostly through TV ``issue'' ads. Such ads,
like the one the Republican Leadership Council (RLC) took out last
month, can advocate for or against a candidate as long as they do
not urge viewers to vote one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, top state Republicans say privately that the New York
Republican committee alone could funnel as much as $3 million into
the race against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The latest numbers available show that as of March 31, Clinton
had $3.9 million in her joint account with the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee and the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Lazio has begun to follow the soft money trail.
</P>
<P>
   The RLC ad, still airing upstate, features shots of the
grinning, boyish congressman as a voice booms, ``Rick Lazio is a
leader. Call. Tell Rick Lazio to keep fighting for issues important
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely the kind of ad that Lazio condemned in two votes
in 1998 and 1999 to ban election propaganda paid for with soft
money. However, his campaign refused to have it pulled off the air,
just as it has not ruled out taking out-of-state donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Condemning the ad wouldn't get it off the air, praising it
wouldn't get it off the air,'' Lazio spokesman Dan McLagan said
when the spot debuted in early June. ``There's nothing we can do to
stop it, change it or move it. And frankly, there's nothing we can
do to stop the millions of dollars that are going to be pouring in
from out-of-state to help Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Lazio generally voted for campaign finance reforms
_ although he missed one vote this year and flip-flopped on another
to require tax-exempt political organizations known as ``527s'' _
such as the RLC _ to disclose their donor lists. Lazio voted for
disclosure in a third vote last week.
</P>
<P>
   He also voted for requiring political candidates to reimburse
the federal government for any use of official vehicles in
campaigns, and he favors barring contributions from non-citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Those are digs at Clinton, who has traveled on Air Force jets
while campaigning and was accused of indirectly accepting $50,000
from Los Angeles businessman Johnny Chung, who claims he funneled
money from Chinese officials to the Democratic National Committee.
The first lady has denied knowledge of the Chung donation.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign also claims it paid every bill it received from the
federal government. In February, that total was $34,000, though
Republicans estimate the real value was $180,000. Her campaign
would not provide updated figures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called for public disclosure of 527 organization
donor lists and has offered to cap soft money spending in the race
at $1 million _ a challenge both Lazio and Giuliani refused.
Clinton, too, enjoyed the benefit this month of a
soft-money-sponsored ad by the state Democratic Committee _ at an
estimated cost of $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady is also the target of a complaint accusing her of
improperly using soft money. The FEC confirmed it received the
complaint from Common Cause, Democracy 21 and Judicial Watch, but
would not confirm or deny that an investigation is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strictly abide by all campaign finance laws,'' said Clinton
spokesman Howard Wolfson, noting that the soft money account is
legal. ``We offered to work out an agreement that would limit the
use of soft money, and Congressman Lazio refused. And no one goes
into a ring with one hand tied behind her back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also inevitably faces being associated with the 1996
White House fund-raising scandal in which donors for President
Clinton's re-election campaign were enticed with sleepovers in the
Lincoln Bedroom and White House coffee klatches. There is no
evidence that the first lady was personally involved and she is not
expected to be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Simon of Common Cause says, ``She's going to have a hard
time shaking that baggage. She's associated with both the good and
the bad of her husband's administration. And one of the bad things
is the shameful behavior of the Clinton campaign and violating all
of the bounds of fund-raising excess in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect Lazio to have an easier time, Simon said,
especially if he adopts Giuliani's fund-raising tactics, which
pulled in $19 million in direct donations and hundreds of thousands
in soft dollars before he quit. ``Lazio certainly has no profile as
somebody interested in cleaning up the campaign finance schedule,''
Simon said.

 &HT;    RESENDING FOR ALL NEEDING
 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Nader's biggest threat is to an apathetic public
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the vanity of third-party candidates to believe that
because the political distance between them and the major parties
is so great, the narrower differences between Democratic and
Republican candidates is trivial.
</P>
<P>
   That was the subtext of the Alabama Gov. George Wallace's
white-backlash presidential campaigns. To yahoo cheers, the
combative states'-righter would declare that there ``isn't a dime's
worth of difference'' between the Republican and Democratic
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar will no doubt be coming from the demagog Pat
Buchanan once he starts running as the nominee of the Reform Party.
(Where is Ross Perot when you really need him?)
</P>
<P>
   And Ralph Nader is keenly huckstering the cliche as the
candidate of the Green Party's muddle of romantic and zealous
environmentalism, well-intentioned but ill-considered do-goodism
and unlikely economic leveling.
</P>
<P>
   The passive nominee of the Greens four years ago, Nader, gadfly
consumer advocate and hairshirt to heedless capitalism, is running
actively this time.
</P>
<P>
   Nader dismisses Gore and Bush as ``Republicrats.'' The only
difference between them, he says, ``is the velocity with which
their knees hit the floor when the big corporations knock on the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nonsense, as Nader's own campaign implicitly acknowledges
when he incidentally urges the election of a Democratic Congress.
How can party differences that matter so much in the House and
Senate not matter in the White House?
</P>
<P>
   Republicrats? Democrats would upgrade education by punching up
the resources of public schools. The preferred GOP answer is to use
tax-money vouchers substantially to replace public schools with
private, often sectarian ones.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore would shore up Social Security in strikingly
different ways. (Neither of them, by the way, fully credible.) Bush
is willing unilaterally to abrogate the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty; Gore seeks only to fine-tune it. Their environmental
records could not be more different.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on and the distinctions are not just superficial
or ones of only degree rather than of kind.
</P>
<P>
   And because the distinctions matter, Nader's claim is finally
not just nonsense but pernicious nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing it as he does, Nader is unlikely to bring voters
clamoring to his candidacy. Just the opposite. Americans prefer to
keep their political squabbles more over particulars than between
clashing ideological crusades.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's pitch most likely will just reinforce the dismissive
indifference by which a lazy electorate forfeits its democratic
franchise in stay-at-home apathy. The idea that Gore and Bush are
interchangeable fits the dangerous bill of goods we've sold
ourselves to the effect that politics doesn't matter; that it has
no consequences in our daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Out here in the real world, Nader won't talk many voters into
seeing him as offering a choice. Rather, he'll bolster the sorry
assumption that the realistic democratic choices don't matter.

   CATCHING METEOR FLASHES
</P>
<P>
   A mosquito hitting a bug zapper goes out, if not in a blaze of
glory, at least in a flash of light.
</P>
<P>
   Small meteors hitting that giant rock zapper known as the Moon
should go out in a flash of light as well, since their speed at
impact is on the order of tens of thousands of miles an hour. But
no unambiguous evidence of a lunar meteor flash has ever been
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, astronomers have reported detecting five impact
flashes last Nov. 18, during the annual Leonids meteor storm. The
flashes were observed using an eight-inch telescope in Monterrey,
Mexico (viewing time had been reserved on other, larger scopes, but
bad weather intervened), that was focused on the part of the Moon
that was in darkness. A report on the observations was published in
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The flashes were brief, less than two-hundredths of a second,
and occurred within a 90-minute span when the Moon was closest to
the Leonid stream of rocks and dust. The astronomers calculated
that the brightest of the impacts was caused by a rock with a mass
of 2.5 pounds to 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In preparatory observations in July 1999, the astronomers
recorded what they said was possibly another impact flash. If it
was an impact, and not electronic noise in the digital recording
device attached to the telescope, it was caused by a 30-pound
meteor, the astronomers said.
</P>
<P>
   UP, UP AND AWAY
</P>
<P>
   The people of New Mexico know about balloons. After all, it was
the crash of an experimental balloon in 1947 (according to the
military) that burned the name Roswell into the minds of UFO
believers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Given that history, it's hard to imagine what residents might
have thought recently when a huge pumpkin-shaped balloon lifted
into the skies near Fort Sumner, N.M. The flight, which lasted 30
hours and reached 93,000 feet, was a test of a new type of research
balloon designed to carry telescopes and other instruments to over
115,000 feet and stay there for at least three months. The balloons
are meant to be a cheaper way to get such instruments to the edge
of space.
</P>
<P>
   When fully developed, the long-duration balloons should be
almost as big as a football field, and able to carry payloads of
close to two tons (the prototype was only about one-tenth as big).
The balloon owes its pumpkin shape to tendons running along the
thin polyethylene surface that take most of the load. There were no
reports of Cinderella sightings, however.
</P>
<P>
   FRUIT FLY'S NEW ROLE
</P>
<P>
   If there were a Research Insect Hall of Fame, the fruit fly
would be among the first inductees. Drosophilae, as the flies are
more formally known, have been smeared, stained, injected,
dissected, mutated and extracted by the gazillions. They even had
their genome sequenced before humans (though without quite as much
fanfare).
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases and the Whitehead Institute have come up with a
new laboratory role for fruit flies: as a model for studying
malaria.
</P>
<P>
   The parasite, Plasmodium, is normally carried by mosquitoes,
which transmit it to people through bites. While in the mosquito,
the parasite goes through several stages of its life cycle. But
studying exactly how the parasite affects its host is difficult, in
part because not all that much is known about mosquitoes' genetic
makeup or basic biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the fruit fly comes in. The researchers have
figured out a way to grow the parasite in Drosophila. And because
so much is known about fruit flies, including their entire DNA
sequence, they make a good laboratory model for studying the
effects of Plasmodium. Already the researchers have identified
elements of the insect's immune system that attack the parasites,
helping to explain why some mosquitoes effectively fight off
infection.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Customary summer heat will reign from the deserts of the
Southwest to the central and southern Plains to the Southeast and
Middle Atlantic States under the auspice of an upper-air
high-pressure system. Heat will be tempered across parts of
Missouri and middle Mississippi Valleys as thunderstorms erupt in
clusters along the edge of the upper-level ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures will tumble into the 40s over the interior of the
Northwest early Tuesday morning, symptomatic of the cool air mass
over the region. Isolated showers will speckle the Bitterroots of
Idaho, the Cascades of Oregon and Washington and the Klamath
Mountains of Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   A drier air mass will move into the Northeast on the heels of a
cool front. With sunshine returning, the day will be warmer in many
areas than it was Monday.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS:
</P>
<P>
   APHELION
</P>
<P>
   Although this is hottest time of year, Earth reached its
farthest point from the Sun, or aphelion, Monday. But the Northern
Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, accounting for the greater
energy that reaches northern latitudes compared with when Earth
makes it closest approach in January. Although in the current era,
Earth is farther from the Sun in the Northern Hemisphere summer,
that is not always the case. Earth wobbles on its axis like a
spinning top. As a result of the slow wobble, 11,000 years from
now, Earth will be closest to the Sun during the northern summer.

GRACE JONES MUST SAY GOODBYE TO THE LAST LITTLE DRESS SHOP IN
TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALADO, Texas _ It's a typical western tale. The crucial
shipment to the small Texas town is hijacked. The loss could amount
to thousands of dollars. The heroine is seen wringing her hands in
dismay. This setback could ruin her business, she could lose the
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Young rides to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The heroine is Grace Jones, and she is always at the center of
big events in incongruous places, surrounded by an unlikely cast.
The fact that Loretta Young once came to her rescue when a
planeload of designer evening wear was hijacked is not in the least
bit strange.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is a tiny person who lives large. She's been a pilot, a
model, an ambassador, and most recently, a specialty store owner.
During World War II, she was one of the first WASPS (Women's Air
Service Pilots), who ferried T-38s and C-47s from coast to coast to
free up the male pilots for combat missions. She was a John Robert
Powers model in New York City, and appeared on live television
shows with the likes of Ed Sullivan. She married Lt. Col. Jack
Jones after the war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, the Joneses retired to Salado. He wanted to ranch. She
wanted to open a dress shop.
</P>
<P>
   Her desire was to have a dress shop the way they used to be. The
kind of place where ladies shopped for fine goods. A place where
the clothes are kept behind closed doors and only a few accessories
are displayed in the public rooms.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted an old-fashioned place where the front room looks
like a parlor with ceiling-to-floor ivory drapes and dainty pieces
of antique furniture grouped in small clusters, where the carpeting
is deep and there is a hush, similar to the kind in funeral
parlors.
</P>
<P>
   There would be saleswomen with deferential airs and the
appraising eyes of Bedouin horse traders, who would inquire if they
can assist. The customer, not a browser or a comparison shopper, is
expected to know what she needs _ a cocktail dress, a day dress,
something casual, an evening gown.
</P>
<P>
   She states her mission, and soon is standing on a small stage in
front of a three-way mirror, in a dressing room the size of a small
bedroom. Here, she is presented with a selection of cocktail frocks
or daytime dresses that are specifically chosen for her size, in
flattering colors and styles that would be suitable.
</P>
<P>
   Tea is served in china cups, drinks in goblets brought in on a
silver tray. If the customer is a regular client, the saleswoman
knows exactly what she bought on previous occasions. The store
keeps a permanent record of your fashion purchases. Can't remember
what you have? Just ask your saleslady.
</P>
<P>
   Saleswomen inquire if the purchase is for a special occasion,
and if it is, the customer is not shown any style that has already
been purchased by someone else for the same event.
</P>
<P>
   Cost might be a consideration, but money is rarely discussed. A
few subtle expressions indicate what is an acceptable price range,
and transactions proceed from there. If a dress is selected, it is
expertly fitted, altered by seamstresses on staff, and then, days
later, arrives in a big box, wrapped in glorious enameled paper and
tied with a moire ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   The bill comes later. In this kind of shop, blouses cost
hundreds, suits thousands and evening gowns tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Jones wanted that sort of store. She would name it Grace Jones,
and she wanted to carry the very best clothing from New York's best
designers, but that was the extent of her business plan. She took
it to 10 bankers in the Central Texas area. Yes, she realized
Salado was then a town of 250 people. She admitted she had no
previous retail experience. She claimed to have no collateral, but
she had a location _ the empty shell that had been Salado's old
bank and post office. It was nothing but walls of hand-cut
limestone blocks with no roof and years of accumulated rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, they all turned her down.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had her own money, didn't need the bankers' help, she
needed their attention. A few months later, after Bryant Reeves, a
Belton-based builder, had refurbished her building, she opened with
a party attended by 10 very curious bankers' wives. What may have
sounded like lunacy to their husbands looked good to their wives,
and they told friends, friends told friends, and soon the
limousines were cruising Salado's gravel streets and Learjets were
landing in the pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Jones paired big Texas names such as Liz
Carpenter, Carolyn Farb and Jane Sibley with labels such as James
Galanos, Christian Dior, Geoffrey Beene and Christian Lacroix. She
became an indefatigable champion of using fashion shows for charity
fund-raisers.

 KIDS CONSIDER CONTACT LENSES FOR COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of children and adolescents who wear contact lenses
is rapidly growing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which began regulating
contact lenses in 1976, estimates that 30 million people in this
country now wear them. Approximately 3 million of these people are
16 years old and younger. While female contact lens wearers
outnumber males two to one, the proportion of males opting for
contacts is also growing.
</P>
<P>
   This news is hardly surprising. Lenses are more comfortable,
easier to wear, easier to care for and more affordable than they
have ever been before.
</P>
<P>
   Between the ages of 11 and 15, nearsightedness (also called
``progressive myopia'') gets worse as children experience a period
of rapid growth. While there are no set rules concerning the age at
which kids are old enough to wear contact lenses, most children who
use contacts begin wearing them in middle school, at the age of 10
or 11.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, a child's motivation, motor skills and maturity
determine readiness. A child may desperately want to wear lenses,
but lack the dexterity and discipline that is necessary to care for
them. One optician quips, ``Your child isn't ready if you still
have to remind them to brush their teeth in the morning!''
</P>
<P>
   Because self-esteem is often related to how they look and how
they are perceived by others, most kids feel better about
themselves when they wear contacts rather than glasses. This is
increasingly true for young boys as well as girls.
</P>
<P>
   Lenses remove the weighty bridge of the eyeglass frame that
rests upon (or alternatively slides up and down) the nose. They
also eliminate the temples (arms) of the eyeglasses that cause
pressure on the ears and obstruct peripheral vision. Kids and their
parents no longer have to worry about glasses that fog up in the
winter or that get wet in the rain. Unlike glasses, contacts are
not likely to get sat on, stepped on, left at school or left at
someone else's house.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of contacts are especially significant for young
athletes. With lenses, soccer players don't need to wear glasses
that can fall off, break or injure them. Hockey players are better
able to see the puck; glasses can't be worn during play because
they fog up under a helmet. Contact lenses remain comfortably
stable in the eyes during cheerleading, dancing, karate, football,
tennis or golf.
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of eye care professionals that are licensed
to dispense lenses, including ophthalmologists, optometrists and
opticians. Whatever choice is made, it is important to select
someone who is experienced and who routinely sees kids in their
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Mail order is never appropriate for a first pair of lenses. It
is imperative that children or teens receive a complete in-person
examination and fitting.
</P>
<P>
   Because working effectively with kids requires time and
patience, finding someone who specializes in contact lenses may be
a better choice than a practitioner with a busy corrective surgery
practice. Such an individual is generally more willing to solve the
unique fitting problems posed by small eyes and awkward fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Lenses were once exclusively made of hard plastic. Baby-boomers
were the first generation to wear them. Because these little pieces
of hard plastic were relatively new, expensive and difficult to
wear, they were used primarily by vain teen-age girls or young,
single women.
</P>
<P>
   The first major innovation came in the early 1970s when soft
contact lenses were introduced into the market. Rigid gas permeable
lenses came nearly a decade later, greatly increasing comfort and
wearing time by allowing more oxygen to pass through the lens to
the cornea. The market for contacts has now grown to more than 350
different brands, with most adults and children opting for soft
ones. In fact, soft lenses made out of new, more pliable materials
outnumber all other types by four to one.
</P>
<P>
   Soft lenses are easier to wear for a number of reasons. Unlike a
rigid, hard lens, they conform to the shape of the eye and provide
greater comfort. This means that a child who is fitted with soft
lenses can get used to them in a matter of days. Because they are
larger, soft lenses are less likely to pop out than rigid lenses.
</P>
<P>
   There are trade-offs. Rigid lenses are easier to care for and
less likely to rip during handling. Their use is also less likely
to lead to infection.
</P>
<P>
   Because soft lenses act like little sponges, they can attract
irritants such as smoke in the air. Soft lenses are also more
likely to absorb soaps, lotions and other unwanted residues during
handling. Finally, some wearers complain that vision with soft
lenses is less sharp than with rigid ones.
</P>
<P>
   Soft lenses can either be disposable (worn once and thrown away)
or replacement lenses that are replaced according to a schedule
prescribed by the practitioner (generally every two to four weeks).
</P>
<P>
   Among children, the use of daily disposables is becoming
increasingly common. While, over the course of a year, these lenses
are slightly more costly, the additional costs are offset by the
elimination of the need for expensive cleaning and soaking
solutions. Time saved in maintenance and care often makes these
no-fuss lenses attractive to busy kids and their busy moms.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing price, two-week replacement lenses general cost about
$200 per year for the cost of the lenses. The cost of daily
replacement lenses runs slightly higher. A pair of rigid, gas
permeable lenses may run between $140 and $160.
</P>
<P>
   Poor hygiene or improper use of contacts can pose serious safety
risks, such as irritation, infection, corneal ulcers and even
blindness. Therefore, before leaving the practitioner's office, a
child needs to learn the essentials of use and care.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the eye doctor will do this training; in other
cases, a technician takes over. Important information must be
conveyed in a supportive, step-by-step manner that uses
age-appropriate vocabulary that children can understand. A
take-home, written version of the instructions is helpful for
parents who generally will be called upon to troubleshoot at home.
</P>
<P>
   Most eye doctors will follow a patient for at least one or two
visits (which are included in the initial examination and fitting
fee). Because a very small proportion of potential users do not
adapt to contacts for one reason or another, it is useful for
families to ask in advance about the practitioner's refund policy.
</P>
<P>
   Because kids prefer to wear their contacts as long and as often
as possible, parents need to be vigilant to make sure that misuse
or overuse doesn't occur. Sleeping in lenses or wearing them for
too many hours increases the risk of complications. Dr. P. Sarita
Soni of the School of Optometry at Indiana University observes that
adolescents either tend to ``be asymptomatic because they have a
higher discomfort threshold'' or that these teens conceal lens-care
associated problems, so they can continue wearing their lenses at
any cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that new laser vision-correction technology has
revolutionized vision care for adults, surgical options _ even
implants _ may someday replace conventional glasses and contacts
for children. At present, though, these procedures are generally
not appropriate for children whose eyes are still developing and
changing.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to remember that while the use of contact lenses
by kids is more common than ever before, it still may not be the
right choice for every child.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Saviola of the FDA remarks, ``Parents should discuss
all options with an eye care provider they have confidence in to
determine the best option for their child.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The pepper tree in front of the Francis Doud House in Monterey
is so massive and gnarled that I'm tempted to plunk myself into the
crook of its weighty arms and pretend that I've fallen back in
time. Inside the picket fence, where the faint chocolate smell of
viburnum mixes with the perfume of ``Philadelphus'' it's easy to
imagine the landscape architect, Florence Yoch, raking the walkways
of this compact garden, as she did just two days before her death
in 1972 at the age of 81.
</P>
<P>
   Yoch designed the landscape for Tara in ``Gone With the Wind,''
the olive groves of ``Romeo and Juliet'' (the 1936 version with
Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard), and the gardens of such Hollywood
estate owners as George Cukor and David 0. Selznick.
</P>
<P>
   The Doud garden is a far cry from these elaborate creations, yet
it bears her dramatic signature. Wisteria climbs the columns of a
pergola, twining with languorous 'Belle of Portugal' roses, black
velvet salvias border the paths and slender stalks of ``Gladiolus
tristis'' shoot up daintily. At night you can smell the fragrance
of these gladioli a block away.
</P>
<P>
   The garden at the Doud House, an 1860s clapboard house built in
New England style by a wealthy entrepreneur, is but one of the
city's 12 historic gardens. Some are so hidden away behind adobe
walls that the locals refer to them as ``secret gardens.'' They're
smack in the middle of the city, part of a public park system that
runs through old Monterey, but you would never find them without a
map.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the gardens belong to the state of California,
bequeathed by descendants of their original owners. Years of
neglect had left them looking bedraggled and withered until four
years ago, when a group of passionate local gardeners _ under the
aegis of the Historic Garden League _ committed itself to the work
of restoring some of these spaces. They began with the Doud House,
where ivy so completely shrouded the L-shaped garden that you could
hardly see the double stairs leading up to the little back porch
with its expansive views of Monterey Bay.
</P>
<P>
   For several long weekends they came with their gloves, rakes,
pruning shears, hoes and garbage bags, and when they were finished,
they had taken out six truckloads of ivy. Now you can enjoy a
formally pruned yew and an old almond tree, planted, as was the
wisteria, by Yoch. Around the corner, an olive jar from Italy,
large enough for a child to climb inside, stands by the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Al Graham, a volunteer docent for the Historic Garden
League, smiles at the memory of all that work as he guides me
around town to see the Doud House, the Robert Louis Stevenson
House, the Pacific House and the Cooper-Molera Adobes.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't want a better escort than Graham, a 60-something
local historian, amateur horticulturist and natural-born teacher.
His family has lived in Monterey since 1800, when his
great-great-great-grandfather arrived as a corporal with the
Spanish Mission and was awarded an eight-mile-long land grant for
his service.
</P>
<P>
   Given this legacy, it's not surprising that almost every street
in Monterey yields a harvest of immediate and ancestral memories
for Graham. ``This was once the governor's house,'' he tells me,
peering through the window of the empty Alvarado adobe. ``His wife
lived in a house across town and he installed his mistress here _
she was one of my relatives. One day, he took her to a party and
people were so outraged that they threw him out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's stories helped guide my meanderings through the various
gardens as we followed the trail of bronze medallions that, like
Hansel's bread crumbs, define the ``Path of History.'' A map is
free at the visitor's bureau.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite garden turned out to be the half-acre retreat behind
the Robert Louis Stevenson House, an old boarding establishment
named for the author who stayed here for six weeks in 1879.
According to local legend, his descriptions of ``Treasure Island''
were inspired by the landscape of Point Lobos about six miles south
of Monterey, with its rocky cliffs and cypress trees.
</P>
<P>
   The peaceful garden is not small by any means, yet it feels
intimate with lots of nooks and private spaces, benches and
birdbaths. Laid out in the 1940s by a local gardening group, the
design is a Victorian fantasy with narrow winding paths looping
around free-form beds. These beds overflow with masses of Icelandic
poppies, cineraria and ``Iochroma'' and give the garden a lush,
flowery look quite different from Spanish-style courtyards, where
wide-open plazalike spaces are planted only around their
perimeters.
</P>
<P>
   The Stevenson garden has as its centerpiece a 40-foot-tall dawn
redwood, an unusual deciduous variety of sequoia brought back from
China 60 years ago by botanists from the University of California
at Berkeley. Every few weekends, the volunteer gardeners march in
to uproot invasive agapanthus.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and I follow the Path of History to the Pacific House, a
former soldiers' barracks across from the Monterey waterfront. The
courtyard of the adobe barracks, called Memory Garden, was designed
in Spanish colonial style in 1926 by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., son
of the landscape architect responsible for Central Park in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   After studying with his father, Olmsted the younger went on to
design Washington's National Mall. A 7-foot-high stucco wall
encloses the courtyard, which is wide enough for 600 people to
gather at one time. And they do, at receptions and barbecues, such
as the Merienda, Monterey's annual birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   Four stately southern magnolias, each about 70 years old, mark
the center of the main courtyard and an enormous blue wisteria
spills over a stucco wall. A hedge of 80-year-old fuchsias and
'Cecile Brunner' roses separates the courtyard from a narrow,
adjoining garden where a Mediterranean-style fountain made of
24-karat-gold tiles glitters in the sun, a 'Ponderosa' lemon tree
yields fruit bigger than grapefruit and a dwarf pomegranate bush
blooms with orange crepe-paper-like flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Olmsted's blueprints for the garden still exist, and they were
consulted during the recent restoration. But of all the secret
gardens in Monterey, the most historically accurate is the
two-and-a-half acre plot within the 19th-century Cooper-Molera
complex, a National Trust site on the Path of History.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Grate gets credit for that. A slight woman, Grate is so
strong-willed and determined that you don't notice at first how
small she is. With a master's degree in history and a love of
gardening, she was well prepared for the job. In 1985, when the
state was completing the restoration of the Cooper-Molera, Grate
looked around, saw precious little planting and asked the
superintendent of state parks if she could have a hand in creating
a historic period garden for the 1830 house. Go for it, was the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   For the next five years, Grate consulted old paintings and
drawings, tracked down 150-year-old seed and flower catalogues for
a listing of what varieties were available and popular during the
gold rush era and visited libraries throughout the state to pore
over horticultural magazines and books.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to her alma mater, Duke University, where a botany
professor allowed her to copy ``The Botanical Register,'' an
English publication with introduction dates of species worldwide.
Her final plant list had one major premise: Everything on it had to
have been introduced to California prior to 1865, the year John
Rogers Cooper and his wife left Monterey for San Francisco. The
fruit trees in the orchard, the tea rose and 'Jeanne d'Arc' rose
bushes, the culinary and medicinal herbs are all horticulturally
true to the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a love for the romance of where plants come from,''
Grate says. Most importantly, Grate researched the history of the
family for whom the adobe was named. Cooper was a Yankee sea
captain who first sailed his ship into Monterey in 1823 and soon
after fell in love with the much younger Encarnacion Vallejo, a
member of one of California's most illustrious families.
</P>
<P>
   In doing her research, Grate found herself increasingly drawn to
Encarnacion. The deeper Grate delved, the stronger Dona
Encarnacion's presence became, until eventually one of her main
goals was to create a garden where the 19th-century matriarch would
be right at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel her sometimes just over my shoulder,'' Grate says. ``If
she were here, she would ask me, 'Where is the Madonna lily?' And I
would tell her, 'I tried, I tried many times to grow it, but it's
not happy in this garden.' Being religious, however, she would want
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Catholicism was such an important part of Encarnacion's
life, Grate sought to include flowers with a religious connotation,
like the passionflower, a vine brought to California from Brazil by
priests. Each part of the flower resonates with Christian
symbolism: The fringe recalls Christ's Crown of thorns; the five
stamens stand for the five wounds upon his body; and the three
pistils represent the Holy Trinity.
</P>
<P>
   Only one remaining apple tree planted by John Cooper still bears
fruit, so Grate restocked the orchard with additional varieties:
'Bellflower' 'Winter Pearmain', 'Red Astrachan' and 'Gravenstein.'
</P>
<P>
   She oversaw an herb garden with all the essentials, from
calendula (once used for thickening gravy) to lemon verbena (which
housewives would let boil in a pot of water to imbue their houses
with lemon fragrance). The garden exudes a serenity and charm that
make it a haven from the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Just on the other side of the adobe wall there's a Safeway
parking lot full of cars, SUVS and shopping carts, but you'd never
know it wandering through John Cooper's orchard, pausing beside the
hollow walnut tree, or stepping around one of the Minorca chickens.
Originally from Spain, they, too, are historically accurate. Their
ancestors came to California with the padres.

 PET BIRDS CAN BE BURDENSOME BUT REWARDING

<P>
   ``My birds are infinitely more intelligent than my other pets,''
says Ellen Phillips, managing editor of pet books at Rodale Inc.,
in Emmaus, Pa., and owner of two parrots, a golden retriever and
two cats. ``The older bird taught my new one to speak English in
two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   A bird's intelligence, however, can lead to unforeseeable issues
in its care. Bringing a bird into the family should be well
considered, for birds are complex, intelligent creatures and have
challenging physical and emotional needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest misconception about birds is that they're
'no-maintenance' pets,'' says Dr. Stephen Zawistowski, science
adviser and certified applied animal behaviorist for the ASPCA in
New York City. ``Birds care if you're around, and almost all need
companionship, either from other birds or people.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you invest in a bird as a pet, find an avian veterinarian
who can advise you on the different types of pet birds and put you
in touch with local bird owners and clubs. Be advised: It is
illegal to take a bird from the wild.
</P>
<P>
   After you've chosen from the many pet bird varieties _ gentle
songsters like finches and canaries, friendly parakeets and
cockatiels, or big, bold parrots and cockatoos _ select the
largest-possible cage that your living space can accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever size is recommended, buy larger,'' Zawistowski
stresses. ``And set up the cage according to the type of bird:
Finches need to hop around, for example, while parakeets need to
climb. Vary toys and perch thicknesses.'' And have patience while
your new companion adjusts to its new surroundings and
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe that birds can improve our outlook on life
in general. In an animal-assisted therapy program at the Oakwood
Correctional Facility, a short-term mental health facility for
troubled prisoners in Lima, Ohio, male inmates may elect to assume
responsibility for a bird. As activities therapist Karen Bosch
explains, ``The men live with the birds in their cells and form
close bonds with them. They give the birds _ parakeets and
cockatiels _ almost round-the-clock attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these men aren't used to the open-hearted love they
receive,'' Bosch continues. ``The birds help bring them out of
depressions and teach them coping and socialization skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Birds require patience, time and knowledge if they are to be
nurtured as companion animals in the home. We, in return, are
nourished by their music, beauty and friendship _ rewards that far
surpass the effort.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL HEALTH CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   Birds hide illnesses to protect themselves from predators, so
careful daily observation and annual checkups are musts. To find a
vet, try the Web site of the Association of Avian Veterinarians:
www.aav.org.
</P>
<P>
   Birds require balanced diets and constant access to clean water.
Hidden dangers include household fumes from nonstick cookware and
poorly designed toys and perches. For more bird information, try
the ASPCA's Web site _ www.aspca.org _ and the American Animal
Hospital Association's Web site, www.healthypet.com.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three-year-old Siderah Bentley's parents have given her herbal
remedies since infancy. When she had fever and congestion as an
infant, elderberry juice eased her symptoms within a half hour.
Dandelion root tea worked wonders when Siderah complained of pain
when she urinated. Now, on days when she's cranky, chamomile tea
calms her down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbal medicines have been around for centuries, so they have
a longer safety record than conventional drugs, which means I feel
more comfortable using them on my child,'' says her father, Andrew
Bentley, a professional herbalist in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Calise Finney is a more recent convert. When she noticed
that her son Max's ears were inflamed, she was reluctant to load
her 1-year-old with antibiotics, the standard treatment for ear
infections. So her family physician, who has incorporated
alternative medicine into her practice, recommended an antidote
that sounds as though it were lifted from a 19th-century
apothecary's stores: ear drops fortified with licorice, echinacea,
mullein and calendula.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my first experience treating an ear infection with
herbals _ and he got well without antibiotics,'' says Finney,
director of a learning center in Boulder, Colo. ``That really sold
me on herbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynnell Ramey wishes she had used them sooner. ``Our previous
pediatrician overused antibiotics,'' says Ramey, a 30-year-old
mother of three who lives in Gainesville, Ga. ``Now my middle
child, who's 4, has a few infections we're having a hard time
getting rid of because he was given so many antibiotics for
recurrent ear infections when he was younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ann Sheth, a pediatrician in Lawrenceville, Ga., suggested
that Ramey try several milder herbal products to treat her youngest
child's colds and congestion. To Ramey's surprise, they worked.
Now, whenever he gets the sniffles, she'll put a few echinacea
drops in his apple juice to disguise the herb's tart taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stops the symptoms in their tracks,'' says Ramey, who
admits she ``was very doubtful initially about using herbs. But Dr.
Sheth had experience using them, and I trusted her judgment. I'm
glad I did.''
</P>
<P>
   These parents' stories echo those of thousands of others who
have recently discovered age-old folk remedies, often with the
recommendation of family doctors who are adding herbal remedies _
for example, echinacea to stave off colds and flu, chamomile or
lavender to treat colic, calendula to soothe diaper rash and ginger
root to quell queasy little stomachs _ to their disease-fighting
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal medicine has become big business. Last year, Americans
snapped up nearly $4 billion worth of herbal products from the
shelves of supermarkets, pharmacies and health food stores. Fueling
these soaring sales, at least in part, is growing scientific
evidence indicating that some of these products really can ease the
symptoms of many minor ills. That also explains why alternative
medicine is gaining acceptance by the medical mainstream and more
doctors are getting up to speed on botanical remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use them routinely in my practice,'' says Dr. Kathi J.
Kemper, director of the Center for Holistic Pediatric Education and
Research at Children's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one 1998 survey, conducted by researchers at Wayne
State University School of Medicine in Detroit and the Medical
University of South Carolina in South Charleston, revealed that
half of the pediatricians polled would consider referring their
patients for therapies such as homeopathy, acupuncture and herbal
supplements to treat benign childhood ills such as scrapes, stuffy
noses, and stomachaches.
</P>
<P>
   Even more startling were the results of a 1998 study of local
physicians conducted by Kemper at the Swedish Medical Center at the
University of Washington in Seattle. At the height of the cold
season, one-third of the doctors surveyed were treating their own
colds with echinacea and zinc, and half were found to be taking
vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   However promising these herbal medicines sound, though, be aware
of some important caveats before you treat your child with them.
First, the herbal supplement industry is poorly regulated by the
FDA. The agency will step in if a product claims to cure a
condition, but many herbals say only that they may be of help in
easing certain symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Second, some botanical remedies, many of which have not been
tested specifically on children, can have powerful and unexpected
side effects. This makes it imperative that you check with your
child's doctor or health care practitioner before administering any
herbal product, however innocuous it may seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents need to be careful _ they should not just go to the
health food store and start picking things off the shelf,''
cautions Dr. Tierana Low Dog, a family practitioner in Albuquerque
who is on the botanical medicine faculty at Columbia University in
New York City. ``They need the assistance of someone who knows
about herbal medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to talk to your pediatrician. ``Parents are
often reluctant to ask their doctor about herbs because they think
their physician will look down on them,'' says Sheth. ``But doctors
have more access to the latest scientific information. Once I've
made a diagnosis, if my patients are interested in herbs, I'll have
them fax me the (names of) ingredients of something they're
considering using. Then I'll double-check the ingredients to give
them my recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to consult a doctor before giving your child an
herbal: Subtle signs of illness, especially in children under age
2, can indicate a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving your kids herbs is no substitute for seeing a doctor if
they're sick,'' says Dr. Bob Rountree, a family practitioner in
Boulder, and co-author of ``Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, that nagging cough or lingering cold may need
more than echinacea _ these symptoms could be warning signs of
pneumonia, while an earache could progress to meningitis. Herbs are
particularly useful in the early stages of mild illnesses, but they
will never take the place of all medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   In treating their youngest patients, physicians like Low Dog and
Rountree say they have had success over the years using these
botanicals:
</P>
<P>
   _ chamomile tea to calm frazzled nerves and relieve stomach
cramps
</P>
<P>
   _ ginger root, grated and simmered in water, to prevent nausea
from a bout of stomach flu or motion sickness and to help children
fall asleep.
</P>
<P>
   _ peppermint leaves, made into a tea or munched straight from
the garden, to help soothe an upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
   _ rosemary, whether in capsule form or served as a tea, to treat
colds, sore throats and headaches in children.
</P>
<P>
   _ calendula (also known as pot marigold), found in topical
creams, to treat mild cases of diaper rash and other skin
irritations.
</P>
<P>
   _ lavender, taken as a tea, to relieve nausea, motion sickness
and gas. A few drops of lavender oil placed on a child's forehead
or on a pillow can also help him fall asleep.
</P>
<P>
   _ aloe vera, used as gel taken directly from the live plant, to
soothe minor cuts and scrapes and to take the sting out of sunburn.
``When you apply aloe on children's sunburns,'' says Low Dog, ``you
can just feel the heat coming off their backs. And it's excellent
to use on insect bites, too.''
</P>
<P>
   _ echinacea, taken in capsule form or as drops, to short-circuit
cold and flu bugs. ``Often we can abort an upper respiratory viral
infection if we catch it in the earliest stages,'' says Low Dog _
and thereby avoid giving kids antihistamines that can leave them in
a fog, or antibiotics that can make them a breeding ground for
drug-resistant bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Though some herbs are considered safe and effective, others can
have harmful side effects. Know that:
</P>
<P>
   _ children under 6 months should never be given herbals. Their
liver and digestive tracts are still developing and their fragile
systems can't handle them. Kids between the ages of 6 and 12 months
should only be given herbals under a doctor's direct supervision.
</P>
<P>
   _ herbal medications can counteract or dull the effects of drugs
your child is already using.
</P>
<P>
   _ parents of kids with asthma or allergies should be especially
careful with herbals; many (like echinacea) are made from plants
belonging to the ragweed family, which can trigger an allergic
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   _ certain herbs are taboo for children. Among them, chaparral,
pennyroyal, ephedra, germander and comfrey, as well as concentrated
oils derived from peppermint, eucalyptus and the tea tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``These oils are very toxic,'' warns Dr. Gail Mahady, a research
assistant professor in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry and
Pharmacognosy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ``Less than
a teaspoon can kill a child or cause severe reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the FDA has no inspection authority over facilities
that manufacture herbal supplements. Most of these are on the up
and up, but there have been problems with the potency and purity of
batches of loose herbs imported from Mexico and China. Some, for
example, may contain heavy metals, especially lead, mercury and
arsenic, as well as other impurities, while as much as 30 percent
of Chinese-grown herbs are laced with potent prescription
medications like steroids, antibiotics and painkillers, according
to Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, that ``a supplement billing itself as 'all
natural' isn't automatically safe,'' according to Dr. Michael D.
Cirigliano, assistant professor of medicine at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia. ``Hemlock is
natural. So is snake venom.''

   GARDENS-MONTEREY-LIFEBEAT _ The garden at the Doud House, an
1860s clapboard house built in New England style by a wealthy
entrepreneur, is but one of 12 historic gardens in Monterey, Calif.
Some are so hidden away behind adobe walls that the locals refer to
them as ``secret gardens.'' They're smack in the middle of the
city, part of a public park system that runs through old Monterey,
but you would never find them without a map. Most belong to the
state of California, bequeathed by descendants of their original
owners _ and have been restored by volunteers. By Sara Solovitch.

1976, an estimated 30 million people in this country now wear them.
A rapidly growing number are 16 years old or younger. The benefits
of contacts are especially significant for young athletes. However,
poor hygiene or improper use of contacts can pose serious safety
risks, such as irritation, infection, corneal ulcers and even

SALADO, Texas: charity fund-raisers. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was when Loretta Young entered the scene. In the late '60s,
Jones had invited Jean-Louis, a famous Hollywood designer, to
headline a charity fashion show. The plane that carried the
clothing was hijacked to Cuba. Young, who was then married to
Jean-Louis, cleaned out her closets and flew to Texas with her
personal wardrobe to save the show.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' business flourished. Although to hear her tell it,
shopkeeping was a modest profit-maker. She added to her resume.
</P>
<P>
   She hired seminal Texas architect O'Neill Ford to build her
home.
</P>
<P>
   She led the Salado Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   She sat on the board of regents for the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Then came her divorce. He got the ranch, she got the store.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, after 40 years in business, she closed the store.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Days before the finale, Jones is so caught up in the turmoil of
change that she can barely focus on the immediate moment. The town
is clamoring to know what she plans to do with her historic
building. ``Something that will be good for Salado,'' she says, but
what that is, she doesn't know. She is making a list of everyone
who has expressed an interest. ``I will interview them, later,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   This Scarlett O'Hara management philosophy of thinking about it
tomorrow is the best she can muster. Her decision to close was
prompted by the unexpected death of her sister-in-law, Genelle
Rosanky, who had been with her since she first opened the store.
Rosanky handled all the bookkeeping duties.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few days of operation, two of Jones' stalwart
assistants have been called away to attend family funerals. Her
hairdresser is out of town, her housekeeper left her three months
ago. She feels utterly abandoned. If she sits still for more than a
few moments, paperwork begins to pile around her like filings to a
magnet. Messages, checks, papers to be signed. She sighs as she
sorts them and then returns them to their unattended state. She
looks around at the furniture and all-but-empty display shelves and
begins to grow despondent. ``It's terrible to close after so long.
What can I do with this?''
</P>
<P>
   All of ``this'' Jones modeled on the Neiman Marcus of her youth.
When the ranching Rosankys of Smithville needed to do some serious
shopping, Grace and her mother would travel to Dallas. Even after
opening her own store, she continued to shop at Neiman's for things
she did not carry. There was a mutual affection between merchants.
</P>
<P>
   After Jones announced that she was closing, Stanley Marcus noted
she was ``one of the shining retail lights in Texas because she was
able to sell high-fashion merchandise with style and authority in
an unorthodox setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones forged loyal relationships with her customers, and the
past few weeks have seen a parade of them coming by to pay their
respects. They have come to say goodbye to a friend and a way of
life. One local customer and close friend of Jones' ducks in to buy
all the handkerchiefs left in stock. Where else is she going to
find hand-embroidered linen hankies?
</P>
<P>
   ``Where am I going to buy my stockings?'' wails another. She has
just realized that among Salado's restaurants, antique stores and
B&AMP;Bs, there isn't anywhere to buy her hosiery. Jones sadly shakes
her head.
</P>
<P>
   In her early days, Jones says she was criticized by a Neiman
Marcus buyer who watched her as she worked with a customer. Later,
after the customer left, the buyer lambasted Jones, ``You didn't
tell her how nice she looked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the woman,'' countered Jones. ``I don't know if
she looked nice or not. I don't know her. I don't know how good she
can look.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the best moments of owning her store were finding
something a customer needed. It wasn't the fashion shows, or the
purchasing or the travel.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who would go to Paris and New York at least twice a
year, sometimes more often, is now looking forward to spending time
in Texas' tiny towns of Smithville and Gonzales, ``where my mother
and father are from. Do some simple things, and meaningful ones.''
There are cousins to visit, nieces to know better.
</P>
<P>
   The store is suddenly filled with a family from Austin. A woman
ushers in her daughter and three young granddaughters. She wants
the girls to see a dress store the way they used to be. They tour
the empty dressing rooms, with their little stages and huge
mirrors. They dutifully glance at the few remaining pieces of
clothing _ a luscious black lace blouse, on sale for $700,
brilliant yellow Lacroix pants with a burn-out design near the hem
_ no price tag, so no gasp. The girls are obviously not overwhelmed
but they politely introduce themselves to Miss Jones, and shake her
hand when their grandmother nudges them forward. Miss Jones beams
and asks to take a photo of the three pretty little blondes. Had
she stayed open, perhaps they would have become customers. Many of
hers were second and third generation.
</P>
<P>
   While the girls gather around Jones for their photo, two women
hesitantly step in the door. They look around the front room. They
don't see sales racks and the scene looks like a private moment, so
they quickly leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand,'' says Jones.
</P>
<P>
   So many people don't know how this sort of store works, ``and
now there isn't any time left to show them.''
</P>

 &HT;    Tina Brown's dishy Talk gets back to following its instincts
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tina Brown says the August issue of her Talk ($3.50) magazine is
the best yet. She's right. After the much-hyped debut issue with
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the magazine has been erratic in tone and
content. Now, with a single-image cover and lots of Vanity Fair
touches, Talk seems to be on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   In this issue, the must-read piece is an excerpt from ``Basic
Instinct'' screenwriter Joe Eszterhas' new book, ``American
Rhapsody.'' Part memoir, part political commentary and part
fantasy, the book focuses on the cast of characters involved in
Bill Clinton's personal woes. Eszterhas, of course, provides lots
of juicy details about his own sexual escapades.
</P>
<P>
   Other articles of note include an interview with Liz Hurley
about life after Hugh Grant, a profile of Donatella Versace and an
update on one family's attempt to get justice for a Klan killing in
Alabama 43 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Monday night buzz: Sports Illustrated ($2.99) writer S.L.
Price muses about the impact Dennis Miller will have on ``Monday
Night Football'' _ and his fellow announcers Al Michaels and Dan
Fouts.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Howard Cosell pontificated from ABC's booth has there
been as much excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is taking a surprisingly low-key approach to the new gig.
``I'm not going to go into that booth and turn into Ed Murrow
during the Blitz, for god's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Harry-ied: In case you've been in a bomb shelter for the past
few months, here's the latest big news. The fourth Harry Potter
novel hits stores Saturday with the biggest first printing ever _
3.8 million copies in the United States alone. What does author
J.K. Rowling think of all this? Newsweek's ($3.50) Malcolm Jones
chats with Harry's creator about the upcoming film (Harry hasn't
been cast yet), the future of the novels (``I want them all to grow
up, but not in a way that's unfaithful to the tone of the books'')
and the final installment (``Seven's going to be like the
Encyclopedia Britannica, because I'm going to want to say
goodbye'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Revolutionary filmmaking: Mel Gibson's movie ``The Patriot''
may not be entirely historically accurate, but most of the period
details are. The July issue of Smithsonian ($3) magazine describes
how the Smithsonian Institution advised director Roland Emmerich on
everything from uniforms to cooking utensils. There were some
Hollywood compromises, however. For instance, historian Margaret
Vining notes that the film did not adequately represent the major
role women played in the war.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: The fifth-anniversary issue of Doubletake ($10)
draws on emerging photographers as well as past masters such as
Dorothea Lange to showcase everyone from surfers to sharecroppers.
... Time ($3.50) takes a leisurely trip down the Mississippi River,
pausing at cities such as Cairo, Ill., and Vicksburg, Miss., to
take the pulse of America. ... In an excellent New Yorker ($3)
profile, author Tracy Kidder writes about medical doctor Paul
Farmer's crusade to save the world's poor.

&HT;     CHANGING OF THE GUARD IN MEXICO DRAWS PRAISE IN THE U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GARY MARTIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vicente Fox's stunning electoral victory that ended
71-year-old hold on the presidency by Mexico's governing party was
praised and applauded Monday by U.S. officials and scholars who
said the historic event legitimized the political system south of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we now have to say Mexico has a legitimate
democracy,'' said Sidney Weintraub, a Latin America trade
specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has controlled
Mexico's government since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's opposition National Action Party (PAN) tapped into decades
of public distrust of the PRI to stage a victory that included two
state governorships and enough seats in Congress to become the
dominant party. In addition, the party nearly took over the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was right,'' said Weintraub, author of the book,
``A Marriage of Convenience: Relations Between Mexico and the
U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox defeated PRI candidate Francisco Labastida and Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas of the left-of-center Democratic Revolution Party, whose
base of political support is largely within Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Weintraub said the overwhelming victory for the PAN was the
result of Fox's popular personality, a weak PRI candidate,
political reforms and stringent controls that were put in place by
a federal election commission to ensure a fair election.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola Co. executive, was quick to claim his
victory represents a ``right foot forward'' for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called Fox on Monday to congratulate the
president-elect, and invited him to the White House after he takes
office later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans should be proud of the extraordinary steps they have
taken during the last six years to strengthen and consolidate
democratic institutions and set Mexico on a course of economic
growth and prosperity,'' Clinton said from the Camp David
presidential retreat in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is our neighbor and friend. Mexico's national
elections, the freest and fairest in the nation's history, stand as
a vivid testimony to the depth of the democratic commitment of the
Mexican people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House aide said Clinton also applauded Fox for his
campaign to fight corruption, help the poor and improve education.
Clinton also thanked outgoing Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo for
putting in place the political reforms that allowed an opposition
candidate to win.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has surpassed Japan as the United States' second largest
trading partner. (Canada is the top American trading partner.) The
United States and Mexico share cultural ties and a 2,000-mile
border.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Gov. George W. Bush called the Mexican election ``very
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how powerful change is. When the people want change
or want reform, it's amazing what happens,'' Bush, the Republican
presidential hopeful, said during a news conference at his ranch in
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic candidate for president,
was in San Diego to address the convention of the National Council
of La Raza, the country's largest Hispanic rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish him well,'' Gore said of Fox. ``I compliment the people
of Mexico on an election that was apparently a model election in
many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Weintraub said there would be few changes in the U.S.-Mexico
relationship, because the U.S. financial community trusts Fox. The
European Union, which has trade agreements with Mexico, also
welcomed the election results.
</P>

   But narcotics trafficking and immigration will continue to be
issues that test the relationship between the United States and
Mexico.

   ``While there are still many challenges ahead for Mexico and the
United States, the counterdrug cooperation we have built over the
last few years is a foundation which transcends any particular
election or change of administration,'' said Barry McCaffrey,
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nations understand the critical importance of continued
action,'' McCaffrey said, referring to the United States and
Mexico.

   Fox's first order of business, however, will be to address the
issues on which he campaigned: education, social reforms and
helping the nation's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Weintraub said he expects Fox to form alliances with the other
parties to move some of his proposals through Congress. ``That will
become a necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the PRI has ``been a corrupt, self-enriching and at
time vicious party,'' Weintraub said it was unlikely that Fox would
order a wholesale dismissal of PRI officials within the government
and instead strive toward allegiances for legislative progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He already has said he intends to make alliances on the
federal level _ take those people from the PRI who are honest and
not corrupt and efficient, and maybe some from the PRD as well,''
Weintraub said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will need those alliances ``if he is going to change the tax
system and increase social spending,'' Weintraub said. ``There are
a lot of things he has to do.''

Surviving Team Williams tough task for Hingis
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ It happened at the U.S. Open, and it seems
virtually certain to happen again here. Martina Hingis may be the
No. 1 player in the world, Wimbledon's top seed and the winner of
five major titles before her 20th birthday, but she remains the
underdog _ until she proves otherwise _ against Team Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, she knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Hingis admitted Monday, ``the tournament begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis faces Venus Williams in the quarterfinals today. Her
reward for winning figures to be having to then deal with Serena
Williams in the semifinals Thursday. She is, however, trying to
think positively, because unless weather intervenes, and weather
is, to be sure, known to intervene on this famous greensward,
Wimbledon has a schedule that actually makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the way, now that we're down to the quarterfinals,
the women and the men are scheduled to play on alternating days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would beat one,'' Hingis pointed out, ``I would get
another day off. I have always had to play them (on) consecutive
days.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case at Flushing Meadow, and Martina proved
unworthy of the task, succumbing to Serena in the U.S. final in
straight sets after having clawed and scratched her way past Venus
in the semis. While the Swiss miss, who looks like a girl among
women although she is not, may be the vastly superior tactical
player, she falls short physically against both Williamses.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter referred to them during Hingis' post-match interview
as ``a monster with two heads.'' She smiled at the image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, they're not easy,'' Hingis said. ``But anything is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, I lost all the time against the second one when I had
to play them both. But I always had to play them on consecutive
days. That's very hard. You have a three-setter, you're happy you
made it through. Then, the next day, the other one is waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena herself almost sounded sympathetic when she was asked to
reflect on the challenge confronting Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus and I both run very well; we both have big serves; we're
both attacking,'' she said. ``It's like playing the same person who
is your nemesis, playing them all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the Wimbledon draw was set, and Hingis wound up
stuck in the same half with the sister-sister act that will dog her
for the rest of her career, her task didn't appear to be as
daunting as at present. Venus had been off the tour for most of the
year with tendinitis in her wrists and hadn't showed a lot in the
French Open despite reaching the quarters. Serena, in turn, hadn't
played anywhere since mid-April because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had a clue what to expect from them, particularly since
neither has shown any special affinity for grass even when fully
fit.
</P>
<P>
   Venus got this far the last two summers before going belly up.
Serena faltered in the third round two years ago in her only
previous Wimbledon appearance. But as these slash-and-burn
teenagers learn their way around the All England Club, they are
only going to improve. In fact, a breakout may be upon us.
</P>
<P>
   Serena has blown through four rounds, losing only 11 games and
spending less than three hours total on the court, although she
insists, ``I've been tested enough. I'm just trying to conserve my
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus, for her part, suffered a bit of a walkabout in the second
set Monday against Sabine Appelmans _ similar to her loose patch
against Nathalie Dechy earlier _ but she says she feels very good.
Physically anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I missed quite a few easy shots,'' Venus said. ``I
usually don't do that. Yeah, it really is annoying. But I can raise
the level of my game. I just have to get my mind there. There's no
way these girls should be competing like that against me. Unless,
of course, I let them.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be Venus' option vs. Hingis. For her, the tournament
starts today as well. Martina owns a 9-5 edge in their head-to-head
play, leads 3-0 in Grand Slam meetings and defeated Venus most
recently in the semifinals of the Chase Championships last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been able to beat Venus when it was really
important,'' Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   But not after having had to beat Serena first. Two of Venus'
wins followed Hingis victories over her sister. But the younger
Williams has won three of the last four meetings against Martina to
even their series at 3-all. And Hingis is 0-3 in the second of
successive Williams matches. The prospects of enduring these
one-two punches for the rest of her career forced Martina to
recognize the obvious. She had to get in the gym and make herself
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought a new game to women's tennis,'' Hingis said, ``a
lot more power, a lot more physical ability. (To beat them) you
have to work out more, just hit the ball harder basically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played them in a while. But I've been playing very
consistent after the second match (a 6-4, 6-1 win over Jing-Qian
Li) and serving very well. If it's going to be enough (against the
Williamses), time will tell. It will show, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   We know.

&HT;     JUDO CHAMPION JUST WANTS SOME RESPECT AT THE OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVID KING  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Please forgive Jimmy Pedro if he sounds just a
little annoyed at the major to-do about the U.S. Olympic basketball
``Dream Team.''
</P>
<P>
   He has his own dream, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Pedro has been one of the best Americans
in a sport that may not even wind up on the 100-plus hours of
``minor'' television coverage of the Summer Olympics in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   He is the current world champion. He has won national titles
five times and has been ranked No. 1 in the country for 10 years.
He has a bronze medal from the 1996 Games in Atlanta and has been
called the Americans' best hope for gold in his sport this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the best of judo _ and Pedro is among the best _ isn't going
to toss the Dream Team out of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy making $10 million a year, and how could he
possibly get more exposure? And then he goes to the Olympics and he
gets all the coverage and takes away from the other sports,'' said
Pedro, of Lawrence, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   You don't want to get Pedro too upset, at least not if you don't
want to get tossed on your head.
</P>
<P>
   He has labored for years in the obscurity _ and the poverty _ of
a sport that has barely 30,000 participants in the United States,
no organized Olympic development program and precious few
resources.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been the best for years. With his father as his
coach, Pedro, now 30, started judo when he was 5 years old and did
not lose a match until he was 11. In addition to his championships,
he also is the only American to win major championships in the
sport's two biggest hotbeds, France and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   He considered retiring after the bronze medal in 1996. But after
a three-month layoff and a long talk with his wife, he went back
into training.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't been doing well going into Atlanta and then come
away with a bronze, I would have quit,'' he said. ``But I felt like
I was just getting to my peak.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his biggest triumphs have come since then, including
his 1999 world championship _ the first for an American in 12 years
_ and the victories at the Paris Open and Shoriki Open.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he claims a gold medal in Sydney _ the first judo
gold for the United States _ there won't be any profiles on NBC, no
parades, no $10 million-a-year job to pick up. In fact, there's no
job at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part with judo ... is that there's no place to go and
do what I love to do after I'm done,'' he said. ``I have to go and
get a job. All the coaches with U.S. Judo are volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   He is teaching the sport to youngsters, but it's not a full-time
occupation, not with so few participants. Perhaps the only
full-time job in the country is executive director of U.S. Judo, a
position the 1994 Brown University graduate said he would like to
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of good ideas, and I've been exposed to world
judo,'' he said. ``I'd like to help the next generation not have to
go through what I did to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of his passion for judo was passed to him by his father,
who at age 53 is still ``hard as a rock and can whip me in the
weight room,'' Pedro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain discipline to it that I enjoy,'' he said.
``It's a one-on-one sport, and you get out of it what you put into
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a will to win. To be honest, I just love the
sport. It's even a fun sport to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro's three children will participate in judo when they get
old enough, although his daughter, the oldest at age 5, may not
stay with the sport.
</P>
<P>
   She might even take up, yes, basketball. With Dad's approval. He
may be a little miffed now, but he's not one to hold a grudge.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ With all due respect to the All-Star break,
baseball's halfway point is actually the Fourth of July, and not
just because of the 15 scheduled pyrospectaculars on the card.
</P>
<P>
   That's pyrospectaculars, as in fireworks shows.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the following teams had played at least 81 games before
the Fourth: Anaheim, Arizona, Atlanta, the Chicago Cubs, the
Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Florida, Houston, Los
Angeles, Milwaukee, Minnesota, Oakland, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, San
Diego and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   So here's your handy guide to the majors as we hit the turn _
some harder than others.
</P>
<P>
   THE NL WEST, or A LOT WORSE THAN THEY'RE LETTING ON: Arizona has
played .500 ball since early May, so the Diamondbacks plainly can
be had. But by whom? Colorado is still forced by law to play half
its games outside Denver, the Dodgers have no closer, the Giants
are getting to be like the Rockies, and the Padres are just sort of
futzing around until ... well, until forever, as near as anyone can
make out.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to like anyone with any real conviction, because all
the teams have noticeable flaws, but Arizona and Colorado are more
likely to spend money and bodies wisely at the trade deadline. The
midseason MVP would either be Todd Helton, Barry Bonds or Randy
Johnson, but the LVP is Omar Daal, who just lost his ninth game in
11 decisions, pushed his ERA back over seven and is barely breaking
even with the impressive Brian Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   THE AL WEST, or, I DON'T GOT TO SHOW YOU NO STEENKIN' PAYROLL:
The A's aren't paying very much for their record, the Mariners have
lost payroll moving Ken Griffey to the Ohio Valley, and the Angels
... oh, who cares? Texas has put up a dismal show, but could rally
if it had a rotation worth speaking of.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners look best because their bullpen is actually better
than someone else's for a change, and the A's look to be about as
good as they're ever going to be, barring a sudden burst of payroll
generosity from the Brothers No. The MVP is Jason Giambi, and the
LVP is Mark Clark, the one-time Texas starter with the 7.98 ERA.
Look, if we had a better candidate, we'd have told you.
</P>
<P>
   THE NL CENTRAL, or, THE SECRET TO FAILURE IS A REALLY GOOD
TRADE: Cincinnati made one, for Ken Griffey, and looks like it will
lose 20 more games than it did a year ago. The Cubs tried to make
one with Sammy Sosa as the bait and couldn't get anyone to dance
with them. The Brewers sent Jose Valentin and Cal Eldred to the
White Sox for nothing in particular and are now watching those two
help the Sox build the game's best record. Only the Cardinals, who
traded and signed their way to a better rotation and counterweight
to Mark McGwire, did themselves proud over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The MVP is Jim Edmonds, said counterweight, and the LVP is Jose
Lima, who is turning into a puff of blue sulfurous smoke before our
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   THE AL CENTRAL, or, BUFFALO FINALLY MAKES THE BIG LEAGUES: The
White Sox are the feel-good story of the year, with the redemption
of Frank Thomas, the assembly of a stunningly good starting
rotation (Eldred is the No. 5 starter, and he's 10-2), and Keith
Foulke as closer to make you Giants fans eat your livers.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland just used its 27th pitcher, Andrew Lorraine, and is
beginning to back up the truck at an awfully early stage of the
year. None of the other teams is worth bothering with again. The
MVP is Thomas, and the LVP is Jaime Navarro because, well, he
explains how horribly it's gone for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   THE NL EAST, or HERE COMES THE CIRCUS: The Atlanta Braves have
destroyed the excuse losers use when they can't admit they stink _
distractions. John Rocker has been everything Jerry Springer hoped
he would be, but the Braves remain so tight that even a pie fight
with feet like Rocker can't upset them too terribly much. Splitting
in New York this past weekend explained nearly everything about the
Braves, no matter how much of a rebuttal Mike Piazza tried to put
up.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal and Florida are interchangeable pleasant surprises
(although there is a move afoot to devalue Marlins closer Antonio
Alfonseca's stats by 20 percent because of the sixth finger on his
throwing hand). Philadelphia is just watching with the bat on its
shoulder. The MVP is either Piazza or Andres Galarraga, and the LVP
is . . . oh, don't make us say it.
</P>
<P>
   THE AL EAST, or TORONTO TORONTO TORONTO!: No, we don't get it
either, but it has something to do with the Yankees and Red Sox
having insufficient pitching. The Yankees are still begging David
Cone to break out of his troubles, and the Red Sox have lost both
Pedro Martinez and Jeff Fassero to the disabled list. That leaves
Toronto, hitting even more home runs than the Cardinals, and having
both David Wells and the best closer in baseball, Billy Koch. The
MVP is Carlos Delgado, and the LVP is the Baltimore bullpen, on a
pace to blow 40 saves this year.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, aren't we all?

 &HT;    Bush keeping lid on VP search
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAWFORD, Texas _ GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush on
Monday held his first news conference at the Waco-area ranch he
hopes will become the Texas White House.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be more conference than news.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into a closed-door session with former Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney, the point man in the hunt for a running mate, Bush
offered little light on the process that has demonstrated the
campaign's first-rate ability to keep a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Courteously and patiently, neither Bush nor Cheney offered much
insight on what's going on inside. Four weeks, or less, from having
to pick a running mate, Bush insisted it's a pretty wide-open
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made up my mind yet,'' he told reporters bused to a
field on the southwest side of his 1,600-acre ranch. ``What I
really don't want to do is have the formal interview process so
that candidates have to walk through the gauntlet of the klieg
lights in order to have a visit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be visiting with people face-to-face, some of whom you
will know about some of whom you won't know about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While no candidates have been in for formal interviews, Bush has
met with potential running mates _ including Michigan Gov. John
Engler, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and others _ as he travels
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's session with Cheney was their third meeting since Bush
put his father's former aide on the one-man headhunting committee.
Bush and Cheney speak frequently by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to say who is on the list, Bush was willing to
say that anyone who has asked off the list has been taken off. That
includes Arizona Sen. John McCain, former Gen. Colin Powell,
Florida Sen. Connie Mack and former Missouri Sen. John Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talks about the list of potential running mates as if it
were a living, breathing thing that ``kind of grows and shrinks
depending on what I look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides scrambled quickly last week when Oklahoma Gov. Frank
Keating become the rumored candidate du jour. As he does with any
name that crops up, Bush on Monday commended Keating as a friend
whose name brings positive response as a potential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney insisted his only role is data collector. Potential
running mates are responding to a questionnaire that includes
queries about ``public records, financial records, health records,
all those kind of things that you look at,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   That's about as far as Bush and Cheney are willing to go. Bush
dodged when asked Monday for any kind of details.
</P>
<P>
   How long is the current list of potential vice presidential
candidates?
</P>
<P>
   ``More than one.''
</P>
<P>
   When will the selection be announced?
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be by the end of next week. And I haven't made up my
mind if the announcement will be made at the convention or sometime
prior to the convention,'' he said. ``One thing is for certain, I'm
not going to name the person after the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Convention begins July 31 in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Has everyone under consideration been on a ballot somewhere for
something?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe. Maybe not.''
</P>
<P>
   Are there ethnic minorities on the list?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're considering a wide variety of people, a wide range of
people from all different backgrounds and different states.''
</P>
<P>
   Any thumb on the scale in favor of a female?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving women serious consideration. They will get the
same consideration that everybody else gets.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, as Cheney and Bush headed down the road toward the
recently remodeled house that serves as ranch headquarters until a
new house is completed later this year, the candidate said the goal
remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a wide variety of factors that go into the
selection,'' he said. ``But the two most important factors are
going to be, can the person be the president and will the person be
able to play a significant and meaningful role in an
administration, which means will we be able to get along well.''
</P>
<P>
   While the only people who really matter in the process met
privately, independent groups stepped up efforts to push their
favorites. Supporters of U.S. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, billing
themselves as the BplusK Committee, announced it will begin
displaying Bush-Kasich signs at Bush events around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles today, a group called American Women Presidents
will endorse Elizabeth Dole for Bush's running mate and California
Sen. Dianne Feinstein for Democratic candidate Al Gore's vice
presidential nominee.

   HARRY POTTER AND THE END OF INNOCENCE
</P>
<P>
   HARRY-POTTER-CENTERPIECE _ Harry Potter is the biggest
mass-culture phenomenon to come out of Britain since the Beatles,
and like the Fab Four before him, the young wizard hero of J.K.
Rowling's series of children's books may soon prove to be more
popular than Jesus. Hold your letters! All I mean is that Rowling's
fourth installment, arriving in bookstores July 8, will in all
likelihood do better than the current No. 1 fiction best seller on
the New York Times list, Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins' end-times
theological potboiler ``The Indwelling.'' Whatever this might say
about the immediate status of enchantment and faith, its
ramifications in the secular world may be more profound, and more
lasting. By A.O. Scott.

<P>
   THE VANITY OF VOLUNTEERISM
</P>
<P>
   VOLUNTEERISM-FAILURE-CENTERPIECE _ I am a volunteer. For more
than a decade, politicians and civic leaders have been looking to
volunteers like me to take over the government's role in providing
vital services to the poor. ``Compassionate conservatives'' would
probably claim that I am the kind of ``caring adult'' who can
transform the lives of disadvantaged kids more effectively than any
government program. I'm all for volunteering, but I would disagree.
To work, mentoring has to be performed consistently, over a
sustained period of time and preferably one on one. For the first
couple of years, I saw my kids as often as twice a week. But now
I'm lucky if I see them once a month, and I almost never see them
individually. In their lives, I'm less a caring adult than a random
one. And my failure is representative. By Sara Mosle.

the East Texas oil boom in the 1930s.)

<P>
   BROTHERLY LOVE IT'S GOT, AND NOW THERE'S A TOUCH OF ENVY, TOO
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-PHILLY-TECH _ when Philadelphia was omitted from a Wall
Street Journal list of the top 20 technology areas last November,
the slight touched off a quest for attention that would have made
the region's Quaker settlers twitch uncomfortably. Civic leaders in
the City of Brotherly Love want an e-business scene, just as
earlier civic efforts tried to recognize the city's movie,
restaurant and film notables. Here, Philadelphia's search for an
e-commerce glamour tag. By David J. Wallace.

   TAKING A WARLORD'S ADVICE TO SHAKE UP THE MARKETPLACE
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-JAPAN _ Hiroshi Mikitani's e-ecommerce site, called
Rakuten, has become Japan's largest online bazaar. The site,
www.rakuten.co.jp, draws about 95 million hits a month as a gateway
to about 2,800 merchants around the country selling everything from
eggs to kimonos. Merchants pay 50,000 yen a month, or about $469,
to link their Web sites to Rakuten. In exchange, they receive tips
on jazzing up those sites and access to Rakuten's database and
software, which contain information about customers and their
predilections. Rakuten also offers them low-cost advertising. A

   NAVY SET TO CELEBRATE A CENTURY OF SUBMARINING
</P>
<P>
   SUBMARINE-CENTENNIAL-POPMECH _ One hundred years ago this fall,
on Oct. 12, 1900, the U.S. Navy deployed the USS Holland. While
this fishy-looking, fume-belching submarine would never fire a shot
in anger, it would reshape the fate of nations more completely than
any war. By Jim Wilson. (1,300 words.) WITH GRAPHIC, PHOTOS.

   CAR-CARE-WATERPUMP-POPMECH _ Bombing down the interstate, you
glance at the odometer and realize you've just reached an
automotive milestone: 100,000 miles with no major repairs. Time was
a car that had passed its belly over that much real estate was
considered pretty much used up, but yours still runs great and
looks practically new. Amazing how technology has advanced. Then
you notice the temperature gauge. Holy smokes _ pegged! It may be
time to change the water pump. By Bob Freudenberger. WITH GRAPHICS.

   WEB WONDERS
</P>
<P>
   INTELLIGENT-SPIDERS-ON-WEB-DISCOVER _ Trying to find something
on the Internet is a lot like rummaging through countless cardboard
boxes in a dark attic. Even if the search is eventually successful,
it almost always turns up too much junk. Worse, no search is ever
comprehensive. The dark attic of the Internet is only infiltrated
as far as the very limited capabilities of a particular search
engine. Is it hopeless? Maybe not in the future. Some Web engineers
are trying to develop swifter, more efficient spiders _ spindly
bits of software that meander from Web site to Web site, sucking up
bits of text and making a list of the keywords they find. By

1860s clapboard house built in New England style by a wealthy
entrepreneur, is but one of 12 historic gardens in Monterey, Calif.
Some are so hidden away behind adobe walls that the locals refer to
them as ``secret gardens.'' They're smack in the middle of the
city, part of a public park system that runs through old Monterey,
but you would never find them without a map. Most belong to the
state of California, bequeathed by descendants of their original
owners _ and have been restored by volunteers. By Sara Solovitch.

1976, an estimated 30 million people in this country now wear them.
A rapidly growing number are 16 years old or younger. The benefits
of contacts are especially significant for young athletes. However,
poor hygiene or improper use of contacts can pose serious safety
risks, such as irritation, infection, corneal ulcers and even
blindness. Therefore, before leaving the practitioner's office, a
child needs to learn the essentials of use and care. By Irene S.

recommendation of family doctors who are adding herbal remedies to
their disease-fighting arsenal. Herbal medicine has become big
business. Last year, Americans snapped up nearly $4 billion worth
of herbal products from the shelves of supermarkets, pharmacies and
health food stores. Fueling these soaring sales, at least in part,
is growing scientific evidence indicating that some of these
products really can ease the symptoms of many minor ills. That also
explains why alternative medicine is gaining acceptance by the
medical mainstream and more doctors are getting up to speed on
botanical remedies. By Linda Marsa.

   WHAT'S DOING IN SAO PAULO

<P>
   SIGHTSEEING-SAO-PAULO-TRAVEL _ Superlatives come quickly to mind
when talking about Sao Paulo. With 18 million people in its
metropolitan area, this is the largest city in Brazil, the largest
in South America, indeed the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.
Those who come to Sao Paulo expecting to find a laid-back seaside
tropical resort in the style of Rio de Janeiro or Salvador are in
for a shock. Sao Paulo is a very different kind of Brazil:
aggressive, sprawling and resourceful, with a different climate,
including temperatures that can drop to near-freezing at night
during the Southern Hemisphere winter (June through September).

 &HT;    SHEER CHARISMA AND A RESONATING MESSAGE CARRIED FOX TO VICTORY
IN MEXICO
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Three years ago, Vicente Fox Quesada had already
violated the norms of Mexico's once stuffy and predictable
political scene.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly six-foot-six rancher and former Coca-Cola executive
from the Mexican province of Guanajuato was already unabashedly
running for president. With an obsession to drive Mexico's ruling
party from power after its 71-year reign, he refused to wait for
his own political party to anoint him in a smoke-filled room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to win,'' Fox fumed, obviously impatient to get an
early start on what would become the most competitive and
electrifying presidential campaign Mexicans can remember.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Fox's quest came true when Mexicans handed him an
historic victory that will put him in Los Pinos, (the Pines), the
Mexican White House on Dec. 1. His conservative National Action
Party, or PAN, will take the reins of power in a center-right
coalition from Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans had a date with history,'' Fox, who turned 58 on
Sunday, told teary-eyed followers. ``We crossed that bridge to a
change in power in a peaceful and legal way. Today we are on the
other side of that bridge and a new road begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The descendent of Spanish and Irish immigrants, Fox is a
multi-faceted personality whose overwhelming charisma helped him
make history. The PRI tried to portray him in scathing television
ads as an uncouth, unpatriotic loudmouth, but in the end his sheer
magnetism and pledge to bring change carried him to victory.
</P>
<P>
   These same characteristics could help his presidency, but they
could rub the wrong way in negotiations with other parties in the
plural government Fox wants to form, said University of Guanajuato
political analyst Luis Miguel Rionda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a natural leader and he enjoys it. He's passionate. But
he can't let those passions run away with things,'' Rionda said,
crediting Fox with usually working well with other parties while he
was governor. ``One of his biggest risks is losing patience. Others
can be pretty impatient, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fear Fox has an authoritarian streak, but he's also viewed
as extremely pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   He was a powerhouse on the campaign trail, often wearing his
trademark black leather cowboy boots and huge silver belt buckle
emblazoned ``FOX.''
</P>
<P>
   He connected with working-class people and young voters who
didn't mind the way he trashed the PRI _ he sometimes employed
obscenities _ and actually admired him for being stubborn. He
connected with farmers, who sensed he knew what he was talking
about when he spoke about running an agricultural business.
</P>
<P>
   When he put on an elegant suit, he connected with entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire for change was overwhelming and we positioned Fox
as the one to do that,'' said Francisco Ortiz, who ran Fox's media
campaign. Three years ago Fox probably didn't have more than a 40
percent name recognition, Ortiz said. By September of last year he
had risen to almost 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a month into the official campaign season, Fox's
team coined his slogan, ``Ya!,'' which means either ``Now!'' or
``Enough!'' in Spanish. He also employed a victory sign shaped into
the word Ya to emphasize Mexicans being fed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really loved that,'' Ortiz said
</P>
<P>
   Fox did an admirable job, too, at turning blunders into
attributes.
</P>
<P>
   He bickered at one crucial point with rival candidates over when
to hold a debate, repeatedly telling them ``today, today, today''
on live television. But after he was declared by much of the press
as the winner of the actual debate, he turned ``today, today,
today'' into a war cry at rallies.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, he admitted he was stubborn, but said a
leader needs to be stubborn to ``get rid of 70 years of corruption,
poverty and desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into an agricultural business family, Fox was educated by
Jesuits and is a strong Catholic. He is staunchly anti-abortion,
which is illegal in Mexico except for special circumstances, but he
has vowed not make abortion an issue. He has four adopted children
and is divorced from his wife, something some PRI activists tried
to use to question both his masculinity and his commitment to
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three close friends who told me they were offered money
to offer bad information about me,'' Fox said in an interview
during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He studied business courses at Harvard and for 15 years he
worked for the Coca-Cola Co., eventually becoming president for
Latin America until he resigned in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with Coca-Cola, the most competitive business in the
world,'' he said. On the campaign trail, he quaffed mostly
Gatorade, but also enjoyed the occasional Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's presidential style could mark an enormous departure in a
country where elected officials have been insulated from the
public. Although he's equally at home wearing a suit and traveling
to meet representatives of foreign powers _ he plans to visit the
United States and other countries before December _ he likes being
out in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Rionda said as chief executive Fox will have to curb that
tendency at some point simply because of the daily demands of the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't be like presidents of Mexico during the 1930s, like
Lazaro Cardenas, who went from town to town riding around on a
horse,'' Rionda said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is proud of his record as a governor who was rarely in his
office, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only went to my governor's office in Guanajuato four times
in four years,'' he said. ``The governor's job is to be out with
people to inspire them and make them enthusiastic.''

DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA A STATE WITHOUT A MAJORITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At some unknown moment between now and next July
1, if state demographers are right, California will become the
first big state in the nation in which non-Hispanic whites are
officially no longer a majority. Or, to put it another way,
California will become the largest proving ground for what it may
eventually be like to live in a United States in which no one
racial or ethnic group predominates.
</P>
<P>
   The California of postwar popular imagination, of the Beach Boys
and the John Birch Society, of Disneyland and monochromatic
Pleasantvilles full of aerospace workers, is not dead. But it is,
literally, dying fast. Non-Hispanic whites now account for about
three-quarters of the deaths in the Golden State, and barely a
third of the births. As recently as 1970, the state was 80 percent
white.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts argue that this transition, fueled by millions of
new immigrants, mostly Latin American and Asian, and the higher
birth rates of foreign-born residents has already taken place and
has yet to be reflected in official estimates by the state Finance
Department only because of glitches in counting. Already, it
certainly has had striking social, political, economic and psychic
impacts, including a series of bitterly fought ballot initiatives
to curtail government services for illegal immigrants, and to end
state affirmative action programs and bilingual education. Polls
show that the disappearing white majority generally remains more
pessimistic about the future than other groups.
</P>
<P>
   But with the state's economy booming again, and the overall
population expected to grow by something close to 18 million in the
next 25 years, Californians are grappling anew with the meaning of
this momentous shift, which the state Finance Department now
projects will happen sometime in the next year, and many are
finding reasons for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows when that line is crossed, but it surely will be,''
Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, said in a recent interview. ``I
believe leadership requires one to look on the bright side. There's
no question that a more diverse population creates some potential
discomforts and even potential conflicts, but it also brings great
strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   The demographic shift has begun to change the state's politics
as scores of new Hispanic voters have registered as Democrats in a
backlash spurred by Republican-led campaigns against illegal
immigration. That is one of the factors complicating efforts by
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican presidential
nominee, to make inroads in a state where his aides believe his
Southwestern brand of Republicanism should be appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Los Angeles, the demographic transition has already
occurred, and it is at once invisible and omnipresent, apparent in
the miles and miles of neighborhoods where signs are printed in
every language but English. This city has the largest population of
Koreans outside Korea and the largest concentration of Iranians in
the Western world, a polyglot port of entry comparable to New York
at the turn of the last century. The latest gang battle in the
region is between Hispanic and Armenian residents in the once
lily-white suburb of Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   California is not the first state where non-Hispanic whites will
not constitute a majority; they do not in Hawaii, whose population
is predominantly Asian and Pacific Islander, and in the past, they
have not in New Mexico, while in the pre-Civil War South, South
Carolina had a black majority. But California is by far the biggest
state to experience the shift, and for longtime Californians, the
changes seem breathtaking. Just 40 years ago, the 1960 census found
that the most common language of foreign-born Californians was
English, reflecting the population of British and Canadian
immigrants, said Peter Schrag, the former editorial page editor of
The Sacramento Bee and the author of ``Paradise Lost: California's
Experience, America's Future'' (1998), a study of the state
government's failures to come to terms with social and economic
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the history of the state, we've gone up and down on this
issue, and there's a kind of inherent ambivalence,'' Schrag said of
the demographic diversity. ``But a lot of it is conditioned by
economic circumstances. When times are good, we like these folks,
because they give us cheap labor. And when times are bad, we say,
`Who are these damn Mexicans taking our jobs away or using public
welfare?' I'm not saying that's a cycle we're fated to live with
for the rest of our existence, but it's been the pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing classification scheme of demographic groups is
itself fraught with anomalies. ``Hispanic'' is an ethnic
description, not a racial one, that lumps together Latin Americans
of all descriptions: whites, blacks, mixed-race mestizos, and
descendants of Mayans, Aztecs, Incas and other Indian groups.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``white'' in the California usage can include
immigrants from the Middle East who may be dark skinned. By this
standard, some analysts argue that Californians of Anglo-European
ancestry have actually been a minority here since sometime in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   One such analyst is Ron Unz, the Republican Silicon Valley
millionaire who sponsored the 1998 measure to end bilingual
education in the public schools in an effort to help forge what he
sees as the state's best hope: a new multiethnic assimilationism
that could avoid the racial wars of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asians and Latinos are intermarrying at 30, 40, 50 percent
rates, so the reality of the melting pot is stronger than ever,''
Unz said. ``But the ideology has been driven out of the public
arena. Very few members of the media or politicians are talking in
terms of glorifying and ratifying the melting pot, so whether
assimilation is doing well or not depends a lot on how you define
the terms.''
</P>
<P>
   When California entered the union 150 years ago, it was the most
diverse state in the nation, with a population of international
adventurers drawn by the Gold Rush. But beginning with the Southern
California real estate boom of the 1880s, Midwestern whites poured
in, and almost ever since, the state has followed cyclical patterns
of welcoming, and then dramatically rejecting, immigrants, from the
Asian exclusion laws of the late 19th century to Proposition 187,
the 1994 ballot measure sponsored by a former Republican governor,
Pete Wilson, to cut off social services for illegal immigrants.
Blacks have never been the presence here that they have in other
large, industrialized states.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, anxiety over immigration and its effects seems
to have abated. By 1998, polls found that fewer than 10 percent of
residents identified either legal or illegal immigration as a major
concern, and recent surveys by the Public Policy Institute of
California, a nonpartisan think tank, show residents about evenly
divided over whether immigrants are a benefit or a burden, with
whites the most skeptical. In various surveys, Hispanics, who are
expected to surpass non-Hispanic whites in total population by 2025
and become an absolute majority by 2040, express significantly more
optimism about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Optimism is alive in the barrios,'' said Harry P. Pachon, a
political scientist who directs the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute,
a nonpartisan research organization with branches at the Claremont
Graduate University and the University of Texas at Austin. ``It is
constantly being renewed by an influx of immigrants and however bad
things are, relative to the home country, things are better here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dispersion of a population of color throughout California
means that white Californians now routinely see others who are
unlike them,'' Pachon added. ``So at a political level, the
anti-immigration rhetoric has subsided. But nativist groups are
sitting out there in the wings, and we can't underestimate how some
of that is bubbling under the surface and may erupt in an economic
downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3 million legal immigrants, most of them from Latin
America, came to California between 1980 and 1994, and perhaps
another 2 million more entered illegally. Analyses are divided over
the net costs and benefits of this new population, though a rough
consensus suggests that the short-term costs have been high and the
long-term benefits are potentially great, as new generations of
immigrants assimilate and fuel an entrepreneurial economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plurality that we have is what allows us to be so
creative,'' said Maria Contreras-Sweet, the state's Mexican-born
secretary of business, transportation and housing. ``In Silicon
Valley or wherever, as you're developing a product, you're doing so
mindful of the different needs and cultural nuances of world
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The political implications of the change are hard to predict.
Hispanics accounted for nearly all of the increase of 1 million
registered voters over the last decade, and went from about 4
percent of the electorate in the 1990 gubernatorial election to 14
percent two years ago, while whites declined to 74 percent from 84
percent in the same period and blacks shrunk to 7 percent from 8
percent. The new Hispanic voters are predominantly Democrats, in
what is regarded as a protest against Wilson and Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in other ways, surveys show, including a recent extensive
statewide sampling by the nonpartisan Field Institute of San
Francisco, the overall ideology of Hispanic voters is similar to
California voters on the whole, with nearly half calling themselves
middle-of-the-road. On some issues, like abortion, Hispanic voters
tend to be more conservative than other groups as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   And though California is often celebrated as the crucible of
trends, and other big states like Texas, Florida, New York and
Illinois are on the road to becoming similarly diverse,
demographers note that the nation will not catch up to California's
diversity until midcentury, and even then small, interior states
may remain disproportionately white.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the precursor for the rest of the country,'' said
William H. Frey, a demographer at the Milken Institute in Santa
Monica. ``A lot of white, baby-boomer retirees are going to be
moving to the Rocky Mountain West and the South Atlantic states and
other high-amenity states.''
</P>
<P>
   But even some of the most typically pessimistic critics of the
California experience find hope in the prospect of diversity and
rising rates of intermarriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California that I love is incipiently Hawaii,'' said Mike
Davis, the author of ``City of Quartz'' (1990) and other studies of
the downsides of the California dream. ``That's not to embrace
multiculturalism, everybody in their little box, but to embrace all
the leakage and the fact that the boxes don't work anymore. Here in
L.A. you have this seashore that could be Polynesian, but it's been
owned by Midwesterners for most of the 20th century who built this
Puritan city on the edge of the Pacific. For generations, Hawaii's
been trying to break out of that, and there's a real chance for
that again this generation.''

Astros' rental of Unit bears no second-guessing
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he will take the mound as the flamethrowing,
rocket-launching enemy capable of lighting up the sky brighter than
any star-spangled Fourth of July fireworks over Buffalo Bayou.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the smoke-belching choo-choo high on the
left-field wall will be only the second most powerful locomotive at
Enron Field once he cranks up that mighty left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the breeze from the home team's bats that will likely
keep the place cooler than any air conditioning on a sultry summer
night.
</P>
<P>
   As the Astros limp into the All-Star break looking like a
collection of anything but, there are more things to question and
criticize than ants at the afternoon picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Trading for Randy Johnson two years ago isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind what the standings say now. It was still the right
thing to do. At the time.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind how high the American League West-leading Mariners
may be on John Halama, Freddy Garcia and Carlos Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Johnson and his Arizona Diamondbacks currently
hold down first place in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Astros are the not-so-proud owners of the
worst record in all of the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Well, go ahead, mind that.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't take the bait and run to one of the most
simple-minded, knee-jerk arguments this side of the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Not unless you can produce a signed, notarized letter of proof
that you stood up and jeered the Astros on July 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Not unless you can look straight in the mirror and say that not
for a moment did you cheer Johnson during his two-plus months in an
Astros uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Not unless you can swear on a stack of Mickey Mantle rookie
cards that you never once pumped your fist when Johnson rang up
another K with that bullwhip left arm, that long, stringy hair and
that vulture's stare in those anything's-possible baseball weeks in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Not unless you can stare through your Craig Biggio eye black and
say with a straight face that you never once nudged anybody on the
block or at the office and made a crack about having the Big Unit
and, thus, a big chance to go the World Series and win it all.
</P>
<P>
   Second-guesses are a part of sports. They might even be the most
fun part of sports. They are why they put bars in stools, have
call-in radio shows and give laptops to guys like me.
</P>
<P>
   If we could use second-guesses in the place of first-guesses,
surely nobody would ever have heard of New Coke, 8-track tapes and
Roseanne singing the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   But to second-guess Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker for
landing Johnson for three prospects is wrongheaded from both a
baseball viewpoint and for revisiting history.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can be Nostradamus predicting the past. If we'd have
known Jose Merengue would do the Lima Limbo this year, that Billy
Wagner would pitch nearly half a season before mentioning that his
arm hurts, sure it would have been nice to have Halama and Garcia
around on the pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, maybe somebody could have done something about
that little art school reject in Germany, too.
</P>
<P>
   But in baseball, as in life, the key is to maximize your
opportunities, and for the Astros, 1998 was it. That was the best
team in franchise history, the winner of 102 regular-season games,
and with Johnson as the ace, should have been a fearsome playoff
contender.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson delivered. He went 10-1 down the stretch with a 1.28 ERA
and struck out 116 batters in 84 innings. He was everything we had
expected or hoped he would be. He gave opponents a sense of awe,
and he gave the Astros a feeling of invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gave up a total of three earned runs in his two playoffs
starts against the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   If Jim Leyritz doesn't turn into Reggie Jackson. If Moises Alou
isn't called out at third in Game 3. If the Killer B's weren't the
Killer Fleas again. If the Astros had been able to get over that
first-round hump, maybe they go to the World Series. And if Johnson
still walks away as a free agent, who would have said it was a bad
experience?
</P>
<P>
   Rip them for Carl Everett. Tear into them for Mike Hampton.
Question them about Brad Ausmus and even Ricky Gutierrez and Bob
Abreu.
</P>
<P>
   See through the charade of owner Drayton McLane Jr. for his
undervalued lip-service offer that was never going to turn
Johnson's head away from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But don't fall for the cheapest, easiest second-guess of all.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Rent-a-Unit was the biggest, boldest gamble and the
right move. At the time.

 &HT;    Don't look for social messages in 'Scary Movie'
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ Never doubt that Shawn and Marlon Wayans know
exactly what they have created. ``Look, this is one of those movies
where you're supposed to check your brain at the door and come
laugh,'' proclaims Shawn, 29, who is 18 months older than his
writing and acting partner sibling. The movie in question is
``Scary Movie,'' a spoof of the teen slasher genre and just about
every other successful film of the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sit there and try to overanalyze,'' he adds of the
teen-targeted release due in area theaters this Friday. ``This is
not a thinker's movie. You're coming to laugh, and you will
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wayanses first emerged into public consciousness in 1990, as
utility players in their family's television showcase ``In Living
Color,'' which made a star of older brother Keenen Ivory Wayans,
who directs ``Scary Movie.'' Six years later, Shawn and Marlon
tried their hands at feature films, writing, producing and acting
in an overstuffed parody of black ghetto gang movies, ``Don't Be a
Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood. ''
</P>
<P>
   For a follow-up, they knew they wanted to spoof the slasher
horror genre and gave their script the title ``Last Summer I
Screamed Because Friday the 13th Fell on Halloween.`` Eventually,
more humor-challenged heads prevailed and the name changed to
``Scary Movie, '' which slasher film fans will recognize as the
original title of ``Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wayans brothers consider themselves slasher fans. ``So much
so that we decided to end them all,'' says Marlon, kicking back on
a couch in a trendy South Beach hotel. ``We decided to kill off all
these young white teens, so we could kill off these movies once and
for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that they want to make this a racial thing, but the Wayanses
have noticed there usually aren't many blacks in horror movies. ``I
think it's partly Hollywood, but I think it's also that black
people _ women and men _ are a little too smart to be in those
situations without using their common sense,'' notes Marlon.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up on the comic jab, Shawn adds his own follow-up punch.
``If they heard someone or something at the door, they would get a
gun and blow him away,'' he says, insisting that that was the
original plot of ``Scary Movie,'' but it was abandoned when they
realized it would only be two minutes long from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   So don't look for social messages in ``Scary Movie. ''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, you left your brains at the concession stand. ``This
movie is just a movie,'' says Shawn. ``It's just a comedy, it's not
a black comedy. It's a general response to the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The two of them made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of
research for their script. To lampoon them, they watched slasher
movies over and over again. ``We watched `Scream' until we wanted
to scream,'' howls Shawn. `` `I Know What You Did Last Summer', but
I don't give a damn.'' (OK, he used an Anglo-Saxon action noun that
is a lot stronger than ``damn.'') ``I can't ever see that movie
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, none of those movies improved with multiple
viewings. ``Nothing made me go, after I've watched it a hundred
times, `Now I really like, uh, Urban Legend.'''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, the plot of ''Scary Movi'' concerns the
brutal murder of a scantily clad co-ed, whose clueless friends soon
find themselves the targets of a persistent killer. Along the way,
the parody net widens to include spoofs of ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' ``The Usual Suspects'' and ``The Matrix,'' to name a
few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every parody movie we've ever done, we've always gone outside
the regular genre,'' says Shawn. ``Because you've got to have pop
culture involved in everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have different levels of humor,'' chimes in
Marlon. ``So even people who didn't see ``Scream,'' they'll get
something to laugh at, to enjoy. You've got to pack it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one level of ``Scary Movie's'' comedy is lowly
gross-out humor. Suffice it to say, the Wayans outdo the hair gel
scene of ``There's Something About Mary. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't put gross-out stuff just to gross you out,'' insists
Shawn. ``It is over the top, but every gross-out thing has to do
with character.'' Shawn looks at Marlon, Marlon looks back at Shawn
and they both burst out laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York City, Shawn and Marlon are two of 10 children
born to a salesman and a housewife, parents who both helped shape
their senses of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' agrees Marlon. ``My dad is silly and my mom is
funny. My dad ain't funny, he's silly. He was acting silly, got my
mom mad, they had sex and here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mom is funnier when she's angry,'' says Shawn, adding that
it wouldn't take much to get her angry. ``It's my father. All he
had to do is walk into the house. It was instantaneous. She'd look
at him and go, `You made me pregnant with 10 kids and you've got a
job that only pays $10,000 a year.' She's very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the jokes, there is a strong family bond among the
Wayanses, and Shawn and Marlon clearly idolize their oldest brother
Keenen, their comedy mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comedy is what he does, and he taught us everything we know,''
says Shawn. ``We kind of look to him as like the guru. Usually
we'll get an idea and we'll go, `Yo, Keenan, what do you think of
this?' and he'll go, `Yeah, that's good, but if you did this ...'
and we go away and work on it some more. Every draft, it gets
better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for Shawn and Marlon is likely to be their animated
parody of ``Antz'' and ``A Bug's Life.'' Their title? ``Roaches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, in our world each bug represents a different
race,'' says Marlon. ``So it's an interracial romance between a
roach and a wasp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like `West Side Story' for bugs,'' adds Shawn.
</P>
<P>
   Their futures do not depend on how well ``Scary Movie'' opens
this weekend, but it would help.
</P>
<P>
   Come Friday, they will have their cell phones poised, as they
wait for reports of the box office grosses. ``Having the champagne
on ice, just in case,'' says Marlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the guns and the razor blades, just in case,'' counters
Shawn.

X-CEPTIONAL: FAMKE JANSSEN IS AN X-MAN WITH A MIND OF HER OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Famke Janssen in a scene from
``X-Men.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Famke Janssen was exasperated.
 &HT;    Soon after relocating from her native Holland to the United
States in 1984, she had ditched a lucrative career as a model to
pursue acting and to study writing and literature at Columbia
University in New York.
 &HT;    But she was going nowhere fast, and there were moments when the
statuesque and smart Janssen _ she stands 5-foot-11 and can
converse in English, Dutch, German and French _ began to seriously
question her decision.
 &HT;    ``Moments?'' she says. ``Years! It was the hardest time of my
life. Every morning I would wake up and it seemed to me that every
single person in the world was saying to me, `Stop doing this!
You're not making any money. Nobody wants to hire you.'
 &HT;    ``But I'd say to myself, `You can do it,''' she recalls. ``And I
did that for years. It was really hard. It's a competitive world,
very competitive.''
 &HT;    Janssen hung in there, and eventually landed work. By 1992 she
had guest-starred in an episode of ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation'' and made her film debut in the drama ``Fathers and
Sons.'' She got her first taste of stardom in 1995, when she played
a bad Bond girl, the memorably monikered Xenia Onatopp, in the hit
007 adventure ``Goldeneye.''
 &HT;    Since then Janssen has mixed it up, gracing major studio
releases and independent features of varying genres. Her resume
includes ``Lord of Illusions'' (1995), ``The Gingerbread Man''
(1997), ``City of Industry'' (1997), ``Rounders'' (1998),
``Monument Avenue'' (1998), ``The Faculty'' (1998), ``Celebrity''
(1998) and ``The House on Haunted Hill'' (1999).
 &HT;    On July 14 Janssen will return to the screen in ``X-Men,'' an
event movie that, like ``Goldeneye,'' could turbocharge her career.
Based on the long-running Marvel Comics series and directed by
Bryan Singer, ``X-Men'' features an eclectic ensemble cast that
includes Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, Halle Berry,
James Marsden, Hugh Jackman and Janssen as Jean Grey, a mutant with
both telepathic and telekinetic abilities.
 &HT;    ``Patrick Stewart's character, Professor X, runs this school of
mutants,'' Janssen says, speaking by telephone from her New York
apartment. ``Some of us are students and some of us are people
who've gone through there and are now teachers. So we're the X-Men,
who have special powers and are more developed.
 &HT;    ``At the school,'' she continues, ``the professor teaches us how
to control those powers, and what the movie deals with is the X-Men
versus the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood are mutants, led by Ian
McKellen, who have not really learned how to control their powers,
and they're taking advantage of them and abusing them. So we fight
them.
 &HT;    ``And then I have a whole love triangle between Jean Grey,
Wolverine (Jackman) and Cyclops (Marsden), both of whom are
X-Men.''
 &HT;    Singer went to great lengths to stay true to the ``Uncanny
X-Men'' comic book and its ``Who are the true outsiders?'' theme,
Janssen says. At the same time, however, the director strove to
avoid the over-the-top garishness, stunt casting and plot
contrivances that derailed the later ``Superman'' and ``Batman''
features.
 &HT;    ``He wanted to make it all real,'' says the actress, whose
character doesn't fly, can't shoot beams from her eyes and rarely
gets physical. ``He wanted everything about it to be real. In the
past, comic-book-based movies were a lot more fantastical.
 &HT;    ``To make a comic-book movie more realistic is a much bigger
challenge and more interesting,'' she says. ``It seems to me that
people can relate to it more if it's realistic.
 &HT;    ``But we'll see _ it's all up to the audience and how they feel
about it.''
 &HT;    Bottom line, Janssen stresses, ``X-Men'' is big summer
entertainment that delivers action along with a bit of romance and
a laugh or two. It's also got something to say about tolerance _
which, she hastens to add, should not be mistaken for a message.
 &HT;    ``I don't like message movies,'' Janssen says. ``I don't know
that movies ought to have a message. It's sort of a myth in
Hollywood that you have to have a message.
 &HT;    ``If a movie is a reflection of life and life is very harsh,
then that's enough.''
 &HT;    Though she's signed for an ``X-Men'' sequel, Janssen's next
films are as different from ``X-Men'' as possible. In the
independent feature ``Love &AMP; Sex,'' due out in August, Janssen
plays Kate Welles, a writer who revisits the gory details of her
love life when given 24 hours to pen a magazine article about the
perfect relationship. Jon Favreau co-stars in the dark romantic
comedy as Kate's most recent ex-boyfriend.
 &HT;    Favreau also figures prominently in Janssen's next film,
``Made.'' Directed by Favreau and co-starring Favreau and Vince
Vaughn, the Mafia-oriented comedy is a follow-up of sorts to the
sleeper hit ``Swingers'' (1996).
 &HT;    It seems as if it's all going according to plan for Janssen.
Still, she's paid a price for her reluctance to cash in, for her
desire not to win roles based solely on her looks.
 &HT;    ``I probably could have been a bigger star, maybe, for a moment
in time,'' says Janssen, who is 35 and single. ``But not for the
long run.
 &HT;    ``What I've tried to do is be taken seriously by the people in
the business, work with good directors and do different types of
roles,'' she says, ``so that people can see that I have some range
and don't have to be just some pretty girl in an action movie. I
think, in that respect, I've succeeded.
 &HT;    ``At some point you want to move on and play leads in movies,''
Janssen concludes. ``I've done that with `Love &AMP; Sex,' and it will
be up to the success or failure of that movie to see what happens
in terms of my career. But `Love &AMP; Sex' was a big step for me.''

`KID' STUFF: LILY TOMLIN IS BACK ON THE BIG SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Lily Tomlin with Bruce Willis in a scene
from ``The Kid.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Jon Turteltaub has directed Anthony Hopkins, John Travolta,
Sandra Bullock and Robert Duvall. His latest movie, ``The Kid,''
stars megastar Bruce Willis.
 &HT;    But when he had an anxiety attack at the thought of meeting an
actor, it was Lily Tomlin.
 &HT;    ``I was really nervous,'' the director says, ``because I
remembered seeing her show, `The Search for Signs of Intelligent
Life in the Universe,' on Broadway, and I had never seen anything
better.
 &HT;    ``When Lily came on the set, I said to her, `You are a comic
genius, I loved you on `Laugh-In' _ just tell me what's funny.'''
 &HT;    Hearing this story, Tomlin giggles. She was just as nervous, she
says, about undertaking her largest movie role in years.
 &HT;    ``Fortunately Jon is like a big kid,'' she says, ``and so
playful that he made it easy to be funny.''
 &HT;    Tomlin has been being funny since even before she first got
famous on ``Laugh-In,'' the seminal 1960s television program in
which she played Ernestine, the irrepressibly impudent telephone
operator, and Edith Ann, that precocious and devilish 5-year-old.
 &HT;    Three decades and a shelf full of Emmys and Tonys later, she
finds herself cast opposite Willis _ who plays the kind of tough
boss that Tomlin tamed in ``Nine to Five'' (1980) _ as his
no-nonsense executive assistant, whose awesome organizational
skills keep his schedule, if not his personal life, on track.
 &HT;    Working with Willis was no problem, the actress says.
 &HT;    ``I've admired him ever since I saw him on `Moonlighting,''' she
says. ``He was charismatic and sexy, and also twinkly and likeable.
When we got together to talk about the movie he was wearing jeans
and a ball cap, and we just started playing around.
 &HT;    ``I know Bruce is an enormous star,'' she adds, ``but he's a
pretty reachable guy. He's accessible. He was everything I expected
him to be, and the best part is that he doesn't take himself too
seriously.
 &HT;    ``I guess in real life he would actually be a good boss.''
 &HT;    It's been a while, but Tomlin still winces at the memory of her
own experience as an office worker.
 &HT;    ``I was the executive assistant for a man in New York who later
became the head of ICM (the prominent artist-management firm),''
she recalls. ``Actually, I was sort of the office flunky, and the
other three women in the office just tortured me. I was a hippie in
burlap skirts and T-shirts, and the women in the office were all
the opposite of me, with long fingernails and bubble hairdos.''
 &HT;    In ``The Kid,'' which will open nationwide on July 7, Tomlin's
character doesn't suffer in silence, keeping her workaholic boss on
his toes with sarcasm and wisecracks.
 &HT;    ``I think my character has a real affection for him,'' the
actress says, ``and she believes that there's a better man inside
him waiting to get out. I'm waiting for that guy to turn the
corner, you know.''
 &HT;    The cue for that change is the arrival of the titular kid
(Spencer Breslin), who through a supernatural twist turns out to be
Willis' character at the age of 8. Against his will, the
high-powered executive finds himself forced to relive the struggles
of his childhood.
 &HT;    That wouldn't be easy for anyone, says Tomlin, who isn't sure
how she's react if she had to confront her 8-year-old self.
 &HT;    ``I would see a kid who still thinks she's pretty great,'' she
muses. ``She wasn't focusing on any problems in her life.''
 &HT;    Tomlin grew up in a blue-collar family in Detroit, not quite
poor but not too far from the brink, either.
 &HT;    ``My mother was very motherly,'' she says, ``but my dad loved to
go to the racetrack. I'd go with him and hang out at the bar
sometimes, but I'd also go to my mother's Tupperware parties.''
 &HT;    Her world was full of people from diverse backgrounds, which
surely enhanced Tomlin's emerging talent to create memorable
characters.
 &HT;    ``We lived in an old apartment house,'' she recalls, ``and it
was full of different kinds of people, all of them were either on
their way up or on their way down. In every single apartment there
was a different kind of life going on, from a different culture. I
soaked it up. Whatever they were doing, I did _ I was always
imitating people.
 &HT;    ``I loved to do shows, to perform for people,'' Tomlin says. ``I
would steal material from television comedians like Jean Carroll,
one of the first female stand-ups who appeared on `The Ed Sullivan
Show.' I stole all of her jokes about her husband.''
 &HT;    When she wasn't performing for the neighborhood, Tomlin was
turning her ability to convey different characters into the chance
to make a few bucks.
 &HT;    ``I had a babysitting business when I was 10,'' she says,
``because I had such an air of competence. I remember one New
Year's Eve when I was 12, I was watching like 16 children. I hired
my girlfriend for $2 to help. Can you imagine? Sixteen children
with a girl who was really just a kid.
 &HT;    ``I guess that's the closest I've ever gotten to the character I
play in `The Kid,''' she adds with a grin. ``As a little girl, I
was very well-organized. Since then I've had assistants who were.
They're also much funnier than I am, quicker with a comeback and
very sarcastic.''
 &HT;    Once one of the most innovative stand-up comedians of her
generation, Tomlin seems alienated from the comedy of today.
 &HT;    ``I personally like humor that is perceptive and, ultimately,
makes you and everyone else feel a little bit better,'' she says,
``rather than loathe yourself and everybody else.
 &HT;    ``I think what's considered to be ground-breaking in comedy
today really seems to be coming out of some sort of profound
repression,'' Tomlin says. ``It's very adolescent and immature. I
remember, when one of the sitcoms first got the word `fart' on TV,
they made a big fuss about it. It was like, `How hip are we?' I
don't see that as ground-breaking at all.
 &HT;    ``Fifteen years ago, in `The Search for Signs of Intelligent
Life in the Universe,''' she continues, ``Jane Wagner wrote a line
for me _ `No matter how cynical you are, it's never enough to keep
up.' I've seen that line quoted over and over. And there's another
one: `I worry that today's reality check is yesterday's culture
shock.'
 &HT;    ``That was written 15 years ago,'' she concludes, ``and now it's
out of control. I think we're just being dumbed down and debased.
Kids are cynical at a younger and younger age.''
 &HT;    In such a climate, she says, a film like ``The Kid'' _ with its
anti-cynical message of hope _ might be all too timely.
 &HT;    ``What I love is that Bruce's character is cut off emotionally
and totally caught up by his ambition,'' she says. ``He's cold,
impersonal and hard-edged. But then, by going back to that little
kid, himself, that he loathed, he breaks through that armor.
 &HT;    ``I wish we could all do that,'' the actress concludes. ``I wish
we were all more soft and tender, toward ourselves and everyone
else.''

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    When Jude Law looks in a mirror, he doesn't see a sex symbol
looking back.
 &HT;    ``I see the dark circles under the eyes,'' the British actor
says. ``I see the sunburned skin. I see someone who might have made
a mistake when he cut his hair in the bathroom by himself. I also
see a guy who looks like he could use a few extra hours of sleep.
 &HT;    ``I'm not a sex symbol.''
 &HT;    Thousands of admiring women beg to differ, but as he relaxes in
a suite at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel, Law seems entirely
sincere in his protestations. He doesn't think he's sexy, and
doesn't want to.
 &HT;    ``Being sexy is basically something I can't think about,'' he
explains, ``or I'll be doomed to spending two hours in the mirror
before I get out of the house. And, frankly, if I monopolized the
bathroom, my wife and sons would want to kill me.''
 &HT;    Law has been on something of a roll lately, following up
critically lauded performances in ``Gattaca'' (1997) and ``Wilde''
(1998) with ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' (1999), in which he played
a 1950s expatriate-American golden boy so effectively that he
snagged an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor for
his pains.
 &HT;    As he passes through the hallways of the Four Seasons, no one
seems to connect the soft-spoken Englishman, rail-thin in khaki
pants and a matching green sweater, with the impossibly buff Dickie
Greenleaf he portrayed in ``Mr. Ripley'' _ which is just fine with
him.
 &HT;    ``My reality is my family,'' the 28-year-old actor says. ``It's
my wife and sons. I'm old enough to know that fame is not the
secret to happiness.''
 &HT;    Law's latest movie opens nationwide on July 14, but it's not the
high-profile, big-budget fare most Oscar nominees turn to in an
effort to cash in.
 &HT;    Instead Law picked the low-budget erotic thriller ``The Wisdom
of Crocodiles,'' an offbeat riff on Oscar Wilde's ``The Portrait of
Dorian Gray.'' Law plays Steven Grlscz, a handsome, successful,
witty man who easily seduces women _ and then kills them. He is
bloodthirsty, literally, and may be a vampire.
 &HT;    ``He's a man with a lot of peculiar traits,'' Law says. ``I want
to play men you can't neatly put into a file folder with a label on
them. And this character fits, because he keeps audiences
guessing.''
 &HT;    ``Mr. Ripley'' kept them guessing as well, to the tune of $100
million at the box office _ which came as a surprise to Law.
 &HT;    ``I loved the movie,'' the actor says, ``but, then again, I
always love my movies. For years I've heard people say, `Jude, this
is your breakout role' _ it's always your breakout role. So my
standard response with every movie now is, `Let's wait and see what
happens.'''
 &HT;    Otherwise, he says, the disappointment can be unbearable.
 &HT;    ``You buy into the buzz,'' he says. ``For instance, when I did
`Gattaca' (1997), I kept hearing, `This is it for you.' I thought,
`My God, this is going to be huge.'
 &HT;    ``Listen, I'm still waiting for that movie to happen for me,''
he jokes. ``Maybe it's huge on video.''
 &HT;    ``Mr. Ripley,'' which co-starred Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow,
actually was huge. In fact, the degree of attention it has brought
him is rather off-putting, the English actor says.
 &HT;    ``I've never wanted fame,'' he insists. ``I'm an actor because I
enjoy acting. And it has been that way since I was a child _ my
parents were acting teachers who ran a theater company on and off
in Italy, so they taught me to take it very seriously.''
 &HT;    His parents were serious enough to name their son after the
death-obsessed protagonist of Thomas Hardy's classic ``Jude the
Obscure,'' but lighthearted enough also to have been influenced by
the Beatles song ``Hey, Jude,'' with its message of hope and
consolation.
 &HT;    Law was only 3 when his parents first began taking him to the
London theater, but he was immediately captivated.
 &HT;    ``I just remember sitting there and responding to the
emotions,'' he says. ``I didn't understand exactly what was
happening on stage, but I knew the feelings of love and anger and
rage.''
 &HT;    By age 5, he was on school stages. He's rarely stepped offstage
since.
 &HT;    ``The minute I was put on stage, I felt like I had come home,''
he says. ``I suppose it's the same way an athlete feels on the
field. I felt like I had done this thing about a million times. It
felt natural to me to be on stage. I understood what I should do up
there _ it was where I belonged.''
 &HT;    Youthful roles with the National Youth Music Theater led to work
with the National Theatre, and at 16 Law dropped out of high school
to act full-time.
 &HT;    His first adult job was on the British soaper ``Families.'' Law
went on to tour Europe in Shaw's ``Pygmalion,'' then originated the
role of Michael in ``Les Parents Terribles,'' which came to
Broadway as ``Indiscretions'' (1995) and earned Law a Tony
nomination.
 &HT;    Oh, and he also caught quite a few people's eyes in the second
act, when he stepped out of a bathtub buck naked.
 &HT;    ``Gattaca'' and a role as a murdered bisexual hustler in
``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (1997) followed. His
performance as the tempestuous Lord Alfred Douglas earned rave
reviews in ``Wilde'' (1998), but the film was scarcely seen.
 &HT;    And then came ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' _ and another nude
scene, which certainly didn't hurt his appeal to the younger
females in the audience.
 &HT;    ``Face it, I didn't become a star until I took my clothes off
for `Ripley,''' he jokes.
 &HT;    ``I didn't have any trepidation about it,'' he says more
seriously. ``Frankly, being naked in plays is far more horrifying,
because those theaters are always so chilly.
 &HT;    ``Seriously, I'm not a great fan of doing love scenes,'' Law
adds. ``I don't like seeing naked bodies rolling around. But I do
think nudity to a degree can aid dramatic intention. In `Ripley' I
must get out of a tub _ I can't be wearing swimming trunks. I mean,
please! We're all grownups.''
 &HT;    Next up is Steven Spielberg's ``A.I.,'' about a boy robot (Haley
Joel Osment) in the 21st century. Law also recently wrapped
Jean-Jacques Annaud's ``Enemy at the Gates,'' a thriller
co-starring Ed Harris.
 &HT;    Offscreen, he spends time with his wife, actress Sadie Frost.
The two met in 1994 while filming the British film ``Shopping,''
and she's the inspiration for the tattoo on Law's left arm: ``Sexy
Sadie.''
 &HT;    The two live quietly in London with their children, Rafferty and
Findlay, also finding time to operate Natural Nylon, a production
company they co-founded with two old friends, actors Ewan McGregor
and Jonny Lee Miller.
 &HT;    ``All of us blokes would pool our money in the poor days and
split a plate of fish and chips,'' he recalls.
 &HT;    Now he can afford to buy his own lunch, but otherwise life is
much as it was then, Law says.
 &HT;    ``I'm just that actor who lives down the street,'' Law says. ``I
don't let that other stuff get in the way of living a normal
life.''

 (Includes a color slide of Sarah Jessica Parker with Cynthia Nixon,
Kristin Davis and Kim Cattrall in a scene from ``Sex and the
City.'') 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be printed in Canada before July 23. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There is nothing better than rolling out of bed and going to
work,'' Sarah Jessica Parker says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true for Parker, since for her going to work
often involves rolling back into bed _ and rarely alone.
</P>
<P>
   As Carrie Bradshaw, ``Sex and the City's'' wistfully wanton
journaliste d'amour, Parker enjoys fame, fortune and a dream
wardrobe, along with critical bouquets and plenty of time off for
feature-film or stage roles. But for this unabashed New Yorker, the
real treat is the show's location shoots, featuring the city which
she claims is the real star of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City is as integral a character as any of the women
on the show,'' she says enthusiastically. ``Otherwise it's not `Sex
and the City.' It's the greatest thing in the world to shoot in New
York City. It's the most romantic, most exciting, most challenging
and most problematic, but ultimately the most satisfying,
especially if you are a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   The satisfaction is showing _ and nobody is faking it. From New
York to Vancouver, from London to Paris to Sydney, ``Sex and the
City'' has become a television phenomenon of the same magnitude as
its HBO stablemate, ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   And, like the men that Carrie and her cohorts Samantha (Kim
Cattrall), Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon)
dream of, the series is rising to the occasion and improving with
age. This third season has seen a considerable deepening of the
emotional textures of the women, without sacrificing any laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Settling down for a quick chat backstage at a Los Angeles awards
show, the 35-year-old Parker shakes her head and looks
simultaneously thrilled and dumbfounded at the show's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very surprised by any success that `Sex and the City'
has had,'' she says. ``It's really been this unexpected, thrilling,
idyllic experience from day one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try not to ponder too much about the show and what people
find resonant,'' Parker adds. ``We're scared to make a show we
think people will respond to. We really just try to tell the story
and produce the best television show we can make, and hope that
people still feel connected to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The central characters' lives continue to evolve, the actress
says, which is one of her favorite things about the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, some things are subtle and some are nuanced and
there are some really amazing surprises that ... '' she trails off,
then resumes at full throttle. ``I'm kind of in the middle of a
story line right now that I can't really believe and I love! I call
my best friend all the time, and I'm kind of like, `Oh my God, I
can't believe what they are going to do now!' Because it is really,
really exciting _ at least for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But everything that happened last season to these women will
inform all the choices they make this year,'' she adds. ``My
character has been hurt and disappointed, and I think she's
resolved as to what that relationship with Mr. Big was. I think New
York has a lot of opportunity and potential, and she's looking for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for it? The ``Sex and the City'' girls seek opportunity
the way Indiana Jones hunts ancient treasure. Rumors abound that
the remainder of the third season will include a wedding _ but
whose? _ and two or three episodes shot in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that's already happened is the return to television of
film actor Kyle McLachlan, still best known as the dogged Agent
Cooper on the cult-classic ``Twin Peaks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great on the show and great fun,'' Parker says
cheerfully. ``A very nice addition for us this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Her onscreen persona may be television's most prominent single
woman, but offscreen Parker is happily married to actor Matthew
Broderick. Furthermore, she says, even before marrying she was
never as relentlessly single as Carrie. She briefly dated John F.
Kennedy Jr. and Chris Penn before beginning a one-year relationship
with Nicolas Cage, and for seven years dated troubled talent Robert
Downey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   It was Downey's drug use, which she recalls as being
``incredibly difficult to deal with,'' which ultimately ended their
relationship, Parker says.
</P>
<P>
   Accentuating the distance between the onscreen Carrie and the
offscreen Parker is the fact that, in real life, Parker disdains
swearing and is so modest that she insisted that her contract
stipulate that she would not appear nude on ``Sex and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not a moral judgment,'' she says. ``It's not about `I
am pure and good and they are bad.' It's just the way I choose to
communicate with my friends, and the choice of language I choose to
use. And I think that Kim Cattrall and Cynthia Nixon _ there was a
certain comfort level with language that they have on certain
things that I just don't, and they do it beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think it's much better-suited to them,'' she adds. ``I
couldn't pull it off, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she is very different from her character, Parker hastens
to add that she doesn't dislike her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot that I admire about Carrie,'' the actress says.
``She lives in a way that I've never lived, but that doesn't mean
that I don't like her. I'm actually very fond of her, fonder than I
thought I would be, although there's just so little about her that
I relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been part of a circle of friends like Carrie
has,'' Parker says. ``My social life has always been much less
public. I've never been somebody that frequented clubs or
experimented. I didn't display comfort with sexuality the same way
she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I'm awed and fascinated by It, and it's great fun
to play, I don't relate to it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker pauses briefly, shaking her head in thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day I am not entirely positive that the other women
exist,'' she says. ``I don't know if they are not fictional
characters that she makes up for her column. I don't know if she
has all those shoes. I don't know if she has a Fendi bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never talked to the writers about this,'' she adds with a
laugh, ``because I don't want to know. I don't want them to ponder
it at all.''

X-CEPTIONAL: FAMKE JANSSEN IS AN X-MAN WITH A MIND OF HER OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly

 (Includes a color slide of Famke Janssen in a scene from
``X-Men.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Famke Janssen was exasperated.
 &HT;    Soon after relocating from her native Holland to the United
States in 1984, she had ditched a lucrative career as a model to
pursue acting and to study writing and literature at Columbia
University in New York.
 &HT;    But she was going nowhere fast, and there were moments when the
statuesque and smart Janssen _ she stands 5-foot-11 and can
converse in English, Dutch, German and French _ began to seriously
question her decision.
 &HT;    ``Moments?'' she says. ``Years! It was the hardest time of my
life. Every morning I would wake up and it seemed to me that every
single person in the world was saying to me, `Stop doing this!
You're not making any money. Nobody wants to hire you.'
 &HT;    ``But I'd say to myself, `You can do it,''' she recalls. ``And I
did that for years. It was really hard. It's a competitive world,
very competitive.''
 &HT;    Janssen hung in there, and eventually landed work. By 1992 she
had guest-starred in an episode of ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation'' and made her film debut in the drama ``Fathers and
Sons.'' She got her first taste of stardom in 1995, when she played
a bad Bond girl, the memorably monikered Xenia Onatopp, in the hit
007 adventure ``Goldeneye.''
 &HT;    Since then Janssen has mixed it up, gracing major studio
releases and independent features of varying genres. Her resume
includes ``Lord of Illusions'' (1995), ``The Gingerbread Man''
(1997), ``City of Industry'' (1997), ``Rounders'' (1998),
``Monument Avenue'' (1998), ``The Faculty'' (1998), ``Celebrity''
(1998) and ``The House on Haunted Hill'' (1999).
 &HT;    On July 14 Janssen will return to the screen in ``X-Men,'' an
event movie that, like ``Goldeneye,'' could turbocharge her career.
Based on the long-running Marvel Comics series and directed by
Bryan Singer, ``X-Men'' features an eclectic ensemble cast that
includes Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, Halle Berry,
James Marsden, Hugh Jackman and Janssen as Jean Grey, a mutant with
both telepathic and telekinetic abilities.
 &HT;    ``Patrick Stewart's character, Professor X, runs this school of
mutants,'' Janssen says, speaking by telephone from her New York
apartment. ``Some of us are students and some of us are people
who've gone through there and are now teachers. So we're the X-Men,
who have special powers and are more developed.
 &HT;    ``At the school,'' she continues, ``the professor teaches us how
to control those powers, and what the movie deals with is the X-Men
versus the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood are mutants, led by Ian
McKellen, who have not really learned how to control their powers,
and they're taking advantage of them and abusing them. So we fight
them.
 &HT;    ``And then I have a whole love triangle between Jean Grey,
Wolverine (Jackman) and Cyclops (Marsden), both of whom are
X-Men.''
 &HT;    Singer went to great lengths to stay true to the ``Uncanny
X-Men'' comic book and its ``Who are the true outsiders?'' theme,
Janssen says. At the same time, however, the director strove to
avoid the over-the-top garishness, stunt casting and plot
contrivances that derailed the later ``Superman'' and ``Batman''
features.
 &HT;    ``He wanted to make it all real,'' says the actress, whose
character doesn't fly, can't shoot beams from her eyes and rarely
gets physical. ``He wanted everything about it to be real. In the
past, comic-book-based movies were a lot more fantastical.
 &HT;    ``To make a comic-book movie more realistic is a much bigger
challenge and more interesting,'' she says. ``It seems to me that
people can relate to it more if it's realistic.
 &HT;    ``But we'll see _ it's all up to the audience and how they feel
about it.''
 &HT;    Bottom line, Janssen stresses, ``X-Men'' is big summer
entertainment that delivers action along with a bit of romance and
a laugh or two. It's also got something to say about tolerance _
which, she hastens to add, should not be mistaken for a message.
 &HT;    ``I don't like message movies,'' Janssen says. ``I don't know
that movies ought to have a message. It's sort of a myth in
Hollywood that you have to have a message.
 &HT;    ``If a movie is a reflection of life and life is very harsh,
then that's enough.''
 &HT;    Though she's signed for an ``X-Men'' sequel, Janssen's next
films are as different from ``X-Men'' as possible. In the
independent feature ``Love &AMP; Sex,'' due out in August, Janssen
plays Kate Welles, a writer who revisits the gory details of her
love life when given 24 hours to pen a magazine article about the
perfect relationship. Jon Favreau co-stars in the dark romantic
comedy as Kate's most recent ex-boyfriend.
 &HT;    Favreau also figures prominently in Janssen's next film,
``Made.'' Directed by Favreau and co-starring Favreau and Vince
Vaughn, the Mafia-oriented comedy is a follow-up of sorts to the
sleeper hit ``Swingers'' (1996).
 &HT;    It seems as if it's all going according to plan for Janssen.
Still, she's paid a price for her reluctance to cash in, for her
desire not to win roles based solely on her looks.
 &HT;    ``I probably could have been a bigger star, maybe, for a moment
in time,'' says Janssen, who is 35 and single. ``But not for the
long run.
 &HT;    ``What I've tried to do is be taken seriously by the people in
the business, work with good directors and do different types of
roles,'' she says, ``so that people can see that I have some range
and don't have to be just some pretty girl in an action movie. I
think, in that respect, I've succeeded.
 &HT;    ``At some point you want to move on and play leads in movies,''
Janssen concludes. ``I've done that with `Love &AMP; Sex,' and it will
be up to the success or failure of that movie to see what happens
in terms of my career. But `Love &AMP; Sex' was a big step for me.''

 &HT;    But when he had an anxiety attack at the thought of meeting an
actor, it was Lily Tomlin.
 &HT;    ``I was really nervous,'' the director says, ``because I
remembered seeing her show, `The Search for Signs of Intelligent
Life in the Universe,' on Broadway, and I had never seen anything
better.
 &HT;    ``When Lily came on the set, I said to her, `You are a comic
genius, I loved you on `Laugh-In' _ just tell me what's funny.'''
 &HT;    Hearing this story, Tomlin giggles. She was just as nervous, she
says, about undertaking her largest movie role in years.
 &HT;    ``Fortunately Jon is like a big kid,'' she says, ``and so
playful that he made it easy to be funny.''
 &HT;    Tomlin has been being funny since even before she first got
famous on ``Laugh-In,'' the seminal 1960s television program in
which she played Ernestine, the irrepressibly impudent telephone
operator, and Edith Ann, that precocious and devilish 5-year-old.
 &HT;    Three decades and a shelf full of Emmys and Tonys later, she
finds herself cast opposite Willis _ who plays the kind of tough
boss that Tomlin tamed in ``Nine to Five'' (1980) _ as his
no-nonsense executive assistant, whose awesome organizational
skills keep his schedule, if not his personal life, on track.
 &HT;    Working with Willis was no problem, the actress says.
 &HT;    ``I've admired him ever since I saw him on `Moonlighting,''' she
says. ``He was charismatic and sexy, and also twinkly and likeable.
When we got together to talk about the movie he was wearing jeans
and a ball cap, and we just started playing around.
 &HT;    ``I know Bruce is an enormous star,'' she adds, ``but he's a
pretty reachable guy. He's accessible. He was everything I expected
him to be, and the best part is that he doesn't take himself too
seriously.
 &HT;    ``I guess in real life he would actually be a good boss.''
 &HT;    It's been a while, but Tomlin still winces at the memory of her
own experience as an office worker.
 &HT;    ``I was the executive assistant for a man in New York who later
became the head of ICM (the prominent artist-management firm),''
she recalls. ``Actually, I was sort of the office flunky, and the
other three women in the office just tortured me. I was a hippie in
burlap skirts and T-shirts, and the women in the office were all
the opposite of me, with long fingernails and bubble hairdos.''
 &HT;    In ``The Kid,'' which will open nationwide on July 7, Tomlin's
character doesn't suffer in silence, keeping her workaholic boss on
his toes with sarcasm and wisecracks.
 &HT;    ``I think my character has a real affection for him,'' the
actress says, ``and she believes that there's a better man inside
him waiting to get out. I'm waiting for that guy to turn the
corner, you know.''
 &HT;    The cue for that change is the arrival of the titular kid
(Spencer Breslin), who through a supernatural twist turns out to be
Willis' character at the age of 8. Against his will, the
high-powered executive finds himself forced to relive the struggles
of his childhood.
 &HT;    That wouldn't be easy for anyone, says Tomlin, who isn't sure
how she's react if she had to confront her 8-year-old self.
 &HT;    ``I would see a kid who still thinks she's pretty great,'' she
muses. ``She wasn't focusing on any problems in her life.''
 &HT;    Tomlin grew up in a blue-collar family in Detroit, not quite
poor but not too far from the brink, either.
 &HT;    ``My mother was very motherly,'' she says, ``but my dad loved to
go to the racetrack. I'd go with him and hang out at the bar
sometimes, but I'd also go to my mother's Tupperware parties.''
 &HT;    Her world was full of people from diverse backgrounds, which
surely enhanced Tomlin's emerging talent to create memorable
characters.
 &HT;    ``We lived in an old apartment house,'' she recalls, ``and it
was full of different kinds of people, all of them were either on
their way up or on their way down. In every single apartment there
was a different kind of life going on, from a different culture. I
soaked it up. Whatever they were doing, I did _ I was always
imitating people.
 &HT;    ``I loved to do shows, to perform for people,'' Tomlin says. ``I
would steal material from television comedians like Jean Carroll,
one of the first female stand-ups who appeared on `The Ed Sullivan
Show.' I stole all of her jokes about her husband.''
 &HT;    When she wasn't performing for the neighborhood, Tomlin was
turning her ability to convey different characters into the chance
to make a few bucks.
 &HT;    ``I had a babysitting business when I was 10,'' she says,
``because I had such an air of competence. I remember one New
Year's Eve when I was 12, I was watching like 16 children. I hired
my girlfriend for $2 to help. Can you imagine? Sixteen children
with a girl who was really just a kid.
 &HT;    ``I guess that's the closest I've ever gotten to the character I
play in `The Kid,''' she adds with a grin. ``As a little girl, I
was very well-organized. Since then I've had assistants who were.
They're also much funnier than I am, quicker with a comeback and
very sarcastic.''
 &HT;    Once one of the most innovative stand-up comedians of her
generation, Tomlin seems alienated from the comedy of today.
 &HT;    ``I personally like humor that is perceptive and, ultimately,
makes you and everyone else feel a little bit better,'' she says,
``rather than loathe yourself and everybody else.
 &HT;    ``I think what's considered to be ground-breaking in comedy
today really seems to be coming out of some sort of profound
repression,'' Tomlin says. ``It's very adolescent and immature. I
remember, when one of the sitcoms first got the word `fart' on TV,
they made a big fuss about it. It was like, `How hip are we?' I
don't see that as ground-breaking at all.
 &HT;    ``Fifteen years ago, in `The Search for Signs of Intelligent
Life in the Universe,''' she continues, ``Jane Wagner wrote a line
for me _ `No matter how cynical you are, it's never enough to keep
up.' I've seen that line quoted over and over. And there's another
one: `I worry that today's reality check is yesterday's culture
shock.'
 &HT;    ``That was written 15 years ago,'' she concludes, ``and now it's
out of control. I think we're just being dumbed down and debased.
Kids are cynical at a younger and younger age.''
 &HT;    In such a climate, she says, a film like ``The Kid'' _ with its
anti-cynical message of hope _ might be all too timely.
 &HT;    ``What I love is that Bruce's character is cut off emotionally
and totally caught up by his ambition,'' she says. ``He's cold,
impersonal and hard-edged. But then, by going back to that little
kid, himself, that he loathed, he breaks through that armor.
 &HT;    ``I wish we could all do that,'' the actress concludes. ``I wish
we were all more soft and tender, toward ourselves and everyone
else.''

RULE OF LAW: AFTER THE OSCARS, JUDE LAW IS RIDING HIGH 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Jude Law in a scene from ``The Wisdom of
Crocodiles.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    When Jude Law looks in a mirror, he doesn't see a sex symbol
looking back.
 &HT;    ``I see the dark circles under the eyes,'' the British actor
says. ``I see the sunburned skin. I see someone who might have made
a mistake when he cut his hair in the bathroom by himself. I also
see a guy who looks like he could use a few extra hours of sleep.
 &HT;    ``I'm not a sex symbol.''
 &HT;    Thousands of admiring women beg to differ, but as he relaxes in
a suite at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel, Law seems entirely
sincere in his protestations. He doesn't think he's sexy, and
doesn't want to.
 &HT;    ``Being sexy is basically something I can't think about,'' he
explains, ``or I'll be doomed to spending two hours in the mirror
before I get out of the house. And, frankly, if I monopolized the
bathroom, my wife and sons would want to kill me.''
 &HT;    Law has been on something of a roll lately, following up
critically lauded performances in ``Gattaca'' (1997) and ``Wilde''
(1998) with ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' (1999), in which he played
a 1950s expatriate-American golden boy so effectively that he
snagged an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor for
his pains.
 &HT;    As he passes through the hallways of the Four Seasons, no one
seems to connect the soft-spoken Englishman, rail-thin in khaki
pants and a matching green sweater, with the impossibly buff Dickie
Greenleaf he portrayed in ``Mr. Ripley'' _ which is just fine with
him.
 &HT;    ``My reality is my family,'' the 28-year-old actor says. ``It's
my wife and sons. I'm old enough to know that fame is not the
secret to happiness.''
 &HT;    Law's latest movie opens nationwide on July 14, but it's not the
high-profile, big-budget fare most Oscar nominees turn to in an
effort to cash in.
 &HT;    Instead Law picked the low-budget erotic thriller ``The Wisdom
of Crocodiles,'' an offbeat riff on Oscar Wilde's ``The Portrait of
Dorian Gray.'' Law plays Steven Grlscz, a handsome, successful,
witty man who easily seduces women _ and then kills them. He is
bloodthirsty, literally, and may be a vampire.
 &HT;    ``He's a man with a lot of peculiar traits,'' Law says. ``I want
to play men you can't neatly put into a file folder with a label on
them. And this character fits, because he keeps audiences
guessing.''
 &HT;    ``Mr. Ripley'' kept them guessing as well, to the tune of $100
million at the box office _ which came as a surprise to Law.
 &HT;    ``I loved the movie,'' the actor says, ``but, then again, I
always love my movies. For years I've heard people say, `Jude, this
is your breakout role' _ it's always your breakout role. So my
standard response with every movie now is, `Let's wait and see what
happens.'''
 &HT;    Otherwise, he says, the disappointment can be unbearable.
 &HT;    ``You buy into the buzz,'' he says. ``For instance, when I did
`Gattaca' (1997), I kept hearing, `This is it for you.' I thought,
`My God, this is going to be huge.'
 &HT;    ``Listen, I'm still waiting for that movie to happen for me,''
he jokes. ``Maybe it's huge on video.''
 &HT;    ``Mr. Ripley,'' which co-starred Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow,
actually was huge. In fact, the degree of attention it has brought
him is rather off-putting, the English actor says.
 &HT;    ``I've never wanted fame,'' he insists. ``I'm an actor because I
enjoy acting. And it has been that way since I was a child _ my
parents were acting teachers who ran a theater company on and off
in Italy, so they taught me to take it very seriously.''
 &HT;    His parents were serious enough to name their son after the
death-obsessed protagonist of Thomas Hardy's classic ``Jude the
Obscure,'' but lighthearted enough also to have been influenced by
the Beatles song ``Hey, Jude,'' with its message of hope and
consolation.
 &HT;    Law was only 3 when his parents first began taking him to the
London theater, but he was immediately captivated.
 &HT;    ``I just remember sitting there and responding to the
emotions,'' he says. ``I didn't understand exactly what was
happening on stage, but I knew the feelings of love and anger and
rage.''
 &HT;    By age 5, he was on school stages. He's rarely stepped offstage
since.
 &HT;    ``The minute I was put on stage, I felt like I had come home,''
he says. ``I suppose it's the same way an athlete feels on the
field. I felt like I had done this thing about a million times. It
felt natural to me to be on stage. I understood what I should do up
there _ it was where I belonged.''
 &HT;    Youthful roles with the National Youth Music Theater led to work
with the National Theatre, and at 16 Law dropped out of high school
to act full-time.
 &HT;    His first adult job was on the British soaper ``Families.'' Law
went on to tour Europe in Shaw's ``Pygmalion,'' then originated the
role of Michael in ``Les Parents Terribles,'' which came to
Broadway as ``Indiscretions'' (1995) and earned Law a Tony
nomination.
 &HT;    Oh, and he also caught quite a few people's eyes in the second
act, when he stepped out of a bathtub buck naked.
 &HT;    ``Gattaca'' and a role as a murdered bisexual hustler in
``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (1997) followed. His
performance as the tempestuous Lord Alfred Douglas earned rave
reviews in ``Wilde'' (1998), but the film was scarcely seen.
 &HT;    And then came ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' _ and another nude
scene, which certainly didn't hurt his appeal to the younger
females in the audience.
 &HT;    ``Face it, I didn't become a star until I took my clothes off
for `Ripley,''' he jokes.
 &HT;    ``I didn't have any trepidation about it,'' he says more
seriously. ``Frankly, being naked in plays is far more horrifying,
because those theaters are always so chilly.
 &HT;    ``Seriously, I'm not a great fan of doing love scenes,'' Law
adds. ``I don't like seeing naked bodies rolling around. But I do
think nudity to a degree can aid dramatic intention. In `Ripley' I
must get out of a tub _ I can't be wearing swimming trunks. I mean,
please! We're all grownups.''
 &HT;    Next up is Steven Spielberg's ``A.I.,'' about a boy robot (Haley
Joel Osment) in the 21st century. Law also recently wrapped
Jean-Jacques Annaud's ``Enemy at the Gates,'' a thriller
co-starring Ed Harris.
 &HT;    Offscreen, he spends time with his wife, actress Sadie Frost.
The two met in 1994 while filming the British film ``Shopping,''
and she's the inspiration for the tattoo on Law's left arm: ``Sexy
Sadie.''
 &HT;    The two live quietly in London with their children, Rafferty and
Findlay, also finding time to operate Natural Nylon, a production
company they co-founded with two old friends, actors Ewan McGregor
and Jonny Lee Miller.
 &HT;    ``All of us blokes would pool our money in the poor days and
split a plate of fish and chips,'' he recalls.
 &HT;    Now he can afford to buy his own lunch, but otherwise life is
much as it was then, Law says.
 &HT;    ``I'm just that actor who lives down the street,'' Law says. ``I
don't let that other stuff get in the way of living a normal
life.''

 (Includes a color slide of Sarah Jessica Parker with Cynthia Nixon,
Kristin Davis and Kim Cattrall in a scene from ``Sex and the
City.'') 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be printed in Canada before July 23. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There is nothing better than rolling out of bed and going to
work,'' Sarah Jessica Parker says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true for Parker, since for her going to work
often involves rolling back into bed _ and rarely alone.
</P>
<P>
   As Carrie Bradshaw, ``Sex and the City's'' wistfully wanton
journaliste d'amour, Parker enjoys fame, fortune and a dream
wardrobe, along with critical bouquets and plenty of time off for
feature-film or stage roles. But for this unabashed New Yorker, the
real treat is the show's location shoots, featuring the city which
she claims is the real star of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City is as integral a character as any of the women
on the show,'' she says enthusiastically. ``Otherwise it's not `Sex
and the City.' It's the greatest thing in the world to shoot in New
York City. It's the most romantic, most exciting, most challenging
and most problematic, but ultimately the most satisfying,
especially if you are a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   The satisfaction is showing _ and nobody is faking it. From New
York to Vancouver, from London to Paris to Sydney, ``Sex and the
City'' has become a television phenomenon of the same magnitude as
its HBO stablemate, ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   And, like the men that Carrie and her cohorts Samantha (Kim
Cattrall), Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon)
dream of, the series is rising to the occasion and improving with
age. This third season has seen a considerable deepening of the
emotional textures of the women, without sacrificing any laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Settling down for a quick chat backstage at a Los Angeles awards
show, the 35-year-old Parker shakes her head and looks
simultaneously thrilled and dumbfounded at the show's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very surprised by any success that `Sex and the City'
has had,'' she says. ``It's really been this unexpected, thrilling,
idyllic experience from day one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try not to ponder too much about the show and what people
find resonant,'' Parker adds. ``We're scared to make a show we
think people will respond to. We really just try to tell the story
and produce the best television show we can make, and hope that
people still feel connected to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The central characters' lives continue to evolve, the actress
says, which is one of her favorite things about the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, some things are subtle and some are nuanced and
there are some really amazing surprises that ... '' she trails off,
then resumes at full throttle. ``I'm kind of in the middle of a
story line right now that I can't really believe and I love! I call
my best friend all the time, and I'm kind of like, `Oh my God, I
can't believe what they are going to do now!' Because it is really,
really exciting _ at least for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But everything that happened last season to these women will
inform all the choices they make this year,'' she adds. ``My
character has been hurt and disappointed, and I think she's
resolved as to what that relationship with Mr. Big was. I think New
York has a lot of opportunity and potential, and she's looking for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for it? The ``Sex and the City'' girls seek opportunity
the way Indiana Jones hunts ancient treasure. Rumors abound that
the remainder of the third season will include a wedding _ but
whose? _ and two or three episodes shot in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that's already happened is the return to television of
film actor Kyle McLachlan, still best known as the dogged Agent
Cooper on the cult-classic ``Twin Peaks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great on the show and great fun,'' Parker says
cheerfully. ``A very nice addition for us this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Her onscreen persona may be television's most prominent single
woman, but offscreen Parker is happily married to actor Matthew
Broderick. Furthermore, she says, even before marrying she was
never as relentlessly single as Carrie. She briefly dated John F.
Kennedy Jr. and Chris Penn before beginning a one-year relationship
with Nicolas Cage, and for seven years dated troubled talent Robert
Downey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   It was Downey's drug use, which she recalls as being
``incredibly difficult to deal with,'' which ultimately ended their
relationship, Parker says.
</P>
<P>
   Accentuating the distance between the onscreen Carrie and the
offscreen Parker is the fact that, in real life, Parker disdains
swearing and is so modest that she insisted that her contract
stipulate that she would not appear nude on ``Sex and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not a moral judgment,'' she says. ``It's not about `I
am pure and good and they are bad.' It's just the way I choose to
communicate with my friends, and the choice of language I choose to
use. And I think that Kim Cattrall and Cynthia Nixon _ there was a
certain comfort level with language that they have on certain
things that I just don't, and they do it beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think it's much better-suited to them,'' she adds. ``I
couldn't pull it off, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she is very different from her character, Parker hastens
to add that she doesn't dislike her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot that I admire about Carrie,'' the actress says.
``She lives in a way that I've never lived, but that doesn't mean
that I don't like her. I'm actually very fond of her, fonder than I
thought I would be, although there's just so little about her that
I relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been part of a circle of friends like Carrie
has,'' Parker says. ``My social life has always been much less
public. I've never been somebody that frequented clubs or
experimented. I didn't display comfort with sexuality the same way
she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I'm awed and fascinated by It, and it's great fun
to play, I don't relate to it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker pauses briefly, shaking her head in thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day I am not entirely positive that the other women
exist,'' she says. ``I don't know if they are not fictional
characters that she makes up for her column. I don't know if she
has all those shoes. I don't know if she has a Fendi bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never talked to the writers about this,'' she adds with a
laugh, ``because I don't want to know. I don't want them to ponder
it at all.''

KYLE PETTY OPTS OUT OF N.H. 300

<P>
   Kyle Petty, who was scheduled to run his No. 44 Hot Wheels
Pontiac in this weekend's New Hampshire 300 in Loudon, N.H., has
decided not to participate, Petty Enterprises announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle's son Adam was killed in a crash at New Hampshire
International Speedway May 12 while preparing for a Busch Series
race; Sunday's Winston Cup event would have been the first at
Loudon since that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Dennison of Petty Enterprises told the Associated Press,
``He just didn't feel comfortable. They decided it would be better
just to take a week off.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennison said Petty would return for the circuit's next event,
July 23 at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pa.

for Petty Enterprises, will take Petty's place Sunday and also run
in the Craftsman Truck Series New Hampshire 200 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   NHIS president Gary Bahre said, ``We didn't really know one way
or the other, but we are not necessarily surprised at this
decision. It is obivous that this was a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that (Grissom) has been a very capable race car driver
and has done good things for their team.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe last Thursday at Daytona (Fla.)
International Speedway, Petty said, `Sometimes you think about it,
and that's why I say, `Do I want to go back?' Yeah, I want to go
back at some point in time just to tell everybody how much I
appreciate everything they did for Adam.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty is 34th in the Winston Cup standings with 1,124 points. He
has started 14 races, with his only top 10 finish coming April 16
in the DieHard 500 at Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   Stock car legend Richard Petty, Kyle's father, also will not
make the trip to New Hampshire this weekend; he had already had
vacation plans.
</P>
<P>
   Following this weekend's action, NHIS will host another Winston
Cup event Sept. 17.

AUSSIE ACTOR HAS STAR CHARISMA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year at this time, Heath Ledger was one phone call away
from packing up his bags, returning to his native Australia and
resuming what had been a successful acting career _ successful,
that is, until he came to the States.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the phone call, courtesy of director Roland Emmerich,
and Ledger was cast in the Revolutionary War epic ``The Patriot,''
playing opposite Australian icon Mel Gibson. Now the only travel
plans Ledger makes revolve around movie projects. He's just back
from Prague, where he's making ``A Knight's Tale,'' another
medieval adventure set for a high-profile opening next summer. Next
up will be the fourth remake of the classic adventure ``The Four
Feathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a 21-year-old who had been inundated with nothing
but teen movie scripts after making a strong impression last year
in ``10 Things I Hate About You.'' His name not withstanding (Heath
is short for Heathcliff; his mom has a thing for ``Wuthering
Heights''), Ledger isn't much for mush. For a year after finishing
``10 Things,'' he turned down dozens of movies aimed at the
Clearasil set, waiting for a film that he ``would be in love
with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long year,'' Ledger says, his Aussie accent still
very much intact. ``I went out for jobs that I probably shouldn't
have been going for, things that had another 30 or 40 actors ahead
of me. But I wanted to give it a shot. And I got very close on a
lot of great projects, very close, and then the rug just always was
pulled out from underneath my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledger was so determined there would be no rug-pulling with
``The Patriot,'' he nearly accomplished the job himself. When he
met with Emmerich (``Independence Day,'' ``Godzilla'') and his
producing partner Dean Devlin, Ledger stopped midway through
reading a scene, apologized to the filmmakers for wasting their
time and walked out of the audition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I had blown my last chance,'' Ledger says. ``And I
was tired from the whole year and I didn't feel like taking it to a
place where I'd almost get the part and then see it go to someone
else. That's why I left. But Roland and Dean must have liked
something about me; either that, or they were curious about what
kind of fool would walk out on an audition like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Devlin admits he and Emmerich were intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Heath is that he has the one quality that's
hard to find in most young actors, and that's the quality of being
a man,'' Devlin says. ``Most 21-year-olds still feel like boys.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ledger's role in ``The Patriot'' called for a mixture of
impetuousness and composure, a blend that suits the young actor to
a T. In the Revolutionary War film, Ledger plays Gabriel, Gibson's
headstrong son, a young man who enlists in the Continental Army
against his father's wishes. For Gabriel, patriotism comes before
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabriel represents the new generation and has all the idealism
that goes along with that,'' Ledger says.
</P>
<P>
   The reason behind Ledger's own maturity isn't difficult to
pinpoint. After growing up in rough-and-tumble Perth and getting
his feet wet acting in local theater productions, Ledger decided to
hop in a car with his best friend and move to Sydney. He was 16 at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train of life was just flying by and I had to jump on
it,'' Ledger says. ``I had 69 cents in my bank account and a bit of
cash that my folks gave me. Looking back, I'm amazed that my
parents were lenient and understanding about letting me follow my
dreams. But I was a kid who was going to do it anyway. It was
either going to be the hard way or the easy way, and I think they
knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   The easy way turned out to be, well, pretty easy, at least at
first. Ledger won parts on two Australian dramas and a sitcom and
then landed the lead on a short-lived, swashbuckling Fox television
series called ``Roar.'' He moved to Los Angeles when he turned 19,
and landed ``10 Things,'' winning the heart of Julia Stiles (and
young female moviegoers) playing the rogueish Patrick Verona.
</P>
<P>
   So when rejection came (and it came often after ``10 Things''),
Ledger didn't have much experience dealing with failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating, but it's all part of the journey, you
know,'' Ledger says. ``And I don't know how long this journey is
going to last, but I'm having a lot of fun right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That casual attitude trickles down to other areas of Ledger's
life, most notably his grooming and attire, which takes artful
dishevelment to new heights. Ledger's hobbies include photography
and tap dancing, the latter a nod to his movie hero, Gene Kelly.
His dream assignment would be to remake one of Kelly's old films,
with ``The Pirate'' being his top choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly wasn't the greatest actor and he wasn't a great
singer,'' Ledger says. ``But boy could he dance. And he had such a
strong spirit. He could bring light to the screen and just fill it
up. I remind myself of his spirit sometimes when I need to push
through on a particular scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledger may have been thinking of Kelly when he showed up on the
first day of shooting for ``The Patriot.'' He admits he was
initially ``hopeless,'' and needed to grab hold of any inspiration
he could find.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see he had a reverence for Mel because Mel is so big
in Australia,'' Emmerich says. ``I think Heath went home that first
day a nervous wreck; he was so disappointed in himself. But he was
actually pretty good that day, although you wouldn't be able to
tell him that.''
</P>
<P>
   No, you wouldn't. Ledger calls himself his ``own worst critic,''
but he cuts himself some slack, too, saying that he calmed down
once Gibson put him at ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I just soaked up as much information as I could,''
Ledger says. ``Mel is a lovely, lovely man, and that's surprising
because I know not everyone in his position is as friendly as he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Ledger's own position is loftier, he's being courted
for some more high-profile projects, including the ``Spider-Man''
feature film. But Ledger says he's not cut out to be an action
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't really interest me,'' Ledger says. ``Too many
action movies are just slapped together and the action always comes
before the story. Look at the last `Star Wars.' It just sucked. It
seemed like it was created just to sell merchandise and video
games. That's not the kind of thing I want to waste my time with.''

   FACTS OF LIFE FOR WHALES
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is a third whale involved in positioning whales for mating?
</P>
<P>
   A. In some whale species, a third whale may have a role in
courtship, but it is now thought to involve competition, not
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The California gray whale, Eschrichtius robustus, has many more
males than females, according to ``Gray Whales'' by David G. Gordon
and Alan Baldridge (Monterey Bay Aquarium Press). ``Two courting
bulls often follow the same cow, forming tightly knit trios that
remain intact right up to the moment of conception,'' the book
says. The cow slows down, signaling a willingness to mate, and the
bulls use their flippers to slow her down even more. The bulls swim
upside down beside her, each trying to press his advantage. When
one succeeds in rotating his underside alongside that of the cow,
copulation occurs.
</P>
<P>
   There was some speculation that an extra male, or males, held
the mating pair together to brace them for mating. However,
Baldridge said, this idea is now mostly dismissed as a
misinterpretation of what is going on in a process that is
difficult to study. A female may have multiple partners, ``but the
relationship between the males is one of competition, not
collaboration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for getting into position to mate, Baldridge said, the female
usually floats rightside up and the male comes up from below.
``What you do see in mating whales is a lot of rolling around,'' he
said, ``and if a female does not wish to mate, she will roll belly
up.'' &QL;

HINGIS, WILLIAMS ENCOUNTER WOULD BE HERCULEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Hercules, the old Greek bodybuilding champ, surely
would sympathize with a little kid named Martina Hingis, wandering
the dangerous grassland of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   He had to deal with the deadly Hydra, a multiheaded sea monster.
Hingis may have the tougher prospect: coping with the dual-visaged
head-breaker named Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has been able to handle one-half of the towering,
glowering menace but never the total package: Venus and Serena in
succession. Hingis knows how Hercules felt. When he axed one of the
Hydra's heads, two grew in its place. If she chops down one
Williams, one more springs up in her face, thirsting for familial
revenge. And getting it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Wimbledon proposition confronting the No. 1 female
tennis toiler on earth as Venus and Serena plot an earthquake for
her. This all came about on a customary afternoon at the Big W: a
little sun, a little rain, a lot of people (38,247) as Venus and
Serena blasted their way into the quarterfinals, skipping through
the house graveyard, Court 2, like happy shovelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graveyard? I didn't know about that,'' said big sister Venus
of the traditionally hazardous cubicle where so many celebrated
heads have rolled. She was sloppy at the end, missing a ton of
first serves and losing three match points and a 5-1 lead, but
still hammered lefty Miriam Oremans, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Also unaware of Court 2's reputation, getting-bigger sister
Serena got out before Tamarine Tanasugarn (of the Bangkok
Tanasugarns) could even think about building a funeral pyre, 6-1,
6-1.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the ivy-festooned lot, Court 1, Hingis bade
a brisk ``wiedersehn'' to the 11th-seeded German, Anke Huber, 6-1,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   That set up Hingis for the Herculean labor of Venus Tuesday and,
probably, Serena in a semi Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can beat them. I do beat them,'' says Hingis with a sigh.
``But I never beat them both in the same tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   She's got her history right. Although she's 9-5 against Venus
and 3-3 against Serena, Hingis is 0-3 when they gang up. You might
beat up my sister, kid, but you can't knock off the family; that's
the Williams theme.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded first at Key Biscayne, Fla., two years ago as Hingis
nailed Serena but not Venus, and was reprised at Rome last year.
Reversing the order at the US Open, Hingis cut down Venus but felt
the blade of Serena in the title match, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Serena has to defeat Philadelphian Lisa Raymond
Tuesday to make sure that Hingis must scale a second Everest if she
conquers Venus. Serena, who has ``grown more than an inch, I'm up
over 5-10'' since she carried the US, is looking more and more like
the flamethrower of Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got each other,'' says Hingis. ``That really helps, to
practice against each other. They both hit so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing that, Serena giggles and says, ``She can join the family
and practice with us. We're hospitable people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sisters Sledgehammer, healthy and together in a tournament
for the first time this year, flail so fiercely that they drove
Hingis (a) crazy, and (b) to a gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came into the game with a new game,'' says the dwarfed
Hingis, 7 inches shorter than 6-2 Venus. ``A lot more power, a lot
more physical abilities. Everybody had to improve on their physical
abilities, and so did I have to. Just work out more, get stronger,
hit the ball harder basically. That's what they've meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Going against these siblings consecutively may be like facing
Pedro and Ramon of Our Old Towne Team, one after the other. You can
bet Hingis will be praying for herself and Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   Five years have passed since five Americans have crowded the
last eight here. The champ, Lindsay Davenport, and her foe, Monica
Seles are the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good,'' says Serena. ``It must be the McDonald's
influence. Cheeseburgers. Also milk. I love milk.'' By the way, she
endorses it commercially.
</P>
<P>
   A new training theory, but the sisters are never short of
theories or confidence, even if they are short of the famous beads.
``New stuff,'' says Serena. Her outlook is lilac: hair ribbon,
racing stripes on her dress, fingernails and toenails.
</P>
<P>
   Her outlook is also positive-plus. ``I came here to win, and I
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus says, ``I'm planning on winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis says, ``I'm going to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, the elder of the quartet, says, ``I learned a long
time ago not to make predictions like that. I'll say that I feel
capable of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena, averaging 55 minutes a match, and Venus, 66, have been
hit-and-running as though they were late for their latest
cheeseburger. But Hingis says accurately, ``The tournament begins
Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows what lies ahead, and intends to somehow clean house as
efficiently as Hercules mopped up the Augean stables among his 12
mighty labors.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what he would have done on cheeseburgers and milk.

VICENTE FOX: MEXICO'S PRESIDENT-ELECT NOT ONE TO HIDE HIS
AMBITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MEXICO-ELECTION and related stories) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The confirmation of his election as president of
Mexico was still hours away, the victory real only in the computers
of his pollsters, but Vicente Fox was already three steps down the
road. There would be a quick sip of champagne, a victory speech and
then he would get to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right tomorrow I want to be working,'' Fox told an American
journalist in between nonstop interviews handled over his
ever-present cell phone. ``My hobby is work. It enchants me. I
thoroughly enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who turned 58 on the day that Mexicans elected him the
first president in the nation's modern history from an opposition
party, is nothing if not a man of considerable ambition and energy.
He is a politician who once told his political marketing strategist
to ``sell me'' like any other product.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a prosperous rancher, his career has traversed
business and politics. A manufacturer of cowboy boots and a former
Coca-Cola executive, Fox entered politics by being elected a
congressman and later was a governor.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more than anything else, Fox is a maverick. In
Congress half of his votes followed the line of his conservative,
pro-business party. The other half were leftist positions, many of
which were backed by the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, which he vanquished on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his campaign began, he was careful to manage
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending 70 years of dictatorship will be a great heroic exploit
for Mexico,'' he said, ``something like when you Americans put a
man on the moon. Reaching the moon took a decade of work, and
defeating the ruling party will also require lots of time, talent
and money.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Fox sought to allay fears that turmoil
might result were he to prevail by pledging to form what he has
called a government of transition. After his victory, he reiterated
those promises, extending friendly messages to his rivals and
calling for unity.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as governor of Guanajuato state in central Mexico from
1995 until he resigned to campaign for president, Fox appointed a
woman with ties to the PRI as his state auditor and enlisted the
help of a member of the largest leftist party to devise programs to
benefit rural women.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly the government he will lead will contrast sharply
with those of the 13 consecutive PRI presidents before him, partly
because he is likely to bring his business instincts to the job.
</P>
<P>
   When he formed his campaign team last fall, Fox asked a
headhunting firm to locate superstar executives to act as his top
aides. He is unabashed at using marketing techniques for political
communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me as a product, and figure out how to sell me,'' Fox
said to Francisco Ortiz, the former Procter &AMP; Gamble marketing
wizard he hired to direct his broadcast campaign, Ortiz recalled in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although he ran as the candidate of the center-right National
Action Party, Fox reached out to leftist intellectuals from across
Latin America, and in discussion groups, he demonstrated
considerable political flexibility, according to Jorge Castaneda,
the liberal New York University professor and author who lives here
part time.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were from a different world, ideologically and
socially, and he was learning how to get along,'' Castaneda said.
``These were establishment and leftist intellectuals. They dressed
differently, they liked different things. To put it mildly, he was
not in his element. But he'd sit down and he'd manage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicente Fox is a phenomenon,'' said Morris, the American
political consultant. ``This has not been a situation where the
consultant runs the campaign. Fox has a chemistry with the people
of Mexico that is beyond belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on July 2, 1942, in Mexico City, Fox spent his childhood on
an 1,100-acre ranch in San Francisco del Rincon, Guanajuato,
purchased during the Mexican revolution by his paternal
grandfather, an immigrant to Mexico of Irish descent.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Mercedes Quesada, was born in Spain, a legal
impediment for Fox's eventual political ambitions until a clause
barring the children of immigrants from serving as president was
eliminated from the Mexican constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has eight siblings. His father was a prosperous landholder,
although not vastly wealthy in Mexican terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something I'm proud of is that I became good friends with the
children of the smallholders and peasants; with them I shared my
infancy, my playthings, my house and my food,'' he wrote in a
campaign autobiography. ``From that time I began to understand our
country's painful inequalities.''
</P>
<P>
   He was educated by Jesuits, and spent a year at an academy in
Prairie du Chien, Wis., learning among other things how to speak
fluent but accented English.
</P>
<P>
   A devout Catholic, he could be the most unapologetically
religious of Mexico's modern presidents. The governing party that
coalesced after Mexico's 1917 Revolution had a strong anticlerical
bias, and the armies of the revolutionary governments that ruled
during the 1920s carried out a bloody counterinsurgency against
Catholic rebels in the west-central region that surrounds Fox's
birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has expressed historical fascination with the legacy of the
Catholic insurgents, known as Cristeros, and during his campaign
often ended rallies with a Cristero war cry: ``If I advance, follow
me! If I stop, push me! If I retreat, kill me!''
</P>
<P>
   If his predecessors have learned the country's local
idiosyncracies as military men or as government bureaucrats, Fox's
sense for the texture of grassroots life came as a route supervisor
for Coca Cola, where he worked in six cities in seven years. After
his transfer to Mexico City in 1971, he climbed to the top of
Coke's corporate hierarchy, serving as chief executive from 1975 to
1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hated most about those years at Coca-Cola was the time
I had to spend dithering with the government,'' he said recently,
recalling how the president would convene Fox and hundreds of other
business executives to the presidential palace ``so we could listen
to a lot of foolishness.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Coke offered to make Fox the head of its Latin American
operations, which would have required that he move to Miami.
Instead, he quit and returned to Guanajuato to work with his
brothers.

   The early 1980s saw many peso devaluations, and Fox has said
that the harrowing experience of running a small business with a
chaotic economy helped persuade him of the need for political
change.
</P>
<P>
   During that economic turmoil, Mexico's opposition forces were
achieving their first major victories in local elections in the
north, and in 1988, dozens of entrepreneurs ran for Congress
representing the National Action Party, including Fox.
</P>
<P>
   He won, served one term in the Chamber of Deputies, and ran for
governor in 1991, losing an election marred by fraud. Four years
later he won. Three years into his governorship, he launched his
quest for the presidency.

MICROSOFT HIRES WASHINGTON APPELLATE SPECIALIST FOR NEXT STAGE OF
DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. added more firepower to the defense team in
its antitrust case Monday by hiring Carter Phillips, one of the
nation's leading appellate lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, 47, a partner in the Washington office of Sidley &AMP;
Austin, is one of the group of lawyers who regularly argue cases
before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent term, Phillips was on the winning side in three
cases before the court. In one, he argued on behalf of a health
maintenance organization in a case in which the court ruled that
the financial incentives placed on doctors to hold down costs do
not make HMOs liable for violating a duty to put patients first. He
was a member of the winning legal teams in two other cases: the
court's reaffirmation of the Miranda rule and its decision to
strike down a New Jersey hate crime law as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' first assignment for Microsoft will be to work on a
Supreme Court brief, due July 26, in which the company will argue
that the court should allow a federal appeals court to review the
antitrust case first. The Justice Department and 19 states suing
Microsoft are seeking to have the Supreme Court take the case
directly to speed up the appeals stage of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is appealing the ruling of U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson that the company is a monopolist that repeatedly
violated the nation's antitrust laws. Jackson ordered that
Microsoft be split in two and that it make a series of changes in
its business practices. But soon after, he postponed all of the
sanctions until the completion of the appeals process, which could
take a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, which presented Microsoft's defense in its
setback before the district court, will remain the software maker's
lead counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're moving to the next phase of this case, and Sullivan
&AMP; Cromwell will benefit from the experience of Carter Phillips and
Sidley &AMP; Austin,'' said James Cullinan, a spokesman for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a courtroom defeat in a major case, it is not
unusual for a defendant to bring in additional expertise for the
appeals, according to legal experts. Phillips will work on
Microsoft's appeal whether the Supreme Court takes the case
directly or not, Cullinan said.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Sidley &AMP; Austin, Phillips was a law clerk to
Chief Justice Warren Burger and he served as assistant solicitor
general in the Reagan Administration from 1981 to 1984.

PAPER TRAIL MAY LEAD TO TROUBLE

By KEN LLOYD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I work in a small business directly with
the owner on a daily basis. He has a terrible time managing paper.
He leaves letters, messages, and documents everywhere. Even
visitors comment on the mess, and my papers easily get lost in his.
I am not his secretary, but I would like to clean some of it up,
although I don't want to ask him about each thing. How do I get
things in order without confusing him or causing him to protest? _
M.C.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It sounds like you are literally and figuratively in a
mess. It is not easy to work with an owner who has given a whole
new meaning to the concept of leaving a paper trail.
</P>
<P>
   If you are truly inclined to help the owner without confusing or
upsetting him, the first step is for the two of you to meet.
Although it may be tempting to simply go out, sort out, clean out,
or throw out, doing so unilaterally may cause real problems.
</P>
<P>
   There can be any number of reasons for this messy management
style. For example, he may actually enjoy an office that looks like
a ticker-tape parade on the morning after, or perhaps he still
enjoys leaving his toys around and having others pick up after him.
When you meet with him, let him know about the problems that the
wall-to-wall paper is causing, and tell him that you would like to
help gather and organize it. Then ask him how he would like you to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the bigger picture, it will be helpful to review
whether the paperwork that is all over the place is needed in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been in the information technology field for over 10
years, and I have extensive certifications and knowledge in
troubleshooting networks, computers, software and hardware, and
providing customer support and training. I feel I should be making
more money, but the problem is that I didn't finish college and
constantly find jobs on the Internet that require BA/BS degrees for
all information technology positions. Since I don't have a degree,
I'm not looking for another job. Your suggestions are appreciated.
_ A.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is true that many information technology positions specify
a college degree, that does not mean that you should not apply just
because you are not a college grad. There are some extremely
successful information technology professionals who are not college
grads.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies may find that your certifications and experience
compensate for the lack of a degree. After all, this is a very
tight labor market for people with your expertise, and you may be
taking yourself out of play unnecessarily. When you contact
potential employers, be sure to emphasize the classes that you have
taken, the certifications that you have received, and the solid and
successful experience that you have had.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it seems that you are letting the lack of a
degree hold you back. Rather than falling into this trap, you
should aggressively push for the jobs that you want. In addition,
since you are so concerned about your lack of a degree, you should
seriously consider taking advantage of the numerous opportunities
for working people to simultaneously work for a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you please give me information regarding the state of
four-day workweeks for office workers? Besides reducing smog, what
advantages do they have? _ L.I.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although it is true that one of the advantages of four-day
workweeks is that they can reduce smog, many people have a hazy
idea as to what else they can do.
</P>
<P>
   From the employee standpoint, the primary advantage is the
satisfaction associated with having an extra day off each week.
Many employees are interested in having more of a balance between
work and family, and this is one way to help meet that need.
</P>
<P>
   From the employer standpoint, there can also be some key
advantages. For example, there tends to be less absenteeism as
employees take care of personal needs and appointments on the day
off. The four-day workweek has also been linked to increases in
productivity, and it can also help with employee recruitment and
retention.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the four-day workweek poses a number of
disadvantages. For example, employees can have problems arranging
their personal lives so that they can arrive at work earlier and
leave later. There is also concern that the extra hours of daily
work can generate stress, fatigue, and potential for errors and
accidents. Depending upon the company and its structure and
marketplace, there can also be problems with scheduling and
coordination.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day workweek is certainly not for all companies or all
employees, although a good number of employees are certainly for
it.

   OIL-PRICES (Undated) _ In a move to bring down stubbornly high
oil prices, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of crude,
announced plans to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day.
The Saudis' unilateral step comes less than two weeks after the
ten-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to
increase production by 708,000 barrels a day, hoping to rein in
crude oil prices that exceeded $30 a barrel. The price of crude
instead rose, driven by the disappointment in the market that the
production increase was not greater, as had been widely expected.

SAMPRAS UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL DIRECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Apparently, Pete Sampras isn't only playing through
pain, he's playing through paranoia. The only question is whether
it's his or everybody else's.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Sampras readily understands _ and doesn't mind _ that his
rivals are out to get him; he is, after all, only three victories
shy of becoming the grandest man in Grand Slam history. It's what
happens when he gets them that bothers him. As if he doesn't have
enough physical injuries, now his feelings are being hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Take Jonas Bjorkman, which Sampras did rather easily Monday on
Centre Court, 6-3, 6-2, 7-5, to reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals
and remain on course to tie the record for male singles titles here
(7) and break it for Grand Slam prizes (13).
</P>
<P>
   Did you see that handshake after Bjorkman got trounced? Looked
pretty skeptical, didn't it? That was the handshake of a man who
doubted Sampras's depleted condition _ the tendinitis in his lower
left leg he suffered before a second-round win over Karol Kucera,
which prompted All England Tennis &AMP; Croquet Club officials to hold
their stodgy breaths until the top seed and defending champion was
able to return to Centre Court Saturday for a somewhat shaky
four-set decision over Justin Gimelstob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell the way Jonas shook my hand today that, you know,
he was thinking whatever he thinks,'' said Sampras. ``For the first
tine, the pressure's on my opponents a little bit. They know I'm a
little bit injured; the pressure's on them. They're not liking
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if that's the criterion for this conspiracy theory,
then the plot has been in effect for some time. Sampras has
suffered an assortment of back, shoulder, and leg injuries, and now
that ever-expanding medical list has another entry: He's sick and
tired of talking about them, especially this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what it is,'' he said. ``I'm going to go out there and
try my best under the circumstances. I'm sure there are a lot of
cynical players out there reading all this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they're reading about him, they must be talking about
him, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I haven't spoken to any guys'' about Sampras overstating
his health problems, Bjorkman claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what about that handshake?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if he felt that I thought he wasn't injured, what
should I do?'' said Bjorkman. ``I'm very disappointed that I lost
my match. You know, I shake his hand as I do when I'm really
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's his story, anyway. But Sampras feels he knows what's
going through his opponents' minds, and it's not nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm sure'' Bjorkman was dubious about the extent of his
injury, said Sampras. ``I'm sure a lot of players think whatever
they think. You can just tell. But that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they're conveying their nasty presumptions
telepathically. At any rate, they're not going to rattle Sampras.
He even made light of his most wretched _ or, more accurately,
retched _ moment on the court. In the 1996 US Open quarterfinals
against Alex Corretja, Sampras became nauseated. And noted
physicians John McEnroe and Jim Courier wondered aloud whether it
was some sort of ploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, when it's a tough moment, I kind of carry it in my
pocket, the vomit,'' said Sampras. ``I explode it; it comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's tough to digest, this much is indisputable: Sampras
has enjoyed a cupcake of a draw. The final seed _ and not much of
one _ was removed from his half when fellow American Jan-Michael
Gambill erased No. 9 Thomas Enqvist, 7-6, 6-3, 6-4. Gambill is
scheduled to offer a limp handshake to Sampras after Wednesday's
quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete's not going to fake an injury,'' said Gambill. ``I think
a thing that Pete's not going to do is go out there and act like
it's hurt when it doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh. Just read between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   In the semis, one of two mighty obstacles _ either Byron Black
(a 4-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-4 winner over Gianluca Pozzi) or qualifier
Vladimir Voltchkov (7-6, 7-5, 6-4 over Wayne Ferreira) _ will be
waiting for Sampras. And undoubtedly whispering about him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the other half of the draw remains studded with
seeds, who are too busy struggling for survival to give much
thought to Sampras. Andre Agassi, last year's runner-up, this
year's second seed, and the world's No. 1-ranked player, leads the
top-heavy bottom half after a 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 decision over qualifier
David Prinosil. He'll face an imposing challenge against No. 10
Mark Philippoussis, who ousted the final Briton, No. 8 Tim Henman,
6-1, 5-7, 6-7, 6-3 6-4. The other quarterfinal pits No. 11 Patrick
Rafter, a semifinalist last year and a 6-3, 6-4, 6-7, 6-1 victor
over Thomas Johansson Monday, against 6-foot-7-inch Alexander Popp,
who downed fellow skyscraper Marc Rosset, 6-1, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras won't reveal a rooting interest, but at least Rafter
gave his supposition some credence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been comments passed in the locker room about it,''
said Rafter. ``But I think all in all, Pete's pretty genuine. It is
funny in the locker room. There's a few comments that fly by. At
the end of the day, you've got to trust the guy and how he's
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In all probability, someone from Rafter's side of the draw will
find out Sunday whether Sampras is still ailing. Wink, wink. Nudge,
nudge.

AT MID-YEAR, INVESTORS IN WAIT-AND-SEE MODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan is firmly in charge.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock market soared last year and early this year,
investors blithely ignored interest rate increases by the Federal
Reserve aimed at bringing the market back to earth. The Nasdaq's
state of denial finally dissolved and technology stocks plunged in
reaction to a March 21 rate hike, pulling the broader market into a
downdraft that briefly threatened the nation's nine-year economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   At mid-year, everything is changed: Investors neither defy the
Fed nor react belatedly to it. Now, they simply wait to see what
central bankers will do next.
</P>
<P>
   During the second half of this year, the Federal Reserve will be
the single biggest factor driving the stock market, says Kathleen
Camilli, director of economic research in New York for Tucker
Anthony Inc. This signals a return to a more normal relationship
between the Fed and the markets, as prospects for an economic
slowdown, slight or steep, weigh on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will determine the performance of the stock market in the
second six months of 2000 is whether or not the Fed has managed to
engineer a soft landing or, in fact, additional tightening of
monetary policy is necessary,'' Camilli said.
</P>
<P>
   At its last meeting, on June 28, the Federal Open Market
Committee voted not to raise interest rates, leaving the discount
rate unchanged at 6.5 percent. Despite this respite from a series
of six rate hikes begun in June 1999, economists said the FOMC may
raise rates again if the economy does not slow appreciably.
</P>
<P>
   Camilli does not see enough strong, consistent signals of a
slowdown and argues the Fed is not done. Despite softer retail
sales, for example, auto sales surged again in June and dealers'
inventories tightened. That may be an indicator the economy will
pick up its pace after the second quarter, the slowest three-month
period of growth in each of the prior three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is still running too fast,'' she said. As a result
of strong growth _ she forecast the economy would grow at a 3.9
percent annual rate in the second quarter, compared with 5.5
percent in the first quarter _ the labor market will continue to
tighten, pushing the unemployment rate down further and wages up.
As for the stock market, she said, ``I don't think the pressure's
off unless we see a deceleration in growth'' to about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But opinions about the market's direction range widely, from
careful pessimism to optimistic forecasts that the major market
indexes will finish the year with positive returns.
</P>
<P>
   The major markets in June mirrored investors' uncertainty,
moving in a sideways zigzag and remaining in negative territory due
to the March-April plunge. In a shortened trading session Monday
for the July 4th holiday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed
at 10,560.67, up 112.78 points for the day but down more than 8
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq added 25.82 points, closing at 3991.93. The
technology index is still 20 percent below its all-time high, and
has lost nearly 2 percent of its value year to date. So far this
year, the broad Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index's flat performance was
the best among the three major indexes; the S&AMP;P 500 Monday rose
14.72 points, closing at 1469.32.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lapman, president of Independence Investment Associates
Inc., a subsidiary of John Hancock that manages pension fund and
other institutional accounts, predicted the markets would benefit
from election-year optimism that would push the three stock indexes
to post positive returns by year-end, including a 20 percent gain
for the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is very healthy and is being very well managed''
by the Federal Reserve, Lapman said. ``There is nothing in the
general economy that would bring about a recession or severe
slowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall Acuff, equity strategist for Salomon Smith Barney
in New York, believes the market has now entered a period of
uncertainty. Looking back over the first half of this year, he
attributed the market's exuberance to a unique combination of a
huge buildup of margin debt at the same time the Fed injected
liquidity into the nation's financial system to preserve calm
during the Y2K transition. Adding to the frenzy, money rushed into
technology mutual funds as investors saw that the high-risk sector
provided high returns.
</P>
<P>
   After the market's peak in March, he said, the Federal Reserve's
rate increases, a drain of liquidity, and a drop in expected
corporate earnings deflated the markets during the second quarter.
Investors, meanwhile, have diversified portfolios out of tech
stocks and into large non-tech companies, such as Coca-Cola and
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Acuff predicted that although the Fed is nearly
finished with rate hikes, ``there is a chance they're going to do
more.'' The question, looking ahead, ``is not whether the economy's
slowing down _ signals are mixed on that. The question is whether
the economy will slow enough for inflation to cool. We won't know
for a number of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Although inflation is not in the danger zone, economists have
become increasingly concerned about its steady upward creep. The
consumer price index rose 3.1 percent during the 12-month period
ending in May, compared with a 2.1 percent increase over the
previous 12 months. The core inflation rate, which the Fed watches
closely because it excludes oil and food prices, has also
accelerated this year.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is wages, as measured by the government's
employment cost index. The index spiked 1.4 percent during the
first quarter, driving up the ECI for the year ending in March by
4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Cliggott, managing director and equity strategist for J.P.
Morgan in New York, said worrisome inflation reports late in the
second quarter helped to undermine a stock market that was
vulnerable and overinflated with a flood of liquidity earlier in
the year. While the strong economy provided a floor under the
market, markets are now ``stuck in the middle'' and unsure where to
go, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got this perception that growth is going to slow, and,
because of that, earnings growth is going to slow, but we don't
know how much,'' said Cliggott. ``On the other side of the
equation, inflation's going up and, because of that, maybe interest
rates are going to go up some more but we don't know how much.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted this uncertainty could continue and year 2000 may
continue to be a ``boring year'' in the market, unless inflation
continues to accelerate and causes the market to decline further.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts argue that Fed rate hikes have already begun to
slow the economy and the impact will continue to be seen in
economic statistics in coming weeks and months.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,
said the Fed's actions this year will be key to the market's
performance, but said the economy already seems to be slowing. ``My
guess is the stock market will break to the upside and technology
will lead us, though every investor should keep in mind one thing:
It's not going to be as exciting as it was early this year or the
past five years.''

ESTATE SUES FOR A BIGGER SAN FRANCISCO TRIBUTE TO DIMAGGIO 
</HEADLINE>
   By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As playgrounds go, it is rather old-fashioned.
The rest of North Beach has gone trendy, with neon-signed bistros
edging out spaghetti joints and old tenements transformed into
condos. But the playground is still your basic city model: Two and
a third acres of asphalt, with swings and monkey bars, a baseball
field, a pool no one would be caught dead in past age 10 and a
bocce court where the same men have been playing for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The playground probably looks a lot like it did 50, even 75
years ago. That would be when Joe DiMaggio the fisherman's son was
learning how to turn a bat into a lightning bolt and a hard ball
into a whirling dervish. He played baseball here with three
brothers, good players in their own right, and made North Beach
playground famous as the humble beginning of one of the great
baseball players of all time.
</P>
<P>
   So when DiMaggio died last year, it seemed natural to rename the
playground in his honor. Then kids who played in Joe DiMaggio
Playground would know that this was a special place, where Hall of
Fame athletes could be seeded. It also seemed fitting to choose a
place that DiMaggio would have recognized from the old days.
Whenever he slipped into town to escape his legend, it was to the
old haunts. He avoided the neon signs and the menus with double
nonfat lattes and headed to the wooden bars with grizzled men who
knew that Joe DiMaggio the Yankee baseball star who married the
biggest movie star of his day (if for a little while) was the same
Joe who once wore hand-me-downs and blushed in the presence of
girls.
</P>
<P>
   What DiMaggio would make of the fight over the renaming of the
playground is anyone's guess. He would ignore all requests to
appear at ceremonies in his honor. He was embarrassed, his old
friends, say, by the attention. But Morris Engelberg, the Florida
lawyer in charge with guarding the Joe DiMaggio name, apparently
believes his old friend deserves more. Bigger. An airport, at the
very least. Or a freeway. Last week, when a federal judge tossed
out Engelberg's lawsuit blocking the renaming of the playground,
Engelberg vowed to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg's lawsuit, filed on behalf of DiMaggio's estate,
claims that the city wants to use the DiMaggio name to raise
property values in North Beach. This accusation makes San
Franciscans laugh. Dot-comers have already raised the property
values in North Beach to the stratosphere. Studios rent for $1,800
here and one-bedroom condos are in the $700,000 range. A
playground, even one with a ballplayer's name on it, could only
raise values higher if its fields were turned into a parking lot or
its pool into a cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Engelberg added a new reason for objecting
to Joe DiMaggio Playground: the city charges 50 cents to use the
park's pool. ``Joe DiMaggio,'' he said, ``would never tolerate and
stand for his name being used on a public facility where you charge
children to use the pool there.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's grandchildren, who live in the Bay area, are said to
be behind the lawsuit, and of the opinion that a playground is too
small a tribute to someone San Francisco can brag about forever.
But in San Francisco, the consensus is that the lawsuit is rather
petty. ``It just seems silly,'' said Carole Suskind, who was
sitting on a bench here Monday afternoon watching her 3-year-old
son Todd toddle after a mourning dove. ``Doesn't the family, or
whoever,'' Suskind said, ``realize how conceited it makes them
seem?''
</P>
<P>
   Gavin Newsom, a San Francisco supervisor who sponsored the
resolution made last year to rename the park, goes further.
``Consensus is a great adjective to use in this case, because it is
so rare to have consensus in this city,'' he said. ``But in this
case, the consensus is that the playground is an appropriate site
for a tribute and that the lawsuit against the city is an absurd
waste of time, money and attention which does a tremendous
disservice to the legacy of Joe DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsom said that the city will be having a big renaming ceremony
at the playground as soon as Dom DiMaggio, Joe's surviving sibling,
can arrange to come here from his home in Florida. Dom, it turns
out, is happy that the playground will be named after his brother.
Joe, Dom DiMaggio said, would love the tribute, too, in his own
quiet way.

Davenport dispatches Capriati
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JODY GOLDSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ They were born only three months apart, but
their tennis careers have diverged greatly.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Capriati was a Wimbledon semifinalist in 1991, while
Lindsay Davenport was struggling through the junior draw. Capriati
also was playing in the U.S. Open semifinals in '91, one year
before Davenport won the junior title on those same courts.
</P>
<P>
   But though Davenport didn't turn pro until three years after her
colleague _ and with much less fanfare _ the 24-year-old
Californian has long bypassed Capriati, accomplishing things the
former phenom still dreams about.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Davenport again showed her dominance, ending
Capriati's best Wimbledon since 1993 with a 6-3, 6-3 victory.
Davenport, the No. 2 seed and defending champion, heads to a
quarterfinal matchup today against No. 6 Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you know you're playing a good returner, you
know deep down you have to serve better,'' Davenport said. ``I hit
the ball a lot better, had a lot more depth and power. I felt this
was the best match I've played in months.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, who is trying to overcome a couple of injuries this
summer, won Wimbledon last year and the Australian open this year.
She also owns the 1998 U.S. Open title, giving her three Grand
Slams in a span of six events. Capriati made three Grand Slam
semifinal appearances in 1990 and '91, then reached the semis this
year in Australia. But she has never gone further.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati, who had lost in the second round in both of her other
Wimbledon appearances since leaving the Tour at the end of 1993,
played well in Monday's first set, losing only her first service
game. She was never able to get that break back, however, and lost
the set. She never had a chance in the second, falling behind 5-0.
She did win three consecutive games, including one break of
Davenport's serve, but Davenport held on to close out the match.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-2{ Davenport drilled seven aces past Capriati and had 18
unreturnable serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all revolves around serve,'' Davenport said. ``If I feel
I'm making good serves, I'm a lot more confident, can go for more
on my ground strokes. If I hit my ground strokes as well as I did
today and serve well, I have a good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport owns a 5-2 edge in head-to-head competition with
Seles, with her victories coming in their last five meetings. But
none of those has been on grass, and only one came this year.
</P>
<P>
   The other marquee quarterfinal will pit Martina Hingis against
Venus Williams, both straight-set winners in the fourth round.
Hingis owns a 9-5 edge over Williams, though they split six
meetings last year. They haven't played one another yet this year
and have never played on grass.
</P>
<P>
   They have met three times in Grand Slams, with Hingis taking all
three meetings, including the 1997 U.S. Open final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena (Williams) made up for that for me,'' Venus Williams
said, referring to her sister's victory over Hingis in last year's
U.S. Open final. ``Hopefully, I'll have another opportunity to play
better, at least play the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   In other women's fourth-round matches, Serena Williams continued
to pound her opponents, Monday's victim being Thailand's Tamarine
Tanasugarn. Williams needed only 51 minutes to knock her out of the
tournament 6-1, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won 100 percent of her first serves, dishing out eight
aces and 19 winners. Tanasugarn had only two winners.
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters could face each other in the semifinals if Venus
Williams can knock off Hingis. Serena Williams should have an
easier time against American Lisa Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   There were no surprises in the women's draw Monday, with every
match decided in straight sets. No. 6 seed Seles is back in the
quarters for only the second time since 1992 thanks to a 6-3, 6-4
victory over No. 9 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. Hingis had an easy time
with No. 11 seed Anke Huber. Jelena Dokic is making back-to-back
trips to the quarters, having dispatched American Kristina Brandi.
And Spain's Magui Serna is making her first quarterfinal appearance
after beating American Lilia Osterloh.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, No. 1 seed Pete Sampras and No. 2 Andre
Agassi both advanced in straight sets. American Jan-Michael Gambill
knocked off No. 9 seed Thomas Enqvist 7-6 (5), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4,
leaving Sampras with no seeded players in his half of the draw.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom half, No. 12 Patrick Rafter advanced, as did No.
10 Mark Philippoussis, knocking out the final British hopeful, No.
8 Tim Henman, 6-1, 5-7, 6-7 (9), 6-3, 6-4. Henman had reached the
quarterfinals or better the last four years, including back-to-back
semifinal appearances in 1998 and '99.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining men's quarterfinalists include Alexander Popp,
Byron Black and qualifier Vladimir Voltchkov.

PRI SEEN AS VICTIM OF OVERWHELMING CHANGE IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A giant meteor once crash-landed near Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula and, according to a popular theory, wiped out
Earth's dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   But, as people here are fond of saying, there were a few
creatures left over in Mexico. They formed a powerful group known
as the Revolutionary Institutional Party, the political tribe also
known as the PRI. And for the past 71 years, they've dominated
every aspect of Mexican life, creating monopolies, handing out jobs
and subsidies, and telling people how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, another meteor hit Mexico. It sent waves of voters,
driven by an intense desire for political change, to cast their
ballots in a historic election that freed them from their own
version of Jurassic Park. And for the first time in modern history,
Mexicans will not be ruled by the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those dinosaurs are finished,'' Enrique Aguirre, a 41-year-old
high school teacher, said Monday. ``This is the beginning of the
21st Century Mexico where the people choose their government, not
the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI suffered an astounding defeat in Sunday's elections. Not
only did it lose the presidency to an opposition candidate for the
first time since its creation in 1929, but it also became a
minority in both houses of congress.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI lost the governor's races in both Morelos and Guanajuato
states, placed a distant third in the Mexico City mayor's race, and
failed to win a single seat in the capital's 66-member city
council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the real dinosaurs, the fundamental cause of the
(PRI) defeat was the fact that the environment where they once
prospered has changed,'' Mexican historian Lorenzo Meyer wrote in
Monday's Reforma newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of change was so pervasive among Mexican voters that
a record 80 percent of Mexico's 59 million voters went to the
polls, and most of them chose Vicente Fox Quesada, a folksy
businessman and former governor, as their new president in a
surprisingly large margin of about 6 percentage points over
Francisco Labastida, the PRI's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The world's longest ruling political party may soon be out of
power, but it won't be completely out of sight. After all, despite
Sunday's defeats, the PRI still possesses the nation's largest
machine. It still holds most of the state's governorships and city
halls.
</P>
<P>
   The likely fallout from this anti-PRI stampede will be an
internal battle between the party's old guard, who would like the
party to return to ruling with a firm hand, and the reformists,
many of them US-trained technocrats, who use words like ``niche''
and ``marketing'' when talking about how to restructure the PRI in
an era of increased competition.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the party will have to conduct its soul-searching
without the benefit of having a party leader who is also the
country's president.
</P>
<P>
   But with formidable foes now on both sides of the country's
political spectrum, where will the PRI fall?
</P>
<P>
   On the right, there is the conservative National Action Party,
or PAN, whom Fox represents. And on the left, where the PRI once
stood, there are at least three parties, chief among them the Party
of the Democratic Revolution, which controls the capital and a
handful of states.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The PRI) is going to have to do some serious
soul-searching,'' said Eric Olson, Mexico program director for the
Washington Office on Latin America. ``It's always been a two-headed
monster appealing to the super elite or the super poor. Now, it's
kind of stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has known defeat before and recovered from it. After
losing control of the governor's office in the northern state of
Chihuahua to the PAN in the mid-1990s, it won it back last year by
using a primary election to select its candidate, something it had
never done before.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the PRI's debilitating loss may have been the work
not so much of Fox's charisma or the opposition parties, but of its
own incumbent president, Ernesto Zedillo, who has gradually
dismantled Mexico's old, fraud-riddled election process, and
replaced it with a fairer, cleaner system.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo backed a set of electoral reforms four years ago that
removed elections from government control and created an
independent Federal Electoral Institute. The laws also allowed for
publicly-funded campaigns and restricted parties' ability to
interfere in the voting process.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Zedillo also broke with PRI tradition by refusing to
name a candidate to succeed him, preferring instead to let the
party hold a national primary election. And Sunday night, the
president was the first official voice to appear on national
television and acknowledge Fox's victory. He also pledged a smooth
transition of power _ something Mexico has never experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, both in and outside of Mexico, drew parallels
Monday between the country's political reforms under Zedillo to the
opening of the former Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine this must be a bittersweet time for (Zedillo),''
said John Coatsworth, director of the David Rockefeller Center for
Latin American Studies at Harvard University. ``He has presided
over his party's worst defeat, but he's also secured his reputation
in history for creating a modern democracy in Mexico.''

   DIMAGGIO-PARK (San Francisco) _ The playground is still your
basic city model: Two and a third acres of asphalt, with swings and
monkey bars, a baseball field. The playground probably looks a lot
like it did when Joe DiMaggio the fisherman's son was learning how
to turn a bat into a lightning bolt and a hard ball into a whirling
dervish. He played baseball here and made the North Beach
playground famous as the humble beginning of one of the great
baseball players of all time. So when DiMaggio died last year, it
seemed natural to rename the playground in his honor. What DiMaggio
would make of the fight over the renaming of the playground is
anyone's guess. But Morris Engelberg, the Florida lawyer in charge
with guarding the Joe DiMaggio name, apparently believes his old

STOCKS RISE SLIGHTLY IN LIGHT, PRE-HOLIDAY TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks rose broadly in light pre-holiday trading
Monday as investors digested the first important data of the month,
a lower-than-expected reading for manufacturing activity in June.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that
its monthly factory index fell to 51.8 in June, below analysts'
expectations and May's number of 53.2. The latest number signaled
that the economy may be slowing and provided further evidence for
those who think the Fed will not have to extend its string of
interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   The figure slightly buoyed a session of sluggish trading that
ended early, with the New York Stock Exchange closing at 1 p.m.
Monday. The three main gauges all rose, with the Dow Jones
industrial average gaining 112.78 points, or 1.1 percent, to
10,560.67; the Nasdaq composite index edging up 25.82 points, or
0.7 percent, to 3,991.93; and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
climbing 14.72 points, or 1 percent, to 1,469.32.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was one of the slowest for a trading session this year,
with 452 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock
Exchange. Five stocks rose for every two that fell on the Big
Board.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 received a lift from Conseco, the beleaguered
insurance and financial services company, whose shares slid 45.3
percent in the first half of the year as its chief executive and
chief financial officer resigned. Last week, Conseco named a
General Electric executive, Gary Wendt, as its chief executive, and
its stock rose 1 5/16, or 16.7 percent, to 11 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of other financial services companies rose on the
manufacturing report. J.P. Morgan rose 5 5/8, to 115 3/4, and
Citigroup gained 2 116, to 62 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq was held back by Oracle Corp., which fell 3 7/8, or
4.6 percent, to 80 3/16, after the resignation over the weekend of
its president and chief operating officer, Raymond Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The market will be closed Tuesday for the Fourth of July, but
investors will be keeping an eye on critical employment data coming
out on Friday and the beginning of the earnings season. Next week,
companies like Yahoo and General Electric will report results, and
the closely watched Producer Price Index will be released.
</P>
<P>
   So far, opinions are mixed on whether signals of slowdown seen
in the first half of the year will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve has labeled the signs of deceleration as
tentative,'' said Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Bank of
America Securities. ``Therefore, all eyes will be on the numbers to
see if they'll confirm the trend of deceleration, or if they will
concern the Fed. The Fed is clearly uncomfortable in indicating
they are moving to the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The disposition of the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan,
toward interest rates is key to the direction of the market. As one
prominent technology investor, Alberto Vilar of the $7.5 billion
Amerindo Investment Advisors, put it, ``Tell me a money manager
that doesn't listen to Uncle Alan.''
</P>
<P>
   The June manufacturing number of 51.8 should be more palatable
to the Fed than earlier results, said Joseph Liro, chief economist
for Stone &AMP; McCarthy Research Associates. Though a reading above 50
signals that the manufacturing economy is expanding, the June
number was the lowest since January 1999. Liro thinks the ideal
range for the index is between 52 and 54.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a range everybody would be happy with,'' he said,
adding that it is a level with ``strong enough growth to keep
incomes high,'' but not so much growth to aggravate inflation. The
question, Liro says, is whether or not the manufacturing number
will stay in that range, continue to shrink or revert back to its
higher levels.
</P>
<P>
   While the manufacturing data indicated a continued slowdown,
news about earnings did not. About 57 percent of the 312 companies
that have already announced their results have said they would be
lower than expected. That, says Charles Hill, director of research
for First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings, is
a ``business as usual'' figure. More positive is the forecast of a
19.2 percent growth rate for second-quarter earnings for the S&AMP;P
500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earnings numbers don't indicate things are cooling off,''
said Hill, adding that the effects of the most recent rate increase
would not be felt until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a period of some confusion right now, trying to sort
all this out,'' he said.

PANCREAS CELLS COULD HELP RESTORE INSULIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a step toward making transplants of
insulin-producing cells a reality for a large number of diabetics,
researchers at the Joslin Diabetes Center have tapped a new source
of the scarce islet cells _ pancreatic tissue that's normally
discarded.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists used special culture techniques to coax
pancreatic ductal cells, which normally secrete very little
insulin, to churn out larger amounts of insulin. The ductal tissue
is routinely discarded when surgeons extract insulin-producing
islet cells from a donor cadaver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited because we have taken lead and made gold,''
said Susan Bonner-Weir, a Joslin researcher and lead author of a
paper appearing in the current issue of the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time this has been done, and I think it
shows the promise of this potential new source'' of transplanted
insulin-making cells, she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes only months after scientists in Edmonton,
Alberta, announced they had succeed in treating eight patients with
Type 1 or insulin-dependent diabetes by transplanting islet cells
from cadaver pancreases. The islet cells provided insulin, which
Type 1 diabetics lack because of a faulty immune reaction that
destroys islet cells.
</P>
<P>
   But the University of Alberta scientists noted at the time that
it required at least two donor pancreases to yield enough cells for
one diabetic recipient. In North America about 30,000 patients are
newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes annually, and some 800,000
people already have the disease. But only about 3,000 pancreases
from cadavers become available each year, severely limiting the
number of patients who could be treated.
</P>
<P>
   If the Joslin technique can be made more efficient and routine,
``this would be an enormous step in starting to address the
shortage,'' said Jonathan Lakey, director of the clinical islet
isolation laboratory at the University of Alberta, in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The pancreas is not only the body's source of insulin, which is
a key protein in metabolizing sugar for energy, but also produces
digestive enzymes. These enzymes leave the pancreas through tiny
ducts, and it is the cells making up these ducts that the Boston
researchers exploited.
</P>
<P>
   The duct cells are precursors that give rise to other pancreatic
cells. In addition, mature duct cells make a small amount of
insulin, probably as a backup in case of trauma or injury to the
pancreas, said Bonner-Weir.
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleagues, including her husband, Gordon C. Weir
and John J. O'Neil, devised a way to turn the clock back in the
duct cells, so that they became immature once again, and produce
more insulin.
</P>
<P>
   They removed the ductal tissue, which is normally thrown away
when islet cells are removed from a cadaver pancrease for
transplantation, and grew the cells in culture dishes in the
laboratory. Under these conditions, ``it's in their nature'' to
lose their ductal specialization and regress to become
insulin-producing precursor cells, she said. The scientists also
added a thin layer of ``matrix'' _ made up of skin-like cells _
that encouraged the immature cells to line up in the correct
configuration, said Bonner-Weir.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a month, the cells cranked up their insulin
production by 10 to 15 times, said the scientists. In this
preliminary study, the researchers estimated, the duct tissue
culture would have generated only about 32,000 new islet cells _
far too few for even a single diabetes patient.
</P>
<P>
   However, they believe the process can be made much more
efficient, and Lakey at the University of Alberta agreed that the
method has great promise. ``They've been able to take what we've
been able to achieve here'' with the transplant success ``and
extend it'' with the hopes of being able to use only one pancreas
per recipient, and later perhaps one pancrease for two, and then
three patients, he said.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ What is the future of Mexico in light of the
election on Sunday? After all, Mexicans elected Vicente Fox Quesada
president of their country, voting out the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has been in power for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is thrilling that Mexicans voted to take the government out
of the hands of a mutual-protection racket of bureaucrats,
politicians, big business and organized (but submissive) labor. But
to whom did the Mexican voters give the government, and to what
end? And why did progressives play so prominent a role in a
movement led by a man often described as a ``pragmatic
businessman'' from a right-of-center political party?
</P>
<P>
   A little story may help answer these large questions.
</P>
<P>
   I first met Vicente Fox four years ago. Jorge Castaneda, a
leading Mexican intellectual, and I had organized a series of
meetings among progressive and leftist party leaders in Latin
America. We discussed the alternatives to policies that had failed
to give economic and educational opportunity to the majority of
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was not invited. He asked to join. He then became one of the
two most active members of the group. (The other most active
member, Ciro Gomes, stands a good chance of being elected president
of Brazil two years from now.)
</P>
<P>
   Fox went with us from meeting to meeting and country to country,
arguing about the details of proposals. A democratized market
economy in a high-energy democratic government that served the
little guy became his watchwords. Fox showed by word, attitude and
deed that he wanted to become a Franklin D. Roosevelt, a rebuilder
of institutions, rather than a Tony Blair, a softener of
conservative orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle between constraint and aspiration now begins. The
powerful interests that lost their hold on the Mexican presidency
last Sunday are sure to strike back. They can be expected to use
their political and economic influence to block or redirect reform.
</P>
<P>
   To defeat them, the new president will not be able to rely on
his businessman's eye for talent and efficiency. He will need to
mobilize and organize the restless, but amorphous majority that
elected him.
</P>
<P>
   How will he accomplish that? Under Fox, Mexico may make itself
more open to economic competition, more respectful of individual
rights and more committed to the alleviation of extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Such a change would mean a great deal. However, for millions of
Mexicans _ and I believe Vicente Fox is among them _ such an agenda
is not enough. The temperament of the president, the beliefs of
many who work at his side and the impatient hopes now welling up in
Mexico may push the country even further. They may begin to invent
a more energetic democracy and a more people-friendly market than
now exists in the United States or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Such a project would raise public revenues and domestic saving,
ensuring that the government has resources to invest in its people
and means to defy the whims of financial markets. The project would
embrace monetary stability and free trade as preconditions of the
progressive cause. It would give millions of would-be, small-time
entrepreneurs access to credit, technology and markets. It would
enlarge the percentage of national income that goes to wages by
strengthening workers' education and rights. It would develop a
public education system that is good enough to win the loyalty of
the middle class, which has relied on private schools. It would
change the constitution to quicken the tempo of reform and heighten
the level of popular engagement in public life.
</P>
<P>
   It would end impunity and increase security, in the hope of
turning victims into activists and underlings into citizens.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ Commodore Stephen Decatur, freshly returned
in 1816 from subduing the Dey of Algiers and swollen with
nationalist fervor, rose to his feet at a banquet in Norfolk, Va.,
and offered a notorious toast. ``Our country!'' he said, glass held
aloft. ``May she always be in the right; but our country, right or
wrong.'' Decatur's salute is often cited as the quintessence of
American patriotic feeling. It's also the kind of remark that has
given patriotism a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   In our own time, sentiments like Decatur's have fallen far out
of fashion, but so has a more tempered and cogent kind of
patriotism, a classic case of throwing out the baby with the bath
water. ``A patriot is a fool in every age,'' jeered Alexander Pope,
but perhaps in no age have patriots been deemed more foolish than
in our own. To confess love of country today is to invite sneers
from sophisticates, to court banishment to the supposedly lunatic
fringe, to risk indictment as smug, stupid and reactionary _ or,
vilest of all possible epithets, corny. How did this sorry state of
affairs come to be?
</P>
<P>
   Always a plural people, Americans in recent years have grown
downright fractious _ not a condition that conduces to patriotic
emotion. Loyalties to tribe and race and communities both virtual
and vital, not to mention ardor for mergers and startups and global
networking, have apparently crowded out love of nation. The booming
economy also tends to make mere sunshine patriots of us all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of palmy prosperity are not those most favorable to
the display of public virtue,'' wrote Edward Everett _ the other
speaker at Gettysburg on Nov. 19, 1863, when Abraham Lincoln
managed in just three pithy paragraphs to craft a surpassing
argument for devotion to American nationhood. Only ``in hard,
doubtful, unprosperous and dangerous times,'' Everett claimed in an
1860 essay, do the ``patriotic find their way.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since privation and danger have blighted
this lucky land. The Civil War was one such occasion. The era of
the Great Depression and World War II was another _ a
decade-and-a-half-long ordeal when widely shared penury and peril
combined to nurture a feeling of common cause and to inspire a
truly healthy sense of patriotic feeling. It was a momentous era,
one that has lessons to teach us still, not least about our
relation to our country.
</P>
<P>
   The patriotism of the generation that suffered the Depression
and waged the war was no witless endorsement of ``our country right
or wrong.'' So far from being ``the last refuge of a scoundrel,''
their patriotism was the first haven of those who revered the
promise of America even while recognizing its defects.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Roosevelt knew how stricken his land was. He demanded
relief for the one-third of its people who were ill-housed,
ill-clad and ill-nourished. But in the opening words of his first
inaugural Roosevelt also affirmed that ``this great nation will
endure as it has endured,'' and in the next breath gave his famous
warning that ``the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.''
That passage amounted to a fond appreciation of the high value of
American institutions, even as FDR was about to extend their
embrace to that excluded one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Popular culture in the Depression decade reflected the same
fusion of admonition and attachment. Through all the prodigious
outpouring of contemporary photographs, films and writings that
documented the Depression's devastation _ works like Walker Evans'
and James Agee's portraits of busted tenant farmers in ``Let Us Now
Praise Famous Men,'' or Pare Lorentz's dirge for the despoiled
Mississippi in his haunting film, ``The River,'' or John
Steinbeck's indictment of the ravages of capitalist agribusiness in
``The Grapes of Wrath'' _ there beats a clear subtext.
</P>
<P>
   All throb with shame for their country, with anger at its
failures, but they pulse with unmistakable affection for it, too.
The critic Alfred Kazin recognized this distinctively American
attitude of what might be called critical patriotism when he
described the cultural mood of the 1930s as ``born of the
depression and the international crisis,'' but also suffused with a
feeling of ``affirmation,'' with ``an insistence to know and to
love what it knew.'' It was as if artists and writers in
Depression-era America turned instinctively to the better angels of
their nation's nature to guide their countrymen through their
greatest crisis in nearly a century.
</P>
<P>
   World War II, of course, unleashed a further upwelling of
patriotic fervor. But even wartime patriotism was not without its
critical element. Black Americans, for example, embraced the
``double-V'' campaign, demanding both victory over aggressors
abroad and victory over discrimination at home, deftly combining
loyal commitment with constructive criticism.
</P>
<P>
   No less striking was the publication in 1944 of the Swedish
economist Gunnar Myrdal's classic investigation of race relations,
``An American Dilemma.'' Its basic argument was twofold: in accents
that even the most red-white-and-true-blue American could endorse,
Myrdal praised ``the American Creed,'' a set of values that
included ``liberty, equality, justice and fair opportunity for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also composed a withering condemnation of racial
oppression, inequality, injustice and denial of opportunity _
probing America's most vexed social issue even during the most
anxious months of the war, and thereby helping to lay the
foundation for the triumphs of the civil rights movement in the
succeeding generation. ``Let us go forth to lead the land we
love,'' said John F. Kennedy on the eve of those triumphs. But
Kennedy also branded the current treatment of black Americans as a
``moral crisis,'' and summoned his fellow citizens to honor their
own best beliefs. That second statement was surely no less
patriotic than the first.
</P>
<P>
   The words ``patriot'' and ``paternal'' stem from the same Latin
root, meaning ``father.'' Critical patriotism toward one's country
might be likened to the love that fathers and mothers alike ideally
tender to their children: unconditional, but still demanding. What
good parents do not both love and challenge their young, supporting
them but at the same time pushing them to be all they can be?
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Decatur got it only half right. May our country always
be in the right, to be sure. But the truest patriotism _ critical
patriotism _ will not hesitate to hold up the mirror of this
nation's better, ideal self to expose its wrongs and urge its
citizens to right them. Critical patriotism demands not mindless
veneration, but strict accountability. It judges as well as
celebrates. It is neither foolish nor corny. It is simply necessary
if this nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the
proposition that all of us are created equal, is to long endure.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ The rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in
air, will give proof July Fourth that America's trade deficit with
China is still there.
</P>
<P>
   The United States celebrates its freedom by blowing up tons of
ornamental ordnance put together by the world's last major
communist power. So with every ``oooh'' and ``aaah'' Americans
utter, with every strontium nitrate starburst (red) or
chlorine-laced copper salt flare (blue), that trade deficit
expands. Even many of the little American flags that people wave at
July Fourth parades are made in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is our biggest market,'' said Liu Donghui, head of
Liuyang Fireworks Development Co. in the central province of Hunan,
birthplace of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, who led China's communist
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks represent only a sliver of the overall U.S. trade
deficit with China, which so far this year exceeds $18 billion. But
Americans spent $122.4 million on Chinese fireworks last year and
are buying more this year, just as they are buying more Chinese
toys, clothes and electronics. And American imports from China
could increase dramatically when China gains normalized trading
relations with the United States and membership in the World Trade
Organization, expected later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pyrotechnics are prepared in cramped Chinese
workshops where low paid workers put together by hand ``cakes`` of
roman candles or ``display shells,'' the largest of which look like
brown-paper wrapped bowling balls sitting on a squat cardboard
cylinder of black powder. The shells shoot 100 feet in the air for
every inch of their diameter, with some reaching 1,200 feet before
detonating in a spray of colored fire.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fireworks come from Hunan province.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks were invented in China, and the Hunanese have been
making them for 1,300 years. In Liuyang, officially designated
China's fireworks capital, more than 400,000 people work in the
industry, or about a third of all the people in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The workers are typically separated from each other by a thick
wooden partition in case of an accidental detonation, though such
precautions don't matter much when a combustion gets rolling: an
explosion ripped through a southern Chinese fireworks factory last
week, killing 36 people and injuring 160 more. As many as 30 others
may have been killed because their bodies have yet to be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese fireworks present other dangers as well. Residue from
the poisonous compounds that give the brilliant colors sift down
through the atmosphere after a blast. Scientists in Liuyang say
they are looking for ways to clean up their shells because the
United States is banning the import of lead bearing fireworks as of
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been urged to stop using lead,'' says the
fireworks boss, Liu.
</P>
<P>
   For those Americans whose hearts beat patriotic at the sight of
a skyrocket exploding into the shape of a star, they should know
the effect was perfected to commemorate the People's Liberation
Army of China, whose emblem is a red star, not to represent the
stars that spangle America's banner.
</P>
<P>
   Americans opposed to increased trade relations with China might
want to forgo the flags and the fireworks displays and stick to
hand-held sparklers. High anti-dumping duties, meant to protect
U.S. manufacturers, have kept Chinese sparklers out of the country
for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, sparklers were popularized in Britain where they
were first used to celebrate the wedding of King Henry VII, so
lighting them might be seen as a nod to America's former colonial
rulers.

RUSSIANS STRUGGLE TO CONTAIN WAVE OF KIDNAPPINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Adi Sharon was chained to a wall in a dark, filthy
cellar for so long that when the man in combat fatigues burst in,
the 12-year-old Israeli native was convinced the Chechen and
Russian kidnappers who had held him hostage for nine months had
decided to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a boy,'' the dazed and terrified youth pleaded in
English, unable to comprehend that he was being rescued, and that
the man was part of a special Russian police unit that had traced
clues from war-torn Chechnya to the remote cottage in central
Russia where Adi was found.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian officer tried in broken English to comfort the pale,
emaciated boy. Another wrapped bandages around Adi's hands,
mutilated by his captors. Someone handed him a cell phone. His
father, Josef, whom Adi had not seen since the day last August when
gunmen snatched the boy from outside their Moscow apartment, was on
the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa, do you love me?'' Adi said, barely able to see or stand,
still not understanding that he was free at last. ``Who are these
men?''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the brutality of the ransom-seeking abduction gangs that
have thrived on the violent chaos of the conflict in Chechnya, that
for all the terror and torture he suffered, Adi was one of the
lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's rescue on June 2, videotaped by police, is one of few
recent success stories against that kidnapping rings suspected of
links to separatists in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities say at least 850 kidnapping victims, and
possibly several times that many, are believed to be held in
Chechnya. But as Russian troops blast away at the Chechen
foothills, raising fears that the captors might kill the hostages
rather than risk discovery, Adi's case poses another disturbing
possibility: that many of the kidnappers _ and perhaps many of
their captives _ could be far, far away from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Stamping out the epidemic of kidnappings during Chechnya's three
years of de-facto independence following a 1994-1996 civil war was
one of the main reasons Moscow gave for sending troops back into
the separatist Caucasus region last October.
</P>
<P>
   But the cruelty has proven contagious. Although hundreds of
hostages have gone free since Russian troops swept through most
major Chechen towns, the abductions have continued, kidnappers are
still looking for big money, and some Chechens charge that Russian
military units sent into Chechnya to restore order are holding
hostages for ransom, too.
</P>
<P>
   This sordid business continues for one reason: because it is
wildly profitable. Russian police estimate that $200 million in
ransom money has been paid out to gangs based in Chechnya since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials refer to ``special operations'' to free
hostages but rarely go into details. This has led to widespread
speculation that in many cases ransom is paid to shadowy
intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that in all of the cases where hostages are
released money is paid,'' said Vyacheslav Izmailov, a journalist
and former army major who investigates kidnappings in Chechnya. He
cited the June 14 release of French photographer Brice Fleutiaux
after eight months in captivity. Izmailov says the kidnappers
received $500,000 from unidentified Russian sources.
</P>
<P>
   Yelena Rumyantseva, spokeswoman for Russia's police unit that
investigates organized crime, denies that money was paid for
Fleutiaux's freedom. But she acknowledges that in many cases,
relatives have paid ransom to free loved ones without going to the
police.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities say thousands of people, including a handful
of foreigners, but many more Russians and Chechens, have been held
for ransom. Hostages have been tortured and maimed by their
captors. Then the kidnappers send videos along with demands for
ransom to the victims' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the captives _ human rights workers, missionaries,
journalists, local government officials, religious officials,
soldiers, officers and children _ were abducted in neighboring
Russian regions and then taken into Chechnya, where the region's
quasi-independent status made it nearly impossible for Russian
authorities to investigate disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the victims have been traded or sold from one gang to
another. Sometimes, victims were betrayed by people they trusted.
Svetlana Kuzmina and Viktor Petrov came to the Caucasus in 1997 to
try to find a Russian soldier from their Volga hometown who had
disappared during fighting in Chechnya 1995. One of the
intermediaries they had hoped would help them instead turned them
over to a kidnapping ring, which then sold Petrov and Kuzmina to a
Chechen warlord named Kyuri for the price of two Land Rovers.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the kidnappings were carried out in the Caucasus by
Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Alla Geifman, 12, who was freed after seven months in captivity
in December, was kidnapped from outside her house in the Volga
River city of Saratov and driven by truck to Chechnya. The
kidnappers were later arrested, but not before they sent 13 people,
five of them minors, to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The ringleader and several members of the gang that kidnapped
Adi Sharon were Chechens, but among their accomplices were six
ethnic Russians. And although the kidnappers made it appear that
the boy was being held in Chechnya, police eventually found him in
Russia's Penza region, 600 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there were Russians among the kidnappers, and
the kidnappings have happened everywhere,'' said Rumyantseva, the
police spokeswoman. ``We began to realize that no one was
completely safe anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumyantseva said that the presence of Russian troops in Chechnya
has made it harder to for kidnappers to take their captives across
borders.
</P>
<P>
   ```But I don't rule out that they are doing it right now,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Russian police freed two soldiers who had been
abducted 10 days earlier from the main military base outside the
Chechen capital, Grozny. Another serviceman, Andrei Rais, who had
been taken hostage in April, was freed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian police say that most of the remaining hostages are in
Chechnya. But this is hardly a comforting prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that only one in 10 of them will live,'' said Kiril
Perchenko, 20, a Moscow video producer who was abducted in the
Russian capital and spent six months as a hostage in Chechnya
before he escaped, he said, to Russian lines in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Perchenko said his Chechen captors, followers of the Chechen
warlords Arbi Barayev and Ramzan Akhmadov, routinely chopped off
the fingers and hands of captives while forcing the others to
watch. The hostages were forced to carry weapons and dig trenches.
When a Russian photographer was unable to keep up, Perchenko said,
he was shot. When a captive Russian lieutenant attacked a Chechen
guard, Perchenko recounted, the Russian officer was beheaded as the
rest of the capitves watched.
</P>
<P>
   Children have not been spared. Adi Sharon's captors cut off the
ends of both little fingers to press their demands that his father,
a wealthy businessman who works in Moscow, pay $8 million in
ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Alla Geifman, the 12-year-old girl, told reporters after her
release that her captors grew impatient as the months dragged on,
cutting off one of her fingers. A month later, they cut off another
and sent it to her father. They also sent him a cassette in which
the girl is heard screaming ``Papa, they're taking off my pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Geifman was in the news several weeks after she was freed when
the US Embassy in Moscow failed to grant her a visa, instead
requesting more information about the purpose of her trip. That
refusal was taken up by the media here as a sign of what many
Russians view as the West's unwillingness to hear Russia's side of
why it is fighting in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But some Chechens say that the practice of holding captives for
ransom has merely switched sides.
</P>
<P>
   Chechens charge that Russian paramilitary police routinely round
up civilian men and put them in detention centers, then demand
payment from their relatives for their release. Detainees who have
been freed describe fierce beatings, mock executions and other
systematic mistreatment. Russian officials have repeatedly denied
such charges as separatist propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens say the price for being freed varies, according to
recent detainees _ $200 to $300 for anyone arrested in peaceful
villages, several times that for men detained near the fighting.
These are small sums compared to what the Akhmadov and Barayev
gangs allegedly demand, but still more than most Chechens can
afford.
</P>
<P>
   Khalipat, a Chechen woman who asked that her last name not be
used, described how she lobbied Russian officials for months in
vain for the release of her son, Mudar, who was detained in
January.
</P>
<P>
   She said her efforts brought no results until she began dealing
with a Chechen intermediary who promised her that for $2,000 he
would free her son. It took Khalipat two months to collect the
money from friends and family. By that time, she said the price had
gone up to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mudar went free, but Albert Idigov, detained in January, remains
incarcerated. His mother, Khazan, said that Russian officials
agreed that her son should be freed. But she had no money to pay
the intermediaries.

FIX YOUR DISHES WITH A SAUCY NEW TWIST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you'll be grilling often this summer _ whether it's succulent
chicken breasts, huge tender steaks or fresh salmon steaks _
consider embellishing your grillworks with tantalizing toppers.
</P>
<P>
   Chic trendy salsas, cold sauces, relishes and even tapenades
require no cooking, can be put together in minutes and offer a
range of different taste sensations.
</P>
<P>
   When you tire of just plain barbecue and want to bump your
dining pleasure upward a notch or two, try a fruity or savory or
piquant creation to fancy things up. You'll find mixtures of
fruits, vegetables, herbs, seasonings and the like _ and many will
even make good dips with chips or crudites. Another plus _ you can
also toss these versatile mixtures on steamed vegetables, rice,
beans or tossed salads for interest and dynamic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that sauces and salsas know no ethnic bounds and you
can customize them to suit personal tastes. Try sprucing them up
with ginger, soy sauce, a variety of chiles, special vinegars and
even oils. You can make Southwestern-style, Asian, Mediterranean
and other interpretations with ingredients as chunky or saucy as
you like. Some recipes contain less, some have more moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit and vegetable possibilities run the gamut from peaches,
nectarines and mangos to papaya, strawberries, raspberries, jicama,
corn, tomatillos, black beans, tomatoes and beyond. It's even
feasible to make a delicious avocado salsa like one once sampled
with the crab cakes at Fog City Diner in San Francisco. Simply mix
together cut-up avocado pieces (don't mash), chopped onions,
chopped green chiles, lots of lemon juice and salt. Another time,
add some garlic pepper and finely chopped tomatoes or cooked corn
kernels. Or spread herb grilled chicken breasts with a tapenade
like they do at Lucques restaurant in Los Angeles and surround with
a ragout of onion wedges and roasted red pepper pieces sauteed in
olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   When time is really short, whip up a combination of sour cream,
prepared horseradish and Dijon-mustard to serve with beef or
chicken. Or try grilled chicken topped with a mixture of Dijon
mustard and apricot jam zapped a minute or two in the microwave
oven. Interesting mustards are another way to go when mixed with
some snipped fresh tarragon or basil and a little whipping cream. I
also favor cucumber-yogurt or sour cream sauces as well as
pineapple salsas, which can be tossed together with canned
pineapple pieces, chopped red pepper and onions, herbs and
seasonings, and a drizzle of wine vinegar and oil.
</P>
<P>
   If you keep a well-stocked pantry and fresh produce bin in your
fridge, you should have no trouble turning out a medley of
creations on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   There really are no preparation secrets or tricks, but for best
results (except in the case of tapenades) be sure to hand chop the
ingredients rather than using the food processor. Although these
sauces can be prepared just before serving (and they should be made
fresh on the day of serving), in most cases, they're at their best
if the flavors are allowed to mellow for at least an hour or two
prior to using.
</P>
<P>
   For those in a time crunch, don't be embarrassed to rely on some
of the delicious ready-made options. Trader Joe's, supermarkets and
specialty food stores stock a variety of fruits salsas, different
relishes, tapenades and sauces. Peruse the aisles _ you'll be
amazed at the variety of interesting items available.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you call these embellishments, they're bound to add
zest and new dimensions to meals. Now the only problem is deciding
which of the following recipes to make first. &QL;

preservationists and planners are beginning to see a new future for
the formidable stone. Architects have started using it to give a
touch of historical sobriety to gaudy mansionettes, and

SATELLITE OBSERVES SOLAR FLARES' SNAP, CRACKLE AND POP 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the painter Winslow Homer, who dismissed the North Atlantic
as ``a duck pond'' when it was not blowing a good storm, solar
physicists find the sun most fascinating when its atmosphere is
erupting, flaring and flinging energetic particles into space.
</P>
<P>
   The physicists believe the energy for those outbursts somehow
comes from the strong magnetic fields that are generated deep
inside the sun and emerge from its surface like wild hair.
</P>
<P>
   Much less clear is exactly how the energy flows from the tangle
of field lines to the solar equivalent of a nor'easter.
</P>
<P>
   By capturing images of the sun that are as beautiful as they are
revealing, the Yohkoh satellite, a collaboration between the
Institute of Space and Astronautical Science in Japan and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the United States,
has moved scientists a step closer to pinpointing the precise
mechanism for that release.
</P>
<P>
   Yohkoh, which observes hot, X-ray-emitting gas that is trapped
by the magnetic field lines, has seen the first evidence that the
lines snap back toward the solar surface like rubber bands after
being stretched out during great eruptions of solar material into
space.
</P>
<P>
   The observation supports the theory that solar flares
accompanying those eruptions are powered by sudden breakages in the
field lines, called reconnection events, that generate tremendous
electrical currents in the gas and heat it to high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists had often seen the stretching, but because the much
more rapid recoil had eluded them, they had begun to question their
model of how flares _ the most violent events in the solar system _
are set loose.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence for the recoil turned up when a solar physicist, Dr.
David McKenzie of Montana State University, analyzed Yohkoh images
of 17 cases in which solar eruptions were followed by flares.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie presented the results in late June at a meeting of the
solar physics division of the American Astronomical Society in Lake
Tahoe, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we all thought was happening, but it's
something we had never seen before,'' said Dr. Eric Priest, a solar
physicist and applied mathematician at the University of St.
Andrews in Scotland. ``In fact, the absence of evidence was really
casting some doubt on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the theory that magnetic reconnections drive
flares, Priest said the new analysis was ``a beautiful piece of
supporting evidence for that basic process.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun's luminous output is powered by nuclear fusion reactions
in its central core. Because the sun's interior, and its
atmosphere, are heated to such high temperatures by the same energy
source, the electrons that normally surround gas atoms have been
knocked loose and roam freely, creating an electrified gas called a
plasma.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ordinary gas, plasmas and magnetic field lines interact
in such a way that they tend to remain stuck together. As the sun
spins on its axis, this interaction within the roiling solar
interior often generates twisted bundles of strong magnetic fields
that bob to the surface like corks in a lake. The fields can keep
rising until they protrude from the surface and form a variety of
structures resembling cowlicks, arches or tethers, with one end
anchored on the sun and the other drifting into space.
</P>
<P>
   One sprawling type of structure, called filaments because of
their dark, stringy appearance against the face of the sun, can
support billions of tons of relatively cool plasma above the
surface of the sun, like giant hammocks. It is the sudden eruption
of the filaments, heaving the plasma into space and stretching the
field lines beneath, that begins the train of events studied by
McKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analogy that I can think of is a hot air balloon taking
off and stretching its tethers up like an elastic band,'' McKenzie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what sets off the eruptions, called coronal mass
ejections, is not known, but physicists suspect that instabilities
in the filament's twisted magnetic field lines may be the cause.
Whatever the reason, the plasma rises up, stretching its magnetic
tethers to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetic field lines, unlike normal tethers, cannot have exposed
ends. So once one breaks free, McKenzie said, ``some of the
magnetic field will reconnect or rearrange its connection
underneath the erupting coronal mass ejection.'' In effect, the
ends of broken tethers splice together, or reconnect.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful electrical currents driven by that reconnection are
thought to heat the plasma violently, leading to the spectacular
displays that come next: solar flares, which consist of explosions
of energetic particles and high-energy radiation like X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   But the reconnection should also let the tethers snap back
toward the surface of the sun, an effect that had never been seen.
So McKenzie examined a series of pictures of each event as taken by
Yohkoh using the same X-rays the flares generated. Since magnetic
structures would be revealed by some of the hot plasma still
sticking to them, the recoil should be evident in the pictures,
taken 15 to 20 seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
   And they were. McKenzie turned up both light and dark striations
moving back toward the sun, though somewhat more slowly than theory
had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is immeasurably helpful in understanding flares and
coronal mass ejections,'' said Dr. Hugh Hudson, of the Solar
Physics Research Corp. in Tucson, who collaborated with McKenzie in
an early phase of the work last year. ``It is the clearest
confirmation yet that the long-suspected process of large-scale
magnetic reconnection really does work.''
</P>
<P>
   Other physicists, including McKenzie, said that because the
reconnection had not been seen directly, the case was far from
settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many compelling pieces of evidence that
reconnection may be underlying flares and coronal mass ejections
that it's a plausible connection,'' said Dr. Amitava Bhattacharjee
of the University of Iowa. ``But not a watertight case yet, in my
mind.''

 &HT;    Women make strides, still face salary gap
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women are closing the pay gap in many industries in corporate
America, according to Working Woman's 20th annual salary survey
being released today.
</P>
<P>
   But they still earn significantly less than men for the same
work in almost every job in every industry, including
women-dominated fields such as nursing and secretarial work. Even
women at the highest levels of corporate America take home less
than their male counterparts, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's survey covers more than 40 industries. It
includes fast-growing fields such as information technology and
health care management as well as male-dominated fields where women
are gaining ground: the clergy, science, management and sports. The
sports category includes salaries for players in the Women's
National Basketball Association, where the $50,000 in average pay
is a far cry from the millions male players make.
</P>
<P>
   Women advertising executives have made some of the biggest pay
gains. Female media directors field make 90 cents for every $1 men
in the same job earn, up 6 percentage points from a year ago, the
magazine found. Although women chief executive officers at large
advertising firms make a lot less than male peers, those at midsize
companies take home $10,000 more, according to the survey. If it's
any consolidation, Smyrna, Ga., native Julia Roberts is the first
actress in Hollywood to join the $20 million-per-film ranks, a
males-only club until she signed to star in the movie ``Erin
Brockovich.'' Stars like Tom Cruise, Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson
routinely earn that much per picture.

FOX PROMISES COALITION CABINET WITHIN TWO MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ As Mexicans hailed the cleanest elections in their
country's history, President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada of the
opposition National Action Party immediately began preparations for
the first non-PRI administration to govern the United States'
southern neighbor since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Operating on little sleep following nearly all-night
celebrations for his historic victory on Sunday, Fox reached out to
his supporters, spoke via telephone with world leaders, including
President Clinton, met with incumbent President Ernesto Zedillo of
the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and
promised that he would form a new coalition Cabinet in two months
that would include other parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that every Cabinet member learn their
responsibility quickly for a smooth transition of programs,'' Fox
said Monday. ``Above all so that we can continue or improve upon
existing programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old former Guanajuato governor, who was the
candidate of a conservative coalition led by the National Action
Party, or PAN, defeated the PRI candidate, former Interior Minister
Francisco Labastida Ochoa, by a surprisingly wide margin in a
Mexican election whose cleanliness was as unprecedented as its
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   With 93 percent of the ballots counted by the country's
independent Federal Electoral Institute, Fox had 42.8 percent of
the vote, followed by 36.5 percent for Labastida. A third
candidate, former Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate
of a center-left coalition, received 16.5 percent, followed by two
other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In other races, voters also slashed the PRI's presence in
congress, making it a minority party for the first time, elected
opposition governors in two states and reelected an opposition
party for the Mexico City mayoralty.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans everywhere arose with surprise and pride at what they
had done at the ballot box. Even those who hadn't voted for Fox
acknowledged that the country had reached an important democratic
milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish somebody else had won, because I don't have much
confidence in Fox or his party,'' said Miguel Herrera, a
40-year-old welder who voted for PRI. ``But at least now we know
that our votes matter and that we can change what we don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Before boarding a Mexico City subway on her way to work Monday
morning, Beatriz Casas, a Fox supporter, said her country felt
different to her after Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe exactly, but it feels like my opinion
matters,'' she said. ``We don't have to put up with bad governments
anymore. We can vote for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new attitude among voters came from an election
process this year that was extraordinarily transparent and clean.
Under the watchful eye of an independent electoral agency created
four years ago that took balloting away from government control,
stricter laws that restricted private funds and party intereference
and allowed for fairer media coverage, observers noted that the
election was generally clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, a majority of the people were convinced that their
votes were secret and counted,'' said David Huey, a spokesman for
Global Exchange, a California-based human rights group and one of
several national and international observer organizations that
monitored the vote. ``There were lots of minor irregularities that
we found, but nothing blinding that would affect the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mexican voters were so eager to express their opinions
in such a close race that a record number of them _ 80 percent of
the country's 59 million registered constituents _ turned out to
cast ballots. Some of them waited hours to vote because of
technical problems and a lack of ballots at some precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the logistical problems, there were complaints by
observers and voters alike that party representatives, particularly
from the PRI in provincial areas of the country, had illegally
influenced voters to support the party's candidates. The electoral
institute will investigate all formal complaints that it has
received.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Fox's work will now focus on building a new government
in time for his Dec. 1st inauguration and for Mexico's first
transition of federal power to a different party.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding significantly more diplomatic than he did during the
tight and combative campaign, Fox stated repeatedly during his
acceptance speech Sunday night and again Monday that he would work
closely with other political factions.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Zedillo sounded as conciliatory as Sunday night's
losing candidates. In a nationally televised speech Sunday night
immediately after the the electoral agency released its preliminary
results and before Labastida could concede defeat, Zedillo
congratulated Fox and pledged a smooth transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have offered to Mr. Fox to personally oversee a transparent
and efficient (transition) to the next federal administration,''
said Zedillo, who was prohibited by the Mexican constitution from
seeking reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's stock market and currency, which have historically
reacted negatively to election day results because of concerns of
fraud and political instability, surged in what some called a
``fiesta rally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexico City Bolsa rose 6.12 percent, interest rates eased
slightly and the Mexican peso gained 3 percent against the US
dollar to its strongest exchange rate in a month.

`WHAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN': `LORD OF THE FLIES' ON IN-LINE
SKATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This slender novel by the Italian writer Simona Vinci plunges
with such stylistic quiet into forbidden territory that one almost
fails to hear the barriers collapsing. Vinci's forbidden territory
in ``What We Don't Know About Children'' is sex among children. The
novel tells a shocking story, mostly through the muddled
perceptions of a girl named Martina whose desire to be included
leads her to become a member of a clandestine club led by a
disturbed 15-year-old. But ultimately Vinci's theme is the
normative cruelty that lies within the human soul and the fragility
of individual defenses against it.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is a shocking story, it is, as the author notes in a
brief afterward, a plausible one. Still, a question arises about
the purpose and the effect of Vinci's depictions of sexually
explicit acts among children. I found myself torn between two
contrary reactions.
</P>
<P>
   One can admire Vinci for drawing aside the curtain that normally
veils this subject and to treat it bravely, unapologetically and
with psychological subtlety. But I also wondered whether she
transcends the sexual and psychological disturbance that she
describes, or, via her book, participates erotically in it. In the
end, perhaps, the discomfort one feels in reading this novel points
to its underlying message: that moral behavior, civilization, is
based not on the denial of forbidden impulses but on restraint, on
governing those impulses when they disrupt the falsely smooth
surface of repression.
</P>
<P>
   Vinci, described on the dust jacket as a 30-year-old writer who
lives near Bologna, provides an arid setting for her tale, a bland,
featureless apartment building on the edge of a town called
Granarolo, a spot so remote that the courtyard faces a field of
corn. Martina stands alone in the middle of the courtyard singing,
remembering when the other children, absent now, used to play
there. Vinci introduces us to two other characters, Luca, who
spends his days sleeping in a dark room, and Matteo, who runs,
``methodical and steady,'' although until recently he was inactive,
``like a dead pine cone.''
</P>
<P>
   Something, in other words, has happened inside the spare and
standardized environment of the apartment building and the
courtyard, whose cement parking lot, green benches, lampposts,
tubular fencing and iron gates suggest a false and empty normality.
What is missing is an adult presence. Parents play walk-on roles in
the story, but in essence are as distant from the children's
emotional lives as the crows circling the cornfields. If Vinci's
story has any practical message to offer, it would be similar to
that of the antidrug poster displayed at New York City bus stops,
on which a teen-age girl wears a tattoo saying, ``Stay involved in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinci's children live in their own culture, careering around on
in-line skates, talking about intergalactic travel and playing a
game called nuclear war in which ``they simulated nuclear blasts
with firecrackers that left a cloud of smoke and made the whole
yard stink.'' A subtle, implicit eroticism hangs over the
playground like a mist. While there are no parents in evidence, a
vague sort of adult evil hovers in the form of two men who pick up
Mirko, the 15-year-old leader, in their car from time to time and
give him things in plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   That was before. Now, the children have gone elsewhere and
Martina sings by herself, Luca sleeps and Matteo runs. Five months
earlier, Mirko began showing the contents of the plastic bags to
Martina, a 14-year-old boy named Luca and Matteo and Greta, both
10. As if these magazines depict models to emulate, the five of
them engage in a secret rite led by Mirko, who has a troubled
``Lord of the Flies'' aura of command about him. They go to a shed
to engage in the sexual experimentation that is at the prurient
heart of Vinci's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the way home Martina sat on Mirko's scooter,'' the narrator
writes after the first visit to the shed, ``hanging on to him, with
the unpleasant feeling that somehow she had lost something, and
that she couldn't do anything about it. All that countryside around
them, and something forgotten or lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the children has a story. But Martina, tormented,
powerless and compliant, remains the central figure, the embodiment
of the confusion and longing involved in protean sexuality. The
blending of disassociated images is psychologically brilliant, from
Martina's memory of early auto-erotic desires to a vision of
Greta's hands on her desk, ``her filed nails with their chipped,
dark-red nail polish,'' that somehow disgusts her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are horses running through the snow, the stars above,''
Vinci writes of Martina's fantasy life. ``There's a leap into
emptiness, like rounding a hill at full speed in a car.''
</P>
<P>
   As the children, in thrall to Mirko, extend their explorations,
matters hurtle toward tragedy. The two men who call Mirko into
their car exercise a strange power; they are an invisible force
that leads the children to carry out their prescribed roles not so
much because they derive pleasure from them but because they don't
know how to escape. But the world the children have created is too
complex, too mysterious, for Vinci's novel to be seen as a parable
about the corruption of childhood innocence by adult malice.
Innocence does not exist in her world of pubescent and adolescent
desire and cruelty, although the corrupting influence of evil
grown-ups who step in when parents are absent is clearly a theme of
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Vinci's book, translated from the Italian by Minna Proctor, is
like nothing else you have read. In its way it is more disturbing
than ``Lord of the Flies'' because the action takes place not on
some abandoned island but in the midst of ordinary life, surrounded
by civilization.

 c.2000 La Stampa  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture a fisherman threatened with old, rusting mustard-gas
weapons in his fishnets. Picture a whole neighborhood evacuated
because of chemical weapons unearthed in one family's backyard.
Picture gallons of deadly nerve gas leaking from storage containers
and wafting downwind toward communities crowded with young children
and their parents. Worst of all, picture a terrorist group
releasing nerve gas in a public place _ say the subway in the
middle of rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   These four scenarios are not hypothetical. All have taken place
in the last few years in the United States, Japan and on the high
seas. Chemical weapons, hundreds of thousands of tons of which are
produced in Russia, the U.S., Japan, throughout much of Western
Europe, and now in Asia, continue to threaten us all in many and
varied ways. In addition, large stockpiles _ as well as dumped and
buried munition caches _ still exist.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to understand this growing threat and to destroy
chemical weapons before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia today have more than 65,000 tons of
chemical weapons stockpiled at 16 major sites. U.S. stockpiles _
some 25,000 tons now _ are located in eight states: Alabama,
Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Oregon and Utah,
and on Johnston Atoll in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Russian stockpiles _ some 40,000 tons _ are concentrated at
seven sites in western Russia and one east of the Urals.
</P>
<P>
   India has also publicly acknowledged an existing stockpile, and
several additional countries no doubt possess smaller stocks of
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, both the United States and Russia, along
with many other nations, signed an international agreement, the
Chemical Weapons Convention, banning development, production and
stockpiling of chemical weapons. It took 12 years of tough
negotiating, partly under my watch as Soviet president, to bring
about the convention, a historic breakthrough in nondiscriminatory,
verifiable, global disarmament of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement has set an excellent precedent for efforts to
abolish nuclear weapons, And yet, although it was ratified by the
U.S. Senate and the Russian Duma, the CWC has failed to eliminate
much of the chemical weapons threat. Serious progress is needed
immediately in chemical weapons destruction if there are to be no
more accidents or terrorist incidents. If we wait, they inevitably
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   First, we all must recognize that the continued existence of
enormous chemical weapons stockpiles threatens each and every one
of us. Nerve, mustard, lewisite and other deadly gasses kill
indiscriminately, especially when let loose by terrorist groups in
public places or when leaking from stockpile sites and carried by
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Old arsenals also pose serious environmental and public health
hazards to local communities, but our main concern must be global
security. The proliferation threat is real.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the international community must begin to seriously help
Russia to destroy its chemical weapons arsenal. Russia is fully
committed to abolishing its stockpile, but its difficult
post-Cold-War socio-economic situation has prevented it from
destroying a single weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cooperative Threat Reduction program, established
eight years ago by Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, has committed
some $150 million in recent years to planning a destruction center
in the Kurgan region, just north of Kazakstan on the steppes of
Siberia. The Europeans _ Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy and
others _ have committed some $50 million. But the Russian program
is estimated to cost $8 billion to $10 billion to destroy all seven
chemical weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
   Much more coordinated support is needed now to share this burden
more fairly. Recent efforts in Congress to halt the Nunn-Lugar
program are misguided and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Continued development of safe and environmentally sound ways to
destroy weapons is needed. The end product should be a ``toolbox''
applicable to all weapons, chemicals and situations.
</P>
<P>
   Having successfully incinerated 6,000 tons of chemical weapons,
the United States has learned that there is no silver bullet. In
the last five years, much has been learned, though, about safe
alternative destruction methods, knowledge that we all must share.
There are many stakeholders in this process, and they must be
included through the use of advisory commissions, regional and
national dialogues, outreach programs and open decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we must begin to address old and abandoned chemical
weapons that contaminate countries and oceans throughout the world.
The United States, for example, has identified more than 200
suspected dumpsites _ in two-thirds of the states _ that may
contain chemical weapons. Green Cross Russia has recently studied
an open-burn site for lewisite in the Penza region.
</P>
<P>
   And all major powers have sunk bargeloads of chemical weapons to
the bottom of the seas, thus endangering the environment and health
of the global community.
</P>
<P>
   I am concerned about the loss of momentum in eliminating
chemical weapons. I have therefore written to leaders of Russia,
the United States and several other countries urging them to give
serious personal attention to this matter. I appeal to them and to
the world public to join me in an effort to rid the world of the
dangerous, obsolete arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   (Mikhail Gorbachev is president of Green Cross International, a
global environmental organization with headquarters in Geneva. The
Green Cross Legacy Program addresses the safe and environmentally
sound destruction of weapons of the Cold War and the environmental
impacts of war.)

AID FOR REFUGEES ON THE SILVER SCREEN
</HEADLINE>
  By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounds like something out of a 1940s film archive: a group of
Americans, driven by great human suffering, travels to a strange
foreign land to offer succor to the needy. But this isn't a movie,
though it is humanitarianism, Hollywood style.
</P>
<P>
   The project is called Filmaid International, and its mission is
to aid refugees worldwide, albeit in a way that has little to do
with such basic needs as water or medicine. Instead, Filmaid's goal
is to import Hollywood's most plentiful natural resource: movies.
</P>
<P>
   Founded last year by Caroline Baron, a film producer, Filmaid's
mission is to bring feature films, children's cartoons and other
screen entertainment to refugee camps, where the horrors of war
have often been replaced by isolation, boredom and bad memories.
</P>
<P>
   Organized in just eight weeks, Barron's group traveled to five
refugee camps in Macedonia over two months last summer, toting
several small movie screens, a pair of video projectors and a
generator. In each, the group's volunteer technicians and
projectionists assembled a makeshift, open-air movie house and
screened movies like ``Titanic,'' ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' and ``E.T.''
for crowds of 300 to 4,000 children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   Working with aid organizations like the International Rescue
Committee and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
Filmaid began to branch out into other services, screening
educational films on everything from AIDS to domestic violence, and
employing camp members as projectionists and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for all of this, Baron, 38, turned to a source not
exactly famed for its global philanthropy: the film industry.
Despite Hollywood's reputation for self-obsession, Baron said she
found a remarkably receptive audience. Within the project's first
six weeks, Filmaid received donations of cash and supplies from an
array of film industry sources including Universal Studios, MGM and
Miramax Films. Some high-profile names also kicked in their
support. Robert De Niro, who worked with Baron on the film
``Flawless,'' joined the group's advisory committee, as did the
actresses Susan Sarandon and Julia Ormond, and Harvey Weinstein,
Miramax's co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   By the time their trip ended in mid-August, Baron's group had
been invited to visit Kosovo, screening the silent films of Charlie
Chaplin and Tom and Jerry cartoons to audiences of recently
repatriated Kosovars. Along the way, Filmaid also earned the
respect of several more established aid operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised by how successful they were, really
pleasantly pleased,'' said Reynold Levy, president of the
International Rescue Committee. ``One of the major issues for
refugees and particularly children is sheer boredom. They have no
routine, they have no school, their parents are clearly distracted.
The opportunity to engage in group activities helps restore a sense
of normalcy. And that's exactly what Filmaid provided.''
</P>
<P>
   So successful was Filmaid's first endeavor that the rescue
committee has adopted the organization as an official project and
signed off on its next mission: a six-month expedition, beginning
in October, to Guinea in West Africa, which is home to estimated
500,000 refugees from the region's simmering civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is that Baron, a veteran of the fantasyland of movie
sets and film shoots, has found herself in the unlikely position of
de facto international aid expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is funny to me sometimes,'' she said. ``I mean, I had to
look up Guinea in the atlas.''
</P>
<P>
   Baron says the idea for Filmaid came to her last spring after
she saw a photograph of a mother clutching her dying son on a
street in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just began to go, `What I am doing about this?''' Baron said
in a recent interview. ``I just thought there's got to be something
I can do.'' So she began to make calls. What she found was an
enormous outpouring of support.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first people Baron called was the producer Jane
Rosenthal (``Wag the Dog,'' ``Analyze This''), who had also been
following the refugee crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `What if we send movies over there?''' Rosenthal
recalls. ``I said, `Count me in.' It was really all Caroline. All I
did was second the motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with Jeffrey Silver, a Los Angeles film producer, Baron
began to solicit donations: a projector here, a generator there.
The group also received support from more traditional nonprofit
organizations like the William Jelin Memorial Trust and George
Soros' Open Society. Tower Air, which is now bankrupt, donated free
flights for the support crew to run the project's projectors and
generators.
</P>
<P>
   There were some skeptics. ``People were worried that it could be
viewed as frivolous,'' she said. ``We're talking movies here, after
all, not food or shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   But aid officials say that especially for refugee children,
entertainment is a much-needed resource, helping distract and dull
the psychological impact of war and displacement. Indeed, large aid
organizations like Unicef and Save the Children often supply toys
and sports equipment for just that reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think of relief as shelter, food, water, and in truth,
it's not really that hard to raise money for projects like that,''
said Robyn Groves, the senior external relations officer for the
U.N. High Command. ``But not a lot of people think what happens
after the basic necessities are taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Groves was just one of several aid officials who attended a
party last week celebrating the project's first anniversary, an
event that drew a mix of foreign aid officials and film types like
Mira Nair, the Indian director of ``Mississippi Masala,'' and
``Salaam Bombay.'' (Baron was co-producer of Nair's 1995 film
``Kama Sutra'' and is producing her next project, ``Monsoon
Wedding,'' which begins filming in India next month.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of Hollywood do-gooders,'' Rosenthal
said. ``I seem to think there's a new generation giving back to the
community in a significant way. I think we're far more socially and
politically active.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration also marked the informal kickoff for Filmaid's
fund-raising for the Guinea project. Budgeted at approximately
$350,000, that expedition will face far more difficult logistical
challenges, including poor roads, a lack of vehicles and a high
crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation, Baron visited Guinea this year with Mary Soan, a
British director who serves on Filmaid's executive committee and
met with aid workers, teachers and organizations like Doctors
without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing to me,'' Baron said. ``They said, `We want to
see hopeful films.'''
</P>
<P>
   Groves, who has visited camps in Angola, Iran, Macedonia and
parts of Southeast Asia, said, ``Refugee camps are really appalling
places,'' but films can make them better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like relief for the soul, relief from the boredom, trauma
and anxiety of those places, she said. ``In there, two hours of
fantasy can go a long way.''

 &HT;    Tech schools' names aimed at new market
 &HT;    By James Salzer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Driven in part by a surge in the need for
computer-savvy workers, technical schools across Georgia have been
overflowing with students in recent years, but not many of them are
coming right out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   So state officials think they've hit upon a solution to make the
campuses more attractive to Georgia's 18- and 19-year-olds and
their parents: Change the name of technical institutes to technical
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   State leaders, including Gov. Roy Barnes, will begin touring the
state Thursday attending name-changing ceremonies for technical
institutes hoping to escape the image of being the second or third
choice for recent high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those on the college track tend to ignore technical
institutes,'' said Atlanta Tech President Brenda Watts Jones.
``Now, it will become a window of opportunity rather than a last
resort.''
</P>
<P>
   The name-change provision was contained in a little noticed
section of Barnes' school reform law, which took effect last week.
The bill also set up a new funding formula that will provide money
for the first time based on enrollment, a change that will mean
millions of dollars more for the Department of Technical and Adult
Education's 33 schools and 17 satellite campuses.
</P>
<P>
   About half the schools will change names right away, and the
rest should do so within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   State policymakers have been through this name game before.
Lawmakers pressured the University System of Georgia Board of
Regents for years to upgrade state four-year colleges to regional
university status in hopes of gaining new programs and prestige. In
the mid-1990s, the regents changed the names of four-year colleges,
turning them into universities but without guaranteeing anything
more than a new name.
</P>
<P>
   State officials think this new name change will bring more
dramatic results. Students coming out of high school have long
picked state universities and colleges over technical institutes,
or simply gotten a job.
</P>
<P>
   While Ken Breeden, commissioner of the state technical school
system, brags of nonstop enrollment gains at his facilities, only
10 percent or so of his students at many of the campuses are fresh
from high school. More commonly, students don't enroll in technical
schools until they are in their mid-20s, or older.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name change is going to make our institutions more
marketable in the high school markets,'' Breeden predicted. ``For
kids out of high school, it is seven years before we see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Tanks Jr., 31, a student at Atlanta Tech, agrees the name
change could help. When he was a senior in high school, he
considered going to technical school, but he knew his parents
wanted him to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   So he got a degree from Georgia State University and works in
Wachovia's credit card business. But he never lost his desire to
study barbering, and last summer he started taking classes at
Atlanta Tech. After graduating, he wants to run his own business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name change will open a lot of parents' minds,'' he said.
``By being called a technical college, it will be considered a
first choice for education more often than it has been in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin Tech President Coy Hodges, who also serves as interim
president of Savannah Tech, noted that the name change will also
put Georgia in line with other Southern states that have technical
college or community college systems.
</P>
<P>
   One question that may need to be answered if the change attracts
more teens: where will technical colleges put them?
</P>
<P>
   Breeden said the state's technical schools have a waiting list
in the range of 6,000-8,000 students, and the problem can be
particularly acute in the system's most popular programs. For
instance, enrollment in computer-related programs has nearly
doubled since 1994, leading to waits for some students wanting to
study information technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waiting lists will increase, no doubt, particularly in our
computer technotudents drop out or graduate high school without
going on to some type of training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes good sense not to waste human talent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects the average age of technical school students _ now at
age 24 for those taking day classes at his Griffin, Ga., school and
age 28 at night _ to drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you will see the pendulum swing,'' he said.
``Eventually, we will get these students into occupations more
suitable to their potential.''

<P>
   ``The waiting lists will increase, no doubt, particularly in our
computer technology and allied health areas,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Tech will be getting more space in the next few years,
and Barnes committed $75 million in the mid-year, fiscal 2000
budget to technical school construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The limiting factor over the last five years is we haven't had
the capacity to expand because we haven't had the revenues to hire
more teachers,'' Breeden said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Barnes' bill, technical school funding will be based on
enrollment, rather than the previous formula of needs-based
recommendations made by Breeden's department and the schools.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly technology-driven society, Hodges said the
state can't afford to let students drop out or graduate high school
without going on to some type of training.

 &HT;    Under Dad's guidance, Williams' sisters advance at Wimbledon
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England -- Serena Williams broke into giggles when
describing her father trying to drive a car on the roads of London.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ride really slow because going on the other side is really
difficult,'' Serena said, laughing, after winning her first-round
match at Wimbledon this year.
</P>
<P>
   British fans laughed almost as much a few days later when
Richard Williams spoke about wanting daughters Venus and Serena,
the fifth and eighth seeds, to retire and become involved in the
Internet because he thinks it would be more lucrative than tennis.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Williams, who coaches the two with their mother,
Oracene, isn't here for his entertainment value to his daughters or
the public. He's here because his daughters asked him to come to
Wimbledon to help them - either of them - win the singles crown.
</P>
<P>
   They usually travel abroad with their mom, leaving Dad to handle
more coaching work at home. But the parents have different coaching
styles, and Venus decided she wanted her father to make his first
trip to Wimbledon. She asked him twice before he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom says a lot, lot less,'' Venus said. ``At a Grand Slam,
I want more input.''
</P>
<P>
   They've gotten it and so far it's paying off. Both moved into
the quarterfinals Monday. Venus defeated Sabine Appelmans 6-4, 6-4,
despite a concentration lapse late in the second set. Serena beat
Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-1, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the tournament begins,'' top seed Martina Hingis said
after beating Anke Huber 6-1, 6-2. Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport,
Monica Seles, Lisa Raymond, Jelena Dokic and Magui Serna were the
other winners.
</P>
<P>
   Matches jump in difficulty and intensity today, most players
said. Venus, in particular, will get challenged by Hingis. Serena
plays Raymond, and Davenport and Seles meet again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny looking at the draw,'' Davenport said. ``There are
some spots where I think some of us would rather be, and then some
spots of the draw that are just unbelievably tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Wins by the Williams sisters would set up an all-Williams
semifinal Thursday. Raymond, for one, thinks the pressure on them
for that match might help her against Serena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got nothing to lose. She's got everything to lose,'' the
former University of Florida player said. ``She's top 10 in the
world. She's the one 'supposed' to get to the semifinals and have a
matchup with Venus.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hingis, if she defeats Venus, could face the same trouble
she had at the U.S. Open last year when she beat Venus in the
semifinals but ran out of energy against Serena in the final. As
she was in New York, the younger Williams appears to be playing
well.
</P>
<P>
   But Hingis never has beaten the Williams sisters in back-to-back
rounds on consecutive days and admits some concern. Serena can
understand that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's (hard) because we both run well, we both have big
serves, we both are attacking,'' she said. ``It's like playing the
same person, who's your nemesis, all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemesis takes on interesting meaning in this context. Davenport
and Hingis have dominated women's tennis this year, building a
rivalry, while Venus and Serena spent much of the year recovering
from injuries and fending off retirement rumors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Williams sisters are never far from conversations about
potential Wimbledon winners, simply because their size, strength,
big serves and volleying abilities mean they should succeed on
grass.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, of course, has been saying that for years - and
saying that each sister would be nemesis to the other as they
dominated the sport at No. 1 and No. 2 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed well on their way to reaching that status last year.
Venus finished No. 3 in the world; Serena finished No. 4. But wrist
tendinitis for Venus and a knee injury for Serena meant they've
missed time from the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Venus now is ranked No. 5 and Serena is No. 8. Neither likes the
lower rankings, although they think it was best they took the time
off to let their injuries heal. Venus missed five months, while
Serena missed two.
</P>
<P>
   During the Ericsson Open, which Serena played but Venus missed,
Richard Williams created a storm by discussing possible retirement
for both his daughters. It fueled speculation that Venus, in
particular, had lost interest in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Williams does seem resigned to the fact that the
retirement conversations won't be much more than that for several
years. Serena predicted five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind them being here,'' Richard said last week. ``I
just don't like to see them on the same side of the draw.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first tournament they've played together since the
Grand Slam Cup in October, when Serena defeated Venus in the final.
It was the younger sister's first victory over the older sister.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, they're enjoying playing doubles, having each
other to warm up with and just hanging out together. As for playing
each other, it's another match to go, both say, but they'd like to
play that match.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to have that opportunity,'' Venus said. ``At least
one Williams would be in the final.''

HAROLD NICHOLAS, DAZZLING HOOFER, IS DEAD AT 79 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn.)   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harold Nicholas, the younger member of the dazzling
tap-dancing Nicholas Brothers, died Monday in Manhattan. He was 79
and lived in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure following surgery, said Bruce
Goldstein, a friend and a writer of the 1992 documentary ``Nicholas
Brothers: We Sing and We Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The careers of Nicholas and his brother, Fayard, began in their
childhood. Harold Nicholas continued to perform as a singer and
raconteur into the 1990s as a guest artist with companies including
Lynn Dally's Jazz Tap Ensemble, with which the brothers were to
have appeared in a tribute this week in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   They danced in vaudeville, on Broadway, in nightclubs and on
television. But it was their dancing in movie musicals that brought
them the most acclaim and made them internationally famous.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Nicholas appeared in more than 50 films, from 1932 to
1989, including ``The Big Broadcast of 1936'' (1935), ``Down
Argentine Way'' (1940), ``Tin Pan Alley'' (1940), ``Sun Valley
Serenade'' (1941) and ``Stormy Weather'' (1943). The brothers'
gifts were epitomized in ``Stormy Weather,'' an all-black 20th
Century Fox musical, in which they seemed to explode on the screen
in their trademark fast footwork and astonishing leaps and splits.
Their ``Jumpin' Jive'' dance in that film, Fred Astaire told them,
was the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   In that number the brothers danced on drums and leaped over the
heads of orchestra musicians. ``Spins, cramp rolls, turns and
crossover steps were woven into an intricate pattern of sound and
movement, as the brothers spun out back-sliding rhythms that
slipped smoothly from place to place on the stage,'' Constance
Valis Hill wrote in her ``Brotherhood in Rhythm: The Jazz Tap
Dancing of the Nicholas Brothers,'' published this year.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers absorbed all that they saw in dance in films and on
the stage, including work by Nick Castle, the 20th Century Fox
choreographer, and George Balanchine, who cast the brothers in two
Broadway musicals he choreographed, ``The Ziegfeld Follies of
1936'' and ``Babes in Arms'' (1937). The two also appeared on
Broadway in ``St. Louis Woman'' (1946), in which Harold introduced
the song ``Come Rain or Come Shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Their tap was an extraordinarily fluent blend of jazz, tap,
``flash-act'' acrobatics, angular eccentric movement, black
vernacular dance and ballet. They themselves called their work
``classical tap,'' not only because it incorporated elements of
ballet but also because they danced with their whole bodies,
including the often-neglected arms and hands. Fayard Nicholas, six
years older than Harold and a lifetime mentor, choreographed their
early dances, but Harold later came into his own as a more
instinctual dance-maker.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Winston-Salem, N.C., to Ulysses and Viola Nicholas,
musicians and vaudeville orchestra directors, Harold Lloyd Nicholas
began dancing at 5 at black vaudeville houses in Philadelphia as a
member of the Nicholas Kids, a show-stopping act that Fayard had
created for his brother, himself and their sister Dorothy. The
brothers' formal professional debut was made in 1930 on the radio
show ``Horn &AMP; Hardart Kiddie Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two years they were performing in New York City. At the
Lafayette Theater in Harlem they were seen by a Warner Brothers
producer who helped them land their first film roles, in a black
vaudeville short called ``Pie, Pie, Blackbird'' (1932). They made
their debut in 1932 at the Cotton Club. A formidable blend of
innocence and sophistication, the Nicholas Brothers were born.
</P>
<P>
   Their Hollywood career began after Samuel Goldwyn saw them at
the club, where they performed as headliners for eight years, and
cast them in ``Kid Millions'' (1934). A well-received stint in
London followed in the stage revue ``Blackbirds of 1936.'' One
reviewer noted of Harold, in The Times of London in 1936, that the
audience did not know whether to admire most his ``twinkling feet
or slow, baby smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers became grown-up stars in ``Down Argentine Way''
(1940) and appeared in five other films for 20th Century Fox.
Despite racial restrictions _no speaking parts, no scenes with
their white co-stars and dances designed to be easily deleted by
Southern exhibitors _ the two became huge film stars. Their last
film together was ``The Pirate'' (1948), in which Gene Kelly broke
the color bar by dancing with them.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Nicholas appeared as a solo artist in films including
``Uptown Saturday Night'' (1974), ``Tap'' (1989) and ``The Five
Heartbeats'' (1991). He also had a successful career in France,
where he moved in 1950, and performed as a dancer and singer
throughout Europe and in North Africa. He appeared with Eddie
Constantine in the French film ``L'Empire de la Nuit'' (1964).
</P>
<P>
   Back in the United States, Nicholas performed on television and
on the road. He returned to Europe to perform in the 1980s, as
popular as ever. Nicholas was a familiar presence on the New York
dance scene for the last 20 years, as a wry commentator and a
subtle sweet-voiced singer who executed a teasing step or two on
occasion. With his brother, he was the subject of a 1998 tribute at
Carnegie Hall. Other honors include the jointly received 1991
Kennedy Center honors, the 1998 Samuel H. Scripps American Dance
Festival Award and an Academy Awards tribute in 1981. The brothers
also taught as visiting dance artists at Harvard University and
Radcliffe College in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' marriages to the actress Dorothy Dandridge and Elyanne
Patronne ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife Rigmor Newman
Nicholas, of New York City; his brother, Fayard; his sister,
Dorothy Morrow; a daughter, Harolyn; a son, Melih, all of Los
Angeles; and two stepchildren, Frederick Newman of Torrington,
Conn., and Annie, of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas was always urbanely ready for anything. In a 1988
interview in The New York Times, the tap star, then 67, was asked
if he would do his trademark move at a forthcoming show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do a split or two maybe,'' he said. ``Don't plural it too
much.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: What's important? Be honest
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   American voters are focusing ever more on honesty as the most
important trait for a presidential candidate, according to an
Associated Press poll. The voters are about evenly split on whether
Al Gore or George W. Bush is more honest. Four in 10 voters now
pick honesty ahead of such traits as caring about people like them,
showing strong leadership, standing up for beliefs and having a
vision. In the new poll (4 percentage point margin of error) about
a third picked Bush as most honest and a third picked Gore. Another
one-third said neither candidate or they didn't know. Black voters
put the most emphasis on a candidate who cares about people like
them. But honesty ranked second.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST BIG OIL, NOW BIG DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from an attack on big oil, Al Gore toughened his criticism
of drug manufacturers today by blaming ``price gouging'' for the
soaring cost of prescriptions. At a high school in suburban St.
Louis, Gore touted his plans for a ``real, comprehensive
prescription drug benefit'' under Medicare, a proposal that he said
offered a sharp contrast with the Republicans. He was accompanied
on the campaign swing by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of St.
Louis, who said that prescription drugs would be a key issue not
only in the presidential race but in Democratic efforts to regain
control of Congress. ``It's a huge, huge issue to senior
citizens,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   VICE PRESIDENT? STILL MULLING
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush met Dick Cheney, the head of his vice
presidential search team today, and said he still had a long and
varied list of potential running mates to consider. Meeting with
Cheney, a former secretary of defense, at his ranch in Crawford,
Texas, north of Waco, Bush said he had not even made up his mind
whether he'd announce his choice before or at the convention in
Philadelphia, which begins four weeks from today.
</P>
<P>
   HEY, HE USED TO BE AN OILMAN HIMSELF
</P>
<P>
   While locked in a string of disputes with the Clinton
administration, the oil industry has pumped more than $1.5 million
into George W. Bush's presidential campaign. Oil companies will be
seeking Bush's help on a number of issues, should he be elected.
Across a range of issues _ from drilling in an Alaskan wildlife
refuge to new rules setting the price of oil taken from federal
land to whether to pursue a controversial international agreement
on climate control _ oil company executives seem to believe Bush
and the people he would appoint to key posts will be more receptive
to their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   BIG CHANGE ACROSS THE BORDER
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush congratulated Vicente Fox, the victor in Mexico's
presidential election who broke the governing party's 71-year hold
on the country's leadership. ``I think what it indicates is how far
reform has come in Mexico,'' Bush said today. ``Obviously, there
needs to be legal reform in Mexico. Mexico's got to do a better job
of arresting folks who break the law, but on political reform they
made great process.'' Al Gore's campaign also offered praise: ``We
congratulate Mr. Fox on his election and the Mexican people for
conducting the freest and fairest election in that nation's
history. We look forward to working with him.''
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT RESULT FROM NEWSWEEK
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek poll released over the weekend showed the two
candidates in a virtual dead heat, unlike a series of recent
surveys that gave George W. Bush a comfortable lead over Al Gore.
The survey had Gore leading 46-45 percent, well within the survey's
4 percent margin of error. Nine percent of those surveyed were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   FREE _ THAT'S ALWAYS A MAGIC WORD
</P>
<P>
   After being nominated by the Libertarian Party to run again for
the presidency, Nashville investment banker Harry Browne
acknowledged today he has scant chance of ever moving into the
White House, but said he hoped his campaign would reinvigorate his
ailing party. ``We're the only political party that's offering to
set you free,'' said Browne, 67, who didn't vote before 1992, when
his wife suggested he run for the nation's top office. ``It's the
most powerful political message in the world.'' The Libertarian
Party advocates individual liberties over expansive and expensive
government programs.
</P>
<P>
   FOR REFORM PARTY, IT'S BUCHANAN VS. HAGELIN
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Republican Pat Buchanan will face John Hagelin, leader of the
Natural Law Party, for the Reform Party presidential nomination _
and the $12.6 million in federal campaign funds that go with it.
Ballots will be mailed to thousands of interested voters around the
country later this week. The deadline for requesting a Reform
ballot has passed. Voters who receive ballots can mail them in or
use the identification number on the ballot to vote over the
Internet Aug. 7-9. Results will be announced at the convention,
Aug. 10-13, but a vote by more than two-thirds of the delegates can
overturn the results.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T EXPECT CAMPAIGNS TO CHANGE MUCH
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved the first significant restriction on campaign
financing in two decades when it voted last week to require
secretive, nonprofit political groups _ the so-called 527
committees _ to disclose where they got their money and how they're
spending it. But the legislation is expected to do little to
prevent outside groups from influencing or even dominating state
and national campaigns this year. ``Soft money,'' the huge
donations that unions, corporations and others give to the
political parties and other groups, remains without limit even
though the parties and advocacy groups, now including the 527
committees, will have to report it.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH'S GOT HIS DUCKS LINED UP
</P>
<P>
   Behind the symbolism of George W. Bush's recent efforts to court
traditionally Democratic minority voters lies a stark reality: He
can afford to focus on expanding his coalition precisely because he
has consolidated his political base far more successfully than Al
Gore. In recent polls, Bush is consistently attracting support from
about nine in 10 Republicans _ a far better showing than either of
the last two GOP presidential nominees. Gore, meanwhile, draws only
about three-fourths of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   YEAH, BUT WHAT DOES HE REALLY THINK?
</P>
<P>
   Green Party presidential nominee Ralph Nader has no problem
finding words to describe Al Gore: Gore ``is a great environmental
impostor. ... He's a 'gee-whiz techno-twit,' '' Between George W.
Bush and the vice president, ``Gore is the more infuriating because
he is more of a hypocrite,'' Nader declared. ``He doesn't know who
he is anymore. He's a plastic person.'' So what about Bush: ``The
problem with George W. Bush is that he is beyond satire. The
challenge for me is, how do you satire satire? This guy is out of
Central Casting. I refer to his campaign as the Bush Corp. He is
out of the corporation; he is the corporation; he is the corporate
welfare king of all presidential candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   DRIVING FORCE IN CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   He said the stop wasn't a campaign event, but George W. Bush
flew from his Texas ranch to serve as grand marshal of the Pepsi
400 in Daytona Beach, Fla., stock car race and shifted into
campaign mode. Bush made a brief pit stop in the garage area,
shaking hands with NASCAR fans, racing crews and drivers _ people
he said ``work for a living.'' The world of stock car racing is
made up of ``very good Americans,'' he said. ``They not only talk
about family values, they live it.''
</P>
<P>
   SHADES OF GLOOM
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that even with 130 days to go before the
election, Democrats are unsettled, even gloomy, while Republicans
are confident. One of Al Gore's biggest problems is, simply, that
voters seem to like George W. Bush more and think the vice
president is too politically calculating and relentlessly
ambitious. But Gore aides said they hope to turn that into a virtue
by convincing voters that as president he would channel that
determination and energy into his policy agenda.
</P>
<P>
   AN EASY NAME TO REMEMBER
</P>
<P>
   Voters in a Georgia legislative district will see a familiar
name on the ballot during the July 18 primary: Jimmy Carter.
Carter, 58, of Brunswick, is no relation to the former president
from Plains, 180 miles to the west. He is not even a Democrat. But
the ex-police chief is happy to share the name. ``It is apt to
stick more deeply than if I said my name was Robert Aspenwalt,'' he
said. Carter, running unopposed in the GOP primary, hopes to unseat
Democratic state Sen. Rene Kemp, who has represented the district
along the Georgia coast since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   FOLLOWING IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   Karenna Gore Schiff, oldest child of Al Gore, is traveling
throughout the country to preach her Democratic message of family
and participation. Schiff, 26, is national chairwoman of GoreNet,
the youth support coalition for her father's campaign. One of her
roles, she said, is keeping dad in touch with the needs and wants
of young voters. Schiff, whose mother, Tipper Gore, teasingly calls
her ``the next senator from Tennessee,'' graduated in May from
Columbia Law School. She was a frequent traveling companion of her
father during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   IN TELEVISION, THEY CALL IT COUNTER-PROGRAMMING
</P>
<P>
   It's an unconventional approach to presidential politics, but
that's the idea. Dismayed that the Republican and Democratic
national conventions have become ``coronations,'' a loose coalition
of political activists, religious leaders, and social satirists has
decided to hold ``shadow conventions.'' In Philadelphia and again
in Los Angeles, the plan is to talk issues during the day and party
into the night, to make Americans think hard about certain issues
and then make them laugh out loud. Sen. John McCain is slated to
speak on the East Coast; ``Politically Incorrect'' host Bill Maher
on the West. Actor and presidential tease Warren Beatty also is
expected to put in an appearance.

SEC AFTER-TAX RULE ARRIVES WITH NARY A WHIMPER FROM FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less is generally more when it comes to mutual fund documents,
which is why regulators have been pushing the industry to simplify
fund prospectuses and annual reports.
</P>
<P>
   But the Securities and Exchange Commission's latest proposal
does just the opposite, requiring funds to add a new and
potentially complicated category of information to their public
documents.
</P>
<P>
   SEC spokesman John Heine said the plan, mandating the disclosure
of after-tax returns, balances simplicity against the investor's
need to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it could be seen as complicating things a little,''
Heine said of the proposal. ``But remember that the commission's
job is first to decide what disclosure is important, then to worry
about how that disclosure is presented.''
</P>
<P>
   During a public comment period that ended Friday, the plan
didn't raise much protest from the fund industry. Even the
Investment Company Institute, the national trade group for mutual
funds, submitted a letter of support to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance funds submitted a letter supporting the plan and MFS
funds submitted one criticizing it, citing high costs for what it
said would be a minimal benefit. Others remained on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it won't matter to most people either way,'' said
Keith Hartstein, senior vice president at John Hancock, which
didn't weigh in with the SEC. ``Something like 40 percent of fund
assets are held in tax-exempt accounts, (and) the average fund
investor has a household income low enough that taxes aren't a
significant issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Plan supporters agree that many people don't need to know their
funds' after-tax returns. The numbers would be meaningless, for
example, for investors in tax-deferred retirement accounts such as
IRAs or 401(k)s.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents argue that investors in other, taxable accounts
have a right to know how much of a fund's return is theirs and how
much goes to Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there is a risk that this could be over-emphasized,
since it doesn't matter for half of the shareholders,'' said Tom
Faust, chief investment officer at Eaton Vance. ``On the other
hand, after-tax returns are vitally important for the other half.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, mutual funds distributed $166 billion in capital gains
and another $134 billion in taxable dividends to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC noted in its March 15 proposal that ``more than 2.5
percentage points of the average stock fund's total return is lost
each year to taxes.'' Jack Bogle, former chairman of Vanguard
funds, has said the ``tax drag'' is closer to 3 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, it can make a significant difference for
investors in taxable accounts.
</P>
<P>
   A $10,000 investment in a mutual fund that returns 10 percent
annually would grow to almost $175,000 over three decades. Clip the
return by 2.5 percent a year, though, and you would end up with
$87,550 after 30 years _ roughly half as much.
</P>
<P>
   The higher a fund's return, of course, the less the tax hit
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how much the tech-fund investors who earned 100
percent last year cared about taxes or expense ratios,'' said Burt
Greenwald, a fund-industry consultant in Philadelphia. ``When
equity markets lose some of their sizzle, these things will
suddenly seem a lot more important.''
</P>
<P>
   The details of the SEC proposal seem important to fund companies
already.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the plan would require funds to show after-tax
numbers for one-, five-, and 10-year performance in two ways. The
first would show gains or losses for an investor in the 39.6
percent federal tax bracket who held onto his fund shares, while
the second would show what the numbers would be if the same
investor unloaded the shares.
</P>
<P>
   It would also require funds to display the after-tax information
both in the annual report and in the ``risk/return'' section at the
front of the prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   The ICI said in its comment letter it supports the SEC's goal,
but the requirement as proposed ``could be misleading'' for
investors.
</P>
<P>
   It said the rule should be limited to the prospectus, and only
to the tax section near the back of the document. It also suggested
the SEC use the 28 percent tax bracket rather than the 39.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance, which stands to look good if the plan is approved
because some of its funds are managed for tax efficiency, said it,
too, supports the SEC's goals. But Faust said Eaton Vance would
prefer the SEC's original proposal to the ICI compromise and would
even like to see it expanded to include three-year returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in our industry who want to minimize the
level of disclosure because their funds wouldn't look good,'' Faust
said. ``Almost two-thirds of mutual fund assets are held by people
in the highest tax bracket, so it doesn't make sense to use the 28
percent bracket for these calculations.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC, for its part, said it chose the top rate because it
provides a worst-case scenario for investors and because the
numbers don't show the effect of state and local taxes as it is.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the next step for the SEC staff is to sift through
the comment letters and make a formal recommendation to the
commissioners. It has the authority to recommend changes as needed.
</P>
<P>
   There's no firm date for completing the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a formal time frame for these things,'' Heine
said. ``(However,) because of the high priority on this issue, I
can't imagine it will take too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The urgency stems in part from the fact that the US House of
Representatives has passed legislation requiring the SEC to improve
after-tax disclosures. The Senate, so far, hasn't followed suit.

C. STANLEY OGILVY, 87, WISE PROFESSOR OF SAILING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. C. Stanley Ogilvy, a mathematics professor who fell in love
with the endless and evanescent possibilities of the ocean breeze,
writing books about sailing as well as geometry, died on June 21 at
his home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy taught for 20 years at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y.,
and wrote mathematical books and articles. But it was on the
splendid, always changing waters of Long Island Sound that he found
his truest metier.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when major newspapers routinely had yachting
correspondents, there were dozens of articles about Ogilvy's
expertise at capturing the wind in canvas and using it skillfully.
Known to the nautical community as the wise professor, he raced the
class of boat known as the Star, a 23-foot-long, two-man boat, for
more than 30 years, placing third in the hotly competitive world
championship of 1949. Among his numerous victories were the North
American championship and the Austrian national championship.
</P>
<P>
   He then progressed to a larger class of boats, the Etchells,
which use a three-member crew, and had more success, particularly
at competitions of the Larchmont Yacht Club, where he was a member
for 62 years and the official historian. He saw the club change
from the preserve of Vanderbilts and Morgans to a place where an
ambitious and skilled sailor could make a name for himself on a
modest boat.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stanley Ogilvy said he was ``a water rat from the
start,'' growing up on the shores of the sound in the Sutton Manor
area of New Rochelle. He began ``messing around with boats'' at a
time other boys were taking their first swings with baseball bats
and began his racing career at age 18 as the crew member on a Star
boat. Five years later, when he joined the Larchmont club, he owned
his own Star. He developed a lifelong obsession with recording each
detail of every race.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Torrey, a sailor who competed against Ogilvy for many
years, told of the special spirit then in the salt air of
Larchmont. ``We thought we were the best sailors in the world,''
said Torrey, a maritime lawyer who went on to become a noted sail
designer.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy attended the Berkshire School, Williams College,
Cambridge University and Columbia University, eventually earning
his doctorate in mathematics from Syracuse University. In World War
II, he commanded a Navy air sea rescue vehicle in the South
Pacific. He taught at Trinity College before joining Hamilton's
faculty in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   His books on mathematics included ``Through the Mathescope''
(1956), ``Tomorrow's Math'' (1962) and ``Excursions in Geometry''
(1969). Several were translated into other languages, including
Swedish, Flemish, French, German and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   But teaching was at least as important to him as publications.
Eugene M. Tobin, the president of Hamilton College, quoted John
Anderson, a mathematics professor who died just a week before
Ogilvy, as saying he learned from Ogilvy ``that one's compassion
for students and one's passion for subject are mutually
dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy's books on sailing included three on one-design racing,
the term for classes of boats, like Stars, in which all boats meet
identical specifications. These were ``Successful Yacht Racing,''
``Thoughts on Small Boat Racing'' and ``Win More Sailboat Races.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rousmaniere, a yachting historian, said the books,
published from 1952 to 1977, were characterized by ``their
affection for the sport, graceful expression, rigorous analysis,
and extreme generosity with ideas for racing success that many
other sailors would have regarded as proprietary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy also wrote ``The Larchmont Yacht Club: A History,
1880-1990'' (1993), which told how the club was carved from
farmland and reached a position of prominence in the racing world.
He did not neglect such intriguing details as the weekly poker game
that began in 1896 even as he chronicled the club's glorious Race
Weeks, which in the 40's and 50's featured Arthur Godfrey as master
of ceremonies and performing seals in the swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy never married. He is survived by a brother, Stephen, of
Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A small and wiry man with a wry sense of humor, Ogilvy is most
remembered in his sailing set for the column he wrote for a quarter
century for the Larchmont Yacht Club newsletter. Called ``A View
from Delancey Cove,'' it darted across his wide range of interests
from fog, raccoons and squirrels and the wonders of sunsets to the
pros and cons of detached garages.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy once even ventured to suggest that winning is not
everything, a novel thought to many sailboat racers. ``As soon as
the importance of winning the race takes command, the sun is
blotted out, the black clouds descend, and before you know it you
are wearing an angry scowl and can see no farther than the bow of
the boat, if that far,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He argued for traditional nautical nomenclature. ``A boat has a
transom, a stern and an after cockpit,'' he cautioned. ``It has no
rear or back deck.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about foghorns? Ogilvy reported that the new ones all
sound alike. ``Time was when each foghorn had its distinctive
sound, and one knew at the first blast whether one was near the
bass diaphone on Captain Island or the mournful wail of Execution
Rock,'' he swore.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not some sort of slavish servant of nostalgia. ``Not
all these changes are necessarily to be lamented,'' he said in his
column. ``After all, we are not the same people we once were. Would
you like to be exactly the same sailor that you were in your youth?
</P>
<P>
   ``Think carefully before you answer that one.''

SEARCH FOR THE ULTIMATE SCRATCH BROWNIES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people opt for making their brownies from a mix while
others wouldn't dream of it. For those who prefer the scratch route
(including me), you not only eliminate the chemical taste of the
boxed product, but if you have a good recipe and you use good
quality chocolate and butter, you can end up with an excellent
textured and flavored result in short order.
</P>
<P>
   Now's it's time for a follow-up to the search for the ultimate
brownie. When I asked readers to share their BEST brownie recipes a
while back, two sent along recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Bassman of Sherman Oaks sent along versions from
Katharine Hepburn and Maida Heatter. The Hepburn brownie recipe _
which is a snap to make _ has made the rounds over the years, and
readers continue to enjoy it. According to notes accompanying the
Heatter recipe, which contains peppermint patties, Heatter found
the original in a Palm Beach, Fla., newspaper. It came from a local
deli, but of course she tinkered with it and added the
chocolate-covered mints, which don't melt but form a middle layer.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lapham of North Hills wrote that he has been experimenting
with brownie recipes for years, trying to come up with the perfect
recipe. The one he's sharing is, in his opinion, the best.
</P>
<P>
   With all my brownie travels and tastings through the years, I'm
sharing two of my current favorites. The first recipe, Fudgy,
Chewy, Cakey Brownies, is one I've made often. It's fabulous, and
the brownies have lots of height (more than an inch thick). The
other recipe for Triple-Chocolate Fudge Brownies is one a friend of
my daughter's recently tried and shared from the Food Network,
courtesy of Sara Moulton of Gourmet magazine. The brownies are rich
and yummy!
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to you to judge for yourself if any of the recipes
here can pass as the ultimate brownie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FUDGY, CHEWY, CAKEY BROWNIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knowing when to pull a pan of brownies from the oven is the only
difficult part of baking them. If you wait until a toothpick
inserted comes clean, they're overcooked. Check your brownies even
before the suggested minimum baking time. If a toothpick inserted
in the middle comes up with really fudgy crumbs, it's time to take
the brownies out and put them on a wire rack for cooling. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2/3 cup all-purpose flour &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon baking powder &QL; 
Vegetable cooking spray &QL; 
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate &QL; 
4 ounces bittersweet OR semisweet chocolate &QL; 
10 tablespoons (1 stick plus 2 tablespoons) unsalted butter &QL; 
1 1/4 cups sugar &QL; 
2 teaspoons vanilla &QL; 
3 large eggs &QL; 
3/4 cup toasted walnuts, pecans, macadamia nuts OR peanuts
(optional) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk flour, salt and baking powder in a small bowl; set aside.
Spray an 8-inch baking pan with vegetable cooking spray. Fit a
16x8-inch sheet of foil in pan and up 2 sides, so you can use foil
overhang as a handle to pull cooked brownies from pan. Spray sheet
of foil with vegetable cooking spray.
</P>
<P>
   Melt chocolates and butter in a medium bowl over a pan of
simmering water. Remove from heat; whisk in sugar and vanilla.
Whisk in eggs, one at a time, fully incorporating each one before
adding next. Continue to whisk until mixture is completely smooth
and glossy. Add dry ingredients; whisk until just incorporated.
Stir in nuts, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated 325-degree oven
35 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted into
center comes out with wet crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Cool brownies in pan on a wire rack 5 minutes. Use foil handles
to pull brownies from pan. Completely cool brownies on rack, at
least 3 hours. Cut into squares and serve. If not serving
immediately, do not cut brownies. (Whole brownie cake can be
wrapped in plastic wrap, then foil and refrigerated for up to 5
days.) Makes 16 brownies.

   Butter and flour an 8-inch square baking pan, knocking out
excess flour. In a heavy 1 1/2-quart saucepan, melt bittersweet and
unsweetened chocolate and butter over low heat, stirring until

sugar and vanilla. Add eggs, one at a time, whisking well until
mixture is glossy and smooth. Stir in salt and flour, just until
combined. Stir in chocolate chips.
</P>
<P>
   Spread batter evenly in pan. Bake in middle of preheated
350-degree oven 25 to 30 minutes or until a tester comes out with
crumbs adhering to it. Cool brownies completely in pan on a rack

THE APOTHEOSIS   OF THE HUSTLER:   A MORALITY CYCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ After the 46 shows that made up the spring 2001
men's wear collections ended in Milan on June 29, one was tempted
to calculate just how much it costs the fashion industry, and the
press that brings back news of it, to present men with the
possibility of pairing hot pants with knee socks, wearing metallic
leather jumpsuits unzipped to the navel or styling their hair so
that they look like female extras on ``The Dukes of Hazzard.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ a rough estimate _ is in the vicinity of $5.9
million. The figure takes into account about $60,000 to produce a
catwalk show (more for those with the swankiest production values).
It also considers the few thousand dollars in expenses that dozens
of buyers and 312 journalists from 18 countries incur during a
five-night stay.
</P>
<P>
   What the number does not account for is the cost of lavish
promotional dinners and parties given by the fashion houses, like
the one Gucci held in Milan's main railroad terminal last week,
which had Tom Ford dancing with Heather Graham. Nor does it account
for the cost of luring celebrities like Graham to Italy in the
first place. Nor does it include mini-bar raids made after hours at
the Hotel Principe di Savoia, center of fashion-week social
activity and home of the $15 airline-size bottle of Absolut.
</P>
<P>
   All this spending results in little with which the modern man
might build a broad and efficient wardrobe. This is not to say that
there are not some labels that still respect the notion of
wearability. At Burberry, Roberto Manichetti again turned out
handsome jackets in plaid and quietly patterned leather. He also
managed a memorably arch tuxedo, in shiny cotton with pointy
lapels, which nonetheless bore no traces of goofiness. Prada showed
narrow, short-cropped pleated trousers and uncomplicated beachwear,
all of which stayed within the realm of the smart and sensible.
Neil Barrett, a former Prada designer now on his own, proved with
boxy zippered jackets of waxed linen and leather, among other
styles, that he is not simply out for a lark.
</P>
<P>
   But what is ultimately played out each season on runways devoted
to men is something else: the frivolous resurrection of one male
archetype or another from a preciously thin catalog. What will it
be this time, one wonders? The pinky-ringed Harvard senior? The
aspiring biker? The seemingly neutered Carnaby Street lad? The
disaffected Midwestern stud with a tenure at Dairy Queen on his
resume?
</P>
<P>
   Or as it happened last week, the airily coiffed man-boy, whose
open shirts, tight sweaters and gold accessories suggest that he is
for sale?
</P>
<P>
   When fashion spectacles offer so little that can be taken
seriously, there is really no other way to judge them than by the
self-parody they achieve. The Versace show, by this measure, was
the week's most entertaining. It put the archetypal male hustler in
shirts with wild prints and plunging necklines, tight pink and
purple shantung suits and zigzag-pattern knit briefs. Nor did it
forget to give him big sunglasses and bigger hair. The overall
image was absurd enough to overshadow the sordidness at its root.
</P>
<P>
   With this show Donatella Versace accomplished something more
purely Versace-esque than she did with her last ``Fight Club''
collection. ``If Gianni is looking down,'' said Stefano Tonchi,
Esquire's fashion director, ``he is smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   At Fendi, where models wore wide-leg, beltless, low-slung pants,
small purses and tight-fitting knits as they slouched down the
runway, another editor commented that the hustler on view seemed of
a very particular sort: Via Veneto, circa 1973. Eric Wright, who is
Karl Lagerfeld's primary creative hand at Fendi and who designed
the men's wear line for the first time, said his inspiration came
from the typical Roman, so infatuated with his own good looks.
``They are all hustlers in a sense,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   At Byblos, models in gold chain belts and bracelets made a
similar point.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, D Squared, the cultish, five-year old label
designed by Dean and Dan Caten, Canadian twins, paraded models
wearing exceptionally low-slung jeans, who were chauffeured down
the runway in monster trucks. This season they held their show in
an open-air Milan discotheque and offered drinks, fruit kebabs and
models in gold leather jeans, tight gold basketball shorts and
sliced leather shirt-vests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme was Tony Monero in Mykonos,'' Dean Caten said,
referring to John Travolta's character in ``Saturday Night Fever.''
``That's where he'd go after he won the dance contest,'' Caten
added. ``Maybe he ran out of money on the vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolce &AMP; Gabanna showed men in tight tank tops and caps, gold
thong sandals and gold- and silver-embellished pants.
</P>
<P>
   However cliched the hustler reference might seem, it is one that
never seems to lose its aptness to the fashion business, a world
where favors are really exchanges and the beautiful always get
more. Last week, Gucci flew in celebrities to grace the front row
of its men's show for the first time. It played host to Graham, who
brought a friend, the comedian Molly Shannon. Dylan McDermott came.
And so, too, did the actor Matthew McConaughey, who also brought a
friend, another actor, Cole Hauser. All were put up at the
Principe, wined and dined and, one evening, toured around Lake
Como.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey's late-night exploits provided much of the week's
chatter, directing more attention to him than to the company that
paid the tariff. At one point, he remained at the Principe's bar
till 11 in the morning, said two people who were there. At 8 a.m.,
he called his official Gucci handler and asked to have the Gucci
retail store opened so that he could do some shopping. The weary
young woman explained he would have to wait until the scheduled
opening at 10.
</P>
<P>
   What Ford hoped to gain from the presence of an actor arguably
less famous than he is remained one of the week's presiding
mysteries. In fact, McConaughey's peripheral antics were so
entertaining that few editors seemed to find time to discuss Ford's
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Which was fortunate, in a way. Throughout his career, Ford has
given birth again and again to the somewhat degenerate 1970s
glamour boy that so many designers embraced last week. Although it
was smart for him to move on, what he delivered instead were
incomprehensible clothes lacking his usual keen irony. There were
kimono-inspired shirts, baggy drawstring leather pants, baggy,
painted jeans and swimming trunks that looked like the male answer
to the string bikini. It felt as though Ford had thrown this
together the morning after an all-nighter of kung fu movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a bit twisted, no?'' Tonchi, the Esquire editor, said
of the hustler look that typified the season. ``A bit corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a decade of sustained affluence has led fashion people to
grow bored with the commodification of genteel sensibilities that
has attended it. Prada's spring 2000 ``Belle du Jour'' collection,
with its allusions to the bourgeois woman who longs to come undone,
subversively tapped into such a mood. By the time the fall 2000
collections took place last February, fashion was selling
well-to-do women an image of themselves bordering on the vulgar and
predatory. The reference was the '80s and the brittle Alexis
Carrington sort determined to sleep her way into a destiny grander
than the one life was going to provide. It only makes sense that
men would eventually receive the same treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But do the wealthy truly hunger for the decadence that fashion
would prescribe for them? If you were to use as a yardstick ``The
Millionaire Mind,'' a best-selling study of how the real rich live
and think, there appears to be no yearning for life styles more
piquant than the mundane ones people already lead. Research on what
millionaires do with their off-hours concludes that the No. 1
favorite activity is ``consulting with a tax expert.'' Casino
gambling and yachting rank 17th and 20th, respectively.

RADKE DECIDES TO TAKE $36 MILLION AND STAY WITH TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Good news is not the norm around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only times I can remember we ever have press conferences
are to announce someone was retiring,'' reflected said Twins
manager Tom Kelly. ``Kirby (Puckett), (Terry) Steinbach, (Paul)
Molitor. ``It's never about a signing.''
</P>
<P>
   Never say never. The Twins had an announcement Monday, and for
once, it was good news. Brad Radke, their ace righthander, has
chosen not to flee for some outdoor pasture. He instead signed a
four-year, $36 million deal to remain with a small-market team that
has gone from a two-time world champion ('87, '91) drawing in
excess of 3 million fans a year to a doormat franchise scraping to
attract half that number.
</P>
<P>
   Radke would have been eligible for free agency following this
season, and the betting was that he would wind up being sacrificed
to a contender during a midseason fire sale. But he has reupped
with the rebuilding Twins, although there is a clause in his
contract allowing him to opt out following the 2001 season, a
clause general manager Terry Ryan says he believes Radke never
would invoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think he will,'' Ryan said. ``He's a loyal kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for Brad and his family,'' said Kelly. ``He's done a
lot for this organization, and it's nice to see good things happen
to a deserving person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan views the signing as a reversal of fortune that could have
important ramifications for a franchise that has been victimized by
market forces and changing times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for our scouts, our business people, and
everyone in our organization,'' he said. ``It gives them hope.
We've lost some good people from our organization the past few
years, and this shows people we're headed in a positive
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins entered this year with a payroll of $16.5 million,
which is roughly one-sixth of the Yankees'. Ryan admits they
wouldn't have been able to sign Radke without revenue sharing,
which, according to one team official, accounts for more money than
they will take in from ticket sales. The team next will have to dig
down to keep such young talents as Matt Lawton, Jacque Jones, and
lefty Eric Milton, but not for a while, anyway. Most of their core
players are years away from arbitration and/or free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said that the Radke signing reflects the desire of owner
Carl Pohlad to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken the money we've gotten from revenue sharing and
put it into personnel,'' Ryan said. ``And he's tired of being
beaten up here. Mr. Pohlad is a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Radke, a 20-game winner in 1997, is 29-38 the
past three years. He is, by modern standards, a workhorse, throwing
between 213 and 232 innings in each of the past four years. He is
5-9, 3.95 this season, and will make his next start Thursday
against the Red Sox and Paxton Crawford.

VIRTUAL REALITY FINDS A REAL PLACE AS A MEDICAL AID (The Science
Times) 
By JIM ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ James Pokorny sat upright in bed in his room at the
University of Washington Burn Center at Harborview as a nurse
prepared to unwrap his bandages. Working on a car when the fuel
tank exploded, Pokorny received third-degree burns on about 42
percent of his body.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pain-killing drugs, Pokorny was in agonizing pain, which
intensified when his bandages were changed. So doctors tried a new
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a black plastic helmet with a computer monitor inside,
headphones and a tracker that monitored the position of his finger,
Pokorny entered a virtual world. Multicolored three-dimensional
graphics, along with sound and tactile input created a realistic
virtual kitchen, with a stove, teapots, cabinets and clouds outside
a curtained window.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a virtual spider. The tracker on his finger
allowed him to chase the spider with his hand, force it down the
sink and grind it up by switching on a virtual garbage disposal.
All of which, Pokorny said, made the wound care seem far less
painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're concentrating on different things, rather than your
pain,'' he said. ``The pain level went down significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hunter Hoffman, a cognitive psychologist at the Human
Interface Technology Laboratory at the University of Washington,
conducted the experiment with a colleague at the university, Dr.
David Patterson, a professor of rehabilitation medicine, surgery
and psychology. Hoffman said that conscious attention was like a
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   With this therapy, he added, ``we are attracting that spotlight
to the virtual world and away from pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual reality, the name for the interactive artificial worlds
created by computers, is finding a place in health care, especially
among psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   It is being used for treating fear of flying or thunderstorms,
helping diabetics warm their hands and mitigating the crippling
memories of war.
</P>
<P>
   Although virtual reality for entertainment received much
attention in the early 1990's, the systems were too expensive _
nearly $200,000 _ for most applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the systems, which are now driven by desktop computers, cost
as little as $20,000, making them more practical in a growing
number of medical and psychological disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not watching something, you're in something,'' said Dr.
David Ready, a clinical psychologist at the Atlanta Veteran's
Administration Medical Center, where a virtual reality system is
being used to treat post-traumatic stress disorders in combat
veterans. ``All you see is what's in the goggles and all you hear
is what's on the headphones.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the virtual world looks extremely realistic.
The one in use at Harborview is a cartoon representation of a
kitchen. But nothing else is visible and the scene changes
realistically as the user's head swivels, giving the patient a
strong sense of being somewhere he or she is not.
</P>
<P>
   In the study by Hoffmann and Patterson, published in the March
issue of Pain, a British medical journal, patients with skin grafts
at the burn treatment center either played Nintendo or wore the
kitchen virtual-reality gear during the painful removal of surgical
staples.
</P>
<P>
   One patient thought of his pain 95 percent of the time while
playing Nintendo, but just 2 percent of the time while using the
virtual reality gear. The other patient went from 91 percent in
video to 36 percent in virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preliminary findings are exciting,'' said Dr. Mark Jensen,
a professor of rehabilitation medicine and a specialist in pain at
the University of Washington. ``I think it can be widely used for
chronic pain. But it needs to be tried with a variety of painful
procedures _ dentistry and dialysis for example _ to see how well
it works for those applications.''
</P>
<P>
   The capacity of virtual reality to convince the mind is also
effective in the treatment of phobias. The virtual kitchen with the
spider that Hoffman uses to treat pain can be adapted to treat
spider phobias.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, for instance, Joanne Cartwright suffered
a debilitating fear of spiders. ``I washed my truck every night
before I went to work in case there were webs,'' she said. ``I put
all my clothes in plastic bags and taped duct tape around my doors
so spiders couldn't get in. I thought I was going to have a mental
breakdown. I wasn't living.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve sessions of spider virtual-reality treatment with Dr.
Albert Carlin, a professor of behavioral psychology at the
University of Washington, greatly eased her fear. ``I'm amazed,''
she said, ``because I am doing all this stuff I could never do _
camping, hunting and hiking.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brenda Wiederhold, the director of the Center for Advanced
Multimedia Psychotherapy at the California School of Professional
Psychology, uses a virtual reality system to treat several kinds of
panic and phobia disorders, including fear of flying.
</P>
<P>
   For the treatment at the school, which specializes in training
clinicians, patients sit in real airplane seats wearing the
head-mounted displays that surround them with realistic airplane
interiors. The seats vibrate as the sound of engines is heard.
</P>
<P>
   As the sweat and rapidly beating heart that accompany panic
start to increase, the patient is taught to stop the cascade of
negative thoughts by yelling ``stop'' or by using a distraction
technique like counting back from 1,000 by 7.
</P>
<P>
   Wiederhold also teaches clients how to rein in their anxiety by
taking deep slow breaths to slow pounding hearts and reduce the
sweating.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hodges, an associate professor of computing at the Georgia
Tech College of Computing, developed the fear-of-flying equipment
that Wiederhold uses, and he has created virtual reality software
that allows people to experience thunderstorms. He is also working
on a virtual audience for people who fear public speaking. Using a
system Hodges built, Dr. Barbara Rothbaum, an associate professor
of psychiatry and director of the trauma and anxiety recovery
program at the Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta, conducted a
study of what is known as exposure therapy to treat fear of
heights.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 people who received the treatment all reported a
substantial reduction in their fear of heights, while there was no
improvement among the 7 in a control group, according to the study
results published in The American Journal of Psychiatry in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The systems have also proven useful in treating the lasting
shock caused by violent wartime experiences. For the last year and
a half, Ready, of the Veteran's Administration center in Atlanta,
has been treating those with post-traumatic stress syndrome with
virtual reality on an experimental basis. The work, so far, is
promising in reducing the severity of flashbacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans with stress syndrome put on virtual reality goggles and
re-experience violent wartime events, complete with helicopter
rides, gunfire and jungle walks. During the therapy, Ready
progressively exposes the patient to realistic simulations of the
situations that affected them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a movie director,'' Ready said. ``If a guy says, `I
was walking through the jungle and mortars came in,' I bring in the
mortars with the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   During all 12 of the 90-minute sessions, the experiences
increase in intensity until the patients begin to experience the
stress with increased heart rates and sweating. As the clients
begin to react, Ready talks them through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a flashback, a veteran has both feet in Vietnam,''
Ready said. ``With virtual-reality therapy, he has one foot in
Vietnam and one foot in the laboratory. And he's got a buddy there
talking to him.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ready has seen the severity of the symptoms reduced by a
third in all 10 people who who have completed the training, on par
with other therapies. Early indications are that the effects last
for months.
</P>
<P>
   The realistic nature of virtual reality, the feeling of being
there, is also helping to increase the effectiveness of traditional
kinds of biofeedback.
</P>
<P>
   Alan T. Pope, a researcher at the Langley NASA Research Center
in Langley, Va., has devised a virtual reality system to treat
restricted blood flow to the hands, a problem that afflicts people
with diabetes and Raynaud's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The patient wears sensors on the hand and arm that provide data
to a computer, which converts the information into a simulation of
the blood-vessel network. The three-dimensional blood vessel
graphics are displayed on a computer monitor in a pair of goggles
that the patient wears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see these blood vessels expand and contract in keeping
with the temperature at their fingertips and their pulse,'' Pope
said. Because the subjects are immersed in virtual worlds and their
conscious attention is solely devoted to hand-warming, the task
becomes easier.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-monitoring is one of the most widely used types of
biofeedback for cold extremities, anxiety, migraine and headaches.
And now, the approach with virtual reality gear is being tested at
the Eastern Virginia Medical School and the University of Virginia
for symptoms of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you provide a compelling and engaging display,'' Pope said,
``it's more motivating.'' And, he added, the patients stay with it.

URIAH JONES II, HALL-OF-FAME FENCER, DIES AT 75 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Uriah Jones II, who in 1968 became the first African-American to
make a U.S. Olympic fencing team and who will be inducted into the
U.S. Fencing Hall of Fame on Tuesday, died June 14. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   A staff member at St. Raphael's Hospital in New Haven, Conn.,
who declined to speak for attribution, said Jones apparently died
in the sauna at the YMCA in nearby Hamden, and was taken to the
hospital. Douglas Jones, a son, said the family was told that his
father had suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Jones was ranked fourth in the world among foil
fencers. In 1971, he became the first African-American to win a
U.S. fencing championship. That year he also won an individual
bronze medal and a team gold in the Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999 he was elected to the U.S. Fencing Hall of Fame in
Austin, Texas. His son Douglas planned to fly there Tuesday morning
to accept the award.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Westbrook of New York, who fenced in the last six
Olympics, said Jones, by breaking the color barrier, was a key part
of the sport's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first opens doors, like Jackie Robinson,'' said Westbrook,
who in 1984 became the first African-American fencer to win an
Olympic medal, a bronze. ``Uriah Jones made it easy for other
African-Americans. If fencing was a big sport like baseball, he'd
be a national hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Keim, who was once coached by Jones, said the task was not
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fencing was dominated by white society and by Europeans,''
Keim said. ``Uriah broke into that circle. Nobody knew him. He had
to establish himself. It was tough because of his color, and he got
into fencing at a later age than most people.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Douglas Jones said: ``He was very bitter because he
reached such heights and still had difficulty getting sponsors. It
was a different era.''
</P>
<P>
   Uriah Jones was born Dec. 15, 1924, in Harlem and grew up in New
Rochelle, N.Y. He would watch an Errol Flynn movie with friends,
then fence with them with sticks. As he later described it, ``I was
pretty handy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, after fencing lessons at the New Haven YMCA,
he went to New York for advanced instruction. At one fencing
academy, he said, he was told, ``We don't teach your kind.'' At
Salle Santelli, the celebrated fencing master Giorgio Santelli
welcomed Jones, taught him and allowed him to pay what he could.
Jones later would refer to Santelli as ``my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   He attended Hampton Institute, Cooper Union and Columbia and
became a civil-engineering draftsman for the city of New Haven. He
lived in West Haven.
</P>
<P>
   He was left-handed and one of the first fencers to train with
weights. Edward Ballinger, an Olympic and Salle Santelli teammate,
said: ``He was very impressive looking, big, tall, with muscles. He
was physically intimidating on the fencing strip. He could make
people afraid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was divorced in 1975 and was estranged from his family
afterward. He is survived by his sons, Uriah III of Middletown,
Conn.; Douglas of Essex, Conn.; Jeffrey of Birmingham, Ala.; and
Noah of Westbrook, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Uriah Jones was most proud of breaking a color barrier. He said:
``I have noted, with some satisfaction, that since I retired from
competition in 1973, many of the doors are gone. The sport of
American fencing is better for the changes.'' &QL;

There were July Fourth celebrations in America before the first
firecrackers were imported, in 1787, but the means of revelry _ and
dangers therein _ were different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even while the Revolutionary War raged,'' write  &UR; Warren &LR; 
 &UR; Dotz &LR; ,  &UR; Jack Mingo  &LR; and  &UR; George Moyer &LR;  in ``Firecrackers: The Art
and History'' (Ten Speed; $19.95) soldiers shot their guns into the
air, creating ``a percussive tone that continued into all future
Independence Day celebrations.''
</P>
<P>
   In rural areas, citizens ``shot the anvil,'' placing a
blacksmith's anvil on the ground, covering it with a bag of
gunpowder, topping that with a fuse, and placing another anvil
upside down atop the whole construction. When the fuse was lit,
``everybody scattered. This was to avoid being crushed like a
cartoon character, because the top anvil was propelled into the air
before returning heavily to ground. It was said you could hear the
sound of a good anvil shoot for miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Beware flying hammers and have a safe Fourth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Washington law clerk who consulted &UR; Newt Gingrich &LR; 's online
wedding registry and sent him a congratulatory note and a $2.50
wooden spoon from Williams-Sonoma received a handwritten thank-you
note from the former speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Jason,'' the note began. ``Thank you for your wedding
gift. Callista and I appreciate your thinking of us. Your friend,
Newt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to see that he's observing the social niceties,''
the student,  &UR; Jason Criss &LR; , told the Washington Post. ``I sent the
spoon because I was inspired by the crassness of registering
online. I was amazed that they wanted things as banal as a 12-inch
wooden spoon. It did beg the question: Newt has been through how
many marriages and he still doesn't have a wooden spoon?''
</P>
<P>
   The Post turned to etiquette expert  &UR; Letitia Baldrige &LR; , who
ruled in favor of Gingrich. ``This young man was being a
smart-ass,'' she said, ``spoofing Newt and the wedding registry.
But I think it was lovely of Newt to send a note, even if it's all
a sham.''
</P>
<P>

 &UR; FLASH &LR;

   _ The  &UR; Duchess of York &LR;  told Biography magazine that come fall,
she is moving to Switzerland. Meanwhile, the first female sentry at
Buckingham Palace, Captain  &UR; Cynthia Anderson &LR;  of Australia, stood
guard at a parade on Saturday morning, July 1. Meanwhile, too, four
royal footmen have been suspended after being accused of stealing
crates of champagne after the Queen Mum's 100th birthday party.

   _ The newsletter of the Hoover Institution at Stanford reports
that  &UR; Richard Mellon Scaife &LR; , vehement anti-Clintonite and

   _ Although the actual movie depicts a lot of firepower,
 &UR; Arnold Schwarzenegger &LR;  has refused to appear holding a gun in
publicity posters for ``The Sixth Day,'' reports the Times of

Schwarzenegger, ``we should make a concession.''
</P>

   _ In Sweden, Ikea has attracted new employees with hand-written
help wanted ads on the walls of rest rooms, reports the New York
Times. ``After only four days we had received 60 applications,''
said company spokesman  &UR; Jimmy Ostholm &LR; , ``four or five times what
we would get from a normal newspaper ad. In the toilet, people are
more relaxed and receptive to our message.''

   _  &UR; Nathan Lane &LR;  told Fox news that he will play the lead in a
Broadway production of ``The Producers,'' which is being written by
the movie's screenwriter/director,  &UR; Mel Brooks &LR; . Having played
 &UR; Zero Mostel &LR; 's role in ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum'' and planning to play his role in ``The Producers,'' Lane
said that the big role remaining is Tevye in ``Fiddler on the

NAPSTER LAWYERS ARGUE AGAINST SHUTDOWN PENDING TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Napster, the embattled Internet music startup,
Monday asked a federal judge not to shut down its service,
asserting in a court brief that individual Napster users are doing
nothing illegal by making personal collections of copyrighted music
they download over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief filed in federal court in San Francisco, Napster
lawyers also argued the service enhances record sales rather than
erodes them, an assertion that the record industry strongly
disputes and one that could be central to determining the outcome
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   On July 26, Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of the U.S. District Court
for Northern California is scheduled to consider whether to grant
the recording industry's request for a preliminary injunction that
would shut down Napster pending a trial. The lawsuit is being
closely watched by policy makers and businesses because it may give
some shape to copyright law applied to Internet distribution, a
medium in which data _ in this case legally protected intellectual
property _ can be swapped easily and immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents
the major record labels in the suit, asserts that 1 million
Internet users have downloaded Napster's software and are sharing
millions of files of copyrighted music using the MP3 format. Users
of Napster software swap music files they keep on their home
computers. Napster's Web site merely matches individuals wanting to
swap music; the data transfers flow from one individual's computer
to another's.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry argues that the practice is causing
irreparable damage in the form of lost sales. It is suing Napster
for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement, alleging the
company's technology abets in, and profits from, consumers
infringing copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, Napster's legal team, led by David Boies, who
argued the government's antitrust case against Microsoft, said
people who use Napster are permitted to download files under the
federal Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. Boise said the act
permits copying of files for personal, noncommercial use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a consumer can copy an MP3 file from his or her hard drive
without violating the copyright laws, it is self-evident that
Napster's Internet directory service does not violate the copyright
laws either,'' according to the brief.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, if individual users are not guilty of copyright
infringement then the company cannot be guilty of contributory
infringement, Boise said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the first line of defense in a contributory copyright
case is to assert individual users are not guilty of copyright
infringement. In this instance, the recording industry does not
concede that the Audio Home Recording Act permits such copying.
But, moreover, the industry asserts Napster has created a
commercial enterprise to capitalize on the copying and to promote
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not it is lawful for users to share music one on
one, it is entirely different for a commercial entity to create a
business that induces users to do that,'' said Cary Sherman, the
Recording Industry Association's general counsel, in a statement
Monday. ``Napster cannot hide behind what consumers might be able
to do, individually and on their own, to build its own commercial
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are wielding competing studies to illustrate the
impact of Napster on record sales. According to a survey the
Recording Industry Association commissioned from Field Research
Corp., a San Francisco-based research firm, 22 percent of Napster
users said that because of Napster, they did not buy CDs any more
or they buy fewer CDs.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to a Napster-backed study, prepared by Peter
Fader, associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School of
Business at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 91 percent of Napster users buy as much or more music
than before they used Napster, with 28 percent purchasing more,''
the brief asserts, citing Fader's survey of Napster users.

SAUDI ARABIA ANNOUNCES INCREASE IN OIL PRODUCTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move to bring down stubbornly high oil prices, Saudi
Arabia, the world's largest exporter of crude, announced plans to
increase production by 500,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will go into effect within the next few days ``if
the price doesn't decrease,'' according to a statement from the
Saudi Arabian oil minister quoted by the official Saudi Press
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The unilateral step by the Saudis comes less than two weeks
after the 10-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
of which Saudi Arabia is the de fact leader, decided to increase
production by 708,000 barrels a day, hoping to rein in crude oil
prices that exceeded $30 a barrel. The price of crude instead rose,
driven by the disappointment in the market that the production
increase was not greater, as had been widely expected.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after commodities markets in London
closed, and the first U.S. reaction will only become apparent after
the Independence Day holiday. Analysts said they believe the
increase in output will dampen crude oil prices. The increase most
likely comes too late to affect U.S. gasoline prices this summer,
analysts said, but they are cautiously optimistic that it will push
down prices for heating oil, which have jumped 10 percent in the
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any additional oil supply is good news for the American
consumer,'' said John Felmy, chief economist for the American
Petroleum Institute, a trade group in Washington, D.C. ``But demand
continues to grow, so it's not clear how much prices will
decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The 500,000 barrels a day constitute a small fraction of the 75
million barrels a day the world consumes. Typically, for every $1
decrease in the price of crude oil, there follows a commensurate
2.5 cent decline in the price of gasoline and other petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. market will not see the first of the new oil until
early August, because it usually takes about 40 days for Persian
Gulf crude to reach American ports. By that time, gasoline prices
should be tapering off on their own as vacation season winds down
and people begin to drive less. But the oil would arrive just as
refineries begin to build stocks of heating oil for the winter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Energy Department reported last week that inventories of
distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, were 21 percent
lower than last year. Surging demand for diesel has drawn
distillate out of refineries as quickly as it flowed in, leading to
a rapid rise in heating oil prices. New Saudi oil could ease the
supply crunch and, as a result, help drive heating oil prices
lower, though perhaps only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   But recent production increases by OPEC have failed to reduce
crude oil prices, primarily because robust economies, especially
that of the United States, demand more oil than the cartel has so
far offered. After weathering years of depressed oil prices, OPEC
cut production drastically in March 1999 to boost prices. But once
crude oil surpassed $30 a barrel earlier this year, OPEC came under
pressure from the world's industrialized nations to raise output.
The high crude prices also worried some OPEC members, particularly
Saudi Arabia, which have seen worldwide recessions unfold because
of costly oil.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC increased output significantly this spring, with little
impact on crude prices. When cartel members met again in Vienna 10
days ago, the oil market had been primed for a second increase, on
the order of 1 million barrels a day. It was widely known that
cartel members were producing an estimated 500,000 barrels a day
more than they had agreed to in spring. So an increase of 1 million
barrels a day would have brought on the market an additional
500,000 barrels of new oil.
</P>
<P>
   When OPEC announced a more modest increase of 708,000 barrels
that would release only about 200,000 barrels of new oil, the
market essentially rejected the gesture and crude prices jumped to
more than $32 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC was really surprised that prices went higher after
Vienna,'' said Leonidas Drollas, chief economist with the Centre
for Global Energy Studies, a London research group. ``Most people
expected 1 million barrels a day. That would have been enough for
the soft landing that people had sought. But that seemed a bridge
too far for the hawks in OPEC.''
</P>
<P>
   Those hawkish OPEC members have little to gain by a more
substantial increase. Of the 10 active members, all but three _
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates _ are producing
at full capacity. The other seven countries lose revenues with any
increase in output because they lack the capacity to make up for
the fall in crude prices by pumping more. That may explain why
Saudi Arabia acted swiftly and, apparently, unilaterally, although
in their statement the Saudis said they would raise output ``in
consultation with other producers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers expect Kuwait and the Emirates to also increase
production and contribute to the additional 500,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided decision could increase tensions within the cartel,
but that is unlikely to affect Saudi Arabia's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were getting really antsy about prices not coming down
and about their inability to affect market psychology,'' said Roger
Diwan, managing director of the Petroleum Finance Corp., a
Washington consulting group. ``Now, the Saudis have taken the oil
bull market by the horns and pulled it down.''

 &QL; 
There were July Fourth celebrations in America before the first
firecrackers were imported, in 1787, but the means of revelry _ and
dangers therein _ were different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even while the Revolutionary War raged,'' write  &UR; Warren &LR; 
 &UR; Dotz &LR; ,  &UR; Jack Mingo  &LR; and  &UR; George Moyer &LR;  in ``Firecrackers: The Art
and History'' (Ten Speed; $19.95) soldiers shot their guns into the
air, creating ``a percussive tone that continued into all future
Independence Day celebrations.''
</P>
<P>
   In rural areas, citizens ``shot the anvil,'' placing a
blacksmith's anvil on the ground, covering it with a bag of
gunpowder, topping that with a fuse, and placing another anvil
upside down atop the whole construction. When the fuse was lit,
``everybody scattered. This was to avoid being crushed like a
cartoon character, because the top anvil was propelled into the air
before returning heavily to ground. It was said you could hear the
sound of a good anvil shoot for miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Beware flying hammers and have a safe Fourth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Washington law clerk who consulted &UR; Newt Gingrich &LR; 's online
wedding registry and sent him a congratulatory note and a $2.50
wooden spoon from Williams-Sonoma received a handwritten thank-you
note from the former speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Jason,'' the note began. ``Thank you for your wedding
gift. Callista and I appreciate your thinking of us. Your friend,
Newt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to see that he's observing the social niceties,''
the student,  &UR; Jason Criss &LR; , told the Washington Post. ``I sent the
spoon because I was inspired by the crassness of registering
online. I was amazed that they wanted things as banal as a 12-inch
wooden spoon. It did beg the question: Newt has been through how
many marriages and he still doesn't have a wooden spoon?''
</P>
<P>
   The Post turned to etiquette expert  &UR; Letitia Baldrige &LR; , who
ruled in favor of Gingrich. ``This young man was being a
smart-ass,'' she said, ``spoofing Newt and the wedding registry.
But I think it was lovely of Newt to send a note, even if it's all
a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ The  &UR; Duchess of York &LR;  told Biography magazine that come fall,
she is moving to Switzerland. Meanwhile, the first female sentry at
Buckingham Palace, Captain  &UR; Cynthia Anderson &LR;  of Australia, stood
guard at a parade on Saturday morning, July 1. Meanwhile, too, four
royal footmen have been suspended after being accused of stealing
crates of champagne after the Queen Mum's 100th birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   _ The newsletter of the Hoover Institution at Stanford reports
that  &UR; Richard Mellon Scaife &LR; , vehement anti-Clintonite and
 &UR; Vincent Foster  &LR; conspiracy theorist, has received the first Hoover
Institution Award for Uncommon Commitment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Although the actual movie depicts a lot of firepower,
 &UR; Arnold Schwarzenegger &LR;  has refused to appear holding a gun in
publicity posters for ``The Sixth Day,'' reports the Times of
London. ``If people say movies lead to violence,'' said
Schwarzenegger, ``we should make a concession.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In Sweden, Ikea has attracted new employees with hand-written
help wanted ads on the walls of rest rooms, reports the New York
Times. ``After only four days we had received 60 applications,''
said company spokesman  &UR; Jimmy Ostholm &LR; , ``four or five times what
we would get from a normal newspaper ad. In the toilet, people are
more relaxed and receptive to our message.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Nathan Lane &LR;  told Fox news that he will play the lead in a
Broadway production of ``The Producers,'' which is being written by
the movie's screenwriter/director,  &UR; Mel Brooks &LR; . Having played
 &UR; Zero Mostel &LR; 's role in ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum'' and planning to play his role in ``The Producers,'' Lane
said that the big role remaining is Tevye in ``Fiddler on the
Roof.'' ``And I'm not even Jewish!'' said Lane. Mostel is
``probably in heaven saying, `Cut it out, already, will you?' ''

VICENTE FOX: MEXICO'S PRESIDENT-ELECT NOT ONE TO HIDE HIS
AMBITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert Morris' first name, Dick, in 15th graf.)  
(With MEXICO-ELECTION and related stories) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The confirmation of his election as president of
Mexico was still hours away, the victory real only in the computers
of his pollsters, but Vicente Fox was already three steps down the
road. There would be a quick sip of champagne, a victory speech and
then he would get to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right tomorrow I want to be working,'' Fox told an American
journalist in between nonstop interviews handled over his
ever-present cell phone. ``My hobby is work. It enchants me. I
thoroughly enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who turned 58 on the day that Mexicans elected him the
first president in the nation's modern history from an opposition
party, is nothing if not a man of considerable ambition and energy.
He is a politician who once told his political marketing strategist
to ``sell me'' like any other product.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a prosperous rancher, his career has traversed
business and politics. A manufacturer of cowboy boots and a former
Coca-Cola executive, Fox entered politics by being elected a
congressman and later was a governor.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more than anything else, Fox is a maverick. In
Congress half of his votes followed the line of his conservative,
pro-business party. The other half were leftist positions, many of
which were backed by the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, which he vanquished on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his campaign began, he was careful to manage
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending 70 years of dictatorship will be a great heroic exploit
for Mexico,'' he said, ``something like when you Americans put a
man on the moon. Reaching the moon took a decade of work, and
defeating the ruling party will also require lots of time, talent
and money.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Fox sought to allay fears that turmoil
might result were he to prevail by pledging to form what he has
called a government of transition. After his victory, he reiterated
those promises, extending friendly messages to his rivals and
calling for unity.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as governor of Guanajuato state in central Mexico from
1995 until he resigned to campaign for president, Fox appointed a
woman with ties to the PRI as his state auditor and enlisted the
help of a member of the largest leftist party to devise programs to
benefit rural women.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly the government he will lead will contrast sharply
with those of the 13 consecutive PRI presidents before him, partly
because he is likely to bring his business instincts to the job.
</P>
<P>
   When he formed his campaign team last fall, Fox asked a
headhunting firm to locate superstar executives to act as his top
aides. He is unabashed at using marketing techniques for political
communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me as a product, and figure out how to sell me,'' Fox
said to Francisco Ortiz, the former Procter &AMP; Gamble marketing
wizard he hired to direct his broadcast campaign, Ortiz recalled in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although he ran as the candidate of the center-right National
Action Party, Fox reached out to leftist intellectuals from across
Latin America, and in discussion groups, he demonstrated
considerable political flexibility, according to Jorge Castaneda,
the liberal New York University professor and author who lives here
part time.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were from a different world, ideologically and
socially, and he was learning how to get along,'' Castaneda said.
``These were establishment and leftist intellectuals. They dressed
differently, they liked different things. To put it mildly, he was
not in his element. But he'd sit down and he'd manage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicente Fox is a phenomenon,'' said Dick Morris, the American
political consultant, who worked for Fox. ``This has not been a
situation where the consultant runs the campaign. Fox has a
chemistry with the people of Mexico that is beyond belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on July 2, 1942, in Mexico City, Fox spent his childhood on
an 1,100-acre ranch in San Francisco del Rincon, Guanajuato,
purchased during the Mexican revolution by his paternal
grandfather, an immigrant to Mexico of Irish descent.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Mercedes Quesada, was born in Spain, a legal
impediment for Fox's eventual political ambitions until a clause
barring the children of immigrants from serving as president was
eliminated from the Mexican constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has eight siblings. His father was a prosperous landholder,
although not vastly wealthy in Mexican terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something I'm proud of is that I became good friends with the
children of the smallholders and peasants; with them I shared my
infancy, my playthings, my house and my food,'' he wrote in a
campaign autobiography. ``From that time I began to understand our
country's painful inequalities.''
</P>
<P>
   He was educated by Jesuits, and spent a year at an academy in
Prairie du Chien, Wis., learning among other things how to speak
fluent but accented English.
</P>
<P>
   A devout Catholic, he could be the most unapologetically
religious of Mexico's modern presidents. The governing party that
coalesced after Mexico's 1917 Revolution had a strong anticlerical
bias, and the armies of the revolutionary governments that ruled
during the 1920s carried out a bloody counterinsurgency against
Catholic rebels in the west-central region that surrounds Fox's
birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has expressed historical fascination with the legacy of the
Catholic insurgents, known as Cristeros, and during his campaign
often ended rallies with a Cristero war cry: ``If I advance, follow
me! If I stop, push me! If I retreat, kill me!''
</P>
<P>
   If his predecessors have learned the country's local
idiosyncracies as military men or as government bureaucrats, Fox's
sense for the texture of grassroots life came as a route supervisor
for Coca Cola, where he worked in six cities in seven years. After
his transfer to Mexico City in 1971, he climbed to the top of
Coke's corporate hierarchy, serving as chief executive from 1975 to
1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hated most about those years at Coca-Cola was the time
I had to spend dithering with the government,'' he said recently,
recalling how the president would convene Fox and hundreds of other
business executives to the presidential palace ``so we could listen
to a lot of foolishness.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Coke offered to make Fox the head of its Latin American
operations, which would have required that he move to Miami.
Instead, he quit and returned to Guanajuato to work with his
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The early 1980s saw many peso devaluations, and Fox has said
that the harrowing experience of running a small business with a
chaotic economy helped persuade him of the need for political
change.
</P>
<P>
   During that economic turmoil, Mexico's opposition forces were
achieving their first major victories in local elections in the
north, and in 1988, dozens of entrepreneurs ran for Congress
representing the National Action Party, including Fox.
</P>
<P>
   He won, served one term in the Chamber of Deputies, and ran for
governor in 1991, losing an election marred by fraud. Four years
later he won. Three years into his governorship, he launched his
quest for the presidency.

 &HT;    Here's a fish tale about profanity that got away
 &HT;    By The Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The practical man got blessed out last
week.
</P>
<P>
   By his son.
</P>
<P>
   It happened at the Juno Beach Fishing Pier, but don't get the
practical man wrong. He's no fisherman. His child, however, is wild
to wet a line.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, the practical man has tried to nip the nonsense by telling
him the truth: Fishing's a fool's game. Invest $50 and five hours
and you'll still need luck to come home with 5 pounds of slimy
seafood. But sense doesn't score with a 12-year-old, so the
practical man downed a double-shot of Cuban coffee and headed out
at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The pier offers two ways to waste time: Alive and frozen. If you
pick the latter, you buy a bag of rancid shrimp and spend the day
trying to snag porgies, grunts, toad fish and other bug-eyed bottom
feeders that are so bony or bloodcurdling even a starving man would
snub them. If you go live, you first kill an hour catching a bucket
full of baitfish, which swim in huge schools around the pier. Hook
these juniors on and while away hours waiting for barracudas, blue
runners, bonitos and other prettier but no more appetizing fish to
chomp.
</P>
<P>
   The practical pair went live, and that was where the cussing
came in. No sooner had they and their pier partners started jigging
for bait than boats began to appear. Huge signs warn boaters to
stay 500 feet away, but they held no sway. The mobile fishermen,
pausing before heading out into the open ocean, wanted live bait,
too, and soon a fleet of noble vessels was sauntering within a
stone's throw _ flouting the law and flaunting their wealth. The
pier-bound peasants were not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read the sign!'' one hollered. ``500 feet!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said 500 $%&AMP; feet, (at)$%&AMP;!'' bellowed another.
</P>
<P>
   And it went downhill from there as a cadre of clodhoppers united
and hurled invectives overboard, profanity raining on the boats
like a hail of pitchforks. Until, that is, they started hurling
something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll show those sons of b-----!'' cried one pier-locked looby.
This fellow tied a huge sinker onto his line, shouted ``Merry
Christmas!'' and sent the missile screaming at the nearest boat,
where it clunked the hull with a menacing thunk. His happy cast
brought a cheer from his bumpkin brethren, who immediately began
tying enormous sinkers on their own poles. But the rich-boy brigade
knew how to get even.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a boat, losers!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, (at)$%&AMP;, aren't you my bug man?!''
</P>
<P>
   Gathered into a profane posse, the boaters then vomited a
counterbarrage of vituperation over the pier railing. Meanwhile,
the practical man was trying to decide whom to favor in this
delicate dispute. Should he cast his lot with the peasants, who had
the law on their side but brought the brouhaha to violence? Or
should he embrace the nobles, who seemed to be rubbing their boats
in the bucketheads' noses but nevertheless couldn't fish without
bait?
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough call, but then _ insight. Just as the head sinker
chucker was heaving back to fire another round, the practical man's
son spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he nails those f-----!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you say, boy?!''
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon his son's eyes teared up and he went into mumbling
denial. He hadn't said the f-word, no sir. On the contrary, he had
wished ill on those ``suckers.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical man was tempted to ground his butt and launch a
lecture, but who was he kidding? His kid probably hears 1,000 swear
words a day on TV, in movies, on the radio, from his buddies, from
the practical man himself _ and now in a maritime melee that held
two morals: Pier rats are often as rotten as they look, and money
might buy a 27-foot Mako, but it can't buy class. Surrounded by
these gents, it was hard to blame a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, son. Suckers it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: I am a woman who belongs to an expensive
gym. Every time I'm in there, big lugheaded muscle-brains leave
45-pound weight plates, three thick to a side, on the machines. Can
you fight my cause, Practical Man? Can you explain that it may be
easy for them to hoist those things, but other people resent their
rudeness and that they have to put away their toys?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, the practical man isn't going head-to-head with anyone
who slaps 270 pounds on a barbell and means it. He will, however,
tangle with you.
</P>
<P>
   For about what it costs to join a gym for three months, you
could park a weight set permanently in your garage, where you could
exercise at your own pace, to your own music and not have to worry
about gym giants messing up your routine. For no money at all, you
could get a more than ample workout by doing calisthenics and
running around the block. So, for the love of God, why would you
waste money on a gym?
</P>
<P>
   That's a rhetorical question. The practical man knows the
answer, which is that you, like 90 percent of the population, think
buying something is the solution to every problem. But you can't
buy physical fitness, and if you're knuckleheaded enough to try,
get used to being in line behind lugheaded muscle-brains.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: I have a philosophical question. What is
your stance on personal technology _ cell phones, beepers, e-mail,
answering machines, etc.? Have they made the world a better place,
or worse?
</P>
<P>
   Are you kidding? These gadgets are the crowning achievements of
our age!
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones and beepers keep people connected. Important
communicados can reach you 24 hours a day. Have dinner with your
family, have a heart-to-heart with your child, make love to your
wife and not feel guilty because you're always in touch with what
matters most: The office.
</P>
<P>
   And don't get the practical man started on e-mail. How else
could you live thousands of miles away from family members and
still have a clear conscience? So what if your aging mom pours her
heart out to strangers and hires a handyman to trim her tree? At
least you told her about the weather in Oregon and her grandson's
first steps in that last electronic screed.
</P>
<P>
   JUST KIDDING!
</P>
<P>
   The practical man disses these devices for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, he doesn't need them. On any given day, he knows roughly
where the people he loves are hanging out and how to get in touch
with them, either in person or by phone. He suspects cell phones,
beepers and e-mail would put him at the beck and call of people
he'd rather not hear from, so he'd rather not give them the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Second, they don't bring people together, they keep them apart.
Being close to friends and family means being there with a shoulder
to cry on, a pair of eyes to look into or a strong back to help in
the yard. It doesn't mean electronic small talk. By offering the
illusion of ``keeping in touch,'' e-mail lets loved ones live apart
guilt-free. And by intruding on face-to-face gatherings, cell
phones and beepers keep people from being entirely ``there'' in any
situation, driving a wedge between their victims and the people
they care for the most.

ANALYSIS: TAKING THE ADJECTIVES OUT OF MEXICAN DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MEXICO-ELECTION and related stories.) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ At 11 p.m., with the official returns showing that
Vicente Fox had seized the presidency from the governing party, the
man who went before the nation to concede defeat was not the losing
candidate, but President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had telephoned Fox to congratulate him on ``his
triumph'' and promise him a ``transparent, clean and efficient''
handover on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In another country, a president whose crowning achievement was
to hold an election in which his party was humiliated and driven
from the office it had held for seven decades probably would be
regarded as a flop. But in Mexico, where the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has been in command for seven decades,
the loss of the presidential battle won Zedillo a much greater war
to transform this country into a working democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have shown for all to see that ours is a nation of
free men and women who believe in the means of democracy and law to
achieve progress,'' Zedillo told Mexican viewers astonished by
Fox's showing.
</P>
<P>
   In his six years as president, Zedillo has been dogged in
pursuing the goals of political reform that he set forth early in
his term, knowing that they could ultimately lead his party into a
political winter. Enrique Krauze, a historian of the Mexican
presidency, recalls a meeting at the presidential offices in 1995
at which Zedillo, still fresh in the job, asked Krauze to look over
the draft of the speech in which he would unveil proposals for a
broad change in the Mexican electoral system.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans had long settled for the appearance of democracy.
During decades when the PRI was an untouchable single party, it
held ritual elections every six years. When real political parties
formed in the 1980s to challenge it, the PRI responded with
bribery, influence peddling and sometimes, critics said, outright
fraud to hold onto its power. Zedillo's own rise to office began in
tragedy, the assassination of the nominated PRI candidate in 1994.
In these circumstances, Mexican democracy was always described as
an ``artificial'' or ``useless'' or ``dictatorial'' one.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over his notes, Krauze recalled, Zedillo mused, ``I am
going to take all the adjectives out of Mexican democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, he did. Fox owed his victory in no small
measure to Zedillo. In his inaugural speech in 1994, the new
president had implied deficiencies in his own election and said
that Mexico needed a fairer voting system. Two years later he
pushed those electoral reforms through Congress, often over the
furious objections of the opposition parties, like Fox's, which
eventually benefited from them the most.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms created the independent elections agency that
organized the voting on July 2, the fairest election in Mexico's
history. They also provided for nearly $1 billion in public
financing for the parties' campaigns, so that Fox was able to buy
broadcast advertising time to blanket the country with his message
of change.
</P>
<P>
   All along it was clear that the big loser in the reforms was
Zedillo's own party. His policies amounted to an ultimatum. No
longer was it the domineering PRI elite's job to spread the spoils.
The president wanted the party to work for its votes.
</P>
<P>
   The need for an opening in Mexico was seared into Zedillo's
awareness before he took office. His predecessor, Carlos Salinas,
became president in a 1988 election that most Mexicans believe he
won by fraud. The tainted mandate came back to haunt Salinas after
the end of his term when the currency collapsed and his legacy was
instantly shattered, sending him into exile.

 &HT;    Petty bows out of Jiffy Lube 300
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kyle Petty said a few days ago that it has been difficult
returning to any track since the death of his son Adam.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Petty announced he will not compete in Sunday's
Winston Cup race at New Hampshire International Speedway. Adam
Petty died there May 12 after wrecking in Busch practice. Steve
Grissom, who drives in the Craftsman Truck Series for Petty
Enterprises, will drive for Petty in the No. 44 Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone in New Hampshire will be pulling for the No.
44 or No. 43 (cars of Petty Enterprises) to win this weekend as
much as their own favorite car,'' said Robbie Loomis, the crew
chief for Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom served in the same capacity at the Charlotte race on May
28, but failed to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe everyone can understand Kyle's feelings right now,
and I'm glad I can help out again,'' Grissom said. ``All I want to
do is help out as best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty talked Monday about New Hampshire and about his continued
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at the race track and say that's what killed
Adam,'' Petty said. ``I don't look at the state of New Hampshire
and say that's what killed Adam. I know it could've happened here
or Charlotte or anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I want to go back to New Hampshire? Yeah, I want to, at
some point in time, just to tell everybody that I'm thankful for
everything they did for Adam, thank the doctors or nurses who were
at the hospital with Adam, the guys on the (track) rescue squad.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty has participated in five races since the tragedy and has
received an outpouring of fan support and standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   The racing community also has embraced the veteran driver. Rusty
Wallace even apologized publicly for knocking Petty off the pole
after qualifying at Sears Point.
</P>
<P>
   Other Winston Cup race teams agreed with Petty's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to be in Kyle's situation and go up there,''
Kenny Wallace said. ``None of us could ever relate to his
situation, unless we've been through a tragedy like that ourselves.
My heart just goes out to him and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Loomis worked for Petty Enterprises for nine years, including
the past two as crew chief for No. 43 driver John Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kyle and his family will be missed greatly this weekend,''
Loomis said. ``Anybody in his shoes could imagine how tough it
would've been for him to go up there and race.''

A FEMINIST SURVIVOR WITH THE EYES OF A CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICIA R. LEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Childhood is the first, inescapable political
situation each of us has to negotiate,'' says the writer June
Jordan. ``You are powerless. You are on the wrong side in every
respect. Besides that, there's the size thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a poet and essayist who has written on topics like
apartheid, rape and her mother's suicide, has now ventured into the
territory of childhood with ``Soldier: A Poet's Childhood,''
recently published by Basic &UR;  &LR; Books.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 63, was in New York recently as part of a tour to
promote the book. She is a professor of African-American studies at
the University of California at Berkeley, where she also directs
the Poetry for the People project, a course for Berkeley
undergraduates that includes a program to introduce poetry to local
high school students.
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan is perhaps most identified with the leftist
political battles and feminist foment of the 1960s and '70s, she
has endured as an artistic force. Dozens of people, many of them
young, had to be turned away at a recent reading she gave at New
York University. At that event, Toni Morrison introduced her in a
kind of literary coronation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met June Jordan, my familiarity with the lives of
activists-artists led me to wonder what would shrink first: her art
or her progressive activism,'' she told the audience. Neither has,
Morrison said. Jordan is ``as responsive to slaughter in Baghdad as
she is to rape in the kitchen, as outraged by state lies as she is
made delirious by love,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's oeuvre includes poetry, plays, novels, essays,
children's books and the libretto for John Adams' 1995 opera ``I
Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky.'' While her work
has been criticized at times as politically strident, it has also
been praised as frank and mellifluous.
</P>
<P>
   A brief review by Johanna Berkman for The New York Times faulted
Jordan's 1998 book, ``Affirmative Acts: Political Essays''
(Anchor/Doubleday), for example, for ``a far-fetched attempt to
extract political significance from her oral surgery,'' as well as
``frequent use of the overwrought prose of politically correct
cliche.'' ``Still,'' the reviewer concluded, ``her lyric writing is
a powerful mix of the inspirational and the dispiriting.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan writes by hand at her dining room table. ``Soldier'' was
a sometimes wrenching journey, she said, because many of her
memories were painful. It took three months of reviewing notebook
jottings about characters and structure before she wrote her first
sentence. She decided the best approach was to write the book with
the consciousness of a child, without the filter of adult
perceptions and judgments.
</P>
<P>
   She reports beatings at the hands of her father, Granville
Ivanhoe Jordan, this way: ``Like a growling beast, the roll-away
mahogany doors rumble open, and the light snaps on and a fist
smashes into the side of my head and I am screaming awake: `Daddy!
What did I do?!'
</P>
<P>
   ``And now he lays on a belt, slapping the leather and the buckle
hard against the blankets or my arm exposed by short-sleeve
teddy-bear pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I am trying to cover my face and he tears away the
blankets and I can barely recognize this man, my father.''
</P>
<P>
   There are happier memories, too. She recalls her first date in a
torrent of words: ``And then there was Herbie Wilson Jr. ringing
the bell. And I went to the gate to open it and he was wearing a
tie and a new suit and the old lace-up shoes he always liked to
wear and we went to the city and we watched this play about a white
girl with her Negro `Mammy' looking after her and at one point the
girl uses this huge knife to slice at something on her foot and
that made the biggest impression on me about `Member of the
Wedding' except for afterward when Herbie Wilson Jr. took me to the
Times Square Crossroads Cafe and we sat at this tiny table with a
blue-and-white checkered tablecloth and he ordered strawberry
shortcake for both of us and a bottle of beer for himself and a
glass of milk for me and I felt pretty sure I must look all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said: ``I feel very proud to try to contribute to the
literature on girls. We have a lot about boys. This story of a
black child, a poet, a girl, is claiming space for those various
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan grew up in Harlem and Brooklyn, reading Shakespeare and
Edgar Allan Poe before she turned 5, she says. Her family moved
from a Harlem housing project to the Bedford-Stuyvesant area in
Brooklyn because it seemed like a better place to raise a family.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldier'' is a sparely written kaleidoscope of the young June
at school and at home, learning about love and books, about being
smart and being a girl. She recalls her father's using a pot of
boiling water to scald an annoying, howling cat under their window.
And she remembers savoring the feeling of escape in climbing an
apple tree at Robin Hood Camp in ``the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The memoir ends with her scoring high on an intelligence test
and winning a scholarship to the Northfield School for Girls, (now
the coed Northfield-Mount Hermon School) in Massachusetts. Her
father takes her to Track 22 in Grand Central Terminal and tells
his little soldier, ``You gwine make me proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Mildred Maude Jordan, is depicted in ``Soldier'' as
a mysteriously troubled woman in retreat from herself and the
world. Her mother did not assert herself when her husband beat
their only child or insistently referred to his daughter as ``he,''
Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan does not call her father abusive. He also forced her
to memorize long passages of literature and poetry. The book is
dedicated to him, the man who inadvertently paved the way for her
entry into her own world of words.
</P>
<P>
   That is not what her parents intended, she laughed. Doctors, not
poets, are what first-generation immigrant families want, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's parents came from Jamaica. Her father, a postal clerk,
was half Chinese, a self-taught ``race man'' who admired Marcus
Garvey but made derogatory comments about the darker skin of his
wife and his daughter. Her mother was a nurse. The parents often
fought over money, manners and their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my father,'' Jordan said. ``And he was crazy. He
associated social humiliation with racial identity. He didn't want
what happened to him to happen to me, and it would happen if I was
black and if I was female.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the beatings, she said: ``Anyone can come up with an
adjective, a pejorative. I had committed myself to writing this in
the consciousness of a child, which meant making no judgments. I
hope in a way this is very good news: I'm OK. One can reasonably
say some pretty dire things about my folks, but I love my father.
I'm here to say, I'm here; I'm OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing from a child's perspective was difficult because it
involved shutting out the day-to-day demands of adulthood, said
Jordan, who has a grown son. It was challenging to reconstruct her
life in prose rather than poetry, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was winding up, ready to sing,'' she said. ``I was afraid if
it was poetry, people wouldn't read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing should be a poem,''except that too many people
fear poetry, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   In her Poetry for the People course (Jordan calls it a
``movement''), students study the poetry of three cultures each
year and the ways those cultures shape writers. This year they are
surveying Arab, African-American and Chicano cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only in the African-American segment of poetry that you
find people talking about freedom, over and over again,'' she said.
``Why is that? Why do you find the incredible emphasis on the fact
that you exist, the `I am.' You can't understand that until you
understand the history.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan describes herself as a soldier trying to see the world
anew and report her sightings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that things are changing in a way that is
profound and helpful,'' she said. ``Those of us who have mothers
and fathers who came over here are the children of unlimited
expectations, and those expectations attach themselves to the
abstract idea that is the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, that would be dishonoring what motivated them _
despite extraordinary contempt and disregard'' for who they are in
their adopted land, she said.

 &HT;    FOX FACES DAUNTING TASK OF LEADING MEXICO IN TRANSITION FROM 71
YEARS OF ONE-PARTY STATE
 &HT;    EDS: Story will be updated after Fox-Zedillo meeting ends.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Just hours after toppling the country's ruling
party, president-elect Vicente Fox
</P>
<P>
   rolled up his trademark blue shirtsleeves Monday and began
charting a transition toward Mexico's first opposition federal
government in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   The task will be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   When he takes office Dec. 1, Fox will inherit a troubled country
of stark inequality with a political and social infrastructure that
evolved over 71 years under the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI. That framework includes a federal bureaucracy and
labor unions tied to the PRI which many Mexicans believe are
riddled with corruption and inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Fox met with President Ernesto Zedillo of the defeated ruling
party Monday evening in an unprecedented session designed to
underscore a commitment to a peaceful change of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot fail because we have awakened too many expectations,
too many dreams and desires,'' an ecstatic Fox said Monday in a
Mexico City radio interview after his convincing victory in a
three-way race. With 93 percent of the vote counted, he was nearly
7 percentage point ahead of his second-place PRI opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reiterate my invitation to a government of concordance that
we are going to form, to a unity of Mexican men and women, to an
inclusive project with ideas from everyone, but also for work for
everyone,'' Fox said in a separate televised interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all going to have to work,'' he said. ``Today is barely
the starting point to construct a great nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The president-elect has said he will try to boost job
development with more investment and credit for small businesses.
He has pledged to root out corruption and government ties to drug
trafficking, which has become a sore point between Mexico and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to continue to reach out to Mexican immigrants
in the United States. His plan is a plural government that will
negotiate policies based on ideas from right to left, including
experts from the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton telephoned Fox to congratulate him and later
issued a statement calling the Sunday's elections a ``vivid
testimony to the depth of the democratic commitment of the Mexican
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter, who was on an election
observation mission here, praised speeches Zedillo, Fox and the
losers made after the outcome became clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will set a tone for the next five months of
transition that will be very beneficial for Mexico,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive and rancher, is a member of
Mexico's conservative, free-market National Action Party, or PAN.
But he ran as a broad-based coalition candidate _ under the banner
of the Alliance for Change _ with Mexico's small environmentalist
Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of jubilant street celebrations, analysts compared
the magnitude of Fox's triumph to the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
For seven decades _ a lifetime _ the PRI has controlled the
presidency and most other political offices.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic reforms that have taken effect in recent years _ a
freer press, fairer campaign rules and a new balloting system to
combat fraud _ helped clear the way for an opposition victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fox supporter Cecilia Suarez, 40, a television casting director,
said, ``Thank God we saw change before we die.''
</P>
<P>
   Javier Trevino, a spokesman for defeated PRI candidate Francisco
Labastida, said, ``We have heard the message of the people. We have
heard the message of change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The defeat of the PRI alone is enough to dramatically change
Mexico's political system,'' said political analyst Jose Antonio
Crespo.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's media, less chained but still beholden to the federal
government, will inevitably become more independent, with no clear
master to serve, Crespo said.
</P>
<P>
   A mix of parties in the Mexican Senate and Chamber of Deputies
will provide a democratic balance, Crespo said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has already tried to ``heal'' divisions among all parties,
including Mexico's leftist Democratic Revolution Party, whose
candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas came in third.
</P>
<P>
   In post-election statements, Crespo said, Cardenas was not
especially conciliatory toward Fox. But leftists are already on
Fox's team and others will inevitably join his government, Crespo
said.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious risk for Fox is if Mexicans, especially those of the
left, do not believe his government is dealing satisfactorily with
the country's overwhelming problems of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``An authoritarian regime sometimes generates fantasies that
democracy is a magic wand,'' Crespo said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has raised expectations that corruption might be better
controlled, a difficult task in a country with a tradition of
bribes and low salaries. During his campaign he said he wouldn't
conduct ``witch hunts'' to identify corrupt officials, but would
seek to punish high-profile perpetrators who have raided public
treasuries or consorted with criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between July 3 and Dec. 1,'' Fox said in a pre-election
interview, ``there will be a lot of files burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has assumed a more statesmanlike posture since Sunday night,
taking Zedillo at his word that he will guarantee a smooth,
transparent transition.
</P>
<P>
   Some federal government workers who voted for the PRI said they
feared that if Fox were to win, he would fire massive numbers of
public employees and abolish unions. Some impoverished Mexicans
said they were told Fox would cut welfare benefits for children or
crop subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Fox ran television commercials to counter these rumors. But he
is clear in his goal to improve government subsidy programs to make
them more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   As a PAN governor of Guanajuato state, he streamlined government
and started a system of merit pay on top of salaries, said
University of Guanajuato political analyst Luis Miguel Rionda.

   ``At first the workers reacted with fear. Most people just
wanted guaranteed security, not merit pay,'' Rionda said. But
younger government officials now appear to like the system, which
is viewed as a substitute for arbitrary bonuses that have
traditionally been used in Mexico to threaten workers and guarantee
loyalty to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Government-employee unions linked to the PRI are going to have
to evolve or face competition from independent unions that could
now advance, Rionda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the bureaucracy is still tied to the PRI,
however,'' Rionda said. ``So Fox is going to have to be careful and
try to reach out to them to include them.''
</P>
<P>
   On election night, members of PRI unions and neighborhood
organizations sobbed openly or stood stone-faced when they heard
the news that their party had finally been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI was born in power, so the question is can it
survive,'' said Rionda. The party emerged from the tumult of the
Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910 and raged for another
decade. It has shed its ideological skin many times and slid from
socialism to capitalism whenever global conditions seemed
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said the party he toppled had no ideology at all anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino, a PRI activist in his late 30s, said the party has to
reflect on its future.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of its crushing defeat, he conceded, ``Many people
are shocked. We need to take this as an opportunity for young PRI
members like myself to craft a new message.''

   A random collection of random thoughts because, hey, it's a
holiday. Besides, would you really want to see a whole column on
any of these topics?
</P>
<P>
   _Darva Conger _ you remember: the ever-so-brief bride of ``Who
Wants To Marry a Multimillionaire?'' _ succumbed to Playboy's
blandishments and doffed her duds, so who's next? The wicked women
of ``Survivor?'' The brash babes of ``Big Brother?'' Whatever and
whenever, these (air)brushes with fame will no doubt be handled
with style and good taste to protect the participants', uh,
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   _Envelope, please. The Heights of Hypocrisy Award goes to NBC
for scheduling three hours of previously unaired ``Freaks and
Geeks'' episodes Saturday. ``Freaks'' fans are eternally grateful,
no doubt, but the unmitigated chutzpah of cashing in on the show's
``critical acclaim'' _ NBC uses the term in its promotional
material _ is about as classy as burping at a funeral. If the show
is so good, why was it canceled?
</P>
<P>
   _While we're on the subject of senseless cancellations, it turns
out that ``Sports Night'' will not be resurrected on premium cable.
HBO and ``Sports Night'' creator Aaron Sorkin, who also does ``The
West Wing'' for NBC, couldn't agree on a plan that would let Sorkin
continue writing each episode of ``Sports Night,'' which ABC
canceled after two seasons. 'Tis a pity.
</P>
<P>
   _Football purists are leery about having Dennis Miller in the
``Monday Night Football'' broadcast booth. They seem to think ABC's
telecasts of neckless guys in tight pants committing sanctioned
thuggery is nobler than, say, standup comedy, and therefore
deserving of more specialized commentary. They forget that the late
Howard Cosell, who wrote the book on ``Monday Night Football''
punditry, was an erudite, acerbic non-sportscaster with a gift for
gab and an opinion on everything. So relax, football fans. Now
comes Miller time. Can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   _Sydney Olympics, the local angle: NBC expects to use 16,000
pounds of Starbucks coffee during the summer games, enough to make
320,000 cups of kick-start. (NBC's calculations, not mine.) With
1,800 staffers working the games, that's roughly 178 cups per
employee over three weeks (allowing for setup and take-down), or
8.5 cups a day. No estimate on the number of bathroom breaks.
</P>
<P>
   _Speaking of which, NBC will be testing our bladders by
scheduling only 18 minutes of commercials per hour during the
Sydney Olympics. Four years ago in Atlanta, NBC averaged 19 minutes
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   _Wouldn't want one in the house, and if I see another commercial
for it I may rethink my position on gun control, but Boogie Bass
and its competitor, Big Mouth Billy Bass, are the latest things to
get people around this country buzzing. Go figure. A wriggling,
singing fish-on-plywood is hotter than Britney Spears on a Dallas
sidewalk. Then again, the fish sing better.
</P>
<P>
   _The only thing airing more often than Boogie Bass commercials
last weekend was the ongoing gush fest over Experience Music
Project. MTV and VH1 replaced the print media in fawning over Paul
Allen's monument to American rock with repeated airings of a
program featuring slices of the EMP-launch concerts at Memorial
Stadium. Best Chamber of Commerce moment came when Kurt Loder asked
Richard Patrick of the band Filter: ``Is it worth a trip to
Seattle?'' Patrick's reply: ``Definitely.'' Now can I have my old
MTV back?
</P>
<P>
   _Protesters 1, Dr. Laura O? The TV critics' summer press tour,
which begins Friday in Pasadena, Calif., will have to go on without
Dr. Laura Schlessinger. The tart-tongued radio talker was scheduled
to appear on Day One of the three-week clambake highlighting new
fall fare, but Paramount, the studio producing Schlessinger's
syndicated TV show, opted out. No official reason given, but a
vigorous ``Stop Dr. Laura'' movement by the gay community is happy
to take partial credit. Procter &AMP; Gamble also has decided not to
advertise on the weekday series.

SUICIDE BOMBERS CLAIM AT LEAST 54 IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The death toll rose to at least 54 in Chechnya Monday
from a series of suicide truck bomb attacks that rocked the
war-torn region anew and shattered Russia's claim that its troops
control the rebellious region.
</P>
<P>
   The five nearly simultaneous bombings in four Chechen towns late
Sunday, evidently all part of the rebels' most organized and
deadliest attack in months, came a week after Russia's senior
commander in Chechnya declared that organized Chechen rebel
resistance had been crushed.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the bombings, large trucks loaded with explosives
plowed into buildings that housed Russian troops. Officials said at
least 37 Russian servicemen, 11 civilians and six rebels were
killed. More than 100 people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   In what Russian officials called the deadliest blast, in the
town of Argun in eastern Chechnya, at least 26 Russian servicemen
were killed and 81 were wounded when a truck blew apart a military
dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how the large trucks got past the
many Russian checkpoints dotting roads in Chechnya, although
Chechen drivers say the police manning the posts will let anything
through for a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Russian NTV television showed pictures of grim rescue workers
searching for bodies in the wreckage of a two-story building. The
camera showed two beds fastened to one of the few remaining walls,
overlooking a pile a huge debris-filled crater where the the
building had been.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst setback since early March for the Russian
forces trying to reestablish control over Chechnya, which had been
effectively free of Moscow's control since Russian troops withdrew
after a 1994-96 war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian media quoted a statement by the rebel leader, President
Aslan Maskhadov, saying the rebels' guerrilla tactics ``leave the
Russian troops no chance of establishing control in Chechnya.'' A
Kremlin spokesman warned more bomb attacks were likely, following a
claim by the separatists that they have established two battalions
of suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
   As federal troops Monday cordoned off major Chechen towns and
security troops began a region-wide hunt for rebels, Russia's
senior military commander in Chechnya suggested that part of the
blame may lie with a lack of preparedness among the forces he
commands.
</P>
<P>
   General Gennady Troshev said that he had asked federal forces to
be ``vigilant, especially when it comes to letting big trucks
through the checkpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the commanders fulfilled this request, but
unfortunately, not everything was done well,'' Troshev said on
state-owned ORT television.
</P>
<P>
   It was Troshev who said just last week that the operation in
Chechnya was all but finished. But after more than nine months of
fighting, the Russian military's losses have remained high in
recent weeks as a result of Chechen guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Russian army troops have been pulling out of
Chechnya, gradually handing over control of cities and towns to
Russian police and a loyalist militia under the command of the
loyalist Chechen leader Moscow appointed last month, Akhmad
Kadyrov.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's bombings underlined the predicament of the Russian
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officers say rebel guerrillas take part in isolated
operations, then return to ``civilian'' life. The result is that
Russian troops are not completely safe anywhere in Chechnya. Two of
Sunday's attacks occurred at the center of the Russian presence in
Chechnya _ in Argun, just outside the main military base in the
capital, Grozny, and in Gudermes, the home of the pro-Moscow
Chechen administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some pro-Russian Chechen leaders suggested the time was right to
start talks with the rebels. But Troshev ruled that out. ``There is
only one thing that can be done: to find and destroy them,'' he
said. ``Talks will not help.''

<P>
   MOOREHEAD CITY, N.C. _ On the anniversary of Blackbeard's death,
Phil Masters received a phone call he will never forget.
</P>
<P>
   It was Nov. 26, 1996. His company, Intersal, had just wrapped up
a 10-day search for Blackbeard's ship, Queen Anne's Revenge. He had
returned to his full-time job in New York the day before. Director
of operations Mike Daniels remained in Beaufort for one last day on
the company's last dime.
</P>
<P>
   From the deck of their search boat Pelican, Daniels dialed
Master's number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sitting down?'' he asked. ``The boat broke. She's
sinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Masters remembers saying, ```Well, we did the best we could. Try
to save the boat.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Daniels interrupted laughing, ``Phil, I'm anchored over a
pile of cannons and anchors.''
</P>
<P>
   The pile turned out to be a significant find for underwater
archaeology _ one rich in artifacts. But, in terms of traditional
treasure, the site believed to be Queen Anne's Revenge is a bust.
</P>
<P>
   No one really expected any different. Researchers knew
Blackbeard had time to relieve the ship of valuables. Her allure,
according to Masters, was always in the chase.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for loot is, in essence, what Intersal is all about,
but chests of gold are not what turn Masters on _ he swears. It's
the challenge of piecing together history that motivates him.
</P>
<P>
   That they found the vessel 278 years to the day of Blackbeard's
bloody death near Ocracoke is a sign to Masters that he values
history more than the next guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackbeard wanted us to find him. He knew we would treat him
with respect,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Respect is not a word always used in reference to professional
salvors. An antagonistic history exists between underwater
archaeologists, whose primary concern is preservation, and salvors,
whose primary concern is profit. The most notable argument between
the two camps was the high-profile case of Mel Fisher, whose
company found the Atocha off the coast of Florida, and then fought
the state all the way to the Supreme Court over her multimillion
dollar bounty. Fisher won, but the stink is legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Masters insists that his relationship with the state of North
Carolina is unique. David Moore, site director for the Queen Anne's
Revenge Project and coordinator of maritime archaeology at the N.C.
Maritime Museum, agrees. Despite retaining a permit entitling him
to the majority of the artifacts, Masters gave the wreck over to
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few salvors out there who would have turned
Queen Anne's Revenge over to the state,'' Moore said. ``Now, he
wanted something out of it, which he got, but it's true that it's
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   What Intersal got out of the bargain were two principal rights:
They have the exclusive right to make limited-edition
museum-quality replicas _ not plastic swords. And they own the
media rights.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC had to get Masters' approval before filming a recent
documentary. His deal with the BBC? Intersal gets access to BBC
footage for its own upcoming documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The media attention, in addition to the relationship Masters
maintains with the State Underwater Archaeology Unit (UAU), is good
business. ``Working on Queen Anne's Revenge gave us publicity, it
gave us credibility and it put us on the map,'' he says. ``The
Blackbeard mystique, I call it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Daniels remains devoted to helping the state's Queen
Anne's Revenge Project through a branch of Intersal named MRI,
Masters is on to bigger fish _ namely, the El Salvador. This
18th-century two-masted, 110-ton Spanish vessel is different from
Queen Anne's Revenge in a big way _ she's full of loot. Masters
says research shows the ship sunk near Queen Anne's Revenge with
four chests of gold and three times as many of silver. Intersal
conservatively estimates her value at $124 million, and their
permit from the state entitles them to 75 percent of whatever they
find.
</P>
<P>
   If the site proves positive, Intersal would have to stop, inform
the state, obtain a more specific permit for excavation, hire an
archaeologist, build a lab and develop an archaeology plan approved
by the state. This would take years and between $5 to $10 million
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   But that's nothing compared to what Masters believes has the
potential for being ``the richest treasure of the New World.'' He
is hopeful that undocumented treasure aboard El Salvador could send
her potential payoff into the hundreds of millions.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of treasure is attractive. Three other companies have
permits to search for El Salvador in other areas off North Carolina
. Masters is sure he is in the right place.
</P>
<P>
   ``To blow my own horn, the thing I'm really good at is the
research,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His knack for research certainly helped locate Queen Anne's
Revenge. In the 1980s, hot on the trail of El Salvador, Masters
read a research paper written by Moore, then an East Carolina
University graduate student, on Blackbeard's lost treasures.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, he met with Moore and decided to pursue Queen
Anne's Revenge in addition to El Salvador because of the likelihood
of their proximity to one another. His re-examination of the
research led him to the New York Public Library where he found a
previously overlooked deposition including an eyewitness testimony,
of the sinking of Queen Anne's Revenge in the Beaufort Inlet in
1718.
</P>
<P>
   For the history junkie in him, ``It was a moment even more
exciting than when we actually found the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   If Masters' research skills prove magic again, he may hit it
big. Otherwise, at 63, he isn't giving up. If it's not her,
Intersal has at least 50 more sites in the Beaufort Inlet to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Without a trace of doubt in his voice, he says _ ``She's out
there.''

MILLAR RETAINS LEAD DESPITE CRASHING 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ Tom Steels, a Belgian sponsored by Mapei, won
his second successive stage Monday by sprinting to victory in the
100-mile race from the hospitable town of Loudun to this city in
western France.
</P>
<P>
   David Millar retained the yellow jersey of the overall leader
despite crashing with about a mile left.
</P>
<P>
   Steels was clocked in 3 hours 37 minutes 51 seconds for the ride
along rolling terrain in cool weather.
</P>
<P>
   The same time was given to Marcel Wust, a German sprinter with
the Festina team from Spain, who finished second by inches to
Steels. Erik Zabel, a German with Telekom, was in third place with
the same time as were 22 others.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger pack that finished nine seconds behind included Lance
Armstrong, the defending champion, who is second over all in this
race, and Millar, a Scot with Cofidis and the man ahead of
Armstrong by four seconds after three of the 21 stages.
</P>
<P>
   Millar crashed into a crowd barrier with about 1.5 kilometers to
go and was left behind by the riders charging for the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd lost the yellow jersey there,'' Millar said.
</P>
<P>
   With no teammate inexplicably at his side to assist him, Millar
had trouble slipping the bicycle chain back on its ring so that he
could pedal. Finally he got going again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sprinted all out to catch the pack,'' Millar said.
</P>
<P>
   He did hook on and, since Armstrong was in the same group _ and
not the one that was ahead by nine seconds _ the Scot continues
another day in the leader's jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Jalabert, a Frenchman with ONCE, is third over all, six
seconds behind, and Jan Ullrich, a German with Telekom, is fourth,
seven seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   Millar seems unlikely to be wearing the yellow jersey after a
long team time trial on Tuesday because his Cofidis colleagues have
been working hard the last two days at the head of the pack,
chasing breakaways to protect their leader's edge.
</P>
<P>
   The team time trial, over 43.5 miles, is expected to be the
first big challenge of the 87th Tour and possibly the only one
before the race starts to sort itself out next week in the
Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its imminence, the race against the clock was not a
subject of conversation Monday among the riders. They preferred to
talk soccer, specifically the European Championship, which was won
by France over Italy on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't watch the match,'' said Paul Van Hyfte, a Belgian
with Lotto. ``I don't have any interest in teams from France and
Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was more than willing, however, to discuss the Belgian team
in Euro 2000, an early casualty.
</P>
<P>
   Both Roland Meier, a Swiss with Cofidis, and Jesper Skibby, a
Dane with Memory Card, said that they felt they had more difficult
jobs than the men on the soccer pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have hard work, but it's not an everyday job like this,''
Meier said.
</P>
<P>
   Even less respectful was Wurst, Monday's runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're paid too much money for what they do,'' Wurst
said of soccer players. ``This Euro 2000, they've been going three
and a half weeks and they did 10 hours' work in three weeks. We do
that in two days sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Rodriguez, an American with the Mapei team from Italy,
said: ``I watched it a little bit. It wasn't that interesting to
me. It was more interesting to watch my teammates go crazy.''

BERTELSMANN COMMITMENT TO LYCOS DEAL INTACT, CEO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief executive of German publisher Bertelsmann AG says he
remains committed to a planned alliance with Waltham, Mass. Lycos
Inc., although Bertelsmann's exact obligations were revised
downward last week.
</P>
<P>
   When Lycos and its would-be buyer, Spain's Terra Networks,
announced their merger on May 16, they said Bertelsmann planned to
pay their combined company $1 billion over five years for
advertising and e-commerce services. In a filing June 28, Terra
disclosed that Bertelsmann is only ``obliged'' to pay $325 million
and that Terra's parent, Telefonica SA, would replace up to $675
million worth of orders Bertelsmann might cancel.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Bertelsmann chief executive Thomas
Middelhoff called it ``very, very unlikely'' his company would
spend less than the full $1 billion. He also said Bertelsmann
expects to go ahead with a plan to acquire a stake in Terra Lycos
in three years or so.
</P>
<P>
   But Middelhoff said Lycos chief executive Bob Davis was right to
insist Telefonica guarantee Bertelsmann's payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for (Lycos) shareholders, because nobody knows what
will happen in the next three to four years in the Internet
world,'' Middelhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann's exact role in Terra Lycos has been unclear to
some.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture is counting on access to Bertelsmann's big array
of record and movie studios, books, and magazine titles, all needed
to attract online viewers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bertelsmann is barred from investing in Terra Lycos
directly, under its agreements with America Online, once a close
ally until it moved to buy Time Warner Inc. this year.
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff said Bertelsmann is still committed to paying Lycos
competitor AOL $250 million for advertising over four years, in a
deal announced in March. ``We're best friends,'' he said of America
Online Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Bertelsmann's relationship with Terra Lycos will go further,
he said. ``It's a special kind of alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Terra's filing mentioned various risks for Terra
Lycos it hadn't previously highlighted. One section of the document
was titled ``Risks Related to Being Part of the Telefonica Group.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Terra noted that other Telefonica companies
``could compete with us, and they may pursue their own
Internet-related business.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Telefonica's Argentine telecommunications unit also
runs an Internet portal targeting the same home users Terra Lycos
aims to attract, the filing said.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk is that Internet use in Latin America may grow more
slowly than expected. Terra said it received 73 percent of its
revenue from Latin American operations. And Terra warned its
free-Internet access offerings in Spain, Brazil, Mexico, and other
countries could prove costly.
</P>
<P>
   A Terra representative in New York declined to elaborate on the
details.
</P>
<P>
   Terra also outlined new five-year employment agreements for
senior Lycos executives including Davis, who would be chief
executive of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   Davis would get a base salary and bonus of $500,000, plus a $5
million payment in case of severance. He would also receive options
to acquire 2 million Terra Lycos shares.

DIGITAL SIGNATURE LAW LIKELY TO SPEED UP E-BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The law that President Clinton signed last week allowing
businesses and consumers to seal a wide variety of legally binding
arrangements with electronic rather than handwritten signatures
raised the speed limit on e-business development, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   They project that many enterprises awash in documents,
especially financial services, real estate and government itself,
will accelerate efforts to use computer transactions to limit
paperwork once the law takes effect in October. Such a transition
is expected to save billions of dollars annually in administrative
costs and cut some online transactions _ like setting up a trading
account or applying for a home loan _ from days to minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be taking a look at every place we require signatures on
a case-by-case basis,'' said Greg Gable, a spokesman for Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co., the stock broker. ``Convenience is important, and if
a new capability has value, you can't afford not to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``E-signing,'' as the new process is called, is also expected to
spur a variety of technologies that provide digital variations on
penning one's name on paper, including the use of coded messages,
pen-like styluses or thumbprints on electronic pads, or camera
shots of the signer's face or eye.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal law came after 46 states and many foreign
countries had adopted laws encouraging online deal-making, and many
online businesses have already incorporated such capabilities. So
it may be hard to calculate the immediate financial impact of the
federal law on the major companies supplying such technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It validates the market, but it won't really add to their
revenue in the near term,'' said Mark Fernandes of Merrill Lynch,
who studies companies that provide the software and support
services needed for electronic business.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, because the law is careful not to favor any particular
technology for signing contracts electronically, it does nothing to
alter the scramble for dominance in the new field. The core of the
business for now belongs to a group of companies, including
VeriSign, Entrust Technologies, RSA and Baltimore Technologies,
that provide ways for those doing business online to use coded
messages and electronic ``certificates'' to complete their
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   All of them rely on public key encryption, a technology invented
in the 1970s but not widely used until the e-commerce wave hit the
Internet. Such systems use a combination of public and private
keys, or snippets of numbers, to pass secure messages through a
trusted third party, or certification authority. The system not
only allows a recipient to be assured the message came from the
party that claims to have sent it, but also that it has not been
tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   The digital signature such systems produce looks nothing like a
scrawled John Hancock _ in fact, it is invisible. As a result, many
entrepreneurs are betting that other systems will be used instead
of public-key encryption, or in addition to it, to complete
e-commerce deals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed the bill into law on Friday with a smart card _ a
credit card-sized device programmed to work in combination with a
password furnished by the user. Such systems are already widely
used in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   One company hoping to benefit is Signature-mail.com, based in
Greenwich, Conn., which allows users to attach a picture of their
actual signature to e-mail. The company's founders figure such a
device may well be unacceptable as a legal e-signature since anyone
could hit the computer key to send it and hackers might easily
forge it. Still, says Michael Lloyd, a Signature-mail co-founder,
such a feature might be attractive to companies like VeriSign as an
added element to make their encryption products more consumer
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Silanis Technology Inc. of Montreal already has a business
software program to append visual signatures to documents, but its
software makes it impossible to detach the signature, forward the
document without it or alter the document once it is added. It is
designed for use with the public-key systems. Michael Laurie, vice
president of alliances for Silanis, said that in response to the
new law his company had set up a new business called OnSign.com to
distribute free e-signature software to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Communication Intelligence Corp., based in Redwood Shores,
Calif., and PenOp, a privately held New York company, have also bet
that the human signature may retain a role in e-signing. Both
companies have systems for authenticating who is signing a document
based on how the name is written on a digital pad, but what counts
is the pattern of pressures on the pad they are scanning rather
than the visible shapes _ a form of biometrics.
</P>
<P>
   Others say signatures will be overtaken in many applications by
other biometric attributes that are unique to individuals, such as
digitized thumbprints _ possibly captured by placing thumbs to a
pad on the computer keyboard _ or images of the retina of the eye.
In some applications, people might ``sign'' by speaking, relying on
the computer to recognize their voice or some code word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this legislation is technology neutral, you can use
anything that can be fixed to an individual,'' said Anabella
Hallawell, an analyst for the Gartner Group, a Stamford,
Conn.-based technology consulting and research firm. Hallawell said
she expects strong demand for companies like Valicert that can
manage multiple verification technologies for companies running
e-business sites. Such service providers will also help the
companies keep track of all of the consumer protection requirements
written into the law, such as the restrictions on cutting off
utility service without written notice.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the original public-key encryption companies like
VeriSign and Entrust have long since begun migrating toward
providing a full range of management services to e-business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new law sends a message to the business community that
e-signatures are OK,'' said Kevin Coleman, a specialist on Internet
security issues for KPMG. ``This will be a case of a rising tide
lifting all the boats.''

Dierker weathers Astros' first-to-worst decline
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   For three years, Astros manager Larry Dierker was one of the
smartest men in baseball. Now, he's one of the dumbest.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really, but you'd think so by listening to fans, media
and even some of his players. That's what happens when your team
has the worst record in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   A half-season removed from becoming just the fourth manager to
guide his team to first-place finishes in his first three years,
Dierker finds himself under fire as the leader of a team that has
greatly underachieved.
</P>
<P>
   Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. and general manager Gerry
Hunsicker repeatedly have said Dierker's job security will not be
an issue for the remainder of the season. However, as he does after
each season, McLane will re-evaluate the ballclub from top to
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   While the vote of confidence for the remainder of the season no
doubt was at least partially designed to keep the issue from
becoming a distraction, it's pretty clear there is a faction of the
team that is not in Dierker's corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there is,'' said Dierker, who pitched in the big
leagues for 14 seasons. ``I haven't really sensed it as much as I
assume it. I haven't felt it or seen it. It's nothing that's
tangible, but I have to imagine it's going on. The most difficult
thing when a team is losing or underachieving is that there comes a
time when the players think that maybe there's going to be a
management change.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, it's not a conscious decision, but the teams I
was on like that, it seemed like guys would just be treading water
and waiting for something to happen that would create a fresh
start. Of course, we had hoped that would happen with the (Astros'
recent) coaching changes, but really it's gotten even worse. But I
don't think there's any way to change that, other than to start
winning some games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are wanting a breath of fresh air, something that will
signify that things are going to change or could change,'' Dierker
continued. ``A lot of the teams that I was on, guys were just
waiting for the manager to go, and while they were waiting, they
weren't necessarily playing their best. They weren't consciously
trying not to play their best, but it's just like you're waiting
for something to happen instea of trying to go out and make
something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a bit must happen if the Astros are to avoid setting a
franchise record for losses. While Dierker is the man who led the
Astros to a franchise-record 102 wins in 1998, they are on pace to
lose 106 games this season, which would shatter the franchise mark
of 97 losses, accomplished three times, most recently in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros must go 35-46 over the second half of the season to
avoid the embarrassment of losing 100 games. That would require
playing at a .432 clip, a significant upgrade over their .346
winning percentage during the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, players win and lose games. But the manager
generally gets more credit than he deserves when the team is
winning and more blame than warranted when it is losing.
</P>
<P>
   And while there are differences in philosophy and strategy
between players and managers on every team, they're magnified when
the club is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with the players doesn't seem to be any more difficult
now than it did when we were winning,'' Dierker said. ``They all
have their own wants, needs and desires, whether you're winning or
losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense that there is a greater level of dissatisfaction in
losing, and there's a tendency for people in whatever occupation _
or whether it's their family life or whatever _ when they have
problems to shift the blame or the responsibility away from
themselves and onto others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, this is the ultimate place on a team _ the manager.
And yet I think because I haven't just blown up or gone crazy, it's
been minimal compared to what it could be. But it's still more
compared to if we were winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dierker has yet to blow up on his team, but there have
been a few tense moments with the media, particularly on the most
recent road trip, when the Astros won only two of seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the monotony of losing has made the normally
laid-back manager a bit testy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a little irritable right after games, but I can usually
get that out of my system fairly quickly,'' said Dierker, who spent
18 seasons on the club's broadcast team before taking over as
manager. ``I haven't had any trouble sleeping. After a game is the
worst _ when someone asks me what the level of frustration is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they don't have any way of knowing that everyone has
been asking me that for months. What I thought would be the easiest
part of the job has been the most difficult. Going into this, I
thought the media part would be easy, because I was used to it. But
the same questions over and over again is like torture.''
</P>
<P>
   McLane will have the final say regarding what happens to Dierker
after the season. But whatever happens, it's a safe bet Dierker
will take it in stride. When you've been in the game nearly all
your life, you come to realize managers are hired to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are streaks and slumps in managing just like there are
in playing,'' said Dierker, who has two years and $1.5 million
remaining on his contract after this season. ``When you're
streaking, everything seems to work. And when you're slumping,
you're trying your best to help the team win, but it seems like a
lot of things just backfire. We've had a lot of meetings; we've
tried different lineups; we've had a players-only meeting, coaching
changes. No one is satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   With a record of 28-53, no one should be.

`JOURNEY THROUGH CANCER': A DOCTOR REDEFINING TRADITIONAL MEDICINE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By LAURIE TARKAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With thousands of cancer patients seeking alternative and
complementary medicine, ``The Journey Through Cancer'' seems a
timely addition to the medical bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeremy Geffen, a board-certified oncologist and a
self-described student of Buddhism and Ayurvedic and Tibetan
medicine, lauds the benefits of complementary practices in treating
the person as a whole. But he does not advocate swallowing these
notions and potions instead of proven treatments. The book may
actually have the effect of bringing those who have put all their
hope into alternative practices back into the traditional fold.
</P>
<P>
   At his Geffen Cancer Center in Florida, Geffen and his staff try
to address the emotional and spiritual needs of patients and
provide traditional care. These efforts will sound refreshing for
cancer patients, many of whom feel they are simply cases being run
through a treatment mill. When Geffen asks a woman with advanced
breast cancer how she and her husband were handling things, she
answers, ``No one has ever asked us how we're feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Geffen's writing is more earnest than urbane, his points
are important for patients and their families. The book covers the
seven-level program his patients follow while receiving treatment.
After Geffen explains the basics of cancer and traditional
treatments, establishing himself as an oncologist first, he moves
into less conventional terrain.
</P>
<P>
   In Level 3, for instance, called ``the body as garden,'' he
emphasizes nurturing the body with a healthy diet, lifestyle and
thoughts. The garden metaphor is a distinct departure from viewing
the body as a battleground, the unofficial metaphor for cancer
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   He goes on to discuss how cancer patients tend to run around in
a frenzy trying to treat the disease, never stopping to address
their emotions. Geffen uses scattered studies to support his belief
that ignoring emotions may affect one's survival, though admitting
that it is not proven.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``life assessment'' phase, he moves to the spiritual,
asking questions like ``Why do you want to live?'' and ``What is
the real meaning and purpose of life?'' Since many patients say
that having cancer helped them see what was important in life, this
chapter may help guide those who are ready to consider such
philosophical questions.

 &HT;    WHAT IS ATLANTA?
 &HT;    City a truck, rail powerhouse
 &HT;    Eds: This is the third in a series of five articles.
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Twice a day, almost on cue with the snarling traffic
along the city's highways, hundreds of truck drivers swerve into
Norfolk-Southern's Inman Yard to pick up or drop off containers
full of computers, auto parts and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, some 400 truckers will unload up to four trains, each
about a mile long, loaded with goods headed for malls, factories
and construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   At about 3 p.m, the tide reverses. An equally large stream of
truckers rolls in the Northwest Atlanta railyard, pulling bus-sized
metal boxes packed with consumer goods and other items headed for
every point on the compass, from Asia to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The nightly exodus of intermodal traffic _ cargo carried by
rail, truck and ship _ won't slack off until well after the evening
rush hour ends.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, a hundred Norfolk Southern trains rumble in and out of
Atlanta. Hundreds of carloads of coal come from Virginia and West
Virginia to feed power plants. Auto parts come in from the Midwest
and Mexico and leave Ford's and General Motors' two Atlanta-area
assembly plants as finished GM minivans and Ford Taurus and Mercury
Sable cars.
</P>
<P>
   Trains carrying citrus and vegetables roll in from Florida and
pull out loaded with containers destined for Florida and Central
and South America.
</P>
<P>
   But such tonnage is just the bottom of the iceberg of goods that
flow through Atlanta each day, powering its historic role as the
economic engine of the South.
</P>
<P>
   The tip of that iceberg consists of a relatively tiny pile of
high-value goods _less than a million tons in 1999 _ that came or
went via aircraft at Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In between, trucks carried about $8 out of every $10 worth of
all goods originating in Georgia in 1997, according to a U.S.
Census Bureau survey released last year. Truckers also transported
nearly 90 percent of the 374 million tons shipped from the state
that year, according to the federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta accounted for a lion's share of the state's cargo
movement. The city is a regional power in the physical movement and
distribution of goods. Chicago is the undisputed railroad capital
of the United States, which has the world's richest rail network,
writes Brian Slack in ``Modern Transport Geography.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rickman, superintendent of Norfolk Southern's Georgia
Division, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago is probably the most complex interchange in the United
States,'' he says, with at least 16 railroads large and small
converging on the city. It's ``a real challenge'' to thread rail
traffic through the city, he says. But it's ``still strategically
the best location for interchange'' in the nation, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   But by at least one measure, albeit a rather virtual one,
Atlanta is a global cargo-handling powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say that Atlanta is the largest inland port in the
world,'' says Georgia State University economist Donald Ratajczak,
because its accountants, lawyers and trade financiers handle much
of the paperwork for East Coast ports from Charleston to Fort
Lauderdale. ``We have better access to experts in the particular
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's Atlanta's long history as a trade crossroads, then
as a rail center, then as a major airport hub, that positions the
city well to prosper from the continuing drive toward global
markets and electronic commerce, most experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   Counted directly, transportation workers account for only 6
percent of Atlanta's employees, says Ratajczak. But the city owes
its growth to its role as a transportation and distribution center,
he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a transportation-based metropolitan area,'' he says.
''It's what Atlanta is.''
</P>
<P>
   And will continue to be, he and others say.
</P>
<P>
   On the one front, goods will still go through the same basic
process whether sold over the Internet or a store counter, says
Ratajczak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may make (Atlanta ) more important,'' he says. ``You still
have to move goods. You need distribution centers, and you've got
to account for it. (E-commerce) won't undermine it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the trend toward global production of goods and lowered
trade barriers, such as those under the North American Free Trade
Agreement, mean more shipping of parts and finished products, says
Jean-Paul Rodrigue, a geography professor at Hofstra University who
studies globalization's role behind the current transport boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about Detroit. In the past, all the cars and parts came
from within the region,'' he says. ``Today, it's global. You have
thousands of parts from all over the continent and all over the
world, and of course that has to be shipped,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the volume of intermodal cargo shipped between Asia,
the United States and Europe continues to grow rapidly, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   All those trends point toward more shipping activity in the
future, and ``Atlanta will manage that freight,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Norfolk Southern expects more intermodal traffic to hit
Atlanta, its second busiest intermodal hub, this fall from Europe
via Savannah's port, says Norfolk Southern's Rickman.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad plans to add a daily train that will handle
intermodal shipments between Savannah and Atlanta, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the growing intermodal traffic at Norfolk
Southern's Atlanta operations, the railroad is spending $95 million
on a new intermodal yard near Austell.
</P>
<P>
   The new yard will double Norfolk Southern's intermodal capacity
in the Atlanta area when it opens next year, says Rickman.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the new yard, plus regularly scheduled train
departures much like those at Atlanta's airport, have helped
Norfolk Southern regain customers it lost in the past to other
truck and rail carriers, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (tell customers) that if we can bring it into Atlanta, we
can move it a lot quicker,'' he says.

 &HT;    SHEER CHARISMA AND A RESONATING MESSAGE CARRIED FOX TO VICTORY
IN MEXICO
 &HT;    EDS: Revises 19th graf ( ``Born into an agricultural. . .'') to
reflect Fox is separated from his wife.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Three years ago, Vicente Fox Quesada had already
violated the norms of Mexico's once stuffy and predictable
political scene.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly six-foot-six rancher and former Coca-Cola executive
from the Mexican province of Guanajuato was already unabashedly
running for president. With an obsession to drive Mexico's ruling
party from power after its 71-year reign, he refused to wait for
his own political party to anoint him in a smoke-filled room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to win,'' Fox fumed, obviously impatient to get an
early start on what would become the most competitive and
electrifying presidential campaign Mexicans can remember.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Fox's quest came true when Mexicans handed him an
historic victory that will put him in Los Pinos, (the Pines), the
Mexican White House on Dec. 1. His conservative National Action
Party, or PAN, will take the reins of power in a center-right
coalition from Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans had a date with history,'' Fox, who turned 58 on
Sunday, told teary-eyed followers. ``We crossed that bridge to a
change in power in a peaceful and legal way. Today we are on the
other side of that bridge and a new road begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The descendent of Spanish and Irish immigrants, Fox is a
multi-faceted personality whose overwhelming charisma helped him
make history. The PRI tried to portray him in scathing television
ads as an uncouth, unpatriotic loudmouth, but in the end his sheer
magnetism and pledge to bring change carried him to victory.
</P>
<P>
   These same characteristics could help his presidency, but they
could rub the wrong way in negotiations with other parties in the
plural government Fox wants to form, said University of Guanajuato
political analyst Luis Miguel Rionda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a natural leader and he enjoys it. He's passionate. But
he can't let those passions run away with things,'' Rionda said,
crediting Fox with usually working well with other parties while he
was governor. ``One of his biggest risks is losing patience. Others
can be pretty impatient, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fear Fox has an authoritarian streak, but he's also viewed
as extremely pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   He was a powerhouse on the campaign trail, often wearing his
trademark black leather cowboy boots and huge silver belt buckle
emblazoned ``FOX.''
</P>
<P>
   He connected with working-class people and young voters who
didn't mind the way he trashed the PRI _ he sometimes employed
obscenities _ and actually admired him for being stubborn. He
connected with farmers, who sensed he knew what he was talking
about when he spoke about running an agricultural business.
</P>
<P>
   When he put on an elegant suit, he connected with entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire for change was overwhelming and we positioned Fox
as the one to do that,'' said Francisco Ortiz, who ran Fox's media
campaign. Three years ago Fox probably didn't have more than a 40
percent name recognition, Ortiz said. By September of last year he
had risen to almost 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a month into the official campaign season, Fox's
team coined his slogan, ``Ya!,'' which means either ``Now!'' or
``Enough!'' in Spanish. He also employed a victory sign shaped into
the word Ya to emphasize Mexicans being fed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really loved that,'' Ortiz said
</P>
<P>
   Fox did an admirable job, too, at turning blunders into
attributes.
</P>
<P>
   He bickered at one crucial point with rival candidates over when
to hold a debate, repeatedly telling them ``today, today, today''
on live television. But after he was declared by much of the press
as the winner of the actual debate, he turned ``today, today,
today'' into a war cry at rallies.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, he admitted he was stubborn, but said a
leader needs to be stubborn to ``get rid of 70 years of corruption,
poverty and desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into an agricultural business family, Fox was educated by
Jesuits and is a strong Catholic. He is staunchly anti-abortion,
which is illegal in Mexico except for special circumstances, but he
has vowed not make abortion an issue. He has four adopted children
and is separated from his wife, something some PRI activists tried
to use to question both his masculinity and his commitment to
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three close friends who told me they were offered money
to offer bad information about me,'' Fox said in an interview
during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He studied business courses at Harvard and for 15 years he
worked for the Coca-Cola Co., eventually becoming president for
Latin America until he resigned in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with Coca-Cola, the most competitive business in the
world,'' he said. On the campaign trail, he quaffed mostly
Gatorade, but also enjoyed the occasional Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's presidential style could mark an enormous departure in a
country where elected officials have been insulated from the
public. Although he's equally at home wearing a suit and traveling
to meet representatives of foreign powers _ he plans to visit the
United States and other countries before December _ he likes being
out in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Rionda said as chief executive Fox will have to curb that
tendency at some point simply because of the daily demands of the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't be like presidents of Mexico during the 1930s, like
Lazaro Cardenas, who went from town to town riding around on a
horse,'' Rionda said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is proud of his record as a governor who was rarely in his
office, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only went to my governor's office in Guanajuato four times
in four years,'' he said. ``The governor's job is to be out with
people to inspire them and make them enthusiastic.''

 &HT;    These cheerleaders yell for more than teams
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - There are a few unwritten rules at the
Fellowship for Christian Cheerleaders camp: Don't say it if you can
shout it. Don't sit if you can stand. And don't stand if you can
jump up and down.
</P>
<P>
   So when a camp counselor asks the 200 10- to 18-year-old girls
sitting on the floor of the Palm Beach Atlantic College gymnasium
if they're ready to work on some stunts, they stand up, leap into
the air and shout: ``Bring it on, baby! Bring it on!''
</P>
<P>
   For a teenage Christian cheerleader, that's ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the pretty girls you knew in high school. The popular
girls, the prom queens who are involved in everything and speak
with exclamation points. The difference for the nation's 6,000 FCC
members is that they cheer not just for their football teams but
for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The girls, mainly from Christian schools, come from as far away
as Iowa and as close as West Palm Beach to attend the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal is to teach the girls to accept Jesus Christ as
their personal savior,'' says Cynthia Morrison, who directs the
camp. The day begins with devotions, packs in some flipping,
tumbling and jumping, and ends with skits about prayers and
humility.
</P>
<P>
   Humility is a theme that runs through the four-day camp. Campers
are told that as cheerleaders they will be looked up to and
admired, but they shouldn't let that popularity go to their heads.
``It's not about you. God has given you these talents,'' Morrison
repeatedly tells the girls. ``You are this way because God made you
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   With her face sparkling with glitter, her baby-blue eyeliner
accenting her blue eyes and her blond hair tied back in pigtails,
Paige Armstrong is the epitome of cheerleading perfection. She is
the 5-foot-2, 110-pound ``flier'' who leaps out of her teammates'
arms, twists into the air and lands in their catch without ever
losing her smile. She is 17, the national cheerleader of the year
and she wears a P.U.S.H. bracelet on her left wrist (Pray Until
Something Happens). She's hoping for a full cheerleading
scholarship to the University of Alabama, and with her 4.0 grade
point average, she'll probably get it.
</P>
<P>
   What is the main gripe of cheerleaders, Christian or otherwise?
``There's never, never enough respect,'' says Armstrong. ``No one
will ever understand how much hard work cheerleading is until they
come to one of our practices.''
</P>
<P>
   But being a cheerleader at a Christian school has its
advantages. ``We're not just the peppy, popular squad; we're the
squad that wants to go out and minister. We have spirit. Not just
spirit like pep, but the spirit of God.''

7-ON-7 FOOTBALL BECOMING A HOT SPORT IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK MAUCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Gaby can't wait for Saturday morning. Come dawn, he's up
to face the day _ and defenses bent on making his day miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby, a Keller receiver, is one of many high school players
across Texas who has fallen in love with seven-on-seven football.
From Lake Worth to Houston, players such as Gaby are participating
in off-season tournaments each week with hopes of capturing a state
championship in College Station on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wake up early on Saturday and meet at 7 a.m. and can't
wait to get out there and play,'' Gaby said after his team won the
championship of the Cedar Hill Tournament last month.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-on-seven football became popular in the mid-1990s after
the Legislature removed University Interscholastic League
restrictions on the number of teammates who could compete on a
summer team without the supervision of a coach. Previously, no more
than four teammates could compete together during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's origins mimic a training method used by California
high school football players, where seven players take the field
without pads and pass, pass, pass in a game of touch football.
Meanwhile, seven players on defense try to stop them from going the
length of the field _ 45 yards _ for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   UIL rules prevent coaches for grades 7-12 from supervising the
athletes, and players are responsible for their own entry fees into
any off-season program. The rules are designed to keep the
activities voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, however, can organize tournaments and contests, which
usually start in May and are played on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they \Rthe players\S are not under the jurisdiction
of a coach, they can put together as many players as they want on a
team,'' Bill Farney, UIL director, said.
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine and Carroll were among the first programs to play
seven-on-seven football in Texas, beginning shortly after the
participation rules changed in 1995. Carroll defeated Grapevine,
47-33, and was crowned the first state champion in the sport in
1998 by Fox Sports Net, which helps organize the state tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   State tournament director Bobby Burton, who runs the Web site
Rivals100.com and is a broadcaster for Fox, said the network
anticipated the increasing popularity of seven-on-seven football.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the network helped take the sport beyond off-season
training and into a competition that would give statewide bragging
rights to players who won the annual championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years and two months ago, Jon Heidtke \Rgeneral manager
of Fox Sports Net \S and I sat down and talked about how popular
this was becoming and how we could take this event to a central
site,'' Burton said. ``We had visions, sure, but this thing has
really grown faster than even we hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's state tournament, July 21-22, will have 64 teams,
its largest field yet]. It will feature both championship and
consolation divisions of 32 teams for the first time. The first
tournament in 1998 featured 32 teams and last year's had 48 in the
field, won by North Mesquite over Lake Worth, 31-26.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 11 Fort Worth-area teams have qualified for the state
tournament this year. They are Grapevine, Marcus, Lamar,
Colleyville Heritage, Keller, Grand Prairie, Martin, Carroll,
Stephenville, Brownwood and Celina.
</P>
<P>
   Teams qualify for the state tournament by winning or being one
of two teams to survive selected tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Burton anticipates about 5,000 spectators for the state
tournament at Kyle Field, the largest attendance to date.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing popularity of the sport is largely being driven
by one thing, Burton said: The kids are having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is these guys are having a great time. It
gives football players something to do other than just train,''
Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, weekend competition for the state tournament hasn't
been enough to satisfy many players. Several programs are forming
leagues with other area schools and playing a weekly round-robin
competition on weeknights.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the weekly leagues are cheaper, said Scott Peach, a former
assistant coach for Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tournaments got so expensive. Every one we wanted to go to
was $15 a kid,'' said Peach, who recently became Sam Houston's
offensive coordinator. ``By putting together a league, the kids get
to play for free. It's still a good idea to play in some
tournaments, especially if you want to qualify for state, but to
the coaches the state tournament is no big deal. We're interested
in the kids getting the reps and the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller assistant coach/passing coordinator Brian Hart said
coach-less football, where players have to make all of the on-field
decisions, is one of the other reasons the sport is popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are out there making decisions, helping each other out.
That's big come September,'' Hart said. ``It's the key to winning
close games.''
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine quarterback Richard Bartel is playing seven-on-seven
for a second season. At one point this year, the Mustangs won 23
consecutive games and three consecutive tournaments, all of which
makes playing even more enjoyable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be running drills and lifting weights or we can be
out doing this, which do you think we'd rather be doing?'' Bartel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Worth coach Percy Whitmire said he would have his team
participate even if it weren't pass oriented. The sport gives small
schools such as his a chance to get some off-season training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It especially helps the littler schools like those in 3A,
where we don't have spring practices,'' Whitmire said.
</P>
<P>
   Farney warns players and coaches not to get too caught up in the
seven-on-seven hype. He said the UIL is behind the sport as long as
it stays within the rules, and he's still pondering whether the
state tournament is good for the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we're seeing is more pressure on coaches to see
their kids compete and that puts more pressure on the kids,''
Farney said. ``We hear reports of coaches picking teams and telling
kids they have to play. But any time a youngster is able to do this
at his own will and they and the parents have a choice, we're OK
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the sport is here to stay. He already is thinking of
ways to expand participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about going to 128 teams for the state tournament
and maybe going to 5A, 4A and 3A and below divisions,'' Burton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Is a national seven-on-seven tournament on the horizon?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the inaugural ones to have a state champion \Rin
Texas\S. Arkansas has thought about trying it, and Colorado has a
state camp that Grapevine has gone to,'' Burton said. ``I'd say a
national championship would be a ways down the road, if ever. But
who knows?''

GORE HEAPS CRITICISM ON DRUG COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>
  By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAYTON, Mo. _ Vice President Al Gore accused drug companies
Monday of ``price-gouging'' and ``special interest schemes'' to
keep drug prices high and he pledged to a crowd of elderly people
that he would ``fight for you, not for the powerful drug
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance at a community center in this swing state
began a weeklong drive to highlight an issue that has emerged as
one of the most potent this election season: the spiraling cost of
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president worked to tie his opponent, Gov. George W.
Bush, and the Republicans in Congress to the drug industry. ``It is
not all that complicated,'' he said at a news conference.
``Governor Bush is with the big pharmaceutical companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also claimed that the drug companies had written the House
Republicans' recently passed bill that provides a prescription drug
benefit for Medicare recipients. The Republican bill would rely on
private insurance companies to sell drug coverage to the elderly,
backed by government subsidies and incentives. ``I think they
crafted the actual words,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats support a more expansive measure, relying directly
on the Medicare system. Bush generally supports the House
Republicans' plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a history of taking on the drug companies, dating to
his years in Congress, although some of his friends and advisers
now represent the pharmaceutical industry as lobbyists. His
campaign believes the issue allows him to draw a sharp contrast
with Bush, who received more campaign contributions from the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Campaign Study Group, a nonpartisan research
organization, Republican Party committees have received $4 million
in unregulated ``soft money'' contributions from pharmaceutical
companies since January 1999, while Democrats have received $1.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Gore's speech, the Bush campaign released a
statement by Rep. James M. Talent, R-Mo., charging that the Clinton
administration had been ``an obstacle'' to overhauling Medicare.
``After eight years of failing to propose a solution, the vice
president is now saying he wants reform.''
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Democrats have put the cost of prescription
drugs for the elderly at the top of their agenda. With drug prices
rising faster than the rate of inflation, President Clinton a year
ago proposed an expansion of the 34-year-old Medicare program to
cover drugs. House Democrats have been riding the issue hard in
their quest to regain control of the House _ running bus trips for
the elderly to Canada and Mexico, where drug prices are lower.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader from Missouri, was at
Gore's side Monday and said House Democrats would campaign on the
issue across the country this week.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans originally denounced Clinton's plan as a costly
expansion of a program that already faced fiscal difficulties and
said they would not take it up unless it was part of a broader
overhaul of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But trying to blunt the Democrats' drive, House Republicans
pushed through on a near party-line vote their own $40 billion
measure just before the July 4 recess, changing the debate to which
party's plan is better. John Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert, said Republican House members were also told to
conduct town meetings this week to promote their plan.
</P>
<P>
   Feehery said the Republican bill avoids ``a government takeover
of health care'' and does not rely on a ``huge government
bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore pointed to assertions by insurance companies that the
Republican bill would not work. ``It's a misnomer,'' he said of the
Republican legislation. ``It's nothing. It doesn't work.'' He said
the Republican bill reminded him of a story about a veterinarian
and taxidermist who ``go into work together and they put up a sign
saying, `Either way you get your dog back.''' He added, ``There is
a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore heard stories from hard-pressed elderly, including a woman
who told of buying 16 boxes of macaroni and cheese dinners because
they cost only $4, saving her money for medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been eating macaroni and cheese for every meal?'' Gore
prompted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can save a little bit of it for the next day too,'' said
Jacqueline Steele Johnson, 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to have a system where you are completely at the
mercy of the big drug companies and no one is standing up for
you,'' Gore said. ``I want to stand up for you.'' He said the drug
companies had too much power over drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore singled out for criticism the manufacturer of Claritin, the
Schering-Plough Corp., because of a provision circulating in
Congress to extend the patent for the top-selling allergy
medication. He said drug patents were not intended to create a
situation ``where we can be just exploited forever by the wealthy
and the powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the Democratic and Republican approaches
on prescription drugs involves both philosophy and detail. The
Democrats rely on the Medicare program, while the Republicans rely
on incentives to private insurers to sell policies to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plan, the government would set the
parameters of a standard drug policy for the elderly, but premiums
and co-payments could vary from one private drug plan to another as
long as the overall values met the government standard. The plan
envisions premiums of $35 to $40 a month. After a $250 deductible,
the policies would pay for half of a recipient's annual drug costs,
up to $2,100.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, like other Democrats, has proposed a more generous benefit
than the Republicans, which would cost $255 billion over a decade.
It would carry no deductible and would cover half of the costs of
drugs, up to $5,000. The premium would start at $25 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's plan and the House Republicans' plan would
both contain subsides for low-income seniors and protections for
those with high drug costs. The Republican plan would provide 100
percent drug-cost coverage after an individual's out-of-pocket
costs reached $6,000. Gore's plan would pay for all expenses after
out-of-pocket costs reached $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry is the second industry Gore has gone after in
recent weeks, having just finished a series of broadsides against
the oil companies. Today, he hailed news that Saudi Arabia was
raising oil production and called on the ``big oil companies'' to
pass along price reductions. ``We need some significant relief,''
he said.

MEXICAN POLITICAL MACHINE DEPENDENT ON POWER LOSES ITS POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (with MEXICO-ELECTION) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has
governed Mexico since 1929, was formed to bring order out of the
chaos of the Mexican Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Its hallmarks were an iron hand, military discipline, and total
control wielded by a maximum leader, the president. It used
political force and fraud to win elections, from the smallest
mayoralty to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It became a machine designed to keep itself in power, many
Mexican and American historians say. By the 1990s, the party had
been in power for so long that it became indistinguishable from
power itself.
</P>
<P>
   An endless succession of new presidents _ each chosen by the
previous one _ made the government, the party and the president
synonymous. This process of choosing the new leaders was called
``el dedazo'' _ tapping the candidate _ and Mexicans joked bitterly
that they lived under ``dedazocracy,'' not democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Without the presidency and its perquisites, which traditionally
included millions of dollars in political funds, the party is a
machine without its engine, its fuel, its oil and grease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party had become a mindless tool of the president,'' said
John Bailey, a professor of government at Georgetown University in
Washington. ``What held it together was winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the presidency is lost, and the party may be lost without
it. Out of power, the party may fly apart, break into factions and
cease to exist in its present form, Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Historians often point out that the name of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party contains a contradiction. The party's many
critics say it has lost its old political ideals and simply become
an institution.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first half of its life, from the 1930s into the
1960s, the party's ideals were alive. The PRI, as it is called,
created something out of nothing: it made modern Mexico. It built
roads, schools, hospitals and libraries. It gave land to the poor.
It nationalized Mexico's oil. It gave power to labor unions and
money to peasant groups and received loyalty in return. Through the
1960s, Mexicans had a stable economy and a strong peso, though
millions remained dirt poor.
</P>
<P>
   The party made a peaceful transition from military rule to
civilian power in the 1930s. Ever since, Mexico has been free of
the military coups and dictatorships that have made life miserable
in so many Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
   A turning point came, though, when the government turned its
guns on protesting students in 1968 in the Mexico City neighborhood
of Tlatelolco. Hundreds died. Mexicans today compare the massacre
to the 1989 killings in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. What happened
in Tlatelolco is still shrouded in official secrecy. But it left
millions of Mexicans believing that the governing party would use
violence, rather than voluntary reform, to preserve its power.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, when President Jose Lopez Portillo ran the
economy aground and nationalized the banks, his missteps gave rise
to the National Action Party, which began winning elections across
Mexico. That led to a pattern of apparent election fraud by the
governing party.
</P>
<P>
   When a mysterious computer breakdown appeared to alter the
results of the 1988 presidential elections, giving victory to the
governing party, millions more came to believe that it would steal
an election to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, political killings, an economic crisis and a
succession of corruption cases suggested that the old order in the
party was decaying. In 1994, its presidential candidate, Luis
Donaldo Colosio, appeared to break with the old guard, including
President Carlos Salinas, promising sweeping reforms that would
separate the party from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Colosio was assassinated on the campaign trail, a killing whose
intellectual authorship remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign manager, Ernesto Zedillo, received the dedazo from
Salinas. He would be the last so chosen. To the praise of all but
the party stalwarts, he ended the dedazo and consolidated political
and electoral changes that opened up the system. Those reforms led
on Sunday to the cleanest election in Mexican history, the National
Action Party's victory and the governing party's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Election returns and polling data suggest that millions of
young, educated and globally minded Mexicans voted against the
party in the belief that the nation would never be a modern
democracy while in the grip of the party's old guard.
</P>
<P>
   And no less an authority than Colosio seemed to have believed
that something sinister thrived behind the closed doors of the old
regime.
</P>
<P>
   According to the historian Enrique Krauze's definitive ``Mexico:
Biography of Power'' (HarperCollins, 1997), Colosio was asked
shortly before his death what he thought of Salinas and his circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen `The Godfather?''' he replied.

LEADERS OF TEACHERS UNIONS DENOUNCE FOCUS ON TESTING
</HEADLINE>
  By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA &UR;  &LR; _ The leaders of the nation's two teachers unions
harshly criticized the movement to raise academic standards in
public schools &UR;  &LR; Monday, saying in separate speeches that
politicians and educators should focus more on developing a
challenging curriculum and less on testing students.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the American Federation of Teachers biennial convention
here Monday morning, Sandra Feldman, the president, said her
members were the only professionals expected to invent ``their most
basic tools'' while practicing their craft and called for a
national consortium to develop curriculum on all subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 800 miles away in Chicago, Robert Chase, the president of
the National Education Association, told some 10,000 convention
delegates that enactment of standards had been ``absurd'' and
``perverse'' in some cases and urged ``a massive infusion of common
sense _ common sense based on real classroom experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase and Feldman said they continued to support the drive for
higher standards that has swept statehouses and schoolhouses in the
last decade. But they also said they have begun to worry about a
backlash against the high-stakes standardized tests intended to
monitor progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``State standards do not curricula make,'' Feldman told some
4,000 school employees gathered at the gleaming Pennsylvania
Convention Center. ``No test, no matter how good _ and all too many
of them are not _ can possibly capture the sum of education, let
alone be a substitute for real education.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the federal government is prohibited by law
from writing curriculum, Feldman proposed that the Department of
Education invite states into a consortium that would solicit plans
to develop and evaluate curriculum and educational software.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Feldman's speech, Richard W. Riley, the
secretary of education, told a group at the convention that he
would host a national forum to address the alignment of curriculum
with the new standards and tests.
</P>
<P>
   Riley also expressed support for Feldman's proposal, made public
today, to create a ``transitional'' year of high school to help
teenagers who lack basic skills in reading and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said states and local districts have abandoned
curriculum development, handing teachers thick sets of
``frameworks,'' which offer guidelines of what children should
know, but no map to get there. She also said there should be more
uniformity in what is taught nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arithmetic in the third grade in Georgia, kids should be
taught at the same level as third-grade arithmetic in California or
New York,'' she told reporters after her speech.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, too, complained that teachers were ``being required to
teach an entirely new curriculum without textbooks or other
resources _ or without training,'' according to a text of his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted a teacher who wrote to him, saying, ``I have never
been so overwhelmed in my 32 years of teaching,'' adding that
``testing mania'' was overtaking schools ``like some
education-eating bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase also criticized some of the standards themselves, such as
California's requirement that fifth-graders memorize the elements
of the periodic table and Virginia's expectation that third-graders
should be able to ``describe the ancient civilizations of Greece
and Rome in terms of geographic features, government, agriculture,
music, art, religion, sports and roles of men, women and
children.''
</P>
<P>
   During a discussion of the standards movement among American
Federation of Teachers delegates, several teachers described how
these problems played out locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourth-grade teachers want transfers _ they don't want to
teach fourth grade anymore,'' said Jeffrey Rozran, president of the
union's local in Syosset, N.Y. ``For those of you who don't know,
fourth grade is the testing year.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Spence, a geometry teacher in Volusia County, Fla.,
proudly said that no schools in his district received failing
grades under the state's new accountability system, then admitted:
``We all taught to the test. I'm kind of embarrassed to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers called for increased professional development
around the new standards, and Maryann Graczyk, president of the
union in Mississippi, received an enormous ovation when she said
teachers needed more parental support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They vote in the survey they want standards,'' she said. ``Try
sending more homework home. Try keeping them after school for
remediation. Try getting them to pay as much attention to math,
science or all the academic areas as they do to football,
basketball or cheerleading.''
</P>
<P>
   At both conventions, the coming presidential election loomed
large, with many delegates wearing political buttons and several
speakers urging support for Vice President Al Gore, who is
scheduled to address each group this week. Though Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican nominee, has made public
education a focus of his campaign, Feldman said his real goal was
to ``demonize it, starve it and privatize it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our choice is very clear,'' Feldman. ``The outcome is not. And
that is why it is so important to vote and get out the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Federation of Teachers has more than 1 million
members, the National Education Association some 2.5 million. Both
unions support Gore and are expected to play an important role in
the election through advertising and organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said gun control was a crucial election issue, and
promised to push for legislation requiring trigger locks and
mandatory background checks, as well as bans on certain devices.
</P>
<P>
   The conventions held a joint moment of silence for Barry Grunow,
the Florida teacher who was shot and killed by a 13-year-old boy on
the last day of school this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child is killed by a gun every two hours in our country,''
Chase said. ``That's 12 children killed by guns every 24 hours.
That's the equivalent of one Columbine a day. That's a public
health crisis.''

TIME IS RIPE TO RID NATION   OF SYPHILIS, HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Va., N.C., Ind., Ga.)   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The new jail inmate had intimidating arms,
thick as thighs. But he extended one meekly when a nurse, Jean
Graves, told him: ``I have to give you a tuberculosis skin test. I
also have to draw blood for syphilis, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   As she slid the needle into his skin, the city of Nashville took
one more small step in a sweeping national program: a push by
health authorities to rid the country of the scourge of syphilis,
spirochete bacterium by spirochete, chancre sore by chancre, once
and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Even here, where the syphilis rate is the second highest in the
country among major cities, topped only by Indianapolis, the
numbers are less than staggering. Only 250 cases of new _ and thus
still infectious _ syphilis turned up last year. Nationwide, they
dropped below 7,000, down from the most recent peak of 50,000 in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the very point, health officials say. Now, when new
cases are at an all-time low and so concentrated that about half of
them come from just 25 of the country's 3,100 counties, is the time
to try to wipe it out altogether. They are prosecuting a
multipronged attack that includes heavy reliance on community
activism and stepped-up detective work to track down carriers and
those at risk, as well as expanded clinical and laboratory
services.
</P>
<P>
   Up close, however, this campaign, which officially started last
October, sometimes appears more a slog than a fast strike, a lesson
in the painstaking process of fighting sexually transmitted
diseases even when, like syphilis, they have a cure as easy as a
couple of shots of penicillin.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing this week in Atlanta, local health officials
reported lessons and patches of progress from the three
metropolitan areas where pilot anti-syphilis programs are already
underway: Nashville, Raleigh, N.C., and Indianapolis, all places
where rates are high. They included word from North Carolina that
the state had begun to see a sharp drop in syphilis rates, by 36
percent last year compared with 1998, and a report that nationwide,
the striking racial disparity in syphilis rates had diminished as
well, from a 43-to-1 ratio of blacks to whites infected in 1997,
down to less than a 30-to-1 ratio in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The local officials also called for continued federal financing
for their program, which is expected to cost $37 million a year
through 2005 but has been allocated only about half that to date.
In his current budget, President Clinton is requesting an
additional $15 million for the anti-syphilis effort in 2001. But
the Senate, seeking to funnel more money instead toward chlamydia
prevention, is considering providing only half that amount for
syphilis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I know about the epidemiology of syphilis tells me
this elimination effort is dead in the water if we're not able to
sustain the president's budget request,'' warned Dr. Judith N.
Wasserheit, who directs the Division of Sexually Transmitted
Disease Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Without a full-fledged elimination program, federal health
officials project, syphilis, which tends to rise and fall in
7-to-10-year cycles, could reach 23,000 new cases in 2005. As it
is, they said, treatment for syphilis and its consequences cost
nearly $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   For all their focus on money, however, they also emphasized that
money is not enough, that eliminating syphilis takes commitment and
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville, for example, needs workers like Pam Pitts, who
persuades new inmates at the city's jail to get tested and, if
infected, identify their sexual partners; and Tina Lester, who
coordinates the anti-syphilis campaign among dozens of community
groups and churches in the poor neighborhoods where the disease is
most prevalent; and Princesita A.L. Hawkins, who ventures out into
those same neighborhoods every day to track down carriers and talk
them into getting help.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a hard and frustrating job, Hawkins said: ``A lot of
your patients, you're going to be more concerned about their health
than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is a job that must be done, health officials say, as they
struggle to learn how best to eliminate a disease that is easy to
test for and cure but not as easy to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, we don't have vaccines for the majority of
infectious disease now,'' said Wasserheit. ``So a strategy like
this, that allows us to eliminate a disease through a multifaceted
approach, is a new thing and a really important concept that goes
way beyond syphilis itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has tried before to eliminate syphilis, but
never reached the near-total success of European countries _ in
part, experts say, because the efforts failed to reach the poor
areas most affected. This new approach, health officials say,
emphasizes heavier community involvement than ever, from church
sermons to screenings in local libraries, along with more tracking
and clinical services. It seeks to bring syphilis cases below 1,000
nationwide, which is not total eradication but low enough to be
considered elimination.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here in Nashville, that strategy has translated into innovative
moments, from anti-syphilis church sermons last Valentine's Day to
a graphic ``Syphilis is Scary'' exhibit at a university last
Halloween, to talks by Lester in which her advice to teen-agers
considering a sexual encounter includes, ``Turn on the light, look
at people, don't just trust!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville, some things are already becoming clear. One is
that focusing syphilis prevention efforts on the city jail is
highly effective.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the cases that the city has picked up in recent
months came from the program to screen new inmates and try to get
them treatment quickly, before they are released on bond or
otherwise move on in the criminal justice system, officials say.
Overall, about 70 percent of people found to have syphilis have a
criminal record, said Dr. Jesse Huang, the city's chief
epidemiologist. Rates in homeless shelters are also
disproportionately high, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Pitts, the public health worker now stationed full time in
the city's main jail, said that perhaps 10 percent to 20 percent of
new inmates refuse to be screened, for all her persuasive powers.
Women tend to refuse out of belligerence, men because they're
scared of the needle, she said. But overall, she is more convinced
than ever that she is stationed in the right place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think without a corrections process you're not going to
eliminate syphilis in your community, you're just not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson is that word does get around; several public
health workers said that recently, they had begun encountering a
few people who said they had heard that there was a syphilis
problem in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But only a few. More typical was Ricky Carr, 38, a construction
worker who had been lured into a public library for a free
screening the other day. He had mainly wanted an HIV screening to
dispel the rumors that, because he had been looking bad as he
recovered from surgery recently, he had AIDS. But he agreed to a
syphilis test as well, though he had heard nothing of the epidemic
and knew no one who had it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I ain't got no syphilis, I think I can pretty much tell
that,'' he said. But ``it's free, and I'm off today, and I don't
mind looking after me.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In most ways, health officials acknowledge, syphilis has not
been as worrisome as some other diseases since penicillin came into
use, and to this day the bacteria have developed no resistance to
antibiotics, in sharp contrast to gonorrhea and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In its early stages, syphilis shows up as painless genital
sores, which go away by themselves, and weeks or months later by
rashes, which also tend to heal untreated.
</P>
<P>
   But if left untreated for years, syphilis can damage the brain,
heart and other organs; if a pregnant woman is infected and left
untreated, it can prove deadly for her baby; and its sores raise
significantly the chances of transmission of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains: If syphilis tends to affect the poorest of
the poor, the homeless, the drug users, the prostitutes, people who
tend to be alienated enough from government and even medical
officials that some resist even efforts to test and cure them, can
it really be eliminated as health officials plan?
</P>
<P>
   Lester and others in Nashville say it can. ``I think that it can
be done,'' she said. ``It's just that we really need to get to the
core of the infection, just keep tracking down those contacts.''

MEXICO'S NEW LEADER SEEN AS ENTHUSIASTIC U.S. PARTNER
</HEADLINE>
   (With MEXICO-ELECTION) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration welcomed the transition
of power in Mexico, saying Monday that the election of Vicente Fox
was evidence of the maturing of democratic institutions and that it
set the stage for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton telephoned Fox to congratulate him, and also
spoke to President Ernesto Zedillo, the outgoing leader, to express
his gratitude for his role in strengthening democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans should be proud of the extraordinary steps they have
taken during the last six years to strengthen and consolidate
democratic institutions and set Mexico on a course of economic
growth and prosperity,'' Clinton said in a statement released by
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dealt frequently with Zedillo in the past six years,
especially after the passage of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, which saw trade between the two nations soar. The two
leaders held their 11th meeting here last month when Clinton
praised Zedillo for advancing the process of trade integration with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, the Clinton administration had been fairly
scrupulous in not showing a preference for either Fox or his main
opponent, Francisco Labastida of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The administration had also expressed
confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   That confidence was borne out in the conduct of the elections on
Sunday and in the results, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   For Washington, dealing with a Mexican administration led by the
PRI, which had been in power for 71 years, has been an ingrained
habit that survived countless bouts of economic crisis in Mexico
and American-led financial bailouts. Through all the crises,
Washington was generally grateful to have a stable neighbor even
though it was poor and in recent years had become the major conduit
for illegal narcotics into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox is not unknown in Washington. In an introductory visit
here in May, he met with Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering
and spoke at several foreign policy institutions. He impressed
people not only as a businessman who once worked for Coca-Cola but
also as a politician who understood the United States, a senior
administration official said. One of his major points was further
expansion of American investment in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to reassure us that the United States would have a
good partner, that he would be reliable and would cooperate across
the board,'' the official said. ``Relations under Zedillo had
reached an all-time high and we would expect Fox to continue the
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was not to say that Fox would not inject some new ideas
into the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   On the three main issues between Mexico and the United States _
immigration, trade and the flow of drugs _ Fox, as a former
governor of a northern Mexican state, would likely bring some fresh
thinking, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Fox said he would like a more even
relationship with Washington on the handling of immigration which,
from the Mexican perspective, has largely been treated by the
United States as a criminal justice and police issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is one issue that the new president and the new
president of the United States will have to deal with quite
quickly,'' said Andres Rozental, a business consultant in Mexico
City, who was a deputy secretary of state dealing with American
relations in a former Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   Rozental said he believed that Fox would like to look beyond
``managing'' the question of illegal Mexican immigrants into the
United States and turn toward reaching agreements with Washington
that would allow better terms for semi-skilled Mexican migrants to
enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the AFL-CIO had recently noted the value of
semi-skilled foreign workers to the United States, and that the
Treasury had attributed some of the economic growth during the
Clinton administration to immigrant labor. This presented a
``window of opportunity'' for Mexico to try to persuade Washington
to sit down and take a new look at immigration policies with
Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disputes involving trucking and sugar _ two sectors in
which Mexico would like a bigger share of the American market _
Mexico's trading relations with the United States have moved
steadily since NAFTA was signed into law by President Clinton in
1993. An administration official said that Zedillo had refrained
from repeating the practice of his predecessors of ramping up the
Mexican economy in an effort to have his party win the election.
``There is stability, not boom,'' in the Mexican economy, an
administration official said. There was also the prospect of
continuity in the economy with the head of the central bank,
Guillermo Ortiz, slated to stay. It also appeared possible that the
finance minister, Jose Angel Gurria, might remain in office.

<P>
   In some ways, Lucille Lee is typical of many people who have
cast their lot with Silicon Valley start-ups. Early last year,
after many years as a software systems architect at International
Business Machines, she joined eCircles.com, a service based in San
Mateo, Calif. for building virtual meeting places, where she puts
in 60 to 70 hours a week as director of applications development.
</P>
<P>
   But almost every week Lee has the company's chief executive over
for Sunday dinner. Although she does not report directly to him,
she often brings up work-related concerns, but when she does this,
he squirms, telling her he would rather not discuss work. This
usually goes on a bit until Lee's husband chimes in to admonish
their guest: ``Prescott, listen to your mom.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 67, Lee is working for her son, who is 38. And her
situation is not all that unusual anymore. In the world of Internet
start-ups, where a typical chief executive is 30 and a labor
shortage continues even as some Web companies fail, in many cases
dot-commers are recruiting their parents.
</P>
<P>
   These 30-somethings belong to a generation that came of age
comfortable with both technology and the risks that come with
entrepreneurship. Most of their parents are still in the work
force, many of them still years from retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Some say they decided to work for their children's firms because
their skills and experience were a good fit with the firm. A few
say they find the potential financial rewards attractive. But most
do it for the most time-honored of reasons: Who can say no to a
child who needs you?
</P>
<P>
   In the process, this curious form of reverse nepotism is
upending traditional notions about family businesses, where the
younger generations work their way up the ladder. It is also
bringing a new dimension to child-parent relationships and the
questions of authority and approval that usually define them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really new,'' said Mary J. Waller, an assistant
professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who
studies organizational behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Waller noted that except in smaller, family-owned businesses,
nepotism has generally been frowned upon in American companies. But
many young and inexperienced dot-com executives, she said, are the
children of successful entrepreneurs who can offer valuable advice
and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most famous recent example of a parental recruit is
William H. Gates Jr., father of Microsoft's chairman. The elder
Gates, a 74-year-old lawyer, is co-chairman of the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation, the largest philanthropic foundation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The position grew out of a conversation a few years ago with his
son and daughter-in-law during a night at the movies. After that
evening, the elder Gates offered to help his son with his
philanthropic efforts.
</P>
<P>
   For many other parents who go into a child's employ, it starts
with a more active call for help.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with Josie Herron, a 55-year-old database
designer who uprooted herself from West Palm Beach, Fla., last
January to join the payroll of Mercury2, an e-commerce company in
San Francisco. Her daughter, Christine Herron, a former venture
capitalist and graduate of Stanford Business School is the
company's founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch recently at a cafe close to Mercury2's offices south
of Market Street, the elder Herron, looking slightly out of place
amid the relentless hipness of the restaurant, and her daughter, a
cheerful 30-year-old clearly in her element, talked about how the
recruitment took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a shameless lobbying,'' said Josie Herron. ``Heavy
guilt on the `Mom, I need you.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You use what works with different people,'' responded
Christine, a broad, mischievous smile on her face. ``I know what
works with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc H. Bell, 32, who is chairman and chief executive officer of
the Globix Corp., an Internet infrastructure firm in New York, was
also in need of help. Both of Bell's parents _ who have been
amicably separated but not divorced for more than 10 years _ now
work for him.
</P>
<P>
   The first to join the company, in 1995, was Bell's father,
Robert, 61, an experienced real estate lawyer who started out by
giving informal advice as the company was getting started and
eventually signed on as executive vice president of business
development.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't always been an easy situation to adjust to. ``When
my father came on board, the dynamic was a little weird because my
father was working for me,'' said the younger Bell. ``It required
finding boundaries. There are definitely some tense moments. ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Bell said, at the same time, ``there's no one you can
better trust than family.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bell did not ask for any shares when the company was
formed. He later took options, the company went public in 1996 and
now he is a multimillionaire. Now 600 employees strong, Globix has
made Marc Bell far wealthier; his stock in the company is worth
about $185 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have in our situation is a pendulum where it's swung
from one end to the other,'' said the elder Bell. ``It evolved from
son coming to father for advice to a father taking total direction
from his son.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell's mother, Ruth, 58, who coordinates events for the company,
was a more difficult recruit. It took several years before Bell
finally convinced her to join the company. She was happy running
her own small business producing what her son calls ``crystal
tchotchkes'' and what she describes as ``hand-crafted personal
accessory items.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1998, she relented. Her nickname around the company
is The Corporate Mom.
</P>
<P>
   When a company is just starting out, and one's parents get
involved, the financial and emotional stakes can be enormous, and
young entrepreneurs may want more than a parent's expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to me to have not just my mortgage on the line
but my mom's mortgage as well,'' said Courtney Rosen, 33, chief
executive of eHow.com, a how-to Web site with 80 full-time
employees and 200 free-lancers. Rosen's mother, Roberta Kramer, 61,
works there as a senior editor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, investors and colleagues are often skeptical of
such arrangements at first. ``Everyone wants to know, `Is this a
family business I'm getting involved in, or what?' said Matthew
Josefewicz, 27, chief executive of Chapbooks.com, a start-up in
Boston that produces books in small quantities. ``The answer is
definitely `or what,''' Both his parents now work for him.
</P>
<P>
   But, say many chief executives, the skepticism usually fades
once a parent's credentials are trotted out. Further, it doesn't
hurt to demonstrate that at least one highly experienced
``gray-hair,'' as employees over the age of 40 or so are generally
referred to at start-ups, can be found in the company's ranks.
</P>
<P>
   That same experience, however, can breed discord. Bell, who
describes his father as a ``strong-headed person,'' recalled
several disagreements over the years. Gradually, the elder Bell has
come to defer more readily to his son. ``This is a Marc company,
this is not a Bob company,'' said the elder Bell. ``He is the
brains behind it, and I accept that and I respect it. Some fathers
don't want to let go.''
</P>
<P>
   In a variation on the theme of recruiting one's parents, said
Josefewicz, his father and a small group of friends had the idea
for Chapbooks.com and turned to him in 1998 when they were seeking
someone to run it. ``My parents have run their own business and
don't want to be doing that again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Josefewicz said that early in the company's life, he and his
parents had ``one or two major disagreements I'm not comfortable
sharing in print.'' But those differences were quickly resolved, he
said, and all has since gone smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation negotiations can be awkward. Bell said that neither
parent seemed pleased with the stock options he offered them.
``Everybody always wants more,'' he said. Both parents, however,
say they are perfectly happy with their compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen of eHow.com said her mother was surprisingly tough. ``She
negotiated really well,'' said Rosen. ``She did a great job.'' The
negotiations did not take place directly between mother and
daughter, said Rosen, but with the company's vice president of
operations, who happens to be Rosen's husband.
</P>
<P>
   Josie Herron refused to negotiate altogether. ``She said, `Just
pay me what I'm worth,''' recalled Christine Herron.
</P>
<P>
   Many CEOs of companies still in their infancy and strapped for
cash are offering their parent-employees the choice of salaries or
stock options. Lee, for instance, has chosen to take more of her
compensation in options and less in salary, which she considers an
extra vote of confidence for her son.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply rooted patterns that can be found in most parent-child
relationships are also difficult to shut out completely. Lee, for
instance, often criticizes his mother for her pessimistic
tendencies, he said, adding that it isn't until his co-workers tell
him that he is being too judgmental that he rethinks his position.
``Part of the problem we all have with our moms is we expect them
to be perfect,'' Lee confessed.
</P>
<P>
   For parents, pride in one's children, as natural an instinct as
a parent can have, is hard to avoid when working so closely with
one's offspring. ``Sometimes we're at the same meeting and every
once in a while I'll get that rush, that motherly pride thing mixed
with love,'' Josie Herron said. ``But I only let that last a
second, and I say to myself, `That's enough now, we can't do that
at work, and I focus right back to where we were.'''
</P>
<P>
   And, not least, there is the question of what to call Mom or
Dad, in meetings or the workplace. For a while, Bell tried saying
``Ruth'' and ``Bob'' but soon gave up. ``I realized that was just
silly,'' he said. ``No matter how much I want to deny it, it's a
fact _ they're my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   His difficulties are typical, as is the tendency to revert to
habit. Lee said that in more formal settings, such as meetings, he
usually addresses his mother as ``Lucille.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``when we start disagreeing on something, I switch
right back to `Mom.'''
</P>
<P>
   And what if, in the midst of the current wave of dot-com
failures and layoffs, it becomes necessary to hand a pink slip to
the very person who used to set your curfews and order you to clean
your plate?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to lay my mom off, I would be in a horrible
situation,'' said Lee. ``My mom would understand but I know that
deep down she would also be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Herron said she, too, had thought about this. ``If something
were to happen to the business, though I feel responsible for the
well-being of the entire team here, naturally there's more angst
associated with letting down your mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Herron said that given her mother's experience, she would have
no trouble finding another job. All the same, she said, ``Until she
was settled into something else, I would be quite on edge _ more so
than if I was unsettled myself.''

WHY SETTLE FOR THE REAL FIREWORKS? 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sure, the fireworks Tuesday night will be
spectacular. They're spectacular every year, and this time they're
supposed to be bigger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But four centuries ago, when people really had imagination, they
staged fireworks displays on the Arno River in Florence in which
mock battles between dyers and silk weavers vying for the queen's
favor ended with the weavers' getting tossed in the river and the
god Vulcan erupting in the form of a huge fireball.
</P>
<P>
   Good clean mayhem and educational, too! That and other
historical nuggets can be learned from ``Fireworks!,'' at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art through Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you spare yourself the happy crowds, the bombs
bursting in air, the balmy breezes of a long summer evening. Stay
home watching reruns Tuesday night after spending a few hours in
the Met perusing old prints and drawings of long-forgotten
pyrotechnical displays.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't thank me. It's my job to tell you these things.
</P>
<P>
   Some history should enhance your inevitable pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.0
</P>
<P>
   As nearly every child who has ever dreamed of lighting a bottle
rocket in the backyard knows, the Chinese, probably by the ninth
century, hit on the crazy idea of mixing sulfur, charcoal and
potassium nitrate to create gunpowder. It took hundreds of years
more, maybe until the 14th century, for backward Europeans to catch
up, whereupon they celebrated as often as they could by destroying
things.
</P>
<P>
   A print illustrates what happened in Munich in 1530 after the
coronation of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor. The Bavarian dukes
invited Charles to a big field outside the city where a group of
mock Turkish-looking buildings had been built. A battalion of
cannons fired at the buildings, and ka-boom! So much for the Turks.
</P>
<P>
   What fun. Pretty soon, whenever any king or prince was born,
married, conquered somebody, issued a decree, took religious vows,
recovered from the flu or passed through town, civic leaders
lighted dangerous explosives in crowded places. When the
Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, the younger brother of Philip IV of
Spain, visited Antwerp in 1635, Peter Paul Rubens, no less, was
enlisted to organize the two-day celebratory spectacle, which ended
with fireworks at the cathedral. A print of the occasion (not by
Rubens) shows the cathedral spire in silhouette against a burst of
streamers.
</P>
<P>
   It is very scenic. Many of the prints and drawings of fireworks
are naturally scenic, artists taking on a subject like this to
demonstrate their own pyrotechnical skill. There is, for example, a
Russian book of color lithographs and wood engravings commemorating
the coronation of Alexander II in 1856 that is three feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Piranesi's colored etching of the Girandola, the
annual fireworks extravaganza atop the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome,
is a striking example of lighting effects and depicted aerial
acrobatics, capturing the experience Dickens described after he saw
the Girandola half a century later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show began with a tremendous discharge of cannon; and
then, for 20 minutes or half an hour, the whole castle was one
incessant sheet of fire and labyrinth of blazing wheels of every
color, size and speed,'' he wrote in 1845. ``In half an hour
afterwards, the immense concourse had dispersed; the moon was
looking calmly down upon her wrinkled image in the river, and half
a dozen men and boys, with bits of lighted candle in their hands,
moving here and there, in search of anything worth having that
might have been dropped in the press, had the whole scene to
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   By Dickens' era, fireworks had become so commonplace that
artists interested in social interaction, like Daumier and Winslow
Homer, began to focus on faces in the crowds rather than on the
explosions. Then photographs started to outpace prints as popular
documents of notable firework displays. Times were changing.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't quite the end of the story. Anyone who goes to
the Guggenheim's ``1900'' show, which is based on the art that was
in the Paris Exposition Universelle, will especially want to see
the prints and a so-called Chinese toy theater in the Met show that
lovingly simulate the fireworks over the Seine when the exposition
opened.
</P>
<P>
   No red-blooded New Yorker should miss the bird's-eye view of the
opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883. People crowd the bridge and
river. Ships choke the harbor. Rockets blast from the bridge and
from the docks. The celebration reportedly lasted more than an
hour. In the lithograph, orange and yellow streaks across the gray
sky make half the image look almost abstract.
</P>
<P>
   What more could you want to celebrate the holiday? So forget
going to see the real fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the lines in the cafeteria at the Met are bound to be
shorter than the ones for hot dogs at the celebration.

HINGIS WALTZES TO A DANCE WITH VENUS WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The wicked edges that typically mark the
corners of Martina Hingis' mischievous Garfield smile suddenly
vanished. At the mention of Venus and Serena Williams on Monday,
Hingis was less biting and all but cuddly as she unveiled a humble
front.
</P>
<P>
   She was respectful, complimentary and credited both sculpted
sisters for pointing her in the direction of the gym. Just after
Hingis advanced to the quarterfinals by dismantling a beleaguered
Anke Huber, 6-1, 6-2, she refused a chance to snip at the Williams
sisters, fully aware of her predicament.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the Wimbledon final, she will have to escape the sling
blade groundstrokes of Venus Williams in the quarterfinals and
potentially Serena in the semis. With straight-set victories in the
Round of 16 as a kick start the second week of Wimbledon, Serena
and Venus Williams began closing in on Hingis like walls in a
claustrophobic nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're happy you make it through one of them,'' Hingis said.
``And then the next day, the other one is waiting. Hopefully, if I
can beat one, I'll get a day off. Definitely they're not easy, but
anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Hingis fancies herself too clever on the court to be
vulnerable, but after Venus Williams drained her during a three-set
semifinal of the United States Open and Serena Williams finished
her off in the final, her increasingly fragile confidence was
cracked in half. So although Hingis is No. 1 in the world, she
could not have been surprised at the response Venus Williams gave
when reminded of her next opponent's top ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?'' the elder Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a day to show any fear for the Americans. Although she
had to overcome the current reincarnation of her fellow
hard-hitting countrywoman, Jennifer Capriati, Lindsay Davenport
pummeled the lines in a 6-3, 6-3 victory on Center Court. Joining
Davenport and the Williams sisters to form a quarterfinal assembled
by Uncle Sam, Monica Seles and Lisa Raymond also advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Serena Williams said. ``Maybe it's
McDonald's. Definitely their cheeseburgers. Not too much the fries,
but the cheeseburgers, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a fast-food feel to the day. Wasting little time,
Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras pulled away with their fourth-round
matches in straight sets. And Jan-Michael Gambill, the giddy,
effusive American once billed as the next Agassi or Sampras,
finally greeted high expectations with a karate-like kick and a
pumped fist when he advanced to his first quarterfinal in a Grand
Slam event with a 7-6 (5), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 upset of ninth-seeded
Thomas Enqvist.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Gambill eliminated the last seeded player in
Sampras' half of the draw, and became the top-seeded player's next
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Moving freely with tendinitis in his lower left shin, and
uncoiling his body to hit 17 aces, Sampras oozed health. That image
only fed into the skepticism around what some of Sampras' peers are
referring to as his ``so-called injury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can believe or read what they want to read,'' Sampras
said. ``It's still two guys playing out there.''
</P>
<P>
   After match point, Sampras felt as if he had a brush with such a
skeptic when his opponent, Jonas Bjorkman, barely shook his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell by the way Jonas shook my hand today that, you
know, he was thinking whatever he thinks,'' Sampras said. ``For the
first time, the pressure is kind of on my opponent a little bit.
They know I'm a little bit injured, the pressure is on them.
They're not liking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bjorkman described his limp handshake as merely a sign of his
disappointment with losing, but side-stepped the issue of Sampras'
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if he's faking it or not,'' Bjorkman said. ``I
just go out and be prepared to play a guy who has been dominating
Wimbledon for the last seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Sampras has been viewed as a drama major when
injured. Already slumped-shouldered by nature, he once punctuated
his bedraggled appearance when he became physically ill on the
court during the 1996 United States Open. At the time, John McEnroe
and Jim Courier reportedly said Sampras was faking it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when it's a tough moment, I kind of carry it in my
pocket, the vomit,'' Sampras said when reminded of McEnroe's and
Courier's comments. Then Sampras smiled a little more when he was
asked why so many doubt him. Could it be envy over his ability to
play hurt?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go, don't we?'' said Sampras as he left the
interview room. ``Cry me a river.''
</P>
<P>
   However painful his shin, Sampras' chase of history has the
potential to overshadow the women. But on Tuesday, with a
women's-only day of singles to showcase the quarterfinals, the
attention will be on Hingis and Venus Williams, as well as another
intriguing match between second-seeded Davenport and a fit Seles.
Playing as a survivor of a sometimes emotionally difficult and
tragic career, Seles believes she still has a shot at a Wimbledon
title that has always eluded her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I can't say I'm a shade below the top players
because I'm playing one of them tomorrow,'' Seles said. ``That's
would be a terrible way to go into the match. But up to this
moment, I'd have to say I'm probably behind. Martina and Lindsay
have beaten me the last couple of times I've played them.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Hingis, who has bounded through the tournament with
ease, appeared a step ahead of Venus Williams. In her match against
Appelmans, Williams had to persevere through 12 deuces before
slamming a forehand winner to break Appelmans' serve in the first
game of the second set. Williams wasn't displeased with the 6-4,
6-4 outcome, but she wasn't happy about how she has allowed her
last couple of opponents second chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is annoying,'' Williams said. ``But I can raise the
level of my game. I just have to get my mind there. There's no way
these girls should be competing like that against me in these sets,
unless of course I let them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis will search for any crack. She is quick to exploit the
weaknesses of her opponent and sneak inside their head by chasing
down every point. In 53 minutes, she picked apart 11th-seeded
Huber's psyche by staying in every point and breaking her
opponent's serve on 7 of 11 chances. For now, her confidence is
beneath the surface. If she believes she can take the Williams
sisters, she wasn't letting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they came into women's tennis, with a lot more power and
physical abilities, everybody had to improve,'' said Hingis, who
holds a 9-5 lead in head-to-head matchups with Venus Williams. ``So
I had to improve. I feel very good. Now the tournament begins.'' &QL;

<P>
   CLAYTON, Mo. _ With their competing array of policy speeches,
Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush seem to be turning
this election into a referendum on which candidate can best reshape
government to meet the challenges of the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   From health care to education to tax cuts to Social Security,
Bush and Gore are placing before the voters significant questions
about how some of the most fundamental public institutions should
be shaped for a global, digital age that offers the prospect of
unprecedented prosperity _ and enormous uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers say that the high technology-based economy and
the growth of a middle-income investor class will make voters far
more responsive to Republican ideas for decentralizing government
and reshaping the New Deal and Great Society programs for the
elderly. He would like the private sector to provide more
government services and make people less dependent on
one-size-fits-all government programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on the other hand, wants to expand the traditionally
Democratic entitlement programs. His aides argue that the lower and
middle classes need more government assistance with education and
health care and retirement pensions at a time when knowledge is
ever more important to success and when employers offer less
generous and less secure health and pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the candidates were on display again
Monday when Gore promoted his plan for a Medicare prescription-drug
benefit and assailed a House Republican version, supported in
concept by Bush, that subsidizes private insurers to offer the
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a misnomer,'' Gore said here in Clayton of the Republican
legislation. ``It's nothing. It doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The face-off may not have the same high drama that Democrats and
Republicans engaged in during the Cold War era. Nor have the two
candidates focused in a sustained way on hot-button social issues
the way the presidential rivals did in 1988 when crime, welfare and
flag-burning were on the agenda. But analysts in both parties say
the stakes are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party that seizes the wave of change sweeping our economy
is the one that is destined to lead for the coming generation,''
Peter Ross Range, the editor of The New Democrat Blueprint, a
magazine of centrist Democrats, wrote in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Goldsmith, Bush's chief domestic policy adviser, said,
``There's a big fault line here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some talk of the new economy is as much about symbolism as about
substance. It allows Gore to try to capitalize on what should be
his greatest strength, the extraordinary economic expansion of the
Clinton years. And for Bush, analysts say, presenting himself as a
managerial reformer lets him look less ideological than other
Republicans, particularly those in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also true that since the last presidential election
the economy has changed sharply. Robust growth has turned deficits
into surpluses. Internet use and electronic commerce are exploding.
And the stock market, while cooling somewhat in recent months, has
generated huge new pools of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, new issues have arisen about the ``digital
divide'' separating the winners and losers in the New Economy, one
that has produced less stable jobs and less stable benefit plans
and left millions of Americans without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge of the New Economy, one of the biggest
challenges, is to expand the winners' circle so you don't leave
people behind,'' said Al From, president of the Democratic
Leadership Council, the centrist Democrat organization. ``Because
one of the dangers of the New Economy is if you leave too many
people behind, you have a backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush agree on some broad themes. They both embrace free
trade in the increasingly global economy, in contrast to the
third-party contenders, Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader, and many
congressional Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   They also each call for the federal government to take a
stronger role in education policy at a time when the
knowledge-based economy rewards the higher educated. And they each
speak frequently of helping those whom prosperity has left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two have fundamental differences on how to shape
government.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Gore would expand three government entitlement
programs, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. He would bring
more of the uninsured under the auspices of Medicaid, the health
insurance program for the poor. He would create a new Medicare
prescription-drug benefit for the elderly. And he would offer more
Social Security benefits to women, and also would create a new
retirement benefit for the working poor and the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Bush argues for more individual choice. So he would allow
workers to divert an unspecified part of their Social Security
payroll tax to private investment accounts. And he would turn
Medicare from a fee-for-service guaranteed benefit program to one
that lets people buy different levels of health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   And while he, too, would create a prescription-drug benefit for
the elderly, he wants to do it by creating subsidies for private
insurers so that they, not the government directly, would offer the
benefit. He would give tax credits for health insurance but send
people to the private market to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   A similar contrast concerns education. Both men would invest in
schools and teachers _ Gore putting in about 10 times more money
than Bush _ and both have plans for how to improve accountability
and performance. But two proposals are particularly telling.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would extend the reach of public-school systems by giving
states grants to create public preschools. Bush, as a lever against
failing schools, would give vouchers for private-school tuition to
low-income parents whose children attend public schools that do not
improve.
</P>
<P>
   And while both candidates favor tax cuts, they differ in methods
and degree.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calls for a $1.3 trillion across-the-board tax cut over a
decade, saying, ``A government with unlimited funds soon becomes a
government of unlimited reach.'' Gore offers $500 billion in tax
cuts intended to reimburse people for particular needs _ like child
care or college tuition _ and phasing them out as income rises.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides call the top-down, big-government structures
outmoded relics of the Great Depression. ``Governor Bush will put
more control over decisions _ whether they are health, retirement
or savings _ in the hands of individuals,'' said Ari Fleischer, a
spokesman for Bush. ``The vice president will maintain them in the
hands of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats reply that Bush's ideas would erode the common
commitment to many government institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big danger with a lot of the Bush programs is what we call
cherry-picking,'' said Robert Reich, President Clinton's former
labor secretary. ``The healthy, the wealthy or the well-educated
will be the first to opt out, leaving the poor, the sicker and the
lesser-educated behind in the general insurance pools or in the
education system. This is a sure-fire recipe for social
stratification.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides are also trying to turn the debate to the question
of who gets helped under the competing plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush takes the old-fashioned approach of cutting everybody's
rates which ends up really, really, really helping wealthy people
because they pay so much and being of marginal help, if any, to
people in lower brackets,'' said Elaine Kamarck, Gore's policy
director.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promotes his tax cut by saying that it would remove 6
million low-income families from the tax rolls. But critics say it
would also give most of its benefits to higher-income groups simply
because they pay the most taxes.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal public policy
group, found that the top 1 percent of tax payers would get 42
percent of the tax cuts in Bush's plan while the bottom 20 percent
of tax payers would get less than 1 percent of the reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides counter that their approach to tax cuts gives
individuals more choice on how to use their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore views government's roles as manipulating people and uses
people's own tax money to manipulate their behavior,'' said
Lawrence B. Lindsey, Bush's chief economic adviser. ``Bush says
it's your money. You keep it. Do what you think is best with it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A similar debate is brewing over Social Security. Depending on
how it is structured, Bush's plan to switch some Social Security
payroll tax to individual savings accounts could prove more
lucrative for upper-income groups.
</P>
<P>
   If 2 percentage points of payroll tax were diverted to IRAs,
someone earning $76,000 annually would have slightly more than
$1,500 a year to invest in private markets. Someone earning $25,000
would have $500 to invest. Critics of the idea say it is not hard
to see which taxpayer is likely to build up the better retirement
account.
</P>
<P>
   Some plans on Capitol Hill try to address this by cutting the
basic Social Security benefit more for higher-income individuals
than lower-income ones or by giving extra contributions to
low-income workers. Bush has said the idea of matching funds for
lower incomes should be considered. But he has not committed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would preserve the current Social Security system, as well
as create a new retirement plan that would be similar to a 401(k)
and would be geared toward helping lower-income groups.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the government would give couples earning less than
$30,000 a year $3 for every dollar they put in this savings
account; the government match would then reduce as income grew. The
program would not be available to couples earning more than
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides also that Gore would make Medicare and Social
Security more expansive and costly at a time when the boomer
generation's impending retirement threatens to bankrupt the
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental challenge facing the next president is to
solve this problem,'' said Lindsey. ``What Gore just proposed is
layering another new unfunded entitlement on top of what's already
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides also prefer to steer the debate to how people are
helped. They say that they want to give people with lower incomes
the same kinds of choices the wealthy have _ whether it is the
choice of attending a private school or the choice of investing
their retirement money in the stock market.

 &HT;    Finding answers to riddles of autism
 &HT;    By Charles Anthony
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Aside from Hollywood's sometimes inaccurate portrayal
of autism, few people know much about the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   A gathering this week in Atlanta sponsored by the Autism Society
of America, ``2000 National Conference on Autism: Celebrating Our
Future,'' is focusing on treatment options, research and the
incidence of autism. The conference continues through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to bring in 1,000 attendees, and, hopefully, people
will have a better understanding about autism at the end of the
conference,'' said Vernell Henry, director of conferences for the
society.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and people whose family members are affected by autism
are the target group of the conference, which is organized around
five areas: communications; education; family and community;
medicine and research; and options for adulthood and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Autism was previously thought to affect one in 500 people, but
the number is actually closer to one in 250, according to a study
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some frequently asked questions about the disorder,
with answers by the Autism Society of America:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is autism?
</P>
<P>
   A: Autism is a complex developmental disease that is four times
more prevalent in boys than girls. It affects the normal
development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and
communication skills. No one knows what the cause of autism is. It
knows no racial, ethnic or social boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Adults and children living with autism usually have difficulty
with verbal and nonverbal communication, and leisure or play
activities. In some cases, aggressive and self-injurious behavior
may be present. They may exhibit repeated body movements, such as
hand flapping and rocking, unusual responses to people or
attachments to objects and resistance to changes in routine. Some
people with autism may also have other disorders that affect
functioning of the brain such as epilepsy, mental retardation and
Down syndrome. They may also have genetic disorders such as
Tourette's syndrome or Williams syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What causes autism?
</P>
<P>
   A: Current research links autism to biological or neurological
differences in the brain, but no specific cause. Autism is not a
mental illness. It is not caused by bad parenting, and children
with autism are not kids who choose to misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are some of the treatments?
</P>
<P>
   A: Studies show that individuals with autism respond well to
highly structured, specialized education programs tailored to their
needs. Early intervention leads to better results.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a way to diagnose autism?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are no medical tests. Accurate diagnoses should be
based on observation of an individual's communication, behavior and
developmental levels. Signs of autism typically appear during the
first three years of life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Should parents shelter their children once it is determined
they have autism?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``It is very important that children be kept close to other
developing children,'' said Gail McGee, director of the autism
center at Emory University. Parents should push for children's
inclusion in normal social activities to induce growth and
development in that area, she said.

 &HT;    Heard the one about the flesh-eating bananas?
 &HT;    By Kirk Kicklighter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Emory University senior Shelly Seaver had seen the
e-mail message many times over a period of months, usually
receiving it from a friend of a friend in her sorority until it was
hard to tell where the thing had originated.
</P>
<P>
   The message had made the rounds of campuses nationwide, warning
female students of date rapists who use a new veterinary drug,
Progesterex, to sterilize and knock out women so they can be raped
without becoming pregnant. Nearly 100 Emory women had access to the
message on the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very alarmed at first. ... A lot of students were,''
said Seaver, 23. ``It seemed like a real warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she found out that Progesterex doesn't exist. According to
the American Veterinary Medical Association, a drug called Estrus
is used to temporarily prevent mares from coming into heat, but it
would not be an effective weapon for date rapists. The warning and
the rapes were pure fiction.
</P>
<P>
   What Seaver and her sorority sisters experienced was yet another
lowlight in the ongoing plague of health and safety scares known as
``urban legends.'' Propelled by e-mail and the Internet, hoaxes
that prey on the anxieties of ordinary people are proliferating as
never before. They have become so common, in fact, that the
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
introduced a page on its Web site (www.cdc.gov/hoaxrumors.htm) to
knock them down.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and co-workers who forward such e-mails are generally
well-intentioned, but the far-reaching realm of cyberspace can
quickly turn an innocent mistake into nationwide paranoia. In the
time it takes to click the send button, modern life becomes a dark
gantlet of imagined horrors: The glue on ATM deposit envelopes is
laced with cyanide. Infected bananas from Costa Rica eat human
flesh. HIV-infected needles are hidden on movie theater seats.
Black-market organ thieves abduct business travelers and remove
their kidneys in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite unprecedented access to health information, Americans
are still suckers for these awful tales of injury and disease. P.T.
Barnum and Orson Welles would be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a paradise for people who don't think normal
things to be able to connect with other people,'' said David Emery,
who writes about urban legends and folklore for About.com, an
Internet information clearinghouse. ``You can't always determine
what the person was thinking when they come up with these things.
Some probably mean well. But it's always a story, and I think it's
often a flawed way of using stories to create a community around a
shared interest or concern.''
</P>
<P>
   American folklorists started collecting ``urban belief tales''
in the 1940s, and the field blossomed in the 1960s as researchers
began analyzing why these bizarre narratives were accepted as
truths. By the 1980s, urban legends were a major topic for folklore
researchers. And, while past legends concerned such harmlessly
outlandish scenarios as alligators living in the sewers of New
York, today's mythology often involves health scares.
</P>
<P>
   Urban legends can travel by word of mouth or print, but the
Internet has become the prime vehicle for their dissemination.
However they spread, they all share the same characteristics,
according to Harold Brunvand, a professor emeritus of English and
folklore at the University of Utah and author of a recent study of
urban legends titled ``The Truth Never Stands in the Way of a Good
Story!'' (University of Illinois Press, $22.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who spread them always insist on the truth of the story
and usually attribute it to the neighbor of the radio dispatcher
who knows the deputy who talked to the doctor who treated 18 slash
victims at the local mall,'' said Brunvand. ``The tales are always
about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances and acquire a
persistent hold on the imagination with their bizarre elements of
suspense.''
</P>
<P>
   Such tales can create headaches and a lot of extra work for
companies, police departments and public health officials. Take the
recent scare over Costa Rican bananas supposedly containing
``flesh-eating'' bacteria. The rare disease mentioned in the banana
myth, known as necrotizing fasciitis, strikes fewer than one in
15,000 Americans a year. It is most often passed person to person,
and the consumption of fruit would be a highly unlikely source,
because the bacteria cannot survive long on the surface of a
banana. But a story that began as a drip created a tidal wave of
queries to the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the peak of the scare, we were getting 250 phone calls and
about 500 e-mails per week,'' said Dr. James Watt of the CDC's
National Center for Infectious Diseases. ``After a few days it
became clear this was a big problem for us. We set up automated
systems to give people recorded messages and e-mail responses just
to try to get some other work done.''
</P>
<P>
   CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the agency's decision to create
its new myth-busting Web site was prompted by the spread of legends
and hoaxes. ``So many of the hoaxes used the CDC as a supporting
voice of authority in their messages, so we decided to make a
formal response,'' Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has been able to target the sources of these
e-mail scams. ``That would be a mission more appropriate for the
FBI, and I assume they already have their hands full with hackers
and computer viruses,'' said Watt.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hoaxes won't end anytime soon, experts on urban
legends try to educate the public as much as possible about the
background and relevance of the misleading stories. ``Many of the
legends are a reflection of current societal concerns or a search
for excitement,'' said Barbara Mikkelson, who runs a Web site
(www.snopes.com) in Agoura, Calif., that debunks urban legends.
``People have always been worried about their health. So today you
hear lots of things about needles in play areas and toxic products
because we worry about AIDS and cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Added to that worry is a distrust of government. Many of the
experts agree that Americans living in the age following Vietnam,
Watergate and Monica Lewinsky have been conditioned to be
suspicious of authority. The AIDS virus strikes minorities
disproportionately, and many in the black community believe AIDS is
part of a government conspiracy to control nonwhite populations.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, has summed up that
attitude by saying that you can't trust a medical establishment
that was willing to experiment with black men's lives during the
Tuskegee Study, a 40-year project in which scientists observed _
but did not adequately treat _ syphilis among 412 black men in
rural Alabama. The disease killed at least 28, a federal
investigation concluded. ``The urban myths acquire a convincing
pseudo-veracity because they suggest information the government and
public health officials might be trying to hide from the rest of
us,'' said Mikkelson. At worst, such stories lead people to make
bad decisions about their health. For example, minorities who
believe AIDS is a government plot may refuse to listen to public
health advice about AIDS prevention. A recent e-mail urged all
women to seek screening for ovarian cancer using a test that, in
reality, is not reliable. And in another case, beachcombers around
the country temporarily abandoned using waterproof sunscreens after
an urban myth claimed that the products cause blindness upon eye
contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stories are also dangerous because they distract us from
the real health concerns like smoking and bad diets and the
common-sense things we need to do to stay alive.'' said Jeff Stier,
associate director of the nonprofit American Council on Science and
Health, which educates the public about health quackery.
</P>
<P>
   Stier and other experts say the best antidote for an outbreak of
``urban mythitis'' is a daily dose of skepticism. In other words,
as always, don't believe everything you read or hear. Though some
urban legends contain the slightest grain of truth, none has ever
proved to be true. Yet.

<P>
   How do you recognize and stop the spread of a health-related
urban myth? Experts at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the American Council on Science and Health and
About.com, an information clearinghouse, generally agree on these
guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   _ If the story seems suspicious or its explanations are only
somewhat plausible, it's probably not true.
</P>
<P>
   _ When the message says, ``Please forward this to everyone you
know,'' that's a dead giveaway. Have you ever seen press releases
from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health or the New England
Journal of Medicine that made such an urgent request? Don't forward
the message, even if you think it's funny. E-mail forwarding is how
the story's credibility grows.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of messages with lots of exclamation points. Real
health scares don't need schoolkids' punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the message refers to an expert, do an Internet search on
that person. Chances are good that the name won't come up as an
expert on anything.
</P>
<P>
   _ When doubts remain, two of the best sources to check are the
CDC and About.com Web sites on medical hoaxes. If you're still
scared or confused, don't hesitate to call your local public health
department or family doctor.

 &HT;    Summer poses threat to children's teeth
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The kids are playing baseball and basketball,
swimming, climbing trees and hanging from jungle gyms. They're on
skateboards, in-line skates and trampolines.
</P>
<P>
   And some end up in dentists' offices, with broken, chipped or
knocked-out teeth. Summer is prime time for accidents, dentists
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the season when kids are playing hard _ especially the
boys,'' said Dr. Arva Lumpkin, a dentist. ``They're playing sports,
and they're doing anything that they think will help them fly. Of
course, that means they're getting hit with baseballs, smacked with
elbows in basketball or falling off the top of cars, jungle gyms
and trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, more than 5 million teeth get knocked out each year,
with such accidents accounting for 15 percent of children's dental
emergencies, according to the American Academy of Pediatric
Dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   When a child shows up with a bloody mouth, parents who know what
to do can save a permanent tooth _ and headaches in the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   If a tooth is knocked out: The first task is to find it, said
Dr. James Hall III of Macon, Ga., a past president of the Georgia
Dental Association and a pediatric dentist for more than three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to immediately call your dentist _ generally,
you have a window of about an hour to get the tooth back into place
and stabilized to save it. Ideally, your child should be sitting in
a dentist's chair within a half-hour of the accident, Lumpkin said.
</P>
<P>
   After finding the tooth, you should gently wash it with water to
get off any debris. But you don't want to use soap, and you don't
want to damage the fibers on the root. Tap water would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   Next, you have some choices. If the child is old enough, stick
the tooth back into his mouth, storing it either in a cheek or the
place it was knocked from until you get to the dentist. If the
child is young and you think he might swallow it, you can _ brace
yourself _ put the tooth into your own mouth.
</P>
<P>
   If that's more than you bargained for when you signed up for
parenthood, dentists say a tooth can also be stored in milk. Again,
when handling the tooth, be careful to handle the crown and not the
root.
</P>
<P>
   To save the tooth, dentists typically will take X-rays to see
exactly how it should be placed back into its socket, then
stabilize it by bonding the tooth to flexible wires attached to
other teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like creating a hammock,'' explained Hall.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps surprisingly, children are smart enough not to mess
with the splint.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a tooth is damaged, they'll play with it with their
tongue, or they'll put their finger in their mouths,'' Hall said.
``But once it's stabilized, in all my years of being a dentist,
I've never had a child that came in with a splint off because he
monkeyed with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes about a week to determine whether the tooth has
stabilized. If it has, the dentist then has to evaluate whether a
root canal is needed.
</P>
<P>
   If the tooth is chipped or cracked: If it's a minor chip, a
dentist might be able to smooth it off. If the chip is more
substantial, he might be able to bond it. But if the nerve is
exposed, parents and dentists will have to discuss the best
options, which might include a replacement tooth.
</P>
<P>
   If the tooth is a baby tooth, the dentist will try to determine
whether a permanent tooth is near the surface of the gum. If so,
the child's only crisis will be finding the best location for the
tooth fairy to visit.
</P>
<P>
   If not, the dentist will put in a spacer, which looks like a
tooth if it's in the front but not if it's in the back. The spacer
is attached with wire and stays in place until the child's
permanent tooth shows up.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can try to protect their Indiana Joneses or Janes from
such mishaps. Most dentists will custom-mold mouth guards. Such
molds, which cost between $25 and $50, are more comfortable than
standard ones.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to pay that much, Hall recommends that you buy
a pre-formed guard, put it in hot water and mold it to your child's
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are going to be kids,'' he said. ``All you can do is take
care of the basics and hold your breath.''

 &HT;    AL All-Star squad will lack familiar faces
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - When the final vote totals are announced today,
Baltimore's Cal Ripken will again be the American League leader at
third base. But barring a quick recovery, he won't start his 17th
consecutive All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, out with a bad back, is on the disabled list. So is
Cleveland outfielder Manny Ramirez, another AL starter, and Boston
pitching ace Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The American League has won three All-Star Games in a row. But
with Ken Griffey Jr. now in the National League and with Ripken,
Ramirez and Martinez injured, the AL has several holes to fill.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game is July 11 at Turner Field. Atlanta has hosted
the game once before: In 1972, the NL won 4-3 in Atlanta-Fulton
County Stadium on Joe Morgan's RBI single in the 10th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Few surprises are expected when the final totals in the fan vote
for the starters are announced. Voting at major-league stadiums
ended June 27, but fans could cast votes on the Internet through
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The closest races are at first base in the AL and second base in
the NL. Oakland's Jason Giambi (484,737) led Cleveland's Jim Thome
(455,614) at first in the AL. In the NL second base race, Houston's
Craig Biggio (452,863) was ahead of the New York Mets' Edgardo
Alfonzo (387,893).
</P>
<P>
   Six regular National League second basemen are hitting over
.300, so it will be one of the toughest positions to pare down when
the All-Star reserves are announced Wednesday, along with the
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox makes the selections for the NL, New
York Yankees manager Joe Torre for the AL. It won't be easy for
either. But Cox must have at least one player from each of the 16
NL teams on his 30-man roster. The AL has 14 teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves will have one starter, third baseman Chipper Jones,
and Greg Maddux is a cinch to be named to the pitching staff. Other
Braves candidates are first baseman Andres Galarraga, outfielder
Andruw Jones, second baseman Quilvio Veras and pitcher Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   The only Braves representatives last year were outfielder Brian
Jordan and pitcher Kevin Millwood. The AL won 4-1, with Martinez
winning the MVP award at Fenway Park. The Boston right-hander,
sidelined because of a strained oblique muscle, struck out the
first four batters and five of the six he faced.

TWO NAVY FOOTBALL PLAYERS CHARGED WITH RAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two star football players at the U.S. Naval Academy
were charged Monday with raping a female midshipman at a party
off-campus, according to the police and officials at the military
school.
</P>
<P>
   The football players, Cordrea Brittingham and Arion Keith
Williams, both 21, were charged with raping and performing other
sexual offenses on a fellow student who had passed out after
drinking at a party in the suburban town of Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, whose name was not released, awoke to find herself
being assaulted and pushed the men away, said Sgt. Joe Jordan, a
spokesman for the Anne Arundel County Police. She was treated at a
local hospital after midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects were being held on $250,000 bond. If convicted
of second-degree rape, they would face a maximum prison sentence of
20 years, Jordan said. It was unclear whether the victim knew the
men, who had just completed their sophomore year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is likely to revive a new round of soul-searching
at the academy, which has groomed future naval officers for a
century and a half, but has grappled with a prominent cheating
scandal and various crimes over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The case could also renew debate over what some critics view as
a climate of privilege and leniency that surrounds the school's
most valued athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a cornerback from Detroit who is studying naval
architecture, is considered one of the team's best athletes,
according to a Web site of the Naval Academy's sports programs.
Known by the nickname Bas, he started in 11 of Navy's 12 games last
season and had more than 60 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Brittingham, a running back from Berlin, Md. who is studying
economics, is known as one of the fastest players on the team and
has ``an impressive 40-inch vertical leap,'' according to the
team's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   An academy spokeswoman Monday declined to say whether the school
had taken any action against the suspects. She referred inquiries
to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Although local police officials said they could not recall
similar incidents at the school recently, the academy was rocked by
a series of scandals during the 1990s. The most prominent case
involved the theft of an examination for electrical engineering in
December 1992, in which 133 midshipmen were found to have violated
the honor code by lying to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-week period in 1996, a midshipman was arrested
for assaulting four female students, another student was charged
with sexually abusing a toddler, and two midshipmen and three
former academy students were indicted for operating a car theft
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Investigating the series of problems, a 20-member panel led by
former CIA director Stansfield Turner concluded there was no
``systemic flaw'' at the military college.

COMMENTARY: A FOURTH OF JULY ADDRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My fellow Americans.
</P>
<P>
   We stand here today on the bridge to the 21st century. Some may
decry this bridge as unnecessary, and argue that since we have
already been in the 21st century for some months now, no new
infrastructure is needed.
</P>
<P>
   To them I say: Consider the feelings of the many Americans who
believe that the new century does not really begin until Jan. 1,
2001. We have not heard their voices recently. They cower silently
in our midst, fearing that one careless word might trigger a new
flood of millennium roundups. But they are out there, and they
deserve their bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are dawdlers on the road to the future, milling
sullenly like frequent fliers at La Guardia Airport during a
monsoon. However, even they must know that we are on the brink of
something new, something so unique it has not even been stolen from
European TV programming. It is a new era, and to begin it, we will
be electing a new president. That campaign has already begun _
indeed, it has been going on for longer than the combined
administrations of William Henry Harrison and James Garfield.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe that this is still the same race as the
one that had Bill Bradley and Steve Forbes in it, in which Lamar
Alexander once frolicked and Orrin Hatch romped. And where are they
now, my friends? Not gone, surely, but only on summer hiatus, like
the Sopranos.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we will bid farewell to Bill Clinton, our companion through
so many civic adventures, from the New Covenant to the V-chip. We
can be confident that his successor will be a man who listens to
the lessons of the past. In fact, both Al Gore and George W. Bush
are so soaked in the lore of bygone elections that they might well
be called the metaphorical equivalent of history's drowned kittens.
</P>
<P>
   We all realize that Bush is the son of one former president. But
how many of you know that he is also a direct descendant of
another? Yes, some of Bush's genomes were once worn by Franklin
Pierce _ the man known as ``Young Hickory'' to his supporters in
New Hampshire and ``The Fainting General'' to his troops in the
field. He was also called ``the victor over many a hard-fought
bottle,'' but only by political opponents wishing to harp on
isolated incidents, all of which, I believe, occurred before his
40th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Our candidates are both the products of great traditions of
public service. Gore is the son of a senator, Bush is the grandson.
America has been blessed with many presidents who spring from such
well-hoed political truck gardens. Perhaps this year's winner will
find it in him to become another John Quincy Adams or Benjamin
Harrison, or even a second, smaller, William Howard Taft.
</P>
<P>
   There are some among you, I know, who feel that electoral
politics are not what they once were. Where, you may ask, are the
election rallies of yore, the bonfires, the parades? Whatever
happened to the old-fashioned civic spirit that once inspired our
citizens to raise incredibly tall poles or roll extremely large
balls from town to town in support of a favorite candidate? When
people ask, as they so often do, ``Where are the Grover Clevelands
for the new millennium?'' I can only shake my head and say that we
get the leaders we deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Some people go further and claim that there are not even any
issues worth fighting for in this flaccid new era. They miss the
days when the mere mention of ``free silver'' or ``Remember the
Maine'' or ``Save Checkers'' set passions quivering. Today, our
blood runs cooler. Still, who among us did not feel a twinge of
excitement as we watched the Al Gore Prosperity and Progress Tour?
Who did not feel relief at the news that George W. Bush intends to
be a Reformer With Results?
</P>
<P>
   No issues? Speak on, you prophets of doom _ what say you of
Bush's war against the ``tollbooth on the road to the middle
class,'' a loathsome structure he intends to destroy with copious
tax reductions? Bush hates that tollbooth, even on the days he
refers to it as ``toolboth.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he would use our excess money to pay down the national
debt, and make the nation totally solvent for the first time since
1835, an era when Franklin Pierce was just a pup and America was
preparing to celebrate the Panic of 1837.
</P>
<P>
   ``The precedents are not particularly instructive,'' the vice
president said recently. It is a sentiment we can all take to
heart.

MEXICO ELECTION BRINGS FEELING OF EMPOWERMENT TO THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MEXICO-ELECTION) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For three generations, Juan Quiroz's family has run a
fruit-and-vegetable stand in the market that sits in the shadow of
the presidential mansion, los Pinos. But given the impenetrable
nature of Mexican politics, he said he has never felt close to
power.
</P>
<P>
   But several hours after he cast his vote on Sunday, Quiroz said
he realized he had touched power for the first time. His choice for
president, Vicente Fox, would be the first man in 70 years to oust
the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party, known as the PRI,
from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought that Fox would win, even if all the votes were
for him because the PRI was so powerful,'' Quiroz said. ``The
people finally showed that we are more powerful than any political
party _ even a dictatorship like the PRI. Now the people are in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   That euphoric feeling of empowerment echoed across Mexico on
Monday, among people of various backgrounds, professions and
political stripes, in newspaper columns and radio commentary, in
bookstores and cafes. A day after the most historic election in
recent memory, the nation seemed stunned and excited by Fox's
decisive triumph over one of the longest ruling political machines
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, people said, marked more than a challenge for
Mexico's president-elect. In words full of optimism, people
expressed pride in the peaceful way their votes were cast and
counted, in the way they overcame their fear of change and embraced
it. And almost everyone interviewed, no matter which candidate they
had supported, emerged with some personal feeling of triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new day for me,'' said Francisco Rosales, 50, while
browsing through classics at a popular bookstore called Ghandi.
``The PRI has been defeated and once they are going everything else
in our lives will be easier. There will be less corruption, less
manipulation, less fear and more participation.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the market near los Pinos, people like Luis Manuel
Dominguez said that they did not expect all of Mexico's troubles to
vanish quickly and that they would be happy with slow, steady steps
toward progress.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans took the first step on Election Day, Dominguez, 38, a
telephone repairman, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time,'' he added as he ate stewed chicken at a
lunch counter, ``we are entering a government that was really
created by the people. This is not a cosmetic victory. It is
real.''
</P>
<P>
   Along a commercial strip in the working-class town of
Nezahuacoyotl, just east of the capital, the celebration of Fox's
victory stretched into the late afternoon Monday. Students waved at
passing cars, holding up their first two fingers, now a well-known
gesture from Fox's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents used to say it was better to vote for someone who
is bad but familiar rather than someone who is good but unknown,''
said Alejandro Robles, a student of veterinary medicine at the
National Autonomous University of Mexico who stood smiling among a
group of Fox supporters even though he had voted for Cardenas. ``I
think young people are ready to try something new.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager of a clothing store showed off the ink that was
rubbed on his thumb at the polls to indicate that he had voted. He
said he had voted for Fox, but he saw the election as a victory for
many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox became president,'' the manager said, ``but the people of
Mexico became a democracy.''

COMMENTARY: JUST DO IT 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As it says in Ecclesiastes, for everything there is a season _ a
time to be born and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to
pluck up what is planted. The same is true in diplomacy _ there is
a time to stall and a time to yak, a time to hide and a time to
decide. For Israelis and Palestinians, this is the season for
deciding, and President Clinton should usher it in by summoning the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders to Camp David for one last
cards-on-the-table, in-your-face, put-up-or-shut-up summit to
finally, finally put an end to this conflict.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been deftly
squeezing the parties to help ensure that a possible Camp David
summit would have a reasonable chance of closing the remaining
gaps. In some cases those gaps have narrowed, in others they remain
a chasm. Never mind. There is only one way to find out whether that
chasm can ever be bridged and that is by bringing together a U.S.
president like Bill Clinton, who is trusted by all the parties; an
Israeli leader like Ehud Barak, who understands what Israel will
have to give for a secure peace; and a Palestinian leader like
Yasser Arafat, who has the stature, and the interest in his dying
days, to make the hard concessions for his own people.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment the Clinton team is considering whether to shake
the dice and just invite the parties to Camp David, even though the
chances of success are 50-50. The Palestinians have been resisting,
until they are assured that they will get all they want and won't
be trapped in a Clinton-Barak vice. Barak has been pushing for the
summit, arguing that the only way he can make big concessions is a
one-time, finish-it-all deal. Clinton has been worried that if the
summit tries and fails, the whole fabric of Arab-Israeli
peacemaking could unravel.
</P>
<P>
   All these concerns notwithstanding, you are never going to have
a better alignment of the stars for making a deal than you have now
in the Clinton-Arafat-Barak trio. If these three leaders can't
close the deal, no one can, and we need to know that now. Trying
and failing won't be any worse than not trying, because without a
framework deal for a final peace, the situation will unravel anyway
_ the Palestinians will unilaterally declare a state by Sept. 13
and Israel will unilaterally annex the West Bank Jewish
settlements, and Lord only knows what will happen after that.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem will be Jerusalem. Barak can muster an
Israeli majority for giving back some 90 percent of the West Bank
(while retaining the 10 percent where 80 percent of the Jewish
settlers live), provided he doesn't appear to be redividing
Jerusalem. Arafat can give up some West Bank land, provided he
doesn't give up the Arab-Muslim claim to Jerusalem. Everyone knows
the solution: Let the Palestinians also have a capital in
Jerusalem, based outside the current municipal boundary in Abu Dis,
and give them authority over the Arab neighborhoods in East
Jerusalem, while the Israelis retain authority over the Jewish
neighborhoods, which become part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis rarely go to the Arab neighborhoods anyway, and they
certainly don't need to worry about their garbage collection. The
Palestinians already have control over the Muslim holy places in
East Jerusalem and the Palestinian neighborhoods there already vote
in Palestinian elections. This sort of practical solution would
still leave Israel with control over the biggest Jewish Jerusalem
in Jewish history _ one that would unite the Jewish neighborhoods
in East and West Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty, with
international recognition. Better to share the city this way, so
Jews will feel free to go anywhere there, than maintain a formal
control everywhere, and Jews will only dare go into their own
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   This is the hard price of peace. You can have it now or after a
lot more bloodshed, but it's not going to change. So let's try now.
If you summon them, they will come; if they come, they will
compromise; if they compromise enough _ maybe you'll have a deal.
The only people who would criticize Bill Clinton for trying and
failing would be those who either don't want a deal or hate him to
begin with _ in other words, the same people who would never give
him credit if he tried and succeeded. So just do it. As it also
says in Ecclesiastes: ``He who observes the wind will not sow; and
he who regards the clouds will not reap.''

   As Fox fielded congratulatory phone calls Monday from world
leaders, including President Clinton, and met with President
Ernesto Zedillo, election returns showed that Mexican voters on
Sunday had handed him a substantially more decisive victory over
the governing party than any poll had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   With 93 percent of the ballots tabulated, the Mexican electoral
agency reported that Fox had won 43 percent of the votes, while
Francisco Labastida, the candidate of the ruling party, won 36
percent and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist candidate, won 17
percent. Fox will take office on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   For many Mexicans, it was still sinking in Monday that after 71
years, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which evolved from a
alliance of revolutionary generals into a model nationalist party
imitated across Latin America before degenerating into a clique of
corrupt insiders, had finally been deposed from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But when the dust settles on the first democratic transition of
power in this country's history, for the first time none of the
major parties _ the deposed one, Fox's center-right party, or the
largest leftist grouping _ will be in control of either house of
Congress. Fox will preside over a government unused to coalition
politics but one in which all major business will require the
consent of one or the other of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the parties are going to have to relearn the art of making
politics,'' said Carlos Elizondo, a political scientist who is
rector of the Center for Research and Teaching in Mexico City.
``The fundamental pillars of Mexico's political system have
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   These unsettled results were reflected around the country. Fox's
National Action Party won the two governor's seats up for grabs on
Sunday and will now govern in seven of Mexico's 31 states. In
Mexico City, Fox's leftist rivals in the former opposition retained
control of the mayor's office but the president-elect's party took
control of the Assembly, the legislative body in this city-state.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Fox will face the ticklish task of meeting the
hopes for quick and sweeping change of the diverse voters who
backed him. He has promised, simultaneously, to modernize the
economy and spur 7 percent growth, carry out sweeping political
reforms, and initiate an ``educational revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He has pledged to better the lot not only of the largely young,
middle-class professionals in his own center-right party, but also
of millions of poor urban workers and farmers who have in the past
supported the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all got to get to work right away,'' Fox said in an
interview early Monday, after his triumph. ``I want to be certain
to deliver good results to the people of Mexico, to govern and to
govern well.''
</P>
<P>
   The election results provoked a debate over how successfully
Zedillo's party would navigate its journey from its powerhouse
position into the ranks of the opposition. Some said that the party
had already proved its adaptability and resilience in states where
Fox's party had already won control of the governor's chair.
</P>
<P>
   But others, comparing the position of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, to some communist parties in
Eastern Europe, argued that without presidential support and
control over federal patronage, the party would crumble.
</P>
<P>
   The party's president during the presidential campaign quickly
announced her resignation, and some party officials said they
feared that a sweeping exodus could follow.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the elections to fill all 128 seats in the Senate
and all 500 in the Chamber of Deputies indicated that Fox's party
would finish with its powers significantly enhanced, mainly at the
expense of the leftist party with which it shared opposition powers
during the last Legislature, but that it would not control a
majority of votes.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI lost the Senate majority it had enjoyed since the
party's creation and without the power of the president to
coordinate its efforts, the PRI's entire legislative delegation
will wield considerably less clout.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's party was receiving 38 percent of the votes for Congress,
the returns showed. The PRI was receiving 36 percent and Cardenas'
party, 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the ballot-counting continued, Zedillo met privately in the
presidential compound with the top PRI leaders, whose power now
rests almost entirely in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Zedillo outlined his views of the unprecedented
survival challenges facing the party, which had gone undefeated in
presidential voting _ often through the simple exercise of its vast
powers of patronage and pork and sometimes through outright ballot
fraud _ for 71 years, longer than any other party in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In a second encounter, Zedillo addressed the 21 of Mexico's 31
state governors who belong to his party, urging them to cooperate
fully with Fox's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to work with the new president in a relation of
respect and collaboration,'' Fernando Silva, the PRI governor of
the north central state of San Luis Potosi, told reporters after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   If Mexico was entering absolutely new political terrain with the
PRI's defeat, neither foreign nor domestic investors appeared
concerned. The Mexican stock market surged 6.1 percent on news of
Fox's victory, and the peso, which had been battered in recent
weeks as nervous Mexicans converted savings to dollars,
strengthened 2.7 percent.

GUARD WOULD HELP FORWARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   He is a rich athlete spending the summer in the city _ Chicago _
in which he grew up poor. Antoine Walker was so poor that he used
to collect the caps off soda bottles to make extra money; so poor
that he dragged a jar full of pennies to the store because that's
all his family had; so poor that he moved from apartment to
apartment, hoping his mother could find a way to pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   The kid who rooted for the pre-Jordan Bulls is wealthy now. He
is 23. He can afford to buy a soda company if he wants. His penny
jars have been replaced by portfolios. His mother now lives
debt-free in a beautiful home.
</P>
<P>
   This is almost your typical rags-to-riches sports tale. If it
sounds too good to be true, there's a good reason for it.
</P>
<P>
   It is.
</P>
<P>
   As an anonymous poor man, Walker worried about getting his
mother $60,000 out of debt. As a famous rich man, the Celtics
captain now has to worry about bodyguards and getting himself home
before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   There are many areas of pro sports that have changed so
dramatically you don't recognize them anymore: free agency,
expansion, sports attorneys (agents), and, yes, rags-to-riches
stories.
</P>
<P>
   At about 4:15 a.m. Sunday, Celtics captain Walker and four
friends were robbed at gunpoint on the Near West Side of Chicago.
The gunman left with $3,000 in cash and a $55,000 gold-and-platinum
Cartier watch. Walker and his friends were waiting outside a
restaurant called Eppels, a place with hours made for the nightclub
crowd: 4 a.m. until 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, no shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is a single man. He loves wearing fine, tailor-made
clothing. He also likes to dance. He (itals)should (unitals)be able
to stay out as long as he wants in a city that doesn't sleep until
5 or 6 a.m. This is the Celtics' offseason, so it's not as if
Walker's late night/early morning will affect his performance
against the Pacers or Knicks. He (itals)should (unitals) be able to
wear a piece of jewelry that exceeds some families' household
incomes. He (itals)should (unitals) be able to socialize with his
friends, and _ unlike the days of his youth _ not worry about who
will pick up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)He should.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   He can't. At least he can't do it the way he is used to doing
it. Not in Chicago, not in Boston, not in New York, not in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before Walker was robbed, Nets point guard Stephon
Marbury had a $150,000, two-foot necklace taken from him as he
waited for a light to change in Manhattan. He was waiting in his
Bentley. It was 3:45 a.m. and Marbury, a native of nearby Brooklyn,
had just left a local nightclub. The man who robbed Marbury of his
diamond-studded necklace also had a gun, a silver 9mm.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't describe Walker as conservative, but he's going to
have to be now. By any measure, he is a visible target. He stands 6
feet 9 inches. He is rich. Not only is he tall and rich, he is
tall, rich, and on television. People recognize him. Most of the
people who recognize him are NBA fans who simply want to applaud or
critique him on his game. But, sadly, once you reach a certain tax
bracket and a stratum of celebrity, there has to be a higher degree
of paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   It means that you can still hang out with your friends, but you
might want to consider hiring a limousine rather than driving your
own car. Walker is loyal to his old friends and doesn't like
bringing a lot of new people into his circle. That's admirable, but
he might want to hire a bodyguard just to be cautious.
</P>
<P>
   It means that you can still own the Cartier watch, but you might
not want to wear it certain places. It means that, while your bank
account swells from endorsement deals and the $71 million contract
you signed in January 1999, you might not want to carry a lot of
cash with you _ certainly not $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Look at that. It all seems so neat and idealistic. If Walker
does that, does it mean he will never be robbed again? Of course
not. Poor people and rich people are targeted every day. You don't
have to be famous to pique the interest of a thief. But given
options on the streets of Chicago at 4 a.m., a man with a gun will
most likely approach the expensive car with the 23-year-old,
well-dressed NBA player in it.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that we have to think this way. One of Walker's
childhood heroes, Michael Jordan, began anticipating problems with
large crowds early in his career. He analyzed crowds and clubs the
same way he analyzed his opponents, and then proceeded
purposefully. Charles Barkley was not as cautious and, although he
was and is a hilarious man of the people, he literally had to pay
for some of his late-night openness.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's dossier includes a toss-'em-threw-a-plate-glass-window
trick at a bar in Orlando, Fla., and a memorable confrontation in
Scottsdale, Ariz. After the Arizona incident, Barkley said he would
rather ``wear a Malcolm X hat to a Klan rally'' than apologize to
his foe.
</P>
<P>
   What this all means for Walker is that he has to ignore what his
calendar tells him. Next month he will be 24, a good age for
all-night dancing in the city he loves. On some nights, though, he
might want to consider doing something what many 24-year-old
clubbers don't: dancing at home.
</P>
<P>
   The kid who grew up rooting for the Bears and wearing jersey No.
11 (in honor of Chicago native Isiah Thomas), will soon find that
for pro athletes, even the cliches have changed:
</P>
<P>
   You can certainly go home again . . . just make sure you have a
bodyguard.

 MEXICO CITY: 2.7 percent. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Investors are very enthusiastic,'' said Rogelio Ramirez,
president of Ecanal, a Mexico City consulting firm. ``The market is
seeing Fox as a man who can bring important changes, in the sense
of modernizing the economy and the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview early Monday, hours after his triumph became
apparent, Fox outlined his hopes to forge tighter relations with
the United States, where he attended high school in Wisconsin and
has traveled extensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, I know well the philosophy of the American
people, because I've worked all my life there both in business and
in politics,'' he said. ``I know that we are going to be able to
accomplish many things together. We can develop our great
potential, which still stretches before us. I want to work
intensely with the United States because it is the world's largest
market, it's our neighbor, it's our partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox offered words of conciliation to Labastida and to Cardenas,
with both of whom he had traded extraordinarily harsh criticisms
during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I send him my regards, I recognize his participation and his
passion in defending his ideas,'' Fox said of Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory speech, Fox said he would withdraw the libel suit
he filed last week against his rivals, who had accused him, without
providing documentation, of accepting illegal campaign donations
from a Belgian company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is going to be a government of national concord, a
government of unity, a government with its eyes fixed on the
future, a government that we're going to build with the help of all
Mexicans,'' Fox said in the speech. ``I think that's the way to
build the great nation that we all dream about.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Fox spent several hours at the downtown Mexico City
hotel that had been his residence for a year, greeting
well-wishers, speaking to reporters, and speaking to foreign
leaders by phone.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called Fox Monday morning, said Jorge
Castaneda, an adviser to Fox. ``Clinton was very cordial, very
supportive, in general and in particular,'' Castaneda said that Fox
told him. ``Fox committed himself to a meeting with Clinton before
Clinton leaves office. They had a very pleasant conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Several delegations of international observers on Monday praised
the elections as well-organized and fraud-free.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter called the elections ``a turning point of great
significance for all those who love freedom and democracy.'' He
said reforms implemented by an autonomous federal electoral agency
since the 1994 presidential balloting ``turned out to be almost
perfect''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, analysts were scratching their head about why Fox's
victory was far more sweeping than most public opinion surveys had
predicted. Several polls had shown Fox and Labastida to be running
neck and neck, but preliminary results show that Fox won by a
9-point margin.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Reforma wrote Monday that the nearly 20 percent of
Mexican voters who said they were undecided before the vote, had in
reality been planning to vote for Fox, but had been disguising
their anti-government sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Greenberg, the American pollster who worked on contract
to the PRI during the campaign, said that Labastida's candidacy was
doomed when he failed to compete with Fox among the young, urban
middle-class voters whose portion of the Mexican electorate is
growing fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the country's changing demographics, given the
globalization of its economy, all the changes in Mexico, Labastida
and the PRI simply had to attract votes beyond their longtime base
in the rural areas,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas not only went down to his worst defeat in three
presidential bids, but also saw his leftist party's power in
Congress reduced considerably, the returns show. The party's only
bright spot was the election of Andres Manuel Lopez to a six-year
term at the head of the Mexico City government, which will remain
the party's stronghold.

<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Around the gym, 17-year-old Cheryl Haworth goes
by the nickname Fun. She merrily sings a ``Simpsons'' ditty about
our most ineffective presidents, rattles off the polysyllabic names
of the body's most obscure muscles, knows most of ``The Raven'' by
heart and is an award-winning artist whose lifelike drawings
resemble photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet a senior in high school, Haworth is also the best
American hope, man or woman, for an Olympic medal in weight lifting
at the Summer Games in September, and she has picked up two phrases
of Chinese that may help in communicating with her top competition
in Sydney, Australia. The problem is, she learned the words from
television's most irreverent character, Bart Simpson, who taught
her to say, ``Here are your eyes, sir,'' and ``You can never have
enough slave laborers.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe this is not exactly in keeping with the Olympic spirit
of international brotherhood. She might as well slip a whoopee
cushion to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Olympic president, at the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I won't be saying those things to anybody,'' Haworth said
with a laugh. ``How do you know if they're true? I heard them on
`The Simpsons.'''
</P>
<P>
   Women's weight lifting will be a medal sport for the first time
in Sydney, and at 5 feet 9 inches and 300 pounds, Haworth will
provide a riveting presence in the superheavyweight division with
her size, agility, speed, balance and ballistic strength. She took
a bronze medal at the 1999 world championships and won a
preliminary Olympic event four months ago in Sydney, having deftly
translated her raw power into the technique and velocity necessary
to succeed in international weight lifting.
</P>
<P>
   She can run the 40-yard dash in 5.5 seconds, has a 30-inch
vertical leap, has the flexibility to do a full split and, from a
standing start, jumps on and off wooden boxes standing two and a
half feet high to increase the fast-twitch explosiveness in her
legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of football coaches come in here, and I think they would
die for someone that fast, flexible and strong,'' said Michael
Cohen, Haworth's personal coach, who will also coach the American
women in Sydney. ``I've never seen another woman that strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Haworth, 19, was sitting in a restaurant with her family,
urging a visitor to squeeze her sister's arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel her biceps,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one city in which a woman flexing her biceps in a
family restaurant would not be considered out of place, it is
Savannah, immortalized for its florid eccentricities in the book
``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.'' A tour group had just
trooped through the restaurant, looking for the tunnel that pirates
once used to smuggle forced laborers onto ships in the Savannah
River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead, feel,'' Beth Haworth insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth flexed her left arm, and the muscle was as hard as the
restaurant's peach cobbler was soft. Her left arm is the smaller,
Haworth said, but the biceps still measures 17 inches in
circumference, the same size as the visitor's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now feel her quads,'' Beth Haworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth flexed her thigh muscles, which felt as sturdy as the
moss-draped canopy oaks that tower over Savannah's historic
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-two inches,'' Beth Haworth said proudly. ``Bigger than
my waist.''
</P>
<P>
   Haworth wears her hair pulled tightly behind her head, and
sometimes, she said, people see her wide face and dark features and
ask whether she is Samoan. Once, for television cameras, she
hoisted her sister overhead as if she were a barbell. Another time,
she and a group of friends lifted another friend's car and moved it
across a parking lot. People are always asking her to pick them up.
On ``The Tonight Show,'' the actor Damon Wayans jumped into her
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Good-naturedly, she declines to lift people when they ask. She
is an athlete, not a sideshow performer. Yet she also appears to be
extremely comfortable with her size in a society that often demands
that women be sliced as thin as corned beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of 17-year-olds don't weigh 300 pounds, but I was
never really discouraged because I was so big,'' Haworth said.
``It's who I was, who I am. I knew I wasn't the right size or shape
for certain things, but I didn't let it bother me. I decided to
look for something else.''
</P>
<P>
   A sickly child, Haworth had her tonsils and adenoids removed
when she was 6, and as she grew healthier, she began to gain
weight, says her mother, Sheila, who is a registered nurse. Sheila
Haworth consulted dietitians, but she decided that it was not
proper to put a young girl on a diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my daughter sits down and says she is still hungry, I'd
feed her again,'' Sheila Haworth said. ``I don't want her hating me
or for this to be a battleground. I give her fat-free milk at home,
fruit, good food. If she's going to be big, she'll be big.''
</P>
<P>
   At 13, looking to increase her strength for playing softball,
Haworth visited the Paul Anderson-Howard Cohen Gym, where Team
Savannah, a weight lifting club, does its training. The Haworths
are an athletic family. Bob Haworth, the father, played freshman
football and wrestled at the University of Nebraska in the early
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Haworth always appeared to be strong as a young girl, her father
said. She built treehouses in the family's rural neighborhood.
``And she arm-wrestled boys on the bus _ once,'' he said, laughing.
But it was her first day in the gym that showed him just how
extraordinary her strength could be. Haworth lifted 110 pounds to
her chest ``like it was a broomstick,'' said Cohen, who would
become her coach.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sheryl Cohen, worked with Haworth for 10 minutes and
then reported to him, ``She's the strongest girl I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As her weight-lifting skills improved, so did her
self-confidence, Beth Haworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember people would pick on her, call her fat, and you
could tell her feelings were upset,'' Beth Haworth said. ``Now, I
don't think anyone would be caught dead calling her a bad name.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years after she began lifting, Haworth entered the 1999
Pan American Games in Winnipeg. During the competition, she grabbed
the bar with 246 pounds attached and moved it slightly, away from a
stationary television camera. The crowd gasped. She won the event.
Her coach said a veteran Colombian lifter, Maria Isabel Urrutia,
was so inconsolable, she vowed to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit,'' Urrutia said, according to Cohen. ``I let a
16-year-old beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   In competition, Haworth has lifted 264 pounds in the snatch and
319 in the clean and jerk, the two types of Olympic lifting. This
combined weight of 583 pounds is about 20 pounds short of the world
record. If she remains with the sport through the 2004 Summer
Olympics in Athens, Cohen said, he expects that she will be lifting
700 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   On an afternoon in early June, Haworth was simply warming up for
a state competition the next day. She placed 100 pounds on the bar
and snatched it over her head with little effort, then did several
lifts with 150 pounds. In a snatch lift, the bar is brought from
the floor to overhead in one ballistic motion lasting seven-tenths
of a second, which requires remarkable speed, flexibility and
balance in getting under the bar, along with tremendous strength in
the legs, hips and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at her hamstring,'' Cohen said as Haworth rested in a
chair between lifts, the muscle hanging like a hammock on the back
of her right leg. ``In a normal person that size, that would be
fat. But that is muscle dripping off her leg.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clean and jerk, the bar is brought first to the
shoulders, then propelled over the head with an explosive
scissoring of the legs. Speed and position are not as important as
in the snatch, but strength is far more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just playing with it,'' Cohen said as Haworth lifted 255
pounds over her head. ``She's never missed a jerk. If she gets it
to her chest, she'll get it over her head.''
</P>
<P>
   Is she in good health at 300 pounds? Yes, said Mike Popson, the
head trainer for Team Savannah and the USA Weightlifting. Haworth
received a clean bill of health on a thyroid checkup, and while
weight increases the risks for diabetes and heart problems, Popson
said, Haworth is being monitored. ``She's healthy and strong as an
ox, as far as I'm concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The staff at Team Savannah would like Haworth to lose some
weight eventually, and she will begin working closely with a
dietitian, Popson said. As she gets older and continues to train
vigorously, Popson and Cohen also expect Haworth to replace some of
her body fat with lean muscle. Her only health concern at the
moment is a bulging disk in her back _ a chronic weight lifting
concern _ for which she receives weekly treatment from a
chiropractor.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is a former high school health teacher, and he believes
that anorexia and bulimia pose a bigger hazard than overeating does
for teen-age girls. ``Girls are taught that they've got to be under
100 pounds and wafer thin,'' Cohen said. ``That's ridiculous.
That's dangerous. If a child is healthy and comfortable, that's
what you want. Cheryl says: `I'm bigger than most people and I
don't care. Like me or not for what I am.' If you're not healthy,
you're not going to be lifting that kind of weight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Haworths live on the southwestern edge of Savannah, in a
bucolic neighborhood that was once the Wild Heron Plantation.
Behind the family house in a fenced-in, overgrown area is a slave
graveyard. Overlooking the backyard, in her father's home office,
is a drawing board at which Haworth excels at her other passion,
art.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth grade, she stunned her mother with a reproduction
of Van Gogh's ``Starry, Starry Night.'' She will be a senior in the
fall at the Savannah Arts Academy, and with a pencil drawing of one
of her training partners, she recently won first place in a contest
sponsored by the Savannah College of Art and Design.
</P>
<P>
   She has an IQ of 135, and like many highly intelligent children,
she said she found herself growing unenthusiastic about things that
did not interest or challenge her. But art and weight lifting have
engrossed her, because she is good at both, because they are alike
and because they are different _ one wholly subjective, the other
completely objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both take a lot of concentration, and technique, and they
both force you to finish something,'' Haworth said. ``In weight
lifting, you are always improving. It's always structured. You
never wonder if you're good or not.''

   PORTLAND, Conn. _ Mike Meehan, a geologist who once explored for
coal in the Appalachian Mountains, is supervising a crew of four
men and a canary yellow backhoe, clawing away at the cliffs of the
country's only operating brownstone quarry, trying to fill the
orders that come pouring in every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``See those chunks with the CU on 'em?'' he asked, pointing to
some big rocks the color of fudge and the size of a Doberman's
doghouse. ``They're for the Cooper Union in New York City. And
those over there are going to the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul
in Providence, and that's a stoop going to Yale. Those pieces there
are for the cornice trim on a new house going up in the Farmington
Valley.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brownstone is back. That somber yet elegant cloak for more than
50,000 row houses, from Baltimore to Boston, was revered during the
so-called Brown Decades of the mid-19th century, then reviled by
the century's turn, when gleaming white limestone and marble
captivated the public.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six decades, Portland's quarries _ which produced
an estimated 80 percent of New York City's brownstone _ have been
largely forgotten by the outside world. Already moribund by the
start of the Great Depression, they filled with water after the
flood of 1936 and the hurricane of 1938, were discovered by
teen-agers as a make-out spot and were adopted by fishermen who
stealthily hunt big bass near the towering brownstone cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   But preservationists and planners are beginning to see a new
future for the formidable stone. Architects have started using it
to give a touch of historical sobriety to gaudy mansionettes, and
conservators have begun renewing the elegant facades of grand
monuments like the Cooper Union on Astor Place in Manhattan, where
Abraham Lincoln addressed crowds before the 1860 election. On May
16, the Department of the Interior gave three quarries in Portland
status as a national historic landmark, recognizing a role that
dates to colonial times.
</P>
<P>
   But just as this Connecticut River town in the center of the
state sponsors brainstorming sessions on how to lure visitors to
its first would-be tourist attraction, the two defunct quarries,
the re-opening of the third Portland quarry has set off a debate on
whether brownstone should be used at all.
</P>
<P>
   Because the terrible secret is that brownstone _ ``the very
blood and fiber of New York City,'' in the words of Vincent Scully,
a professor emeritus at Yale University _ is not really much good
as a building material. The same quality that gives brownstone its
charm, making it easy to quarry and easy to carve, also makes it
exquisitely vulnerable to harsh weather and the passage of time,
especially if the stone is installed improperly and is maintained
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Albany, built
in 1848 from Portland stone, its preservation architect, John
Mesick, said, ``you can take your hand and pull off chunks as big
as apple pies.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan, many of the most magnificent
brownstone houses, the ones that date from the Civil War era, are
in danger of losing their sweeping balustraded staircases and their
entire facades. At the National Arts Club, in Gramercy Park in
Manhattan, the brownstone, like a chocolate bar left on the
dashboard on a summer day, just seemed to melt.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Herrera, director of technical services at the New York
Landmarks Conservancy, said that the brownstone veneer on the
facades on some of the houses began to fall off a few years after
they were built. ``Historical records state that some started
deteriorating 10, 20, 30 years later,'' he said. ``Brownstone is
not a consistent material: some of it is OK, and some is perfectly
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone is building all-new brownstone houses; the
architect Philip Johnson was the last to use it in a major way, for
the Bobst Library at New York University back in the 1960s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is brownstone repair and replacement that is being
debated in classrooms, at special seminars and landmark
commissions. Should the real brownstone be used, or a cheap ``cut
and cover'' brown stucco coating favored by contractors?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very controversial subject right now,'' said Paul
Byard, dean of Columbia University's preservation program, and the
architect for the Cooper Union's $12 million brownstone
restoration, the largest in history.
</P>
<P>
   Byard has chosen Portland brownstone, which he says is authentic
and should last for at least six decades if maintained, and the
joints kept properly full of mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Mesick says he will not use it on the Albany Cathedral and is
combing the Ruhr Valley in Germany and southern Scotland for
brownstone that doesn't spall, or flake off, the way he says the
Connecticut stone does. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is even a long-running debate on whether it is
aesthetically pleasing. While many still find the stone beautiful,
Edith Wharton could not stand the stuff. In a memoir published four
years before the Portland quarries shut down, she told of her
childhood return to New York from Europe, her writer's voice
dripping with disappointment at ``this low-studded rectangular New
York, cursed with its universal chocolate-colored coating of the
most hideous stone ever quarried.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The brownstone of the Portland quarries was formed roughly 200
million years ago, when Connecticut was a hot and humid savanna,
with a major rainy season that created streams and rivers that
eroded the Paleozoic rocks of the Eastern Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   As the rains tapered off, the dinosaurs lumbered through,
leaving their footprints in the mud _ footprints that are still
being uncovered by Meehan's crew at the quarry, who spend part of
their time each day showing off the prints to schoolchildren and
other visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The streams left deposits of mudstone, shale and sand. This
sediment, composed of quartz, mica and feldspar, became
brownstone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The English first settled Portland in the 1600s, using the
reddish-brown stone _ far easier to carve than granite _ for
gravestones. During the 1700s, the town operated one of the
quarries and offered the stone free to its inhabitants. By the
mid-19th century, the quarries were controlled by three main
companies, and they employed 1,500 workers, a third them Irish.
Over the years, the quarries sent more than 5 million cubic yards
of brownstone down the Connecticut River.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While some blasting was involved, much of it just fell away from
the cliffs, not unlike the way it is now falling from facades.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lewis, a geologist who was in Portland for a recent
seminar on the quarries, said brownstone ``erodes very quickly,
it's very soft,'' adding, ``And if you build with the wrong layer,
it flakes off.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened with so many of New York City's
brownstones _ they were built with the wrong layer.
</P>
<P>
   Everett H. Ortner, who in 1968 helped found the Brownstone
Revival Committee in New York City, said, ``In the beginning, they
selected the very best material.'' But with the speculative rush in
the post-Civil War years, the quality went downhill fast. ``Stone
had always been the material of the aristocracy, and wood or brick
that of the middle class,'' Ortner said. ``Suddenly the middle
class could have the permanence _ an impression of permanence that
wood never could have.''
</P>
<P>
   In the brownstone heydey, quarries operated up and down the East
Coast, from Patterson, N.J., to Longmeadow. Mass., and beyond.
Portland's was the biggest, but alas, its stone was one of the
softest. Ten years ago, the Society for the Preservation of New
England Antiquities bluntly declared in a brochure on brownstone
care, ``Portland brownstone is notorious for its poor durability.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, the quarry owner, as well as the local town officials
here, dispute that contention.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, 50, plans to ship 1,250 tons from his small quarry this
year, about $500,000 worth of stone. He just sent out 11 truckloads
of brownstone to add decorative accents to a 40,000-square-foot
house going up in Michigan. A new saw from Italy is on order,
designed to bore down into the rock after he has exhausted the
cliffs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked about brownstone's reputation as a fragile building
material, Edward L. Kalinowski, Portland's First Selectman, said
``I don't believe it.'' Kalinowski's grandfather worked in the
quarries until the mid-1930s, when a giant slab of rock crushed his
leg.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that Portland stone did not last, he and others say,
was either because it was installed improperly, or because bad
stone was used.
</P>
<P>
   When the quarries were running at a normal pace, half of the
brownstone was thrown away, used for railway embankments or crushed
for gravel. But in the mid-1800s, the pressure was on to produce
more and more stone for building facades in America's major cities.
According to historians, Portland began shipping some substandard
material. ``In the brownstone heyday, the speculators didn't
care,'' said Alison Guinness, the curator of the Connecticut River
Museum and the author of a paper on the Portland quarry history.
``They just wanted it, and they slapped it up,''
</P>
<P>
   The brownstone was meant to be installed with its striations
facing out and the flat side facing up. Unfortunately, it was
easier, quicker and cheaper (and better looking, too) for the
builders to place it on the front of a building with its flat side
facing out. Meehan, the quarry owner, explained: ``It's like a
book; if you put it out in the rain with its spine facing up, the
water will run down the pages. If you lay it down flat, the water
won't get inside.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why there are so few gravestones left: they were stuck
in the ground with the flat side facing the front. The rain soaked
into the striations, and the stone fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last century, decaying stone was largely repaired by
chipping it off and applying a brown-colored stucco. How many row
houses have been treated this way? ``Are you kidding?'' Herrera
responded. ``Thousands.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the patches fade and change color, they begin to look like
camouflage. The stucco mixture also must be perfect, he said,
``otherwise, it's like chocolate pudding.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, experts say, masonry contractors are persuading
some homeowners to chip away everything and replace the whole
facade with a stucco that includes cement, at a cost that can range
from $20,000 to $60,000, depending on the contractor. This
approach, which critics say lasts 20 years at the most, makes
preservationists tremble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially since they re-opened the Portland quarry, I like to
see real stone for replacement,'' said Ivan Myjer, a stone
conservator from Boston who directed the restoration at St. John
the Divine in New York City. Myjer, who hand-picked the stone for
the Cooper Union and is supervising its use, argues that real
brownstone can be installed for probably no more than $60,000 and
lasts longer than a cement job, between 60 and 100 years, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the favored method in New York City is still cement, even
for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Adami, a masonry contractor who specializes in brownstone
restoration, recently finished a brownstone-colored cement job and
total renovation on Garfield Place in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which
he said cost over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's in the stock market _ he makes $300,000 a minute _
and he had his own face, his wife's face, his two daughter's faces
cast and put at the top of columns in front of his house,'' the
contractor said. ``Now that's a brownstone restoration job!''

SPORTS COLUMN: PIAZZA ILLUMINATES AN OBSCURE RBI RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, the streak seems to be one of those arcane
achievements that only a statistics freak could know or care about.
How significant could it be that Mike Piazza was approaching the
major league record for driving in runs in consecutive games when
the record-holder wasn't Hack Wilson or Lou Gehrig or Babe Ruth or
anyone else of that stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the importance of the streak record is judged by who
holds it rather than by what it represents,'' said Steve Hirdt, an
executive with Elias Sports Bureau, keeper of Major League Baseball
statistics and records. ``I think there would be general unanimity
in baseball that driving in runs is at least as important as
getting a hit. Yet there are 5-year-olds who would know chapter and
verse of Joe DiMaggio's hitting-streak record while people who make
their living playing or covering baseball try to belittle this
record simply because the guy who holds it is someone whom they
have never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Grimes was not Joe DiMaggio, or Lou Gehrig or Babe Ruth, for
that matter. In 1922, Grimes, a first baseman with the Chicago
Cubs, drove in runs in 17 consecutive games. Chances are no one
thought much about it at the time, but nobody had produced such a
streak before Grimes did it and no one has done it since.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes was an unexceptional player. He had a relatively short
career, playing 432 games in five seasons after getting into one
game in 1920. The season in which he established the record was a
career year for him because he drove in 99 of his career 263 runs
batted in. But Grimes' record stands 78 years later. DiMaggio's
56-game hitting streak is only 59 years old.
</P>
<P>
   When Wilson knocked in what remains a major league-record 191
runs in 1930, he didn't threaten Grimes' record. Elias research
found that the longest stretch in which he drove in at least one
run was 11 games. The next season Gehrig drove in what continues to
be the American League record, 184 runs. His best streak: 10 games.
In 1937, Hank Greenberg drove in 183 runs. He knocked in runs in 11
successive games at one stretch.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Sammy Sosa drove in 299 runs for the Cubs the
previous two seasons, and each season his longest consecutive-game
RBI streak was 5. Five games (twice) was the limit, too, for Manny
Ramirez last year when he knocked in 165 runs for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   While Ramirez was unable to go beyond five in a row, Mike
Sweeney of Kansas City made it to 13 games in succession a year ago
Tuesday, tying the American League record set by Taffy Wright of
the Chicago White Sox in 1941, the year of DiMaggio's hitting
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza reached 13 last Friday night when he beat Atlanta with a
dramatic three-run home run in the eighth inning. A two-run home
run in the third inning the next day extended the catcher's streak
to 14, and in what appeared at the time could be his last at-bat of
the day, he reached 15 Sunday by lashing a home run in the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's hitting streak is often cited as the record least
likely to be broken. But why has it received so much attention over
the years while Grimes and his record have been completely ignored?
Is Steve Hirdt right, that the identify of the player determines
the perceived importance of the record?
</P>
<P>
   A reasonable argument can be made that maintaining an RBI streak
is harder than running off a hitting streak. A batter needs no help
in building a hitting streak. A single here, a double there, and a
streak continues. To build an RBI streak, a player needs help. His
teammates have to get on base so he can drive them in. He can do it
himself occasionally with a home run, but no one has ever hit home
runs in 17 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Piazza's RBIs in the 15 games were critical to the
outcome. He won the Friday night game against Atlanta, he gave the
Mets the lead in six other games and he knocked in the tying run in
three games. The home run Piazza hit Sunday was his eighth in his
RBI streak and raised his RBI total in that span to 28.
</P>
<P>
   The streak has catapulted him to the front of the race for the
National League Most Valuable Player award. Although one view might
have it that Piazza has been the league's MVP the first half of the
season, some more cautious people like editors might want to slip
in the hedge word ``perhaps,'' leaving open the possibility that
someone else has been the MVP. It says here without equivocation
that if there were a half-season award, Piazza could step right up
and collect it.

SO MANY WAYS TO DIAL HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use on Sunday, July 9) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology has eliminated certain problems of calling home from
Europe: Belle Epoque hotel instruments, non-English-speaking
operators and wavering connections. The new problems arise from the
technology and its overflow of possibilities: you can buy a cell
phone compatible with European services, or rent one; sign up for
an international program with your regular phone company, or sign
up for another overseas service.
</P>
<P>
   For those preparing for a trip, here is a review of a very few
of the newer possibilities. It's impossible to be comprehensive in
a field that is changing so fast: on June 27, the Justice
Department moved to block Worldcom, which absorbed MCI in 1998,
from acquiring Sprint. Before picking any of the options below, be
sure to ask how _ and if _ the service works in your destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Experts describe the international cell-phone picture as a Tower
of Babel. Almost all wireless companies in Europe and the Middle
East use the same digital technology, GSM, or global system for
mobile communication. But the United States apparently got left
behind on this. Most companies here use quite a number of other
technologies and frequencies, so most cell phones in the United
States will not work overseas.
</P>
<P>
   This gave rise to the idea of renting cell phones to passengers
going overseas. International Mobile Communications, in Bethesda,
Md., offers its WorldCell for rent. Patrice Brown, a marketing
executive, said the company ships rental Nokia and Motorola phones,
which work in 100 countries, to clients by overnight courier. It
costs $75 for the first week, $50 for extra weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Calls on these phones may be charged to calling cards, or a plan
may be established with WorldCell. Brown said that a typical call
to the United States from France would cost $2.69 a minute, from
Britain, $2.91, and from Italy, $2.34. If the renter elects prepaid
air time, flat rates of $3.99 or $4.99 a minute would apply
worldwide. International Mobile Communications: (888) 967-5323,
www.worldcell.com.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel Communications has brought out a dual-mode Motorola phone
that operates in a number of United States metropolitan areas and
70 countries overseas. It incorporates GSM with iDEN, the company's
frequency for the Western Hemisphere. Daisann McLane, who writes
the Frugal Traveler for The Times, took a Nextel to Spain in the
spring. When she called from Madrid, her editor said it sounded as
if she were next door. McLane said that the outgoing calls worked
much better than incoming ones from overseas; she said most calls
to her were routed to her e-mail or to a recording saying her line
was busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big advantage was the ability to make local calls,'' she
said. ``Once, I got lost looking for my house rental in the Canary
Islands. I used it to call the rental agent, who guided me to my
destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from major metropolitan areas in rural Spain, the
connection sometimes faltered, McLane said. She said a cell phone
in her backpack reduced her worry about hiking alone. Asian
coverage is a mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
   The Nextel Motorola i2000 costs $199. Per-minute rates range
from 99 cents in France to $5.99 in Russia. Nextel: (800) 639-8359;
www.nextel.com/worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream Wireless, formerly Omnipoint, sells two dual-band
cell phones, the Ericsson I-888 and the Motorola L-7089, for
$299.95 each. The monthly service plan is $19.99; calls are
additional. To take the phone overseas, the owner must have a
credit record acceptable to VoiceStream; otherwise there is a delay
of six months after purchase. VoiceStream also has a rental plan
for various models for $29 a week, which includes overnight
delivery and prepaid return of the phone. Peter Sandusky, head of
international marketing, said the rental rate was lower than the
competition because VoiceStream's business is selling phone calls.
A freeze of $300 is put on the client's credit card against return
of the phone and $300 more for the data card, or SIM, that is put
into it. Per-minute rates from Britain start at $2.20; from Italy,
$1.40; and from France, $1.60. VoiceStream: (877) 666-4246;

</P>
<P>
   In many GSM countries, inexpensive cell phones are available
with prepaid cards, a way to use a cell phone for a few weeks
without monthly charges. Small European towns often have cell-phone
sales offices. The www.gsm.org site lists all GSM countries,
service providers in each and some of their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The older possibilities are international calling plans offered
by domestic phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint created a program this spring that is not linked to its
regular domestic billing or to calling cards: It uses credit cards.
A call made through the program, called You, costs $3 for the
connection, plus $1.25 a minute. The plan is available in 50
countries, islands and cities worldwide, with the focus on the
Caribbean. In each country there is an access code that leads to an
English-speaking operator. Travelers overseas may learn the access
code through a collect call to (913) 624-5336; wallet guides are
also available at some airports and Sprint centers in the United
States. Sprint: (800) 877-4646. The Web site, www.youcallhome.com,
is incomplete but contains the access codes.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom this spring began a sign-up plan with a $3 monthly
charge, local access numbers and per-minute charges based on the
country where the call is made or going to. Weekend rates are
lower, with the weekend starting at midnight Friday in the place
being called. A call from France is 17 cents a minute during the
week; 9 cents weekends; from Britain, rates are 10 cents and 9
cents, and from Italy, 17 cents and 9 cents. Access codes are on
the Web site. MCI International Weekends: (800) 759-1697,
www.mci.com/international.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Direct also uses local access numbers for an operator or
dial tone in the United States. The call is billed to an AT&AMP;T
calling card or Universal Card, some local phone cards or is placed
collect. A directory of access numbers is available at the Web
site. Various rate plans bring prices down toward costs of domestic
calls. Without these plans, all AT&AMP;T Direct calls have an initial
fee of $4.50 on the first minute, bringing a one-minute call home
from Britain to $7.32; from France, $7.15; from Italy, $7.40. AT&AMP;T
Direct: (800) 331-1140, www.att.com/traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Under call-back systems, the overseas caller dials a special
number, lets it ring once and hangs up. The caller then gets a call
back, which offers either a dial tone or a computerized voice
prompt or United States operator asking for the customer by name:
the call is then placed as a domestic call.
</P>
<P>
   To set this up, the traveler must first call to establish the
overseas number being used. This was ideal for a colleague's
daughter staying in an apartment in Florence; not so good for
someone changing cities daily. Kallback in Seattle says it is the
oldest company in this line of business. One plan costs $10 a
month, plus $2 a month for each overseas number in the system;
rates are less than a dollar a minute for most European countries.
Kallback: (800) 959-5255, fax (800) 949-5255.

PUTIN CONSIDERING TIGHTER MONEY SUPPLY TO CURB INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, warned Monday that
inflation is rising an annual rate of nearly 35 percent, a trend
economists say could severely strain incomes of ordinary Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who is making his first attempts at formulating economic
policy, was quoted as suggesting at a Kremlin meeting that the
government should take steps to slow the pace of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The president met with cabinet ministers and with the chairman
of the Russian central bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, according to the
Interfax news agency, but it was unclear from the accounts of the
meeting what such anti-inflation steps might be.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities included restricting the sharp growth in the
supply of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money supply is more than what the economy can consume,''
Putin said. ``If these processes continue, every citizen will feel
the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Inflation is a pressing concern for Russian households, which
have suffered devastating losses in the value of their savings
because of price spirals and currency devaluations since the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Although the exchange value of the ruble has risen markedly the
last few months, many Russians are still suffering the effects of a
ruble devaluation nearly two years ago, when the government
defaulted on billions of dollars worth of debt payments. Russian
exporters, conversely, have benefited because a cheaper ruble has
lowered production costs at home and increased sales abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's problem today, paradoxically, is that its economy is
doing too well. The trade surplus, a barometer of export strength,
is nearing $30 billion, and economic growth exceeded 8 percent in
the first quarter. Now with the economy growing quickly, the high
demand for rubles has expanded the money supply, spurring
inflation. Industries may now lose some of the benefits of the
devaluation if the government tightens monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is ticking,'' said Roland Nash, chief economist at
Renaissance Capital in Moscow. ``The window of opportunity they
have from the devaluation is closing _ more quickly than the
government was expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary inflation figures showed that June consumer prices
rose 2.5 percent from May. That is an annual rate of about 35
percent, which economists say is unsustainable for Russia's
economy. The money supply is up about 29 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, company profits have improved sharply. Oil companies, the
country's main exporters, have reported strong 1999 profits, in
part from the rising price of petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great problem to have,'' said Peter Boone, director of
research here at the brokerage firm Brunswick Warburg. ``Companies
are so cash-rich at the moment that even a 10 percent appreciation
of the ruble wouldn't make that much difference in their daily
lives.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is enamored of Hendrie. For instance,
Thousand Oaks homemaker Miriam Jaffe, who is in her 70s, says she
has complained to KFI about Hendrie, because his obviously fake
interviewing style so upsets her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just stirs up trouble to boost his ratings,'' Jaffe said.
``And he's raunchy. I listened for several months before I realized
he was doing all the voices. When he went on the air and said
people who own powerful cars should be entitled to drive faster
than everyone else, even in the rain, I got absolutely livid. Some
punk could be listening and could take it seriously. I wrote to the
station and said, `Please, don't you realize people could be
killed.' It's gone beyond entertainment. He's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hendrie says there are already enough disclaimers
in the world and he doesn't feel he should have to offer one on his
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the research shows 90 percent of my audience knows
exactly what's going on,'' Hendrie insists. ``And the 2 percent we
let on the air has absolutely no idea. I mean, is there an honest
show out there? We're all in this thing for ratings, and we all
have to swim in the same water. Even Michael Jackson is putting it
on for everybody. Stern is putting it on. Mr. KABC is putting it
on. There is no such thing as honest dialogue. All we care about is
holding onto our jobs from one month to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing to think so many apparently miss the point. The
giveaway is always the mad opinion expressed by the ``guest,''
Hendrie says.
</P>
<P>
   Those guests include Wireman, a 78-year-old retired San Marino
civil rights attorney; Gray, a 53-year-old journalist whose
syndicated column is called ``A Little Bird Told Me''; Bozell, a
lawsuit-happy 40-year-old construction crew manager from Corona;
and Collins, a thick-as-a-brick 16-year-old Chatsworth high school
kid.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, Hendrie posed as the author of a book that
claims angels are indeed living on Earth with mortals, but they've
begun molesting humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played the part of this guy who wrote a book called `Groped
by an Angel,''' Hendrie said. ``You would think that something so
far out couldn't possibly be taken seriously. But we got about a
half-hour's worth of callers who believed this might be taking
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer adds: ``People who think they like Phil's show like it
a lot more when they know it's him doing the voices.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrie's menagerie includes about 20 voices, of which he uses
about a dozen regularly. It all started when he was a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was around 6 when I began doing James Mason,'' Hendrie
recalled. ``And I grew up laughing at people like Laurel and Hardy
and Jackie Gleason. Then, I got turned on to Lenny Bruce, which was
a life-changing event. And Frank Zappa came into my life when I was
a teen-ager, and I threw it all together. I started looking at
radio as a theatrical enterprise and thought it would be fun if we
could take old radio theater and utilize modern idioms. I always
thought radio could be viewed as an entertainment medium rather
than this embarrassed stepsister to TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily show preparation takes three hours, beginning when Hendrie
writer Melissa Morgan comes in with a pile of ideas and begins
kicking them around with the host.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrie admits that without prep, the program would fall flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did wing it, I would kill myself,'' he said. ``I'm not
that good. I have to sit down for three hours with our writer and
producer and slug it out to come up with material.''
</P>
<P>
   As for competition on the dial, Hendrie refuses to discuss
Leykis except in general terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of guys in L.A. wanting to keep their jobs, so
they get really conservative,'' he said. ``You have a market where
the very thing that got you here, you stop doing when you get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrie believes his show will begin to show real growth after
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to stabilize the audience and bring Phil Hendrie fans
on board,'' he said. ``There won't be a 90-day turnaround. But I
have no doubt we have the most entertaining show in
afternoon-drive. It's new for KFI and some people don't know what
to make of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I've had to battle for the last 10 years.'' &QL;

THE MANY VOICES OF PAUL HENDRIE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phil Hendrie talks to himself for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you know what that entails if you've ever flipped
over to news-talk radio KFI-AM (640) any weekday from 4 to 7 p.m.
and heard Hendrie jawing with such outrageous guests as Harvey
Wireman, Margaret Gray, Steve Bozell or R.C. Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, those are just a few of Hendrie's many alter-egos _
men, women and children _ and if you listen long enough, it becomes
plain the host is doing ALL the talking.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Hendrie is getting paid to carry on seamless,
artful and often overheated conversations with himself. Hendrie's
meticulously crafted act reaches from a high-tech studio in Sherman
Oaks to 61 cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   By holding a telephone about seven inches from his face and
disguising his voice, Hendrie interviews Wireman, Gray, Bozell and
all the rest during what's probably the most theatrical and
subversive program on the radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hendrie's daily three-hour performance art piece
continually draws uncomprehending callers who haven't figured out
the show's plain- as-day secret: that it's Hendrie and only Hendrie
behind the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   The show hinges on those listeners from places like Tampa, Fla.;
Atlanta; Culver City; and Long Beach who are angered at the crazed
opinions Hendrie (as Gray or Bozell, etc.) puts on the air. Call it
interactive improv.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent show, for example, Hendrie, playing the part of
favorite made-up character Colleen Christen Brewster, a Laguna
Beach travel agent, argued that Darva Conger, the woman who married
TV's multimillionaire and recently took her clothes off for
Playboy, was actually a pretty good role model for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a wonderful role model,'' Hendrie-as-Brewster said.
``She gives me the strength to go on. She's a highly intelligent
woman who took control of her own life and called the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   In a cramped control room at the Premiere Radio Network's
offices on the fifth floor of a Ventura Boulevard high-rise,
Hendrie's producer, Mike Schaefer, fields calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darva Conger's not a role model,'' a 34-year-old Manhattan
Beach female insists. ``She's a gold digger.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer hears and smiles: ``Those are the people we want on the
show _ the ones who don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   When a caller listening on a new affiliate in Tampa asks the
screener if it really is Hendrie doing all the voices, Schaefer
keeps the woman off the air but lets the cat out of the bag: ``It's
Phil talking to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrie, who rarely gives media interviews and never allows TV
crews in the studio, developed his act while working at Ventura
talk station KVEN-AM, where the biggest struggle involved getting
listeners to pick up their phones _ a major problem when you're
running a call-in show.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I launched into uncharted territory and decided to make up
my own calls,'' Hendrie explained a few hours before his Thursday
show.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Pasadena, the squat but powerfully built Hendrie spent
15 years in music radio before moving into talk. He arrived in Los
Angeles after handling morning-drive in Miami, starting at KFI the
first time in 1989 before relocating to San Diego, Minneapolis and
back to Miami. In the fall of 1996, he rejoined KFI and was moved
in March into afternoon-drive against top-rated motor-mouth Tom
Leykis on talk rival KLSX-FM (97.1).
</P>
<P>
   ``No calls are set up,'' Hendrie explains. ``We don't pay people
to call, and there are no other character voices. I've had George
Carlin, one of the great mimics and comedians, offer to do a
character on my show. And for me not to get back to him on that was
painful. I've politely declined all these offers because I learned
the hard way the only way I can be successful is to have complete
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Howard Stern's legion of copycats, there have been no
known Hendrie imitators. Speaking of Stern whose business agent
Hendrie and Leykis, incidentally, share the superstar morning jock
was so taken by tapes of Hendrie that last year he visited the
Sherman Oaks studio to see for himself how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flattered he liked my work,'' said Hendrie, 47, who
lives in Westlake Village with his wife and four stepkids. ``He
came to L.A., and we had lunch, and he watched the show. But if my
act could spawn imitators, it would have by now. It's a tough act
to rip off. They would have to do it better than me, and that's a
tough thing to do. I know it angers Howard when people rip him off,
but for me it hasn't happened yet.''

FOR PRI, DISBELIEF AND DESPAIR AS STRING OF VICTORIES IS BROKEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MEXICO-ELECTION) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The headquarters of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, with its titanic statues of dead leaders and
its monumental political machinery, was going to be the site of a
grand election fiesta on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the party's stage set became the scene of a political
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   When the first televised returns came in, showing the party
being crushed in the provincial races, four political operatives
watching the news physically recoiled from the screen, screwing
their eyes shut, as if hit by a blinding flash. One, a young woman
in a white polo shirt emblazoned with the party's red, white and
green insignia, opened her eyes wide and began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Like frolickers at a company picnic struck by a thunderstorm,
party supporters called off the festivities. They furled their
flags and banners and hugged one another for comfort. Yuppie
lawyers wept into their cell phones. Budding politicians stared
into space, seeing their futures evaporate in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the will of the people,'' Pedro Haces, a lawyer and
lifetime adherent of the governing party, known as the PRI, said in
a voice filled with sadness, bitterness and resignation. ``We live
in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote against the PRI was in part a rejection of their oldest
and wisest leaders, known universally in Mexican political circles
(except at party headquarters) as ``the dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   The dinosaurs and their offspring were holed up in the party's
headquarters on Sunday night when the bad news started flooding in.
They listened in silence as their candidate, Francisco Labastida,
who was to have proclaimed the latest in an unbroken string of
victories reaching back a lifetime, told them that things looked
grim.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida and the old guard filed into the auditorium to face
the party faithful before the television cameras. As he made a
short, bittersweet speech, the dinosaurs who took the stage stood
as far away from him as physically possible. The crowd stood and
applauded, cheered and wept, shouted and punched the air with their
fists.
</P>
<P>
   Then the faithful dimmed the lights and, by the hundreds, walked
out, marching silently past the black-shirted security guards and
the bronze statues of the old heroes, through the gates of what had
until that moment been the world's longest ruling party, out into
the streets of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   And out in the streets, thousands of people were shouting for
joy in the heart of a transformed nation.

<P>
   HOW TO BURN $73 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   With George W. Bush breaking all fund-raising records, a lot of
people in the political consulting and media business are reaping a
windfall. A new report by the Center for Responsive Politics shows
exactly how Bush spent the $73 million raised for his primary bid.
The big-ticket item was $21.7 million in campaign advertising,
mostly for television. Air charters came in second at $4.7 million,
and other forms of travel expenses _ buses, cars, parking and
hotels _ added another $1.4 million. Then came direct-mail expenses
at $4.2 million, with another $4.1 million on postage, printing and
delivery of those direct-mail pieces, plus $2.9 million for
payroll, $135,741 for consultants and _ of course _ $672,210 for
fund-raising. ``Bush's spending seems more fitting for a small
corporation than a campaign for president,'' said Holly Bailey, who
wrote the study. Put another way, since Bush announced his
presidential candidacy in March 1999, he has rolled up a money
``burn rate'' of $1.3 million a week, or $180,000 a day. &QL;

<P>
   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   BIG LEAD MISLEADING?
</P>
<P>
   Although most national polls have shown Gov. George W. Bush with
a healthy lead over Vice President Al Gore, a new survey by
Newsweek magazine has found them in a dead heat. In a two-way race,
Gore has the support of 46 percent of voters, with Bush at 45
percent, the survey found. A four-way race also produced a deadlock
with Bush at 41 percent, Gore at 40 percent, Ralph Nader at 6
percent and Patrick J. Buchanan at 2 percent. The survey polled 752
people in late June and had a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus four percentage points.

   THE REFORM PARTY
</P>
<P>
   WEB VOTING FOR PRIMARY
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's presidential primary will feature not only
traditional paper ballots but also voting via the Internet, yet
another sign that balloting on the Web, once only a topic of
discussion, is slowly becoming a reality. In the March primary in
Arizona, more than 45 percent of the 85,970 votes cast were sent
via computers from homes, schools and Internet connections at
polling places. For the Reform primary, party members will be
mailed a ballot packet with a traditional ballot and instructions
for online voting, to be conducted at www.eballot.net. The packet
gives voters a personal identity number and a guide to locate the
ballot on the Web. Electronic votes can be submitted for a limited
time before the party's Aug. 9 convention. ``A mixed-media election
provides our nationwide constituency with greater choice,'' said
Michael Farris, chairman of the party's election committee. &QL;

ST. PAUL, Minn. _ ``Train.''
</P>
<P>
   The word came over the stadium loudspeaker with no inflection.
Just the word.
</P>
<P>
   What train?
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the outfield, a freight train, chugging from left field
to right. It was actually just beyond the fence at the minor league
stadium where the St. Paul Saints were playing the Winnipeg
Goldeyes. But just.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the line for a massage?'' I heard someone ask as I
climbed the stadium steps. ``On the left,'' came a cheery reply
from another fan.
</P>
<P>
   I scooted past the massage chair and nodded at the massage
therapist, then squeezed by the beer man wearing a Nixon mask. I
made my way to the stands behind home plate, where a hairstylist
tossed a barber's apron around her next customer. He settled in for
his haircut and a great view of the batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really slow train.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same monotone baritone, and I couldn't help but look
toward the outfield, where the walls were plastered with ads, which
also climbed the light poles. A second train, this one incredibly
sluggish, had just appeared beyond left field.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Midway Stadium, a Saints game is more than baseball.
It's a happening, embraced by residents. But even more, it's about
the way St. Paul, always the lesser twin in this northern
metropolis, handles its second-string status.
</P>
<P>
   Is it that St. Paul finally got fed up with comparisons to
Minneapolis and decided to stop worrying about it? Not quite. But
nowadays St. Paul seems to revel in its second-rate status. Its
quirkiness is a matter of pride. St. Paul is cool.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Saints is one of the best ways to experience this.
Home games nearly always sell out, even though the Minnesota Twins,
major leaguers, play just a few miles away. There are other ways,
such as poking around the shops along St. Paul's Grand Avenue,
rather than making a pilgrimage to the Mall of America in suburban
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Another is to take the St. Paul Gangster Tour. While other
cities have been reluctant to play up their gangster ties, the St.
Paul tour has been popular with locals and tourists for years. More
on that later.
</P>
<P>
   I headed to the Saints game from my downtown Minneapolis hotel
in an inadvertently symbolic way, by zipping past the Metrodome.
That's where the Twins play their home games _ indoors.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Thursday evening last August, with a few puffy clouds
in a blue sky and a game-time temperature of about 75 degrees. The
stadium had one place to buy tickets and one entrance, in front of
which a three-piece Dixieland band played. The blue stands were
decorated with potted petunias and geraniums. Fans shuffled in from
their pregame tailgating parties. It would be another sellout, with
more than 6,000 devoted followers on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Saints fans,'' called the announcer. ``Are you ready for
some baseball _ outside?''
</P>
<P>
   Not just baseball, of course. Soon contestants in the ``public
humiliation'' event would be called forth. Another fan would be
chosen to race a giant Subway sandwich around the infield. Coming
up was the new car giveaway: ``At least it will be new to them,''
said the announcer. But first, a pig, the Saints' mascot, trotted
onto the field with the game ball in its mouth.

HIGH GASOLINE PRICES LEAD TRAVELERS TO DOWNSIZE VACATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, July 9)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heather and James Westrin of Lansing, Mich., looked forward to
driving to Traverse City, Mich., for a long Fourth of July weekend.
But as gasoline prices soared, the prospect of paying $2 or more a
gallon for the 350-mile round trip lost its appeal. ``It's too much
to pay,'' said Westrin, a travel agent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Noble Small and his wife, Skip, a retired couple living in
Ardmore, Okla., look forward to jumping into their Dodge pickup
every August and pulling a trailer to California, then heading back
home by way of Colorado. But they will omit California from their
itinerary next month. For after estimating the cost of gasoline,
Small, who before retiring owned a wholesale oil company,
calculated that by taking the shorter trip they could save as much
as $400 on gasoline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a summer in which 121.9 million American adults planned to
take vacations, according to survey results released May 10 by the
nonprofit Travel Industry Association of America and the AAA, the
Westrins and the Smalls do not represent most adult Americans. But
they are representative of an apparently large segment who are
canceling or shortening summer vacations because of sky-high gas
prices.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The $1.54 average cost of a gallon of gasoline in March was the
highest since July 1981, when it was $1.38, according to the AAA.
But by mid-June, after weeks of increases, the average price had
risen to $1.65, up from $1 a gallon much of last summer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, regular unleaded gasoline rose above $2
a gallon in parts of Kansas, Michigan and Missouri, and into the
$1.90s in Wisconsin and Illinois. In Chicago, it climbed as high as
$2.33. South Dakotans were paying almost $1.90 for unleaded regular
in late June, and $2.03 for premium. Premium gasoline also topped
$2 a gallon in Connecticut and Hawaii. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Resistance to rising gas prices should come as no surprise. In
the joint Travel Industry Association-AAA survey, conducted in
April when gasoline prices were rising but not yet out of sight, 46
percent of respondents (56.1 million adults) said that they would
consider canceling summer travel plans if gas prices rose to $2 a
gallon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the National Press Club on June 22, William S.
Norman, the president of the Travel Industry Association, said that
although travelers were worried about rising gas prices, the
``average American family traveling by auto will spend only about
five percent of its total vacation budget on gasoline.'' With the
average length of a pleasure trip by car about 700 miles round
trip, he said, the difference in fuel cost is about $13 _ about the
cost of a large pizza at Domino's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But motorists do not necessarily make such direct comparisons.
``Gas prices tend to be a psychological barrier,'' said Jerry
Cheske, who has monitored fuel prices for the AAA for 27 years.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A random sampling of destinations, including the Six Flags theme
parks, the Jersey Shore and the nation's two most popular tourist
sites, Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla., found no appreciable falloff in
visitors. Yet there are many indications that, like Noble and Skip
Small, lots of travelers are economizing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had people tell us they won't be driving this
summer, but plenty of them have said they're going to downsize,''
said John A. Craig, the owner of Pathfinder Travel Service in
Olathe, Kan. ``They say they don't plan to stay as long or go as
far.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aileen Vining, a travel agent in Joplin, Mo., said: ``If there
are only two or at the most three people traveling together,
they'll give a lot of thought to flying, because gas prices are so
high around here. But if it's a family of four or more, they'll
likely drive or stay home, because there aren't many air-fare
bargains this summer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not only are there few air-fare bargains, air fares have risen
each of the past three months, jumping nearly 16 percent in June.
Fuel prices played a big part, according to the Air Transport
Association, the airline industry trade organization. It noted that
aviation fuel skyrocketed to 77 cents a gallon in the first quarter
of this year from 44 cents over the comparable period last year,
and is likely to remain high for much of the rest of 2000. To
offset that, seven major airlines imposed a $30 surtax in May on
domestic round-trip tickets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com recently added gasoline to its growing list of
items for which members can ``name your own price,'' and other
Internet companies are said to be working on plans that they say
will lower fuel costs for drivers. In the meantime, analysts at
Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., J.P. Morgan and Banc of America Securities
have warned that even increased oil output by the major producers
is not likely to return gasoline prices to anywhere near normal
before the end of summer. &QL;

   Tuesday pivotal for U.S. PostalTeam in Tour de France
</P>
<P>
   ByHalliburton-- NANTES, France _ Coming into the Tour de France,
the plan was for American Lance Armstrong to be wearing the
leader's yellow shirt on July 4 and celebrating Independence Day in
style.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan could have been moved up one day, thanks to the
volatility of the riders Monday afternoon. Conversely, that
ever-changing quality of the pack, caused primarily by cyclists
jockeying for final position, almost set back Armstrong's plans by
a day or more.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian Tom Steels won for the second straight day in Monday's
third stage, on a day that started calmly enough, under a
crystal-blue sky with temperatures in the low 70s. The 177 riders
rolled through the French countryside, much like the group did
Sunday afternoon when it ended the trek to Loudun. Instead of
Sunday's wheat fields, the main scenery Monday was acres of grapes
used to make chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   As the riders rolled into Nantes, this port city 270 miles west
of Paris, the race took on a scary air as the true sprinters of the
bunch nervously struggled for the position needed to win stage
three.
</P>
<P>
   Then disaster struck.
</P>
<P>
   With the group a half-mile from the finish, the front wheel of
Markus Zberg's bike clipped that of a competitor's and the two
cyclists went down in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   As the braked to avoid the fallen, a chain reaction started. And
for several agonizingly long seconds, Tour leader David Millar, a
23-year-old from Scotland, was flat on the pavement, struggling to
get up and back on his bike.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong found himself in the pileup behind Millar. ``It's best
not to panic, because you have to make your way past the carnage,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both cyclists struggled to get back toward the front. By the
finish line, both were able to finish with the same time, allowing
the two to remain first and second in the race to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But Laurent Jalabert and Jan Ullrich, who were safely in front
of the pileup, made up nine seconds on the leading pair. Millar
still owns a four-second lead over Armstrong. Jalabert is now only
five seconds behind Millar and one second behind Armstrong.
Ullrich, the 1997 Tour champion, is seven seconds out of first.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mapei's Steels picked up his second straight stage
win, edging Festina's Marcel Wust and Telecom's Erik Zabel.
Although the gap between the leaders grew tighter on Monday, the
leader of the team that wins today's time trial will take over the
yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The odds point to Armstrong's U.S. Postal Team, Ullrich's
Telekon squad and Jalabert's ONCE team.
</P>
<P>
   The team time trial is a unique stage for an event that focuses
on individuals. Each team will start together and ride together,
taking turns at the front of the line. The time assigned to each
team will be that of the fifth-place finisher. The stage goes 43.4
miles west from Nantes to St. Nazaire, an Atlantic port. Given the
nearness to the coast, the course will be affected by wind and
possibly rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have to work together to get from point A to
point B as fast as possible,'' said Tyler Hamilton, one of the
Postal Service's top time trialers.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has pinpointed the team time trial as a key stage to
make an early move before the Tour hits the mountain stages. Time
trials are his strength - he won all three last year and was second
to Millar in Saturday's prologue.
</P>
<P>
   His squad, given that they have been first in the overall team
placement since Saturday, will start last this afternoon, giving
them an advantage of knowing the splits to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a perfect present for an American team to
win on Independence Day,'' Armstrong said.

GORT: EASY TO MISS, HARD TO LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A certain town in the west of Ireland seems at first to offer no
reason to linger beyond the time it takes to refuel your car. It
has no shop selling Celtic knickknacks, no pub with performances of
ditties on the half-hour. Even its name lacks the lyricism found in
those of more famous Irish destinations. It is Gort.
</P>
<P>
   But this town of 1,200 in County Galway is also where my mother
spent her childhood _ on the outskirts, on a farm _ and where
family members still live. All my life, my answer to the inevitable
``Where are your people from?'' has been devoid of poetry but
ringing with pride: Gort. Others may think of it as a blur of
gray-stone storefronts on the road from Shannon Airport to
glamorous Galway City, 22 miles to the north; I remember it as
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   A recent return confirmed my sense that no familial link is
needed to appreciate what the town offers. Within a 10-mile radius
you can find Coole Park, once Lady Gregory's sanctuary for the
leaders of the Irish literary revival; Thoor Ballylee, the tower of
inspiration for William Butler Yeats; Kilmacduagh, a sacred site
with some of the finest monastic remnants in Ireland; Kinvara, an
inviting fishing village; and the Burren, the dramatic limestone
landscape sloping westward into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the people and places of Gort proper. True, the
town is a little grimy, a little reluctant to exploit its history.
The grounds of the Gort workhouse, once crammed to overflowing with
the Great Famine's dying, are now used to store highway equipment.
But those who pay attention will see life in the Irish west as it
is, not as it might be imagined.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Mary, and our 2-year-old daughter, Nora, and I visited
for 10 days, staying most nights with relatives in a nearby farming
hamlet with the singular name of Loughtyshaughnessy. But the area
offers plenty of bed-and-breakfasts, the venerable Sullivan's Hotel
and the Lady Gregory, a new hotel whose luxurious interior has won
the grudging respect of the locals. We spent one night there and
found the rooms comfortable and the staff accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   We went first to Coole, less than three miles from town. A
century ago, Lady Augusta Gregory, the regally beautiful folklorist
and a founder of the Abbey Theatre, began to offer her estate as a
haven to Yeats, Sean O'Casey, John Millington Synge and other Irish
artists. Although Coole House was demolished in the early 1940s _ a
shortsighted act that Irish preservationists bemoan to this day _
the government has worked to preserve the pastoral beauty of the
setting and to recall the poetic brilliance that once fed off of
its air.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds are now a national park and preserve of manicured
gardens and paths beneath majestic yews. Down one path is Coole
Lake, where Yeats encountered the ``nine and fifty swans'' of his
poem, ``The Wild Swans at Coole.'' Elsewhere stands the famous
copper beech with the carved initials of Yeats, O'Casey and others
who paused from artistic pursuits for a moment of whimsy. Coole
also has an inviting tearoom in one of the restored buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Along a narrow road some three miles away stands Thoor Ballylee,
a Norman tower that Yeats bought cheap in 1917 and restored as a
summer home. The tower and its surroundings inspired several of his
poems; it was a ``blessed place,'' he once wrote _ a place where he
grappled with love, civil war and death. Now a museum, the tower
remains remote. Outside, only a small parking lot interrupts the
pastoral surroundings of cow pasture and stream, and only a plaque
on the ancient structure's face tells of what once was:
</P>
<P>
   I, the poet William Yeats
</P>
<P>
   With old millboards and sea-green slates
</P>
<P>
   And smithy work from the Gort forge
</P>
<P>
   Restored this tower for my wife George;
</P>
<P>
   And may these characters remain
</P>
<P>
   When all is ruin once again.
</P>
<P>
   My family and I dawdled in Gort, spending time with an aunt and
uncle who have retired from farming. Now they feed a stove's fire
with sticks from the field, fix tea every 35 minutes or so, and
tell stories _ about the dear price of land during the country's
current economic boom, about the sure signs of a good jar of poteen
(or moonshine), about the foibles and triumphs of neighbors and
clergy. The television was usually off and the radio usually on,
tuned to a station that would follow a traditional reel with a
greatest hit of the Doors. No matter; it was all background music
to ``Do you know the house up the boreen?'' and ``More tea?''
</P>
<P>
   When wanderlust struck, we knew that any outing we took, in any
direction, would be memorable. One evening we planned to eat at
either the Blackthorn or O'Grady's _ two recommended pubs in Gort _
but our daughter fell asleep as soon as we exited the farmhouse
gate. So, in an act approaching sacrilege, Mary and I bought
cheeseburgers and french fries at Supermac's _ the McDonald's of
Gort _ and drove three miles at twilight to the ruins of
Kilmacduagh.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by St. Colman Mac Duach early in the seventh century,
the monastery has been host to prayer and plunder. Vikings raided
its treasures in the 9th and 10th centuries, as did various clans
in later centuries, but it remained the seat of a Roman Catholic
bishop until the 16th century. Now, preserved in the midst of
farmland, there are fine remnants of churches and a cathedral as
well as a 110-foot-tall round tower that once provided refuge for
monks in times of attack. On adjacent land is an ancient cemetery,
a place where St. Colman was buried nearly 1,400 years ago, where
Celtic crosses angle awkwardly toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   With our child sleeping and the radio playing wistful music,
Mary and I watched the round tower slowly become a silhouette
against the night sky. We imagined the secrets it had beheld, and
the generations of farmers who looked up from their chores and
miseries and drew strength from finding it still standing.
</P>
<P>
   About the only long-distance excursion we made was some 30 miles
southwest to the Cliffs of Moher, the spectacular formations of
County Clare that signal the abrupt western end of Ireland. With
photographs taken and faces stung by the snapping wind, we headed
back toward Gort, meandering along the coast road north through the
Burren _ a long stretch of limestone-exposed hills sloping toward
the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Late that afternoon, we stopped nine miles short of Gort in the
seaport village of Kinvara, where we spent the night at a pleasant,
relatively new hotel called the Merriman. Kinvara was fairly quiet.
We walked its narrow streets, past pubs and the occasional shop
catering to visitors; one sold ceramic ``Irish frogs,'' another
specialized in the packing and shipping of Atlantic Irish salmon.
It seemed to us that the village had struck a wonderful balance
between tourism and a dedication to preserving its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Kinvara also provided one of those serene moments destined to
linger in memory: sitting at a window seat of the Pier Head
restaurant, drinking stout, eating smoked salmon and watching the
boats bob in Kinvara Bay.
</P>
<P>
   After a full Irish breakfast at the Merriman the next morning,
it was back to bustling Gort, my personal reference point to Irish
history. Guaire, the legendary King of Connacht, built a castle
here in the seventh century. By the middle of the 19th century, it
was a prosperous market town, with the spires of two churches
dedicated to St. Colman _ one Catholic, one Protestant _ piercing
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   But the famine devastated the counties of Galway and Clare _ and
the town of Gort. An English visitor in 1850 described seeing
hundreds of women and children shivering in and around the grounds
of the Gort workhouse. ``What dress they had seemed to be the rags
of the red petticoat of the country from below the waist, rags of
some black stuff above it,'' he wrote. ``Some of the infants were
nearly naked, and very evidently in a most filthy state.''
</P>
<P>
   The community slowly recovered, and by the early 20th century
was playing a role in the revolution and subsequent civil war. Two
miles from town, in the Shanaglish cemetery where my grandfather is
buried, is a memorial to Patrick and Henry Loughnane, two brothers
who were tortured and dragged to their deaths by British agents in
1920. Eighty years later, every schoolchild in town knows the story
of the Loughnanes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gort is like so many other Irish communities, striving to
be modern while respecting its past. That Protestant church is now
a library. The door to the very old Glynn's Hotel bears a
handwritten sign informing Supermac's customers that yes, thank
you, the hamburger shop has its own bathroom. Across from J.J.
Coen's, the tiny clothing store that has dressed farmers for
generations, there is a shop selling cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Late one Sunday night we went to the Archway, a pub that faces
the center square. The men drank stout at the bar while the women
sipped drinks at small round tables; their conversations blanketed
the room in murmurs. Near the front of the room, a farmer from
nearby Peterswell removed an accordion from its heavy case. Beside
him was a man holding a flute, and another with a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, men and women, my aunt included, wandered onto the
worn wooden floor to take their places. A burst of music shook the
room, and they began to dance. Some closed their eyes as they
whirled about; others stomped the hardwood in defiant joy. I sat
there, watching my daughter clap her hands and my wife tap her
feet, and I knew only this: I did not want to leave.
</P>
<P>

`LUCIA,' MOVE OVER: `JANE EYRE' AS OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHELTENHAM, England _ About 100 miles west of London, Cheltenham
grew up two centuries ago as a spa town, for which purpose it
acquired fine public buildings, a few comfortable hotels and street
after street of modestly handsome houses faced with honey-colored
stone from the local Cotswolds. Behind those regular, flat facades
it would be easy to imagine families of Jane Austen characters who
have arrived to take the curative waters, stroll in the parks and
dance with young officers. Now, though, the place has to find other
ways to attract visitors and to serve its permanent population,
which includes a high proportion of retired people.
</P>
<P>
   Hence its festivals, among which the music festival is the
oldest and most distinguished, having been started right after
World War II. This year's program is typical. The opening weekend
included a recital by Alfred Brendel, an orchestral concert, and
chamber-music mornings with young and established ensembles. It
also included the world premiere of an opera based on a classic
novel, not one of the Austen books that might have suited the
location (if not the operatic form), but rather Charlotte Bronte's
``Jane Eyre.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a second opera for the British composer Michael
Berkeley and his librettist, the Australian novelist David Malouf.
Like their first _ ``Baa Baa Black Sheep,'' based on episodes from
the life and writings of Rudyard Kipling _ ``Jane Eyre'' is an
attempt to use late-20th-century means to understand the minds and
situations of Victorian characters. The mixed perspectives suit
Berkeley's music, which sometimes consorts with the 19th century
(even to the extent, unwisely, of quoting liberally from the mad
scene in ``Lucia di Lammermoor'') and sometimes sounds resiliently
contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Malouf concentrates the capacious narrative into a compact and
fluid psychological drama for Jane and the Rochester couple, with
their housekeeper Fairfax and their ward Adele on the fringes. He
makes it possible for the central characters to be present almost
throughout, often seen when they are not heard ( Rochester pacing
in the attic of the set) or heard when they are not seen (Jane
disturbed by words from Rochester that he will not utter directly
to her).
</P>
<P>
   One big problem is that the resulting atmosphere of unease, and
of an outsider's gradual recognition of malignancy within a
household, brings the opera close to two models it cannot match. A
scene from Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande'' is closely recalled
when Jane questions Adele. More generally the piece evokes
Britten's ``Turn of the Screw,'' not only in its subject but in its
scoring for a few voices with a chamber orchestra of soloists.
</P>
<P>
   While he cannot come near Britten in expressing sinister erotic
appeal, Berkeley is good at murky scene-setting, as in the opening
low glissando figures, and at moments of exasperation, like the
passage where Rochester's baritone seems to be pushed up and
tightened by an insistent piccolo. But continuity is lacking, and
the final catastrophe comes suddenly out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the main musical tension serve the subject. When the
instrumental weave is broken by percussion sounds, the effect is
not so much to suggest the hedonism and otherness of the
Rochesters' Caribbean existence as to hint, rather wistfully, at an
opera ``Jane Eyre'' is not: an opera cut loose from period costume
and waltz tunes. Perhaps Berkeley's and Malouf's next enterprise,
``A Winter's Tale,'' will be that piece.
</P>
<P>
   The performance, by Music Theater Wales, was up to this
company's high standards, with Michael Rafferty conducting and
Michael McCarthy directing. Natasha Marsh provided everything the
title role needed: a strong but quiet beautiful presence, sensitive
acting and a finely handled lyric soprano voice. Also excellent
were Andrew Slater as Rochester, Emily Bauer-Jones as Rochester and
Tabitha Watling as Adele.

 &HT;    FOX FACES DAUNTING TASK OF LEADING MEXICO IN TRANSITION FROM 71
YEARS OF ONE-PARTY STATE
 &HT;    EDS: After 4th graf, updates with 2 grafs of Fox comments
following meeting with Zedillo.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Just hours after toppling the country's ruling
party, president-elect Vicente Fox
</P>
<P>
   rolled up his trademark blue shirtsleeves Monday and began
charting a transition toward Mexico's first opposition federal
government in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   The task will be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   When he takes office Dec. 1, Fox will inherit a troubled country
of stark inequality with a political and social infrastructure that
evolved over 71 years under the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI. That framework includes a federal bureaucracy and
labor unions tied to the PRI which many Mexicans believe are
riddled with corruption and inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Fox met with President Ernesto Zedillo of the defeated ruling
party Monday evening in an unprecedented session designed to
underscore a commitment to a peaceful change of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to assure that this transition toward a new
government is totally harmonious and with stability,'' Fox said at
a press conference held at Los Pinos, (the Pines), the Mexican
White House, after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   To calm ruling-party affiliated public employees, Fox invited
all federal workers _ save for cabinet secretaries and some
officials just below them _ to remain in their posts after he takes
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot fail because we have awakened too many expectations,
too many dreams and desires,'' an ecstatic Fox said Monday in a
Mexico City radio interview after his convincing victory in a
three-way race. With 93 percent of the vote counted, he was nearly
7 percentage point ahead of his second-place PRI opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reiterate my invitation to a government of concordance that
we are going to form, to a unity of Mexican men and women, to an
inclusive project with ideas from everyone, but also for work for
everyone,'' Fox said in a separate televised interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all going to have to work,'' he said. ``Today is barely
the starting point to construct a great nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The president-elect has said he will try to boost job
development with more investment and credit for small businesses.
He has pledged to root out corruption and government ties to drug
trafficking, which has become a sore point between Mexico and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to continue to reach out to Mexican immigrants
in the United States. His plan is a plural government that will
negotiate policies based on ideas from right to left, including
experts from the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton telephoned Fox to congratulate him and later
issued a statement calling the Sunday's elections a ``vivid
testimony to the depth of the democratic commitment of the Mexican
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter, who was on an election
observation mission here, praised speeches Zedillo, Fox and the
losers made after the outcome became clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will set a tone for the next five months of
transition that will be very beneficial for Mexico,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive and rancher, is a member of
Mexico's conservative, free-market National Action Party, or PAN.
But he ran as a broad-based coalition candidate _ under the banner
of the Alliance for Change _ with Mexico's small environmentalist
Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of jubilant street celebrations, analysts compared
the magnitude of Fox's triumph to the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
For seven decades _ a lifetime _ the PRI has controlled the
presidency and most other political offices.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic reforms that have taken effect in recent years _ a
freer press, fairer campaign rules and a new balloting system to
combat fraud _ helped clear the way for an opposition victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fox supporter Cecilia Suarez, 40, a television casting director,
said, ``Thank God we saw change before we die.''
</P>
<P>
   Javier Trevino, a spokesman for defeated PRI candidate Francisco
Labastida, said, ``We have heard the message of the people. We have
heard the message of change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The defeat of the PRI alone is enough to dramatically change
Mexico's political system,'' said political analyst Jose Antonio
Crespo.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's media, less chained but still beholden to the federal
government, will inevitably become more independent, with no clear
master to serve, Crespo said.
</P>
<P>
   A mix of parties in the Mexican Senate and Chamber of Deputies
will provide a democratic balance, Crespo said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has already tried to ``heal'' divisions among all parties,
including Mexico's leftist Democratic Revolution Party, whose
candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas came in third.
</P>
<P>
   In post-election statements, Crespo said, Cardenas was not
especially conciliatory toward Fox. But leftists are already on
Fox's team and others will inevitably join his government, Crespo
said.
</P>
<P>
   An obvious risk for Fox is if Mexicans, especially those of the
left, do not believe his government is dealing satisfactorily with
the country's overwhelming problems of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``An authoritarian regime sometimes generates fantasies that
democracy is a magic wand,'' Crespo said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has raised expectations that corruption might be better
controlled, a difficult task in a country with a tradition of
bribes and low salaries. During his campaign he said he wouldn't
conduct ``witch hunts'' to identify corrupt officials, but would
seek to punish high-profile perpetrators who have raided public
treasuries or consorted with criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between July 3 and Dec. 1,'' Fox said in a pre-election
interview, ``there will be a lot of files burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has assumed a more statesmanlike posture since Sunday night,
taking Zedillo at his word that he will guarantee a smooth,
transparent transition.
</P>
<P>
   Some federal government workers who voted for the PRI said they
feared that if Fox were to win, he would fire massive numbers of
public employees and abolish unions. Some impoverished Mexicans
said they were told Fox would cut welfare benefits for children or
crop subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Fox ran television commercials to counter these rumors. But he
is clear in his goal to improve government subsidy programs to make
them more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   As a PAN governor of Guanajuato state, he streamlined government
and started a system of merit pay on top of salaries, said
University of Guanajuato political analyst Luis Miguel Rionda.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first the workers reacted with fear. Most people just
wanted guaranteed security, not merit pay,'' Rionda said. But
younger government officials now appear to like the system, which
is viewed as a substitute for arbitrary bonuses that have
traditionally been used in Mexico to threaten workers and guarantee
loyalty to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Government-employee unions linked to the PRI are going to have
to evolve or face competition from independent unions that could
now advance, Rionda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the bureaucracy is still tied to the PRI,
however,'' Rionda said. ``So Fox is going to have to be careful and
try to reach out to them to include them.''
</P>
<P>
   On election night, members of PRI unions and neighborhood
organizations sobbed openly or stood stone-faced when they heard
the news that their party had finally been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI was born in power, so the question is can it
survive,'' said Rionda. The party emerged from the tumult of the
Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910 and raged for another
decade. It has shed its ideological skin many times and slid from
socialism to capitalism whenever global conditions seemed
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said the party he toppled had no ideology at all anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino, a PRI activist in his late 30s, said the party has to
reflect on its future.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of its crushing defeat, he conceded, ``Many people
are shocked. We need to take this as an opportunity for young PRI
members like myself to craft a new message.''

RARE FLOWERS AND RUINED CHOIRS OF THE BURREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 9)  
 By LISA FUGARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If birders go birding then those who seek out wildflowers surely
go flowering; the term botanizing doesn't begin to capture the
sweet delight I experienced on discovering the profusion of
wildflowers growing in the Burren in County Clare on Ireland's west
coast. My romance with bird's-foot trefoil, mountain avens and herb
Robert came about by accident. When I flew into Shannon last July
and met my mother, Sheila, for a 10-day holiday, it was with the
intention of viewing shore birds and, with luck, a few seals.
</P>
<P>
   Bleak and harsh are the adjectives often used to describe the
Burren, a roughly 100-square-mile limestone landscape of cliffs,
stony hills and broad stretches of rock resembling pavement. I have
an affinity for such landscapes, as does my mother, and the
boireann, the Irish word for rocky place, did not disappoint us.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half hours after leaving the airport in a
sardine-can-sized rental car, well suited to skinny country roads,
we crested a hill just above a stretch of coastline called Pol
Salach and saw a stunning panorama of fierce Ireland _ shattered
terraces of stark limestone spilling into a sea that was gray as
elephant skin.
</P>
<P>
   We followed the coast road through the lonely village of Fanore
where horses grazed in rock-strewn pastures next to the beach, past
Black Head where the limestone cliffs plunged into the sea. Masses
of oxeye daisies and fuchsias blooming on the side of the road
softened the austere beauty of the rock. By the time we reached
Ballyvaughan, a tiny village sitting on a tranquil corner of Galway
Bay, we were enamored of the Burren. Smoked salmon and mussels at
Monk's Bar on the quay and two elegant bedrooms in Rusheen Lodge, a
four-star guest house, only added to our satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning we drove into the hills behind Ballyvaughan
where flinty stone walls divided the land into pastures. I was
itching to walk among the rocks, but in planning the trip I had
promised my mother a ruin a day. My passion for the natural world
is matched by her passion for mosques, temples, tombs and ruined
churches. Such churches abound in the Burren, as do ring forts and
Neolithic tombs.
</P>
<P>
   Our first visit was to the village of Kilfenora where the
tiniest medieval cathedral awaited us. The nave or front section is
still used for church services while the roofless chancel radiates
stillness and mystery. Two identical stone carvings _ apparently
the head of a bishop _ have a vaguely Egyptian air about them. A
delicate trefoil sedilia _ three seats crowned with a beautifully
carved pinnacle _ is recessed into one wall, while on the adjacent
wall are two naively incised 13th- and 14th-century stone carvings.
One of them, supposedly of a cleric, had us perplexed. What did the
oval head and elongated neck remind us of? Where had we seen that
serene, otherworldly demeanor? My mother, who is half Irish and has
a streak of sly Irish wit about her, solved that mystery when she
exclaimed ``The Holy Alien!''
</P>
<P>
   Pelting rain and sudden squalls, rain that drizzles and mizzles
_ Ireland is one of the few countries where such weather is
shrugged off, hardly a deterrent to wildflower adventures.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch I dropped my mother back at the B &AMP; B and, armed
with ``Wild Plants of the Burren and the Aran Islands,'' bought at
the Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfenora, and a large umbrella
(which immediately marked me as a foreigner and a sissy), I drove
40 minutes along the coast road to rocky Pol Salach for my first
afternoon of flowering.
</P>
<P>
   The great mystique of the flora of the Burren lies in its
diversity and its growing habits _ Mediterranean and arctic-alpine
plants thrive side by side. None of the species are unique to the
Burren, but many grow in the limestone landscape in greater
abundance than anywhere else in Ireland or Britain.
</P>
<P>
   I parked the car, climbed over a low stone wall and crouched on
the ground. Crushing wild thyme between my fingers, I breathed
deep. I'd identified my first wildflower. What were the tiny white
flowers intertwined with the thyme? I thumbed through my flower
book.
</P>
<P>
   Yes! It was squinancy wort. After half an hour of literally
crawling through a cow pasture so ablaze with flowers it seemed as
though a beneficent fairy artist had dipped her paintbrush in
magenta, blue, yellow, cream and periwinkle blue and flicked it
over the ground, I reached the limestone pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth, relatively flat, rectangular chunks of limestone called
clints are separated from one another by fissures that range in
depth from one foot to 20. It's in these fissures, or grikes, that
the pluckiest of plants flourish. The magenta flowers of bloody
cranesbill swayed brightly against the bone-colored rock, and I saw
honeysuckle plants twisted into bonsais by the strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to the sea cliffs I found those plants that thrive in the
salty spray gusting off Galway Bay _ bobbing heads of pink thrift
and sea campion and thick seaweedy-looking ferns that glistened in
the grikes. Of course, there were plants that I couldn't identify.
</P>
<P>
   There are over 600 species recorded in the Burren. The book I
carried listed 120. I was momentarily frustrated. Then smiled. My
naming them didn't bring the flowers into being. Why not simply
enjoy them?
</P>

   The following day while driving to Corcomroe, a Cistercian abbey
that lies five miles east of Ballyvaughan, my mother fantasized
about buying property. We parked at the end of a country lane and
immediately registered an eerie sound that seemed to be rising from
the ruined abbey. A ham-fisted ghost stumbling over the bass keys
of an organ?
</P>
<P>
   After some investigation the Organist of Corcomroe, as he is now
affectionately remembered by my mother and me, turned out to be a
most handsome blond bull lowing to several docile black-and-white
cows cloistered in a field on the opposite side of the road. While
Kilfenora's chancel is exquisitely intimate, Corcomroe, with the
wind gusting through it, feels lonely and desolate. It also has a
stunning roof, as do most of the churches we visited, with a wide
swath of changeable Irish sky through which the rooks wheeled and
cawed. On some of the pillars the traces of carvings of flowers can
be found, a stony reminder of the abbey's other name, Our Lady of
the Fertile Rocks. In one corner there is a recumbent effigy said
to be that of an O'Brien king killed nearby in 1267. Above it is an
unfinished 14th-century carving, presumably of the abbot of
Corcomroe. With a hint of a smile on his face and rather puffy
attire, he looks as though he's levitating up the ruined chancel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three days is not enough time to explore the Burren,'' I
lamented over dinner that night in the superb Whitethorn
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations in Connemara awaited us, so the following day we
left for County Galway. On our way we stopped at Thoor Ballylee
near the town of Gort _ less than an hour's drive from Ballyvaughan
_ where Yeats summered from 1917 to 1929. The recorded commentary
issuing from speakers in his dining room, study and bedroom didn't
interest me so I climbed higher. Close to the top of the stone
tower I found what was surely the true spirit of Yeats _ a
soft-feathered, fierce-eyed kestrel guarding her chick on a nest of
sticks.
</P>
<P>
   After two days in Connemara, during which time the sun blazed 16
hours a day and I swam in the stillest, bluest bay I'd ever seen,
gray clouds rolled in from the ocean. Rain spattered on the window
of our hotel. ``Only one place to be in such moody weather,'' I
said to my mother. Back to the Burren we raced.
</P>
<P>
   Rusheen Lodge had been lovely, but I always feel as though I'm
staying in my grandparents' house when I visit a B &AMP; B. That
evening we checked into the Ballinalacken Castle Hotel, a sprawling
country house sitting on a hill just below a 15th-century O'Brien
tower house. The ruin is now roped off because too many visitors
were leaving with chunks of genuine Irish castle in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   We felt like Burren old-timers, and our remaining days took on
an easy routine. In the mornings we visited churches, castles and
towers. There was Dysert O'Dea, where a bizarre array of
Romanesque-style animal and human heads arches over the south
doorway of the church. Lemaneagh Castle, worthy of at least a few
ghosts, stands proud in a stretch of windswept farmland (equally
creepy was the electric fence surrounding the field and the old
Irish codger who scowled at the few cars parked just beyond his
land). In Killinaboy we came across a humble ruined church with a
simple carving of the Crucifixion and the weathered Sheila na gig,
an ancient fertility symbol, above the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Each afternoon I went flowering. A walk up the Kyber Pass, a
road in Fanore that follows the Caher River _ the only surface
river in the Burren, as most of the rainwater seeps into the
underground waterways _ will be remembered as the afternoon I
discovered orchids. Except for the exquisite bee orchid, the
terrestrial species of the Burren are not as showy as tropical
orchids that cling to trees. Still, I was captivated by their
demure beauty.
</P>
<P>
   On another day I went mad for ferns. I kept meaning to hike one
of the ancient green roads that lace the Burren; they're noted for
the wildflowers but I was smitten with rock, with the way a
saucer-sized depression on a boulder could hold an array of small
flowers brilliant as jewels, the way the wind gusting off Galway
Bay tossed the tousled pink flowers of hemp agrimony, a species
that grew en masse in the limestone fissures.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the food _ lobsters, crabs, black sole, salmon,
mussels. We feasted every evening at local restaurants and returned
to our hotel _ my mother had renamed it Fawlty Castle in honor of
the quirky yet utterly charming staff _ in time for sunset tea,
which, in early July, was at about 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On our last morning in the Burren, I wandered the pavement at
Pol Salach, saying goodbye to yet another part of the world I'd
fallen in love with. My evening reading had been from a chapter in
``The Burren: A Companion to the Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone
Wilderness'' that touched on the historical use of many of the
plants I'd been rhapsodizing over, and as I whispered the names of
the flowers surrounding me, I felt as though I were floating back
in time. Lady's bedstraw _ makes good bedding and can be used as a
rennet plant for curdling milk; squinancy wort _ useful if I ever
get an attack of quinsy; carline thistle _ preserve the buds with
honey and sugar for a tasty sweetmeat; Burnet rose _ I'll drink a
syrup made from the rosehips if I'm coughing, spitting blood or
stricken with scurvy.
</P>
<P>
   The monks of Corcomroe must have put many of these plants to
medicinal use. Perhaps the levitating abbot secretly snacked on
carline thistles. As for the Holy Alien? That otherworldly, rather
blissful demeanor might have come about from one too many
afternoons spent flowering.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rusheen Lodge. Just outside the village of Ballyvaughan, this
four-star guest house has six lovely, spacious rooms with private
bathrooms, and two suites. Doubles are $72; the suites $108, full
breakfast included, calculated at $1.21 to the Irish pound.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone (353-65) 70 77092, fax (353-65) 70 77152.
</P>
<P>
   Ballinalacken Castle Hotel. We loved this creaky yet elegant
hotel on the outskirts of Lisdoonvarna. Drinking tea in the sitting
room and sprawling about our spacious, rather oddly but grandly
decorated room made us feel like fading aristocrats. Some rooms
have splendid views of the Aran Islands, while others (nos. 5, 6,
10 and 11) do not. Doubles are $48 to $54, with full Irish
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   For reservations, telephone or fax (353-65) 70 74025.
</P>
<P>
   DINING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sheedy's Hotel and Restaurant. What this restaurant in
Lisdoonvarna lacks in decor it makes up for with superb food. I had
an entree of black sole so exquisite I wonder if I'll ever eat fish
that fresh again. A three-course dinner for two, excluding drinks,
averages $60. Sheedy's bar has a seafood menu. Telephone (353-65)
70 74026.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitethorn. Situated a half mile east of Ballyvaughan on the
coast road to Galway, this elegant restaurant has a stunning view
of Galway Bay. Dinner for two averages $70 and is served Friday and
Saturday nights only in July and August. Weekends and weekdays the
lunch service is buffet style and the food is just as delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Attached is a shop crammed with good clothing, Irish crafts and
all the guidebooks needed to explore the Burren. Telephone (353-65)
70 77044.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   The Burren Interpretive Center at Kilfenora, the first such
center in Ireland, has models and exhibits explaining the geology,
flora and fauna of the Burren, as well as an audio-visual lecture
of the area. Open daily 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. through September (to 5
p.m. October to May). Telephone (353-65) 70 88030. Admission $3.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recommended reading: ``The Burren: a Companion to the
Wildflowers of an Irish Limestone Wilderness'' (Collins Press), by
E. Charles Nelson, who is utterly bewitched by the Burren. For help
in identifying flowers, pick up a copy of ``Wild Plants of the
Burren and the Aran Islands,'' also by E. Charles Nelson. Both
books are available &QL;

LES SIRKIN, 66; GEOLOGIST STUDIED HOW GLACIERS SHAPED COASTLINES
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Calif., R.I., Mass., Del.) By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Les Sirkin, a geologist who mapped the ways glaciers shaped
American coastlines from Long Island to Baja California, died on
June 25 at his summer home on Block Island, R.I. Formerly of Garden
City, N.Y., he was 66 and lived in Johnsburg, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was apparently a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Sirkin was an expert in the stratigraphy, the layered
arrangement of rocks, of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, a vast
expanse of time from 225 million years ago until after the most
recent ice age. It witnessed cataclysmic lava flows, spawned the
dinosaurs, lifted up the Rockies, encased the Northern Hemisphere
in continental glaciers and, toward the end, gave rise to modern
human culture.
</P>
<P>
   His other interests included environmental geology and
palynology, the study of living or fossil plant spores and pollen.
He published many research papers on various geological periods.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Sirkin was working on two book chapters about the
geology of Block Island and the Hudson River. He also had completed
his first novel, ``Who Killed the CEO of Prophet College,'' which
his family hopes to have published.
</P>
<P>
   With C.K. Seyfert, he wrote a textbook, ``Earth History and
Plate Tectonics'' (Harper &AMP; Row; 2nd ed., 1979). Three other books
on the geology of Block Island (1994), eastern Long Island (1995),
and western Long Island (1996) remain in print at Book &AMP; Tackle
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Arthur Sirkin was born in Dover, Del., and graduated from
Hamilton College in 1954. He received his M.A. in 1957 from Cornell
University, specializing in stratigraphy, sedimentation and
paleontology, and a Ph.D. in micropaleontology and palynology from
New York University in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the faculty at Adelphi University in Garden City in
1962 and became the founding chairman of the earth sciences
department five years later.
</P>
<P>
   He was chairman again in the 1980s and 1990s and retired in 1996
as professor of earth sciences in the College of Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Joanne Sirkin, died in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Sirkin is survived by his fiancee, Judith FitzGibbon; three
daughters, Annie Ledoux of Wareham, Mass., Emily Melcher of Acton,
Mass., and Carolyn Sirkin of Brooklyn; and one granddaughter.

JOBS CHANGE, BUT NOT PEDERSEN'S PASSION FOR RACING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Pete Pedersen will mark his 80th birthday
today in the same place he has celebrated practically every year
since he was 13 - at the races.
</P>
<P>
   The particular tracks and Pedersen's jobs have changed through
the decades - ranging from Longacres, near his native Seattle,
where he earned his first paycheck as a teletype operator, to
Hollywood Park, where he is the dean of the state-appointed
stewards, the three-man board that administers justice on and off
the ovals.
</P>
<P>
   But to Pedersen, who has also been a reporter and a publicist at
tracks up and down the West Coast, the exact location has never
mattered as much as the races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still look forward to going to the races. I'm still
fascinated by it,'' said Pedersen, who has maintained homes in
Arcadia and the San Francisco Bay Area since a permanent move to
California in 1967. ``I figured out that I've been an official for
over 100,000 races. You say, 'Well,then, you've seen everything.'
But the truth is I haven't seen everything. The races are all
different. That's what makes it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver-haired and elegant in suits and hats, Pedersen brings a
dignified air to the tense situations stewards are bound to
resolve, ruling on everything from jockeys' rough riding and
trainers' medication violations to petty financial disputes and
parking citations.
</P>
<P>
   Since he indicates no plan to retire, and doesn't much like the
idea of a newspaper drawing attention to his age, Pedersen will be
heartened to learn that most people at Hollywood Park are surprised
to hear he is turning 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a very nice man, a very classy man, a very
fair man,'' said jockeys' agent Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether an 80-year-old is up to one of the most powerful
jobs in racing: ``I don't think anybody can fill his shoes,'' said
George Slender, who serves with Pedersen and Tom Ward in the
Hollywood Park stewards' stand.
</P>
<P>
   Pedersen, one of four sons of an Irish mother and a Danish
father, a master mechanic in the Seattle sawmill industry, was born
less than a month after Man O'War won the 1920 Belmont Stakes. He
went to work on the Longacres backstretch when the track opened in
1933, gravitated to the press box, where he disseminated results
via the teletype, and soon becoming publicity director.
</P>
<P>
   A $99.90 winner Pedersen remembers the horse's name, Crystal
Chief helped to pay for his education at the University of
Washington. There he rowed on a national-champion crew.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Naval Air Corps in World War II, the only
time he wasn't at the races on the Fourth of July, Pedersen became
a 26-year-old steward while continuing as the Longacres PR
director. He said he would have liked to be a freelance writer but
chose a more secure career.
</P>
<P>
   As PR man at Golden Gate Fields in Albany, Calif., Pedersen
watched Bill Shoemaker ride his first winner in 1949. He names
Shoemaker the greatest jockey he has seen and Citation the greatest
horse though gutty little Determine was his favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Pedersen, California's senior steward for more than a decade,
presided over the first Breeders' Cup in 1984 at Hollywood Park,
participating in the disqualifications of Fran's Valentine from the
win in the Juvenile Fillies and Gate Dancer from second in the
Classic, dramatic decisions captured by NBC cameras in the booth.
Pedersen remembers having a role in ``five or six'' million-dollar
DQs.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulation of milestones is not the only sign of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to more funerals than weddings,'' said Pedersen,
whose wife Jeanne, mother of his sons Craig and Michael, died in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time I was the youngest steward in the country, and now
I hate to think I'm the oldest,'' Pedersen said.
</P>
<P>
   Pedersen doesn't work a full year. He'll be off during the Del
Mar season that opens July 26.
</P>
<P>
   But the vacation will include stops at Bay Meadows, in San
Mateo, and Emerald Downs, Longacres' replacement near Seattle. Not
surprising for a man whose enthusiasm for racing doesn't wane.

PARK SERVICE RIDS GETTYSBURG OF MUCH-DERIDED TOWER
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GETTYSBURG, Pa. _ One hundred and thirty-seven years after Union
troops bested Gen. Robert E. Lee and his Confederate legions in
their desperate gamble known as Pickett's charge, the National Park
Service demolished an observation tower that has been a magnet for
criticism from historians, park officials and battlefield
preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:02 Monday afternoon, after four minutes of delay and two
countdowns, a group of Civil War re-enactors, some in Confederate
gray and others in Union blue, fired their cannon toward the tower.
Less than 10 seconds later, 15.5 pounds of demolition charges that
had been placed on the tower exploded, collapsing the structure.
</P>
<P>
   Taking down the 307-foot structure, the Gettysburg National
Tower, was the first step in an effort to restore the battlefield
to its appearance in 1863, Park Service officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sacred ground,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
said. ``Americans come here to learn of their past, to understand
how it was in those days when we remade ourselves as a new
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, while observing Earth Day at Gettysburg, Babbitt
promised: ``This tower is coming down on my watch.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three decades, the tower, which was a privately
operated tourist attraction, loomed over the battlefield. Union
troops had once gathered near the site of the tower, setting up
defensive positions on what was known as Cemetery Ridge. For years,
preservationists and Civil War enthusiasts have criticized the
tower as an intrusion on the historic setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been our long-term wish to get rid of what we consider
a major eyesore,'' said Walter L. Powell, the president of the
Gettysburg Battlefield Preservation Association.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled Demolition Inc. of Baltimore donated its services and
explosives to raze the tower, a donation the Park Service valued at
$1 million. Park officials said the donation was the largest
corporate contribution toward preservation in the park's 105-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the company retained media and salvage rights for the
collapsed steel tower. The company recently demolished the Kingdome
in Seattle and the ruins of the federal building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer representing the company that had owned the tower,
Overview Limited Partnership of Baltimore, criticized the
demolition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government, for reasons yet to be articulated, has chosen
to destroy a classroom in the sky,'' the lawyer, Irwin W. Aronson,
said. Aronson said the demolition would actually cost only about
$40,000, arguing that the $1 million government figure was grossly
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy behind decisions made by the Union commander, Gen.
George G. Meade, and General Lee, he said, could be appreciated
only from the tower, which had opened in 1974 and included
photographs and maps of the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only vantage point to see the entire spectrum of the
battlefield,'' Aronson said. For about $5, visitors could view the
battlefield, which covers about 6 acres, from the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Hower, 52, an executive for a tour company in Adams
County, Pa., where the battlefield is situated, said the demolition
had caused ``more unrest than I've seen in the 22 years I've lived
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of this area don't believe that we need to take
down the tower,'' Hower said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had tried to prevent
construction of the tower because of its proximity to historic
land. Then, in December, the Department of Justice filed a federal
suit to acquire the property. The court granted the Park Service
ownership in June, laying the groundwork for the demolition.

JAPAN'S DOCOMO AND ROYAL KPN ANGLE FOR STAKE IN BRITISH MOBILE
LICENSE HOLDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British wireless telephone venture TIW UMTS is in talks
to sell about a third of the company to NTT DoCoMo of Japan and
Royal KPN, the Dutch mobile phone operator, for as much as $2
billion, executives close to the discussions said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   TIW UMTS is backed by the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison
Whampoa and Telesystem International Wireless of Canada and owns
one of the five highly coveted third-generation wireless licenses
in Britain, allowing it to offer consumers high-speed Internet
access over mobile telephones and other portable devices. The
venture recently bought the license for $6.4 billion after a fierce
bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   If the sale proceeds, it would give NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest
mobile phone company, and Royal KPN a foothold in the highly
competitive British mobile communications market.
</P>
<P>
   NTT DoCoMo bought a 15 percent stake in Royal KPN's mobile unit,
KPN Mobile, for about $4.5 billion in May, hoping to create an
alliance that would, in part, allow it to pool resources to
aggressively buy third-generation mobile telephone licenses across
Europe. The two companies were expected to bid for Orange PLC,
Britain's third-largest mobile telephone operator, but were
outmaneuvered by France Telecom, which bought Orange for $37.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the talks said NTT DoCoMo would acquire
about 20 percent of the TIW and that Royal KPN would acquire about
15 percent. Hutchison Whampoa would retain a controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
   The executives cautioned that the negotiations could still break
down.
</P>
<P>
   NTT DoCoMo is aggressively seeking to expand in Europe, which is
considered to have the greatest potential for growth in the global
mobile market during the next several years. NTT DoCoMo is
especially eager to enter the European market because it wants to
introduce the market here to its widely popular i-mode technology,
which allows customers to gain access to the Internet over their
mobile telephones. I-mode is already the largest mobile Internet
access service in the world, with 8.2 million subscribers.

MISSOURI BACKS OUT ON UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA football team has been notified by
Missouri that the Tigers will not honor the contract to play a
home-and-home series with the Bruins in 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Sports information director Marc Dellins, who does UCLA's
scheduling, said Missouri is overscheduled with too many tough
opponents. In addition to its Big 12 schedule, Missouri has a
home-and-home series with Michigan State in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's schedules were set through 2008. Now, Sept. 8, 2001, and
Sept. 7, 2002, are open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, I feel really bad,'' Dellins said, ``although I shouldn't
sound sarcastic. But our 2001 schedule has us playing Alabama and
Ohio State.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellins said Missouri notified UCLA in writing six months ago of
its desire not to play. UCLA said it was OK if the two schools try
to find a suitable replacement. Dellins said UCLA wants a
comparable Division I-A opponent so the games could be televised.
Kansas and Kansas State were two possibilities discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dellins said, Missouri athletic director Mike Alben
told UCLA's Peter Dalis the Tigers won't honor the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get the contract and go over it with our legal counsel
and talk to their legal counsel,'' Dellins said.
</P>
<P>
   Commitment: Ed Blanton, a 6-foot-9, 300-pound offensive lineman
from Napa, has orally committed to the Bruins.

SALVADORANS BALK AT U.S. PLAN TO USE AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ The United States has touched a
nerve in El Salvador by seeking to set up a military logistics
point for its war on drugs in a country where U.S. advisers,
intelligence and money not long ago helped fuel a devastating civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   The Salvadoran government agreed in March to allow U.S.
reconnaissance planes to use a military portion of the nation's
international airport at Comalapa for refueling and maintenance as
part of a regional network to monitor the routes used to smuggle
drugs from South America to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement has become caught up in a larger debate over
the role of the military here _ both El Salvador's own and that of
the United States _ in fighting organized crime and drug
trafficking in a country where murder, kidnapping and drug-related
crime have become hallmarks of life since the peace accords ended
the civil war eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The crime wave has increased pressures for the Salvadoran
military, which for years before and during the civil war was used
as a political repression force, to play a role in shoring up
domestic security, something the country's new Constitution
forbids. At the same time, the encroaching role of the United
States is seen by some as infringing on national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the accord has been held up in the National Assembly
by members of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or
FMLN, the political party of the former guerrillas who were sworn
enemies of many U.S. policymakers during the 1980s, when El
Salvador's civil war became part of the larger hostilities of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the accord say the U.S. presence now would help
deter the drug trade that has increasingly relied on routes along
El Salvador's Pacific coast and helped fuel an explosion in crack
cocaine use and related crime.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators from the FMLN, who form the largest single bloc in
the Assembly, say the accord turns over to the United States
monitoring and enforcement tasks that rightly belong to El
Salvador's own police and military. In addition, the 10-year
renewable agreement, they say, is too broad and does not guarantee
that the U.S. role will not grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a United States base here would be a provocation
because our democracy is not yet mature,'' said Blanca Flor
Bonilla, an FMLN legislator and member of the Foreign Affairs
Committee. ``The democracy we started with the peace accords is
weak. There are fears in military terms.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they do not consider the facility a base,
since it would not have barracks, commissaries or other features of
a permanent military installation. But they acknowledge that it
would be a linchpin of the U.S. government's anti-narcotics
strategy after the closing last year of Howard Air Force Base in
Panama, which handled in its day some 2,000 counternarcotics
flights per year.
</P>
<P>
   Existing facilities in Ecuador, Aruba and Curacao have been used
to fill the gap left by Howard's closing and have about 15 ground
support personnel stationed at each, with crews and aircraft
rotating through in short-term stays.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Americans carry side-arms as part of regular security
measures, but officials have insisted that they keep a low-profile
and not take part in on-the-ground operations or make arrests. Any
information about drugs entering other countries is passed on to
local authorities for them to make arrests and seizures, U.S.
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have favored the facilities because they cost
less to operate than a full base: about $18 million a year versus
$75.8 million a year at Howard. And spreading the facilities over
the Caribbean and Central and South America, they say, has allowed
for greater coverage than when the planes flew from the single base
in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   The new facilities, which in military parlance are known as
forward operating locations, or FOLs, reflect a deeper change in
U.S. relations with countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had Panama, it was a crutch for us,'' said an
administration official. ``We could do whatever we wanted and not
worry about working with other countries. This FOL prepares us for
the reality in the region that there are problems we can no longer
handle by ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But seeking that aid has proved tricky in Central America, where
the United States was deeply involved in trying to turn back
leftist insurgencies in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala
through the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions with the Costa Rican government over locating a
facility there failed earlier this year. Salvadoran officials
offered to place a facility here, saying they wanted to contribute
to regional security. But they also believed that it would help
them combat their own problems of drug abuse and crime.
</P>
<P>
   El Salvador has seen an explosion in crack consumption over the
last 15 years as traffickers started paying their Salvadoran
accomplices in cocaine, rather than cash. Salvadoran authorities
say seizures of cocaine have increased, including the discovery of
nearly 800 pounds aboard a private plane in June.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is the narco-traffickers have so much money that
they have technology that, due to our limited resources, we could
never have,'' said Jose Antonio Almendariz, a legislator of the
National Conciliation Party and president of the Assembly's Defense
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has that technology,'' he said. ``Yet there
are people who say, `Why do you have to use our few resources to
help the United States fight drugs that are heading there?' That
might have been true 10 years ago, but we see consumption in our
own country.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the accord worry that it fails to specify the
number of U.S. troops allowed here. They also bristle at general
references that allow U.S. personnel access to any government
institutions needed to carry out their mission.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo Avila, the nation's former chief of police who is now a
legislator, countered that the accord presented no such threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a support operation and not about war or anybody
coming here with tanks,'' said Avila, a member of the Nationalist
Republican Alliance party, or Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not in agreement that U.S. troops should come in here and
do what they want, but that is not in the spirit of the accord.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acknowledge that the agreement is broad, but they
say that it needs to be flexible in case troops have to move
elsewhere quickly or need equipment or supplies not readily
available here.
</P>
<P>
   The FMLN has indicated that it may support the agreement if
changes are made and, if not, insists that it can block it. But
even that is uncertain since lawmakers have yet to determine if the
accord is a routine matter that requires a simple majority to pass
or a treaty, which would need a three-quarters majority of the
Congress. The FMLN has enough votes to deny a three-quarters vote,
but it could not stop a simple majority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   While a selling point of the U.S. facility has been its possible
help in reducing crime, observers say it is unclear how much of an
impact it would actually have.
</P>
<P>
   Others criticize the government for seeking outside logistical
help from the United States before first addressing issues like
police corruption and judicial inefficiency at home.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a presidential commission has been
investigating police involvement in crimes like robbery and
kidnapping, and recently submitted a list of 216 officers for
expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing the country should do is improve public
security organizations,'' said Abraham Abrego of the Foundation for
Studies on the Application of Law.
</P>
<P>
   But for El Salvador, the larger issue is what role the military
should play in addressing internal security after a dozen years in
which it took part in a war that left some 60,000 Salvadorans dead.
</P>
<P>
   The military is currently conducting joint patrols with the
police in rural areas, and the head of the police recently called
for U.S. support with helicopters and flight crews for 15-day
operations against drug traffickers and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show support for some of these measures in the
face of growing insecurity.

   SALES FALL AT U.S. AUTO MAKERS
</P>
<P>
   Americans bought fewer autos than expected from General Motors,
Ford and DaimlerChrysler in June, opting to buy vehicles made by
Japanese and European companies or to keep the vehicles they
already own.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of North American-built cars and trucks fell 5.8 percent
at G.M. and 3.1 percent at Ford. DaimlerChrysler, beset by an aging
minivan lineup, said its sales excluding Mercedes-Benz fell 9.8
percent. Industrywide sales rose 0.2 percent, to 1.61 million cars
and light trucks. Shares of DaimlerChrysler rose $1, to $53.0625,
while G.M. rose $1.5625, to $59.625. Shares of Ford rose 93.75
cents, to $43.9375.

   These are trying days for New York's Silicon Alley, an industry
made up of as many as 7,000 enterprises, most of them tiny
start-ups. They tend to specialize in content rather than
technology, making them more vulnerable to gyrations on Wall

gone under or are barely hanging on, and more are expected to
succumb in the coming months.

   MANUFACTURING GROWTH SLOWS
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing expanded in June at the slowest pace in 17 months,
according to the National Association of Purchasing Management,
which said its monthly factory index fell to 51.8 in June from 53.2
in May. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed
construction spending rose 0.1 percent in May after falling 1.1
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS UP IN LIGHT TRADING
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose broadly in light trading before the holiday as
investors reacted to a lower-than-expected reading for
manufacturing activity in June. The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 112.78 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,560.67. The Nasdaq
composite index edged up 25.82 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,991.93,
while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 14.72 points,
or 1 percent, to 1,469.32.
</P>
<P>
   TREASURY PRICES UP
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices rose as the yield on the 10-year note fell to
5.98 percent from 6.01 percent and the yield on the 30-year bond
fell to 5.87 percent from 5.89 percent.

   RUSSIA FACING HIGHER INFLATION
</P>
<P>
   Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, warned that inflation is
rising at an annual rate of nearly 35 percent, a trend economists

   Minority shareholders of Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT in Hong Kong voted

EDITORIAL: WASHINGTON RENEGES ON A BARGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 4:
</P>
<P>
   Congress made a welfare deal with the states in 1996 that it now
threatens to tarnish. Under the deal, the states relinquished their
60-year-old entitlement to additional federal money when their
welfare rolls rise. In exchange, every state received a big fixed
annual grant to cover its welfare costs. Congress also gave 17
needy states extra help in the form of supplemental grants.
Congress now threatens to reclaim part of these supplemental
grants.
</P>
<P>
   This misguided proposal would punish poor states with high rates
of child poverty. It would also send the terrible message that
states will be better off if they spend money quickly and foolishly
rather than slowly and well.
</P>
<P>
   Congress provided the supplemental grants partly to help states
that were paying low benefits to existing enrollees. The idea was
to close some of the huge gap in benefits paid by rich and poor
states. But as a soaring economy and stiff welfare reforms drove
down welfare rolls by 30 percent in the years following the 1996
law, states found they did not need to spend every last federal
dollar. In addition, the families left behind were often the most
disadvantaged and hardest to help. Some states, needing time to
figure out how to reach them, held on to their money until they
could develop the right strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The administration proposed many months ago to raise revenue for
budget purposes by reclaiming some of the unspent supplemental
grants _ an idea embraced by the House and now under consideration
by the Senate. But according to the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a liberal research group, the supplemental grants are
essential in helping poorer states achieve parity in federal
grants. In the beginning, these poorer states spent a smaller
portion of their federal allotment than the wealthier states,
creating the impression that they did not need the extra money. But
their hesitancy was temporary. Now, according to the center, the
states receiving supplemental grants are using more of their
federal dollars than other states.
</P>
<P>
   Money is not the sole answer to poverty. But a recent evaluation
of an ambitious program in Minnesota shows that it can produce
startling results. The Minnesota welfare program combined generous
work incentives with child-care assistance and support for
enrollees after they find work. The result was a decline in the
number of poor living solely on welfare and a rise in employment
and marriage rates among enrollees. At a time when the federal
treasury is flush with cash, Congress need not deprive states with
high rates of child poverty of the money they were promised. It is
also money they desperately need to help the families left behind
by prosperity and facing federally imposed time limits on cash
assistance.

THREE MORE DODGERS TO APPEAL SUSPENSIONS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   After filtering through the information during the weekend,
players association associate general counsel Gene Orza said
another round of appeals would be filed on behalf of Dodgers left
fielder Gary Sheffield, outfielder F.P. Santangelo and left-handed
pitcher Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Each player had their five-game suspension upheld by Paul
Beeston, chief operating officer of the commissioner's office, last
week. Chad Kreuter, whose eight-game suspension wasn't reduced by
Beeston, already appealed his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's likely all of them will be appealed,'' Orza said
Monday. ``(Mike Fetters) won't because his is one game, but it's
likely the others will be appealed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fetters had his suspension reduced from four games to one. He
wanted to appeal the suspension because he maintains he did nothing
wrong in the May 16 fight with fans at Wrigley Field, but was
convinced by others that one game is not worth fighting over for a
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   While there is talk Kreuter's appeal would be heard during the
All-Star break in Atlanta, Orza said it doesn't mean everyone will
have their appeals heard then.
</P>
<P>
   Orza said the appeals could be filed as early as Wednesday.
Sheffield was slated to begin serving his suspension Saturday,
Perez on July 16 and Santangelo July 22.
</P>
<P>
   Orza confirmed this round of appeals will be heard by
commissioner Bud Selig and not independent arbitrator Shyam Das.
Officials from the Dodgers and throughout baseball are skeptical
Selig will overturn Beeston's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: In bringing middle infielder Mike Metcalfe into
the fold to replace outfielder Shawn Gilbert, a move expected
before today's game in San Diego, the Dodgers may finally have a
base-stealing threat who can swipe a bag late in a game to get into
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalfe is still learning the art of base-stealing, but he had
34 stolen bases in Double-A San Antonio and nine more in 28 games
at Triple-A Albuquerque. Metcalfe played shortstop with the Dukes
but may be able to give second baseman Mark Grudzielanek a
much-needed day off.... Right-hander Gregg Olson had no problems in
throwing one inning for Single-A San Bernardino on Sunday. He's
slated to make a few more rehab appearances before the Dodgers even
consider activating him.

POLICE MAY DROP CHARGE ON FAN WHO THREW BACK ROCKER'S BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS    
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City law enforcement officials were skeptical Monday
that the fan who was arrested for throwing a baseball onto the Shea
Stadium outfield near John Rocker would be prosecuted. But
prosecutors in Queens said they had not yet reached a decision on
the merits of the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the police charged Gregory Sweeney, 25, of Prospect
Heights in Brooklyn, with second-degree reckless endangerment after
he threw back to the grass a ball Rocker had tossed into the
stands. Rocker, who had been warming up left fielder Reggie
Sanders, had left the field before the ball landed in the outfield.
It did not land near any other player.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state penal code, second-degree reckless endangerment
is any ``conduct which creates a substantial risk of serious
physical injury to another person.'' It carries a maximum penalty
of one year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But some police officers quietly scoffed at the charge Monday,
saying the arresting officer had mistaken for a crime an action
that clearly resembled the baseball tradition of throwing back a
visiting team's home runs as a sign of disgust. They also noted
that Sweeney had been handed the ball by a police captain that it
had accidentally struck, and, as he held it, fans were chanting for
him to unload it. The ball landed harmlessly in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocker was already out of the way when the ball came down,''
one police supervisor said. ``It wasn't even near him.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at City Hall Monday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani defended
the police department, saying that it had handled with great skill
the security issues surrounding Rocker, who antagonized people
across the country with remarks in Sport Illustrated last year
about members of minority groups, gays, single mothers and
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   But even Giuliani, a former prosecutor, suggested the charge
might not hold up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is understandable that if a ball came down on the field in
a situation like that, they arrest the person who threw it and then
have to sort it out afterwards,'' the mayor said. ``If it turns out
to have an innocent explanation, it will work out.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the fate of the charge rests with Richard Brown,
the Queens Country district attorney. Brown's office said Monday
that it had gathered footage of Sweeney's toss and had not decided
how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to review our videotapes and make the decisions
accordingly,'' said Sherry Hunter, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Because Sweeney was issued a desk appearance ticket, he is not
expected in court for about a month. And another official said that
before Sweeney appears, the prosecutors will probably drop the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear that the criminal activity, if any, was
minimal,'' the official said. ``But we do have an obligation to
review it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney did not return two phone messages Monday. &QL;

VORBE A PLEASANT SURPRISE FOR GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ There are not too many strikers in Major League
Soccer who can outrun D.C. United defender Eddie Pope, and that
includes speedsters Cobi Jones and Luis Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   So you can imagine how Pope felt last week against the Galaxy as
he chased a ball behind him. Jones and Hernandez weren't around,
but flying in came Sebastian Vorbe, who not only sprinted past Pope
but also finished a beautiful one-touch strike to the far post to
even the match, 1-1. The Galaxy went on to win, 2-1, after a late
Jones goal.
</P>
<P>
   Vorbe, a key performer on Haiti's national team, has been the
Galaxy's biggest surprise since the allocation of Luis Hernandez.
When the Galaxy lost Costa Rican midfielder Roy Myers in the
Hernandez deal, there was a foreign slot available for Vorbe, who
impressed Schmid in preseason workouts especially in a February
match in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Vorbe loves to take defenders one-on-one, but it is his speed
that may end up paying big dividends for the Galaxy, which plays
host to the Columbus Crew tonight at 7:30 at the Rose Bowl, with
the traditional Fourth of July fireworks show following.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's faster than he shows,'' said Schmid. ``The one thing I
would like to see is that speed more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shows it periodically during a game, maybe two or three
times, but when we played against Talleres in Argentina he smoked a
lot of their players over 50 and 60 yards and you saw that same
speed against Pope.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jones and Hernandez getting most of the attention, Vorbe
admits he's left alone to roam the front, and he's taking advantage
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know me here so they don't know what I can do,''
Vorbe said of MLS defenders. ``They key on the big names on our
team so I'm able to sneak in the back or just force my way through.
</P>
<P>
   ``My speed is something they do not expect. Once I kick it (to
space), I feel I can get by a lot of these guys and create chances
for myself and my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Vorbe will get most of the attention soon. After Saturday's
match at Miami, the Galaxy will likely lose Robin Fraser, Greg
Vanney and Jones to the U.S. National team and Hernandez to the
Mexican team for two weeks and two games for World Cup qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Vorbe, asked if he'll feel the pressure of having to perform
when the National team players leave, laughed at the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence and I've adjusted to the league and
the level of play,'' Vorbe said. ``But I don't know if there is any
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back home I'm under more pressure because of our crazy fans.
Here, the fans are more quiet, they sit down and clap their hands
or boo. If you play bad in Haiti you have to worry about getting
stuff thrown at you. If you (mess) up, you know, you're looking
over your shoulder to make sure you don't get hit with something.
</P>
<P>
   ``But seriously, I'm looking forward to that challenge when our
guys leave. We're going to see how much depth we have, everyone is
going to need to step up on this team for us to win, including
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   TODAY'S GAME: Columbus Crew (7-8-4, 25 points) vs. Galaxy
(8-5-7, 31 points), Rose Bowl, 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   RADIO: KTNQ 1020-AM (Spanish); KRLA 1110-AM (English)
TELEVISION: Fox Sports West 2 SERIES: Teams tied, 2-2, April 8;
Columbus leads 7-3-1 all-time.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH UPDATE: Columbus is struggling without injured U.S.
national team striker Brian McBride, but the Crew always seems to
play well against the Galaxy. Galaxy midfielder Danny Pena had
surgery on his right knee to repair at torn ACL and is expected out
two to three months, otherwise, the Galaxy is at full strength for
the first time in six weeks. Cobi Jones, who is playing with a cast
because of a third-degree sprained right thumb, has dropped to
midfield and Haitian striker Sebastian Vorbe has earned a starting
spot. The Galaxy expects a crowd of 50,000 tonight because of the
traditional Fourth of July fireworks show which follows the game.

GAMBILL EARNS AN APPEARANCE ON CENTER COURT  
 PHILIPPOUSSIS' NEW LIFE  
 A BRIEF INTERRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Jan-Michael Gambill was too numb from his
victory Monday to let the reality of playing Pete Sampras in the
quarterfinals on Wednesday crash his feel-good moment.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Gambill has played under the burden to be the next
great American player. Early this evening, he levitated above the
Wimbledon grass after serving 33 aces and upsetting ninth-seeded
Thomas Enqvist, 7-6 (5), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say I'm one of the luckiest people on earth,'' said the
56th-ranked Gambill, 23, who makes his home in Colbert, Wash. ``I
get to go out there in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon and play on
Center Court, play Pete Sampras, the king of Wimbledon, the best
player to ever play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to go out there and have a lot of fun. I'm
going to play great tennis. It's something to look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   He has arrived at this point after a so-so year. In the spring,
Gambill tried a new racket, ditched it to return to his old one and
then regained his confidence. Now, his performance at Wimbledon
might land him on the Davis Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis Cup is something I hold very special,'' Gambill said.
``There are a lot of players who could play. To be named to the
team is huge. It would be very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a lot of buzz around Gambill. Named after
the actor Jan-Michael Vincent by his mother, who liked the ring of
the name, Gambill was at the center of some hype when his ranking
popped up to 31 in March 1999. From there, he slipped down the
ranking and out of sight, until this week. Before Wimbledon, he had
never advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's all the rage. In a tabloid report, he was linked to
the pop singer Britney Spears and was asked about another teen
idol, Christina Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never met either of those girls,'' said Gambill, who
recently signed a contract with the Ford Modeling Agency. ``That's
really funny. I have a girlfriend. My girlfriend lives in
Connecticut. She's a model, not a singer.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIPPOUSSIS' NEW LIFE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the months since Mark Philippoussis toned down his night
life, his energy and focus have given him a new life on the court.
Monday evening, he continued his march through the men's draw with
a 6-1, 5-7, 6-7 (9), 6-3, 6-3 victory against Britain's last hope,
Tim Henman. Philippoussis' victory came just two days after his
five-hour third-round match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got a couple of massages,'' said Philippoussis, who
ripped 43 aces on Saturday and 34 Monday. ``I stayed relaxed. I
just wanted to leave everything on the court again.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Philippoussis will take his big serve and face the
best returner in the game, Andre Agassi, during a quarterfinal
match. Mentally and physically, he said, he is prepared to go
another five sets if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 23, and I feel pretty young,'' Philippoussis said. ``I'm
sure I've got a few more in me.''
</P>
<P>
   A BRIEF INTERRUPTION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A streaker interrupted play on Court 14 during a doubles match
between the teams of Anna Kournikova and Natasha Zvereva and Amy
Frazier and Katie Schlukebir. With a slogan off a Kournikova ad for
sports bras written across his chest, the streaker was quickly
grabbed by security as he darted across the court. In response,
Kournikova buried her head into a towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't paying attention,'' said Kournikova, whose team
advanced to the fourth round, 6-2, 6-1. ``That's why we probably
are professional athletes. We kind of are used to everything
around. I was just trying to think about the match and about the
next game especially because it was important.''  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On June 26, 1929, when the poet Federico Garcia Lorca
arrived from Madrid to study English at Columbia University's
summer session, he was nearly suicidal. His book ``Gypsy Ballads''
had been a best seller in Spain, but some critics were calling his
work untutored and accusing him of being a popularizer.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Lorca believed he had reached a dead end as a poet. At
the same time, Salvador Dali, with whom he was in love, had gone
off to make the film ``Andalusian Dog,'' directed by Luis Bunuel.
And Garcia Lorca's lover Emilio Aladren had taken up with a woman.
When Garcia Lorca heard that Fernando de los Rios, a professor who
was a friend of his family, was going to lecture at Columbia that
summer, he persuaded his father to pay his expenses so he could
accompany Los Rios to Columbia. The father thought the trip might
be good for his son's poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Lorca never did learn English at the summer session; in
fact, he never even took the final exam. But his 10-month stay
resulted in one of his greatest works, ``Poet in New York,'' a
collection of poems about the city, written in Spanish on the back
of Columbia University stationery.
</P>
<P>
   This summer Columbia is celebrating the centenary of its summer
session, and to mark the occasion it has offered a special course
on its famous pupil, conducted by Howard Young, Smith Professor of
Modern Languages Emeritus at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif.,
who is the author of some of the earliest critical work on Garcia
Lorca in English.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Lorca, who had been born in 1898 into a prosperous
farming family in Andalusia, knew little of city life, and when he
arrived in New York he was stunned by what he saw. The city was a
perfect metaphor for his spiritual condition, its ``extrahuman
architecture, its furious rhythm, its geometry and anguish,'' as he
described it later, according to a biography by Leslie Stainton,
``Garcia Lorca: A Dream of a Life'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
1999). In his poem ``Back From a Walk'' in the ``Poet in New York''
collection (Globe Press Evergreen, 1955) he wrote:
``Heaven-murdered one,//among shapes turning serpent/and shapes
seeking crystal,/I'll let my hair grow long.'' (The translation is
by the poet Ben Belitt.)
</P>
<P>
   He had never seen such poverty and decay. ``Dawn in New York
bears/ four pillars of slime,'' he wrote in another poem, ``Dawn,''
``and a storm of black pigeons/ that dabble dead water.''
</P>
<P>
   He also witnessed the stock market crash in October 1929,
traveling down to Wall Street to see firsthand the crowds and the
chaos: ``Time for the cobras to hiss on the uppermost levels,/ for
the nettle to jostle the patios and roof-gardens,/'' he wrote in
``Dance of Death,`` ``for the Market to crash in a pyramid of
moss,/ time for the jungle lianas that follow the rifles _ / soon,
soon enough, ever so soon./ Woe to you, Wall Street!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile he was paying little attention to his Columbia
classes. Garcia Lorca distracted his fellow classmates by mimicking
the teacher behind his back, Stainton writes, and tried to hide his
lack of English by greeting the dormitory staff with elaborate bows
and twirls.
</P>
<P>
   He also spent long stretches of his day in bed. One dorm room
acquaintance, John Crow, tired of Garcia Lorca's late-night visits
and found his ego ``unbearable.'' But other new friends, like
Herschel Brickell, who worked at Henry Holt &AMP; Co., were captivated
by his exotic presence. Brickell noted particularly his ``lively
and eloquent hands.'' At the Brickells' home Garcia Lorca played
the piano and sang, and one evening the guitarist Andres Segovia
heard him perform and called him ``phenomenal.'' ``He electrified
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Garcia Lorca would ``disappear and be gone for a
couple of days,'' Young said. He discovered that he could move
about much more openly as a gay man in New York than in Spain, with
its conservative Roman Catholic culture. His rooms, No. 617 in
Furnald Hall and 1231 in John Jay Hall, were close to Riverside
Drive, a trysting place after dark. Many pieces in ``Poet in New
York'' can be read as coded references to his homosexual
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, Garcia Lorca discovered Harlem, with its
thriving gay culture. Amid all the city's corruption, it was one
place that seemed spiritually pure. ``You Harlem! You Harlem! You
Harlem!'' he wrote exultantly in ``The King of Harlem.'' ``No
anguish to equal your thwarted vermilions, / your blood-shaken,
darkened eclipses,/ your garnet ferocity, deaf and dumb in the
shadows,/ your hobbled, great king in the janitor's suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Lorca's images of black people are stereotypical. They
are depicted as purely sensual and primitive. But the injustice of
racism left an indelible mark on him and his future writing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he was exploring the city, Garcia Lorca was
encountering significant new artistic influences. He attended the
theater avidly, everything from Broadway plays to black revues and
Chinese operas. The American theater seemed revolutionary to him,
Stainton writes, and its technical advances fascinated him.

 NEW YORK: fascinated him.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Columbia also had one of the strongest Spanish departments in
the country, headed by Federico de Onis, and Garcia Lorca was
immediately thrust into its intellectual atmosphere. De Onis
founded the Hispanic Institute as a center for Spanish culture, and
Garcia Lorca joined in its activities. Young says that the wavering
line around the verses of Ruben Dario on the institute logo was
drawn by Garcia Lorca.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an acquaintance, Leon Felipe, was translating
Whitman's ``Song of Myself.'' To Garcia Lorca, Whitman was a pure,
``male'' homosexual, not the effeminate figure Garcia Lorca feared
that he himself was, Stainton writes. ``Not for one moment, Walt
Whitman, comely old man,/ have I ceased to envision your beard full
of butterflies,/'' he wrote in ``Ode to Walt Whitman, ``your
corduroy shoulders, worn thin by the moon,/ your chaste, Apollonian
thighs.'' His encounter with Whitman resulted in a major shift in
style. He abandoned the classical rhyme and metric schemes of
previous work and embraced Whitman's long, declarative sentences
and free-verse form.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Garcia Lorca's friend Angel Flores, was
translating Eliot's ``Waste Land.'' ``Garcia Lorca saw that
translation and read it,'' said Young, ``and some of the vocabulary
and feeling for disengagement and broken objects and lack of
direction crept into `Poet in New York.''' Eliot's influence can be
seen in ``New York: Office and Denunciation,'' for instance: ``What
shall I do now? Align all the landscapes?/ Muster the lovers who
turn into photographs/ and later are splinters of wood, and
mouthfuls of blood?'' The lines echo ``The Waste Land:'' ``What
shall I do now? What shall I do now?'' And, later in the Eliot
poem, ``Shall I at least set my lands in order?''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1930, Garcia Lorca left New York. After his return to
Spain, he reclaimed the classical style in his elegy ``Lament for
Ignacio Sanchez Mejias,'' written in 1934 about the death of a
Spanish bullfighter.
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia Lorca was a changed man. He had witnessed racism
firsthand in America, and he saw the similarities between the
condition of blacks here and of women and gays in Spain. Without
the experience in New York, Young says, he might not have written
his elegy ``Sonnets of a Dark Love,'' generally said to be to his
lover Rafael Rodriguez Rapun.
</P>
<P>
   The New York visit also enabled him to become a playwright.
Before, Garcia Lorca had tried to write plays, but New York
``provided the springboard into a social, poetic theater,'' Young
said. His plays included ``Blood Wedding,'' ``Yerma'' and ``The
House of Bernarda Alba.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 civil war broke out in Spain. Garcia Lorca sided with
the anti-fascist Republicans but did not fight. The fascist
Falangists found him suspect because of his liberal views and
because he was famous and homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   His biography recounts that on Aug. 9, a Falangist squad invaded
his family's house in Granada. He was thrown down the stairs, hit
and taunted with the word ``Queer!'' He went into hiding with
friends. But on Aug. 16, three Falangist officers arrived to arrest
him. Garcia Lorca's hostess asked why the poet was being taken.
``His works,'' one officer answered.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later Garcia Lorca was driven to a prison in the
foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The next day at dawn, near a stand
of olive trees, it is believed, he was shot. His body was never
found. In 1986 the Socialist government of Spain built a monument
at the spot.
</P>
<P>
   When Garcia Lorca reflected back on his time in New York, he
called it ``one of the key experiences of his life,'' Young said.
``He came here to get away from the memories of the love affair in
Madrid, and looking for a different kind of poetry. He found it in
New York.''

9 OFFICERS FACE DISCIPLINE OVER CENTRAL PARK ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Monday that
nine police officers, including six supervisors, would be
disciplined for mistakes that allowed an unruly mob of men to turn
a section of Central Park into a menacing gantlet where they
sexually assaulted dozens of women after the National Puerto Rican
Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the nine officers, Safir said, the two
high-ranking chiefs who were in charge at the June 11 parade will
be given letters of instruction noting the shortcomings of the
operation, and three civilian 911 dispatchers will be punished for
improper handling of calls reporting the riotous behavior, thus
delaying the police response.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that mistakes were made before, during and after
the parade,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   The department's internal review, based on interviews with 236
officers, painted a detailed picture of the attacks, in which bawdy
horseplay on a sweltering day degenerated into sexual abuse. The
review found that some commanders failed to deploy officers
properly and failed to adjust to changing crowd conditions when the
parade ended earlier than expected and large segments of the 1
million spectators began to move about. In the grossest failures,
the review found, some officers disregarded women who complained
that they had been attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The officers cited Monday face a variety of punishments, from
letters of reprimand to formal misconduct charges, which carry a
maximum penalty of dismissal. A senior police official said,
however, that it was unlikely anyone would be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine officers cited, two were accused of failing to
respond properly to women who had tried to report sexual assaults.
Another officer and one supervisor were faulted for leaving their
posts on Central Park South near where some of the attacks
occurred. Five supervisors, including an inspector and two deputy
inspectors, were cited for mistakes in deploying officers or for
letting officers go home even as the unruly crowd was growing
inside the park.
</P>
<P>
   The report immediately started discussion by representatives of
police unions and victims of whether the sanctions were too strong
or too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. John Driscoll, president of the Captain's Endowment
Association, which represents supervisors up to the rank of deputy
chief, said the captains and inspectors cited were scapegoats who
had done nothing wrong. There was no one assigned to work the
problem area of the park, he said, and no way for the line
supervisors to have known a problem was developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel that by offering up these people at high-ranking
levels, they will appease the media and the politicians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, was more muted. He released a statement that said the
union would defend its members but did not criticize the internal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Several victims said Monday that the department did not seem to
have done enough. Although six victims have reported that about a
half dozen officers failed to take their complaints seriously, only
two officers were cited for such misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Susan M. Karten, a lawyer for one of the victims, said, ``This
doesn't make any women in this city, which is supposed to be safe,
feel any safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said their investigation had been complicated
by the fact that two victims would not cooperate while others had
difficulty identifying the officers involved.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 59 women have reported to police that they were
assaulted in the park or its environs by men who doused them with
water and beer, tried, successfully at times, to remove their
clothes, and groped them. So far, 29 men have been arrested and
officials have said they are looking for 17 more.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Department officials also said it was a coincidence that the
city chose to release its findings about the embarrassing incident
on July 3, when much of New York is away or preoccupied with
holiday celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We released this report when I believed it was done,'' Safir
said.

</P>
<P>
   NANTES, France - Benoit Joachim, the U.S. Postal Service's
youngest competitor in the Tour de France, is getting grief about
his new nickname. The media in his home country of Luxembourg refer
to him as ``Prince.''
</P>
<P>
   He gained popularity in his tiny country after winning its road
race national competition last month. Joachim also is the first
rider from Luxembourg to ride in the Tour since Lucien Didier in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   We're not in Texas ...
</P>
<P>
   The route leading from Loudun west to Nantes on Monday afternoon
went right through wine country. The riders were flanked by miles
of muscadet grapes, which are used to produce the area's wine.
</P>
<P>
   In one small village, a man and two women stopped any car that
looked like an official Tour vehicle and handed the occupants boxed
bottles of cold local wine. The riders, however, were not given the
same treat.
</P>
<P>
   Tour traditions
</P>
<P>
   Monday's stage allowed for an unusual Tour tradition _ Le
Regional d'Etape. Any rider who makes his home near the stage route
or has family in the area can make a stop to say bonjour to family
and friends. Numerous fans held up signs Monday afternoon welcoming
``Franck.'' The rider they were referring to was Franck Bouyer, who
grew up in Vihiers and now rides for team Bonjour, which is making
its first appearance in the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Travelogue
</P>
<P>
   Monday's stage ended in Nantes, Britanny's largest city, with
its port and high-tech industries feeding its bustling economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nantes, like so many cities and villages in the country, has a
rich history. It was here that the Edict of Nantes was issued in
1598 by Henry IV. The edict gave religious freedom to Protestants,
although it was later revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Henri made his proclamation from the Chateau des Ducs de
Bretagne, a castle, complete with moat and drawbridge, that was
built in the ninth and 10th centuries and renovated in the 15th
century. The chateau served as a prison for Gilles de Retz, the
mass murderer better known by the nickname ``Bluebeard.'' Louis XII
also married Anne of Britanny there in 1499.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent history, Nantes served as the arrival city for
the fifth and next-to-last stage of the original Tour in 1903. The
original race, which numbered only 20 riders, then went from Nantes
to Paris to finish off the world's biggest bike race. That year,
Maurice Garin rode the 292 miles from Nantes to Paris to cap off
his three-hour victory over the field.

NEW JERSEY INCREASES JAIL TIME FOR POSSESSING ECSTASY DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman signed a bill Monday that
increases the legal penalties for possession and sale of the
synthetic drug Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy is the street name of the compound MDMA, which has
become increasingly popular among high school and college students
and club-goers because it produces feelings of euphoria and mildly
hallucinogenic effects, with few immediately apparent side effects.
Surveys of high school and college students indicate that MDMA is
growing in popularity, even as the use of other drugs like cocaine
and marijuana has leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is sold under a variety of names, including X, Adam,
clarity, XTC and essence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old law in New Jersey, possession of any amount of the
drug was punishable by up to five years in prison. But most
first-time offenders received only probation. Under the new law,
the maximum penalty is 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent studies have suggested that even limited use of
Ecstasy may cause brain damage and memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said those reports, plus several large seizures of
Ecstasy by New Jersey police officers in recent months, had
persuaded her to ask state legislators to put Ecstasy into the same
legal class as heroin and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's proposal received overwhelming support from
lawmakers, and she said Monday that she hoped that the severity of
the punishment would convince teen-agers of Ecstasy's danger. ``A
quick thrill isn't worth the threat of long-term damage to your
health and future,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The new law makes it a first-degree offense to manufacture or
distribute Ecstasy. Penalties for possession of the drug escalate
depending on the amount: from a five-year prison term for a
half-ounce or less, up to 20 years in prison for possession of five
ounces or more. Each ounce of Ecstasy is usually divided into about
100 pills.

BOOK SAYS GIULIANI'S FATHER SERVED TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A forthcoming biography of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says
that the mayor's father, Harold Giuliani, served a year and a half
in state prison for robbing a milk deliveryman.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, ``Rudy! An Investigative Biography of
Rudolph Giuliani,'' by Wayne Barrett, the elder Giuliani in 1934,
10 years before Rudolph Giuliani's birth, pulled a gun on the
milkman in the corridor of a building on East 96th Street and, with
an accomplice, robbed him of $128.82.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett is a reporter for The Village Voice. The book, which is
to be published July 10 by Basic Books, was excerpted on the
Voice's Web site on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Giuliani was sentenced to two to five years and served a
year and a half, the book states.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, through his chief spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, declined
to comment on the account.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not read it,'' she said. ``He has no plans to read it.
He has no comment on it.'' Asked specifically if the report was
true, Mindel again would not answer. Several longtime aides of the
mayor also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Correction Department and the Manhattan
district attorney's office could not be reached Monday night.

PGA SEEKS A HIGH-COURT REVIEW OF MARTIN CART SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARCIA CHAMBERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does the Americans With Disabilities Act trump the authority of
golf's organizing bodies to make their own rules? Or are
professional golf organizations exempt from the act because the
competitive nature of the sport would be forever changed?
</P>
<P>
   The Professional Golfers Association Tour has asked the U.S.
Supreme Court to review these questions in its petition seeking
review in the Casey Martin golf-cart lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The tour said it needs clarification of the act because this
year two federal appeals courts interpreted it differently. The
tour argues that the golf's governing bodies oversee the rules of
their competitions.
</P>
<P>
   The cases centered on two professional golfers, both with
congenital degenerative circulatory diseases that prevent them from
walking in tournaments. Golf's organizing bodies are hoping the
Supreme Court will resolve the conflict the tour and the U.S. Golf
Association now face in the many states where their tournaments are
held and where different rulings apply.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals permitted
Martin, who now plays on the PGA Tour, the right to use a cart
because he has a rare disorder that has deformed his right leg. The
act applied to Martin, the appeals court said, because tour events,
even ``within the ropes'' and involving the most elite players in
the world, are held at a public accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Ford Olinger, a
golf pro from Indiana who has a degenerative hip, was not entitled
to a cart for qualifying events for the U. S. Open because a cart
would change the nature of the competition. These decisions, the
court ruled, were ``best left to those who hold the future of golf
in trust.''
</P>
<P>
   This unsettled state of affairs became even more complicated in
May when a Texas resident who has polio, JaRo Jones, sued the USGA
in federal court in Austin for the right to use a cart to qualify
for the U.S. Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a federal judge ruled in favor of Jones, in a case
that is similar to Olinger's. Texas is part of the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, and thus the Olinger decision did not apply. Even
with a cart, Jones shot an 84 and did not qualify.
</P>
<P>
   A tour spokesman, Bob Combs, said Monday that he believed the
tour's chances of obtaining Supreme Court review are increased ``if
requests to review both the Olinger and Martin decisions are before
the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently denied Olinger's
request for a rehearing before its entire bench. The stage is now
set for Olinger to appeal to the Supreme Court. Olinger's lawyer,
John C. Hamilton, has said he will do so.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the Supreme Court are known to be golfers _
Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Anthony M. Kennedy.
Four votes are needed to accept a case for review. The court may
act by October.

MARTIN HITS STRIDE DESPITE OFF-FIELD WOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES The bold-faced headlines from a Pittsburgh newspaper
detail an unsavory side of the Al Martin story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good guy Martin has run into bad times off the field,'' said
one publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin's image is probably ruined forever,'' the same
newspaper reported the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 32, left fielder for the San Diego Padres and graduate
of Rowland High School, came under scrutiny this season after he
was arrested in March for alleged spousal abuse. There were
allegations of bigamy and paternal absenteeism that further clouded
his status.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the charges continue to hang over his head, others
were investigated and dropped. And, Martin vehemently denies he is
guilty of anything. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Back when he was still playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates,
Martin was known as much for his off-field philanthropy as his
on-field performance. But on the night of March 20, that all
changed when police in Scottsdale, Ariz. received a call from a
woman who said she was beaten by her ``pretend husband.''
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived, a woman, identified as Shawn
Haggerty-Martin, 31, said she had recently married Martin in Las
Vegas. She said she and her husband were arglen by her ``pretend
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived, a woman, identified as Shawn
Haggerty-Martin, 31, said she had recently married Martin in Las
Vegas. She said she and her husband were arguing. Blows were
exchanged, then Haggerty-Martin claimed her husband threatened to
``O.J.'' her.
</P>
<P>
   The two were arrested and each charged with domestic battery.
</P>
<P>
   Just one problem with her story: Police claimed that Martin was
already married to another woman one who lived just seven miles
away. Investigators said felony bigamy charges might be in the
works for the ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty-Martin returned to court and agreed to a year's
probation and entered a spousal abuse counseling program. Al
Martin's case is still pending. Maricopa County prosecutors
forwarded their bigamy investigation to Clark County authorities
who declined to file charges.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Padres' media guide, Martin continues to live
in Scottsdale with his wife Cathy and their son Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Martin expressed sadness about the whole situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 32 years of doing everything exactly right and being
thought of as a pretty decent guy, it's a long fall from glory,''
he said in a March interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be what hurts the most you feel like you let so
many people down. Then you realize that there is nothing you can
really do or say that's going to make it better for the world. You
just go on faith on your past and hope that people understand the
type of person you are.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   On field, Martin is having a much better year. A career .289
hitter, Martin is batting .308 this season, has 22 RBIs, 49 runs
and 10 home runs through June. He's stolen six bases and has an
on-base percentage of .354. He loves his return to California and
is pondering a move from Scottsdale to La Jolla.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far it's been pretty good,'' Martin said of his first year
with the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact his team was 35-42 and 10-1/2 games out of
first at the end of June, Martin praised his organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably on a whole the best group of guys I've been
around as far as getting along with everybody and everybody getting
along with each other. We're battling and this year has been
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   In his seven years with Pittsburgh, Martin had become something
of an institution. As a Pirate, he created ``Al's Army,'' which
provided tickets to 20,000 inner city youths between 1996 and 1999.
His 62 lifetime home runs at Three Rivers Stadium ranks fifth on
the ballpark's all-time list along with Pirate greats Willie
Stargell, Barry Bonds, Dave Parker and Bill Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw that last year, I thought, `What in the world is
Martin's name doing up there,''' he said. ``It made me smile.''
</P>
<P>
   But, at the end of last season, Martin felt it was time to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``In so many ways, I forced the trade,'' he said. ``I wanted to
go somewhere where I was happy and enjoyed life. So far that's been
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was born in West Covina and grew up in Diamond Bar,
said the trade to San Diego meant coming home. It also meant
playing in the same division as longtime friend Dave Hansen of the
Dodgers. The two played football and baseball together at Rowland
High School and remain friends.
</P>
<P>
   The two even share a birthdate: Nov. 24. Martin was born in
1967, Hansen in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my hero,'' Hansen said. ``He didn't even start playing
baseball until he was in high school and look where he is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was a standout football player at Rowland, never
considered baseball as an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who really made me like it was Hansen,'' Martin
said. ``He'd tell me a lot and help me. It was great hanging around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   A nephew of former Oakland Raider great Rod Martin, Al Martin
believed his future was on the gridiron. Although the Padre media
guide says Martin earned a scholarship to USC and played two
seasons at strong safety with the Trojans, USC officials have no
record of his presence, said assistant sports information director
Paul Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   A former coach recalled that Martin was drafted by the Braves
straight out of high school in the June 1985 free agent draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember him ever being at USC,'' said Rowland High
School assistant football coach Craig Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Martin was traded to the Pirates and made his major
league debut in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Although he no longer plays it, Martin still follows football
closely especially his favorite team, the Raiders. He's such a fan,
he even drives a silver and black car.
</P>
<P>
   He's said he hopes that somehow football's bad boys find their
way back to the glory of their heyday of the mid-1980s when he was
still in high school and spent time as a Raiders' ball boy.
</P>
<P>
   Considering his off-season brush with the law, Martin speaks
from experience when he offered his assessment of the Raiders'
chances in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll be in it this year,'' he said. ``If they can
keep their kicker (Sebastian Janokowski) out of trouble.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Martin's troubles aren't over just yet. He faces a pre-trial
appearance in Scottsdale on July 26 and could be sentenced to a
year in jail if convicted. It's likely he will receive probation, a
fine and community service, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, who remembered Martin as a ``happy-go-lucky'' youth with
a big smile and low profile, said he began seeing a change in
Martin's personality last season. Snyder, who coached Martin at
Rowland, said he always paid a visit to the ballplayer when the
Pirates came to town.
</P>
<P>
   But the last time he saw Martin, Snyder said the ballplayer
practically ignored him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe something was brewing then,'' Snyder said. ``I could
tell last year when he gave me the cold shoulder that something had
changed. I could tell something was up.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like others who knew Martin from his days at Rowland High
School, Snyder said he was stunned to hear of the March
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of shocked,'' Snyder said. ``I guess you hope
something like this isn't true ... people at school are all hoping
for the best for him.'' &QL;

 TECHNOLOGY STILL DRIVING ECONOMY  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last year you could have made loads of money in
high-technology stocks simply by throwing darts at the Nasdaq
newspaper listings and buying whatever you hit.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as you may have noticed, it has gotten harder.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index went up in flames
between early March and late May, losing a horrifying 37 percent of
its value. Despite a sputtering attempt to rise from the ashes in
recent weeks, it still stands roughly 20 percent below its all-time
high.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is it considered prudent to blindly buy any tech stock
with a glitzy name and a vaguely plausible business model.
</P>
<P>
   Today, investors in tech stocks must focus as well on such
old-fashioned criteria as earnings, market share and management
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules have changed,'' says David Readerman, an analyst and
partner with Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco. ``People are
more aware of, and sensitive to, stock valuations.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors, devastated by the spring market collapse, have
vowed never to risk their money on tech stocks again.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a mistake, says Gary Schlossberg, an economist
with Wells Capital Management in San Francisco. It is technology
that is driving the economy, he points out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current expansion is a tech-based expansion,'' Schlossberg
observes. ``Computers, semiconductors and telecommunications
equipment may account for only about 10 percent of manufactured
goods, but they also accounted for three-quarters of the growth in
industrial output in the past year. The growth prospects should
continue to hold up quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg cautions, however, that the Nasdaq index continues
to be priced at more than 100 times earnings for the latest 12
months. By contrast, the broader-based Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
is selling at somewhat more than 30 times earnings _ and even that
is extraordinarily high by historical standards.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the largest, most mature high-tech companies sport
triple-digit price-earnings ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, the giant producer of networking products,
recently was selling at 133 times trailing earnings and 122 times
estimated fiscal 2000 earnings. Oracle, the softwaremaker, was
selling at 116 times trailing earnings and 89 times estimated
earnings. For computermaker Sun Microsystems, the figures were 103
and 94 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premium P/E's are generally warranted if a company is in a
market space that has very fast growth,'' says Martin Pyykkonen, an
analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Pyykkonen notes that Cisco _ thanks to its vital role in helping
to build the Internet infrastructure _ has confounded tradition and
common sense by growing faster as it has grown larger. As a result,
its P/E also has grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has done so well against so many competitors,''
Pyykkonen says. ``It has size, critical mass, resources _ it is
very difficult to compete with.''
</P>
<P>
   But can a price-earnings ratio of 100 ever be justified?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, says Alfred Goldman, market strategist for A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Sons in St. Louis. P/E multiples aren't arrived at by scientific
method, he says. Rather, they reflect a ``guess'' about future
earnings, mixed with whatever is the prevailing ``state of mind''
among investors.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart J. Pillette, of Pillette Investment Management in San
Francisco, is less comfortable with the lofty high-tech P/E's.
</P>
<P>
   However, he says he would be willing to buy such stocks as
Cisco, Oracle and Sun at present levels because their prices have
been depressed, and they might bounce back toward their old highs.
</P>
<P>
   Pillette suggests buying these stocks near the bottom of their
``trading range,'' and selling them near the top of that range.
</P>
<P>
   The current trading range, he figures, is bounded by the highs
the stocks reached in March, and the lows they hit during the
tech-stock bloodbath in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   For Cisco, the range would be roughly 80 on the high end and 50
on the low end. The stock closed yesterday at $64.63.
</P>
<P>
   For Oracle, the range would extend from 88 to 62 (current price:
$80.19), while for Sun the range would be 105 to 71 ($90.44).
</P>
<P>
   Riding stocks up and down their trading ranges can be profitable
as long as the range boundaries remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, stocks eventually break out of their trading
ranges, and there is no telling when that might happen.
</P>
<P>
   You can get into big trouble if you buy a stock near the bottom
of its range and it then drops through the floor, or if you sell it
short near the top of the range and it then goes through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   All the experts agree that you had better do a lot of homework
before you buy any tech stock.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bakar, director of research with Chase H&AMP;Q in San
Francisco, says that investors interested in a particular company
must first pull back and take a critical look at the industry in
which the company operates.
</P>
<P>
   Bakar advises that you ask yourself: ``What is the market they
serve; is it an attractive one; what's its growth rate; what are
the competitive dynamics; what are the barriers to entry? You have
to put everything in context.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are charmed by the industry, Bakar says, you next have to
ask ``what is the company's positioning within its market?'' You
want to be sure that the company is ``a leader or future leader.''
It has to be profitable now, or ``on a clear road to
profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Limit yourself to companies with strong management teams that
can ``execute their strategy'' and that hold positions in their
markets that are ``defensible,'' Bakar adds.
</P>
<P>
   Such comprehensive research might seem like a tall order to most
investors. It is time-consuming, and it may require an
understanding of arcane technological concepts.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have the time and the will, there are plenty of
resources that could prove helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Your broker probably can supply you with in-depth reports from
the leading Wall Street analysts. Sometimes these reports can be
found on the broker's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   There also are countless financially oriented sites on the Web _
such as  &LR; www.yahoo.com &LR;  and  &LR; www.freeedgar.com &LR;  _ that will help
you dig out news, statistics and other facts about virtually any
publicly held company.

 NAPSTER BEING BULLIED, LAWYER SAYS  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Napster Inc.'s high-powered lawyer, who was the
trust-busting attorney who led the government's prosecution of
Microsoft Corp., said Monday that the recording industry wants to
squash his client to maintain its tight control on record sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dominant firm or a trade association shouldn't have the
ability to use its power to stifle a new technology,'' said David
Boies, speaking for the first time publicly about the San Mateo,
Calif., startup's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Recording Industry Association of America who are
suing Napster for copyright infringement control the distribution
of all but a small percentage of popular recording artists, Boies
said. But Napster's popular file-sharing program is ``opening up
access to the public to a wider number of artists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Napster claims it has lined up more than 17,000 new
artists who approve of sharing their music through the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The RIAA sees Napster as a threat, not because it's going to
reduce record sales, but because it's going to reduce the RIAA's
control over music sales,'' Boies said while discussing Napster's
legal strategy for fighting a preliminary injunction to stop the
file-swapping program.
</P>
<P>
   Napster filed its objection to the injunction, along with
results of a poll showing Napster has not harmed record industry
sales, yesterday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The association represents record industry giants such as A&AMP;M
Records, Sony Music, BMG Music and Warner Bros., which sued Napster
in December for copyright infringement. The suit claims the
file-swapping program is nothing but a vehicle for music piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the music labels asked U.S. District Court
Judge Marilyn Hall Patel to order Napster to prevent the more than
10 million Napster members from using the program to swap and trade
their copyrighted songs.
</P>
<P>
   The association bolstered its case with a flurry of declarations
from music industry executives and the results of a Field poll that
showed Napster has harmed CD sales.
</P>
<P>
   Napster returned fire, noting in its response that five other
independent polls showed the program increased CD sales, while a
sixth poll found no significant drop.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Napster hired Boies, who was the lead trial attorney
for the Justice Department's antitrust suit against Microsoft.
Boies said the cases were ``quite different,'' but there was a
similarity in ``the principle of how consumers benefit by having
access to new technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Cary Sherman, the recording association's executive vice
president and general counsel, scoffed at the suggestion his
organization was acting like Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is silly since the RIAA is not even a plaintiff in the
case,'' Sherman said in a written statement. ``Individual music
publishers and record companies are the plaintiffs, all of whom
have partnerships with multiple legitimate technology companies.
Furthermore, Napster has never even sought licenses for their
activities. They are engaged in wholesale piracy.'`
</P>
<P>
   Boies said the company's main legal defense remains basically
the same as it has been since December. The company maintains it is
sheltered by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which
shields Internet service providers from the illegal actions of its
members.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Napster members were swapping pirated songs, Napster
still would not be liable for copyright infringement because
Napster just ``provides a directory service that allows individuals
to engage in the sharing of music,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Patel rejected Napster's motion to throw out the case,
ruling it still did not prove it qualified as an Internet service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   Napster also contends laws like the Audio Home Recording Act of
1992, meant to discourage music piracy on Digital Audio Tape, leave
room for new technology used for both legal and illegal uses.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Napster members are using the service to sample songs
and later buy the music, Boies said. ``The mere fact that some
people might be able to use Napster for inappropriate purposes does
not mean the service ought not to be provided,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman attacked that defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napster cannot hide behind what consumers might be able to do,
individually and on their own, to build its own commercial
business,'' Sherman said. ``The courts have repeatedly rebuffed
attempts by businesses to hide behind the `fair use' privileges of
their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the injunction is scheduled for July 26.

NET WORTH: BIOTECH STOCKS MAKE FOR A THRILL RIDE _ IF YOU
CAN  STOMACH IT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Perhaps biotech companies should develop an
ulcer medication for their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the top 20 mutual funds for the second quarter
ended Friday were biotech or health care funds, according to
Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean their shareholders got a good night's
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: the Dresdner RCM Biotech fund.
</P>
<P>
   Run by Faraz Naqvi, a San Francisco doctor-turned-money manager,
the fund ranked No. 2 out of all domestic stock funds during the
quarter, with a 27.3 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   That looks mighty appealing, unless you were watching it day by
day.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of February, the fund was up more than 100 percent
for the year. Like everything biotech, it had been benefiting from
several months of excitement surrounding the impending completion
of the human genome project.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in mid-March, President Clinton and British Prime Minister
Tony Blair made a statement that was widely misunderstood to mean
that drug companies should not be able to patent genes, and biotech
stocks went into cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   From early March until mid-April, Naqvi's fund lost half its
value. It limped along until mid-May, when biotech stocks got
another jolt of hype from the human genome project.
</P>
<P>
   Year to date, the fund is up 73.7 percent, fifth best overall.
</P>
<P>
   Naqvi manages a second fund, Dresdner RCM Global Health Care,
which is ahead 24.6 percent for the quarter (No. 5 overall) and
53.4 percent for the year (No. 12). It is more diversified, and
hence less volatile than the biotech fund.
</P>
<P>
   Those weren't the only Bay Area medical funds topping the
charts. Franklin Global Health Care and Franklin Biotech, of San
Mateo, and Murphy New World Biotech, of Half Moon Bay, made it into
the top 15 for the quarter and the year, according to Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   Because the universe of biotech stocks is not large, biotech
funds end up owning a lot of the same companies, and hew fairly
closely to the American Stock Exchange Biotech Index (BTK). One
thing that sets them apart is how they move between biotech stocks
and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Naqvi says his fund excelled largely because ``we rode the last
biotech wave up a lot more than our competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most conservative, Murphy Biotech ``went to 40
percent cash in early March, then went to 60 percent pretty
quickly,'' says manager Lissa Morgenthaler. ``Several weeks ago I
was at 90 percent cash.''
</P>
<P>
   That helped her small fund's performance in the spring, but
proved to be a drag when biotech went bonkers again in late May and
June. Now she's back down to 20 percent cash.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Naqvi's biotech fund, by charter, must keep at
least 75 percent of its assets in biotech, and can't have more than
15 percent in cash. The rest can go into other stocks, generally
drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Although Naqvi got as defensive as he could in the spring, he
charged back into biotech before the ``second wave.''
</P>
<P>
   He also managed to own some real winners, such as Millennium
Pharmaceuticals (up 72 percent for the quarter), Human Genome
Sciences (up 60 percent) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (up 125
percent).
</P>
<P>
   He predicts that the second half of the year won't be as robust
for biotech as the first, ``but it wouldn't surprise me if we were
up another 30 percent between now and year end.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Fall is the season when biotech companies get to
show off their latest drugs at a slew of medical meetings. Also,
``You're going to see money flowing out of big-cap
pharmaceuticals,'' Naqvi predicts. ``They're facing a really
negative political environment. Typically, when institutions start
moving money out of drugs, they put some of it in biotech.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite stocks:
</P>
<P>
   -- Amgen (AMGN). The biotech giant has filed a
patent-infringement suit against a Boston company called TKT, ``and
that has held down the valuation a little,'' he says. The suit
revolves around Amgen's key drug, Epogen, which helps the body
create more red blood cells. ``We've done a lot of work with
lawyers and are pretty sure Amgen is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Millennium (MLNM). This was the best performing big-cap stock
in the country in the second quarter, but Naqvi says it could go
even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a genomics company that has already made the transition
to become a pharmaceuticals company,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium uses its vast understanding of human genes to develop
drugs on its own and in partnership with big drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   His least favorite stocks:
</P>
<P>
   -- Biogen (BGEN). Its core product, a multiple sclerosis
treatment called Avonex ``is a good drug but not a great drug.
Better drugs are being developed by others,'' Naqvi says. Despite
its ``robust valuation (nearly $10 billion) it has one of the worst
(drug) pipelines in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Chiron (CHIR). ``Again, their core portfolio of products is
not very good, and their development pipeline is not very
inspirational either. I don't own it based on fundamentals alone.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Gilead Sciences (GILD). This company targets viruses, ``a
notoriously hard thing to develop drugs for,'' Naqvi says. Its
leading drug, a flu pill called Tamaflu, ``did OK last year. The
problem is, it's totally dependent on the flu season, and the
manufacturers of flu vaccines are making such good progress'' that
flu treatments are becoming less important.
</P>
<P>
   ``A really good drug is not something you use for a few days
every few years. It's something you take for the rest of your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilead is also developing AIDS drugs, but that market, he says,
is ``very poor, fragmented and not growing,'' at least not in
countries and populations that can afford expensive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullish argument (on Gilead) is that they have a pretty
good royalty stream on Tamaflu, and a lot of their AIDS drugs will
make a big enough splash in the AIDS community to become an
earnings driver. And they're a big-enough company ($3 billion in
market cap) to acquire or end-license products from smaller
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Gilead itself could be acquired. ``The reason why Chiron and
Gilead have maintained their valuations is that people think they
really do have smart scientists and great scientific
infrastructure'' that could make them takeover targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to like Gilead,'' Naqvi says, ``but I never walked
away thinking they're a great company.''

PARK LEARNS TO KEEP IT SIMPLE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park used to pace around behind the mound, tormenting
himself about a pitch he threw two innings ago, or creating anxiety
thinking about a pitch he was going to throw two batters later.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, fastballs were thrown when a curveball was the right
pitch. Curveballs were thrown when the situation dictated a
changeup, and the more it was explained to Park, the more confused
he got.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson helplessly watched it unfold last
year, and was ready to do anything not to repeat it again. So a
month into the season Johnson made Park and veteran catcher Chad
Kreuter an inseparable pair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Park, whose popularity nosedived in Korea during a dreadful
1999, is again regarded as one of the game's top young pitchers.
And he's doing it thanks to a big KISS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep It Simple, Stupid,'' Park said. ``That's what they tell
me, so that's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's worked wonderfully. Park enters the final week before the
All-Star break leading the Dodgers with a 9-4 record. He has a 4.17
ERA and he's won five straight decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It comes from a trust built on five months of constant talking
and listening between Park and Kreuter. Park recently recalled a
moment from a game earlier this season in which he wanted to throw
a fastball and Kreuter was calling for a curve.
</P>
<P>
   It took a pair of trips to the mound, but Kreuter won out. Park
threw a curve, got an out in a key situation, and the two have been
on the same wavelength since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm more comfortable, and I'm thinking the right
thing, and that's important,'' Park said. ``I talk to (Kreuter) a
lot in the game, on the mound, in the dugout, before the game, even
on days I don't pitch. We talk a lot. We talk about what we will
do. That makes me more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has experience. He told me he learned from Nolan Ryan,
Charlie Hough, the veterans. He knows. He has so much experience. I
trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   How that translates into performance isn't lost on manager
Johnson. A year ago, Johnson quipped the other day, Park didn't set
up his fastball with anything, and he didn't use his fastball to
set anything up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see a guy that's not overthrowing, that's comfortable
and it looks like he's playing catch, that's pitching,'' Johnson
said. ``Normally, looking at a pitcher, (you want) good rhythm,
under control, not maxing out every pitch. Chan Ho gets into
trouble sometimes when he tries to overthrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter became Park's personal catcher after the right-hander
was pounded for eight runs in 3 innings May 8 at Arizona. In Park's
10 starts since, he's 6-1 with a 3.28 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are still times Park resists Kreuter's lead, pitching
coach Claude Osteen says, and a look at the walks says it all. Park
is tied for fourth in the National League in wins, but he leads the
major leagues with 66 walks.
</P>
<P>
   In his nine wins, Park has averaged 3.86 walks per nine innings.
In his four losses and four no-decisions, he's walked 7.61 per nine
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``By trusting Kreuter more, it made quite a few less that he had
to worry about,'' Osteen said. ``He got away from it a little in
his last game (Park walked six). It wasn't a bad game, but it had
some looks of the things he used to do. You saw some balls going
out of the strike zone and everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a 'pen the other day, and afterward he said
'Sometimes, I don't have confidence in a certain pitch.' I said,
`Well, you used to say that, but you have to trust Kreuter enough
so that choice of pitches is based on what you have thrown to the
hitter before. The sequence of the pitches.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A usual June swoon has been replaced by a month in which Park
has positioned himself to become one of the top No. 2 starters in
baseball. He was labeled as such by virtue of his 29 combined wins
in the 1997 and 1998 seasons, but a 13-11 mark and a 5.23 ERA last
season instead cast doubt on Park.
</P>
<P>
   A cerebral pitcher with a country worth of pressures on him,
Park, who turned 27 on Friday, began to crumble long before St.
Louis' Fernando Tatis hit a pair of grand slams off him in one
inning last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Park, who was 0-3 with an 8.18 ERA in June last season and
was 6-8 with a 5.29 ERA in his career in June, by far the worst
month of his career, went 4-0 with a 3.67 ERA last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always try to work with him, and the situation dictates how
I do that,'' Kreuter said. ``Sometimes, I have to talk him through
it and tell him his stuff is fine and that he can get a hitter out.
Other times, I'll get mad at him and tell him, 'Do you want this
win? If you do, it's time to get it. This is the time.' It's just
dealing with situations in different ways.''

LAZIO STARTS SECOND BUS TOUR, TAKING STANDS AND SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick A. Lazio began a five-day bus tour
across the state Monday, balancing an effort to direct his U.S.
Senate campaign toward issues against consistent attacks on his
Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he managed to do both.
</P>
<P>
   After beginning his tour with a visit to a Long Island health
clinic, where he called for more money for breast cancer research
and took credit as the ``point man in the House'' on cancer issues,
he labeled Clinton's effort to come up with a universal health care
plan a ``monstrosity.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, he overlooked apparent incongruities.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Yonkers before about 75 supporters, Lazio said
Clinton ``can't get out of the motorcade'' to empathize with
drivers frustrated with high gasoline prices. But he did so while
standing in front of his large, idling, customized campaign bus _
hardly a model of fuel economy _ which had just been escorted by
motorized police through city streets.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a Republican, is on his second bus tour since beginning
his campaign May 20. He is making the most of a congressional
recess after a few weeks of being largely pinned down in Washington
while Clinton went on the offensive with strident language on the
stump and a barrage of attack television advertisements. She, too,
plans a tour upstate this week, as both candidates court voters in
a region campaign officials see as crucial to victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's tour, orchestrated down to the clothing he will wear at
certain stops, will include campaign staples like parade
appearances, including three planned for Independence Day. But as
he rides a bus called ``Mainstream Express,'' he will also use
campaign stops to highlight legislation he has sponsored or
supported and make pointed contrasts to Clinton. Mixed in will be
traditional party rallies, like one here Monday night that drew
about 50 people to a park under a steady drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio used strong language Monday, but some of the strongest
words came from his surrogates, including Mayor John Spencer of
Yonkers, a Republican who at the rally in his city railed against
``elite Democratic liberals looking down the nose of the people of
Yonkers.''
</P>
<P>
   And as he boarded his bus, Lazio's campaign aides blasted a
snippet from a Ray Charles song, ``What'd I Say'': ``Tell your ma,
tell your pa, going to send you back to Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lazio said he was merely reciprocating the
negative campaigning that Clinton started, a claim the Clinton
campaign disputes. ``We were in the race for less than a month
before she personally went on the attack and began airing these
negative distortion ads,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   He told supporters at the Schenectady rally that ``character
does count,'' as well as integrity, without directly accusing
Clinton of lacking either.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's theme Monday was health care, and he toured a hospital
and a clinic to speak on women's health issues. He referred to
legislation he co-sponsored last year that provides Medicaid to
poor women needing treatment for breast and cervical cancer. He
counts the bill, which eventually passed, among his signature
achievements, although House Democrats often assert that the
Republican leadership stalled its passage.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also urged the passage of a bill he introduced last week
that would continue financing for breast cancer research through
the sale of postage stamps. ``We need to make sure we put the foot
on the research accelerator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign office issued a statement deriding Lazio's
record on health care and criticizing him for not supporting a
``patient's bill of rights'' backed by Democrats last fall that
would have allowed people more latitude to sue their health
maintenance organizations over mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carefully staged photo ops won't change the fact that Rick
Lazio has committed legislative malpractice,'' Howard Wolfson, a
spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said in the statement. ``He
voted against a real patient's bill of rights, against a
prescription drug plan that will cover all seniors, and voted to
cut Medicare by $270 billion. For New Yorkers looking for real
health care solutions, Rick Lazio's rhetoric is a bitter pill to
swallow.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Chechen suicide bombers have set off a series of
devastating blasts throughout the breakaway Russian republic,
killing at least 37 Russian soldiers and wounding 74, officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a carefully coordinated rebel attack late Sunday night, five
trucks laden with explosives blew up in towns and cities that were
ostensibly under Russian control.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings caught the Russian military unprepared and occurred
just a week after the military had declared that the war was all
but won.
</P>
<P>
   As the toll of dead and wounded continued to climb _ one
unofficial count put it at 44 soldiers killed and 120 wounded _
Moscow vowed to break the back of the rebel resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one thing that can be done _ to find and crush
them,'' said Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, the deputy chief of staff of
the Russian forces, who called off a trip to Britain because of the
attacks. ``Talks will not help. You can see what is happening
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels said they were planning still more bombings, and
Grozny, the Chechen capital, was rife with rumors that it was about
to be attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen fighters won de facto control of the region in a war
with Russia in 1994-96. Russian forces returned last year after
militants based in Chechnya attacked villages in the neighboring
region of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   The use of suicide bombings represents a new stage of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine months of fighting, Russian forces have swept
through the northern plains, seized Grozny, taken the major cities
and towns in the Chechen lowlands and pursued the Chechen rebels in
the southern mountains. What they have not been able to do is
pacify the restive population and weed out the rebels in their
midst.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to take on the heavily equipped Russian military on its
own terms, the Chechen militants are mounting a guerrilla war.
Rebels have infiltrated the major towns, drawing support from local
Chechens who are embittered by the indiscriminate Russian attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Gennadi Troshev, the commander of Russian forces in
Chechnya, insisted that he had recently instructed his troops to be
especially vigilant, particularly in inspecting trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But trucks full of explosives operated by suicide drivers still
managed to elude Russian checkpoints on Sunday and approach several
major towns, possibly leaving from a base near Serzhen-Yurt, a
settlement the Russians said they had seized last week in a fierce
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of Russian laxity was painfully evident on Monday
in the aftermath of the bombings Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Argun, a town east of Grozny that has been fought over
several times during the year, a truck filled with explosives
smashed into a dormitory housing militia from the region of
Chelyabinsk in Russia's Ural Mountains. The militia's tour of duty
had just ended and they were set to go home. At least 30 died in
the blast, which created a huge crater, 5 yards deep and 10 yards
wide.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials conceded the dormitory had been poorly
protected. ``The dormitory building was not well enough defended
from the outside,'' said Sergei Yastrzhembsky, a Russian government
spokesman. ``As far as I know, the entrance to the territory was
blocked only by a Kamaz truck. There were no concrete barricades.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Gudermes, which functions as the administrative capital of
the region, the Russian military was more successful. Two trucks
full of explosives were stopped at the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers were killed and a Russian as well as Chechen
soldiers died when the trucks exploded. One of the drivers was
believed to be trying to kill Akhmad Kadyrov, the Chechen official
picked by Russian President Vladimir Putin to govern Chechnya,
according to Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Another truck full of explosives, also believed headed for
Gudermes, was stopped near the settlement of Novogroznensky. It
rammed into an Interior Ministry unit, killing three and wounding
20.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another truck exploded near the office of the military
commandant in Urus-Martan. It blew up as it tried to ram the
building, killing two soldiers in a concrete shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians later announced that they had detained 18 people
suspected of involvement in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,100 Russian soldiers have been killed and 6,000
wounded since Oct. 1. The nation is weary of the war, but not to
the point where the Russian public is willing to cede control of
Chechnya to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   With each bombing or ambush, the Russians seem to have become
more bitter. And with each air strike or artillery barrage, the
Chechens seem to have become angrier at the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   On the Russian side, the Chelyabinsk region is an example. It
had promised to help restore the town of Argun, one of the targets
of the bombings on Sunday. But stung by the loss of fighters, the
Chelyabinsk governor said the region would no longer help, ensuring
the restoration of Chechnya would take longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they kill our guys I won't give them a ruble,''
said Gov. Pyotr Sumin. ``And nobody will make me do this.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Chechens, much of the enmity is directed not only at
Russians, but also at Chechens who are cooperating with the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Aslan Maskhadov, the separatist president of Chechnya before the
Russian intervention, essentially called for the death of Kadyrov,
the Russian-appointed leader of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In an address that is recorded on videocassette and available in
Chechnya, Maskhadov called Kadyrov ``the main enemy of the Chechen
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people will appreciate the services of the one who manages
to remove him more than all the heroic deeds performed by Chechen
fighters in all wars in the course of the last 400 years,''
Maskhadov said.

SPORTS COLUMN: PIAZZA ILLUMINATES AN OBSCURE RBI RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS with update in 9th graf, bgng: That's where...)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   At first glance, the streak seems to be one of those arcane
achievements that only a statistics freak could know or care about.
How significant could it be that Mike Piazza was approaching the
major league record for driving in runs in consecutive games when
the record-holder wasn't Hack Wilson or Lou Gehrig or Babe Ruth or
anyone else of that stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the importance of the streak record is judged by who
holds it rather than by what it represents,'' said Steve Hirdt, an
executive with Elias Sports Bureau, keeper of Major League Baseball
statistics and records. ``I think there would be general unanimity
in baseball that driving in runs is at least as important as
getting a hit. Yet there are 5-year-olds who would know chapter and
verse of Joe DiMaggio's hitting-streak record while people who make
their living playing or covering baseball try to belittle this
record simply because the guy who holds it is someone whom they
have never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Grimes was not Joe DiMaggio, or Lou Gehrig or Babe Ruth, for
that matter. In 1922, Grimes, a first baseman with the Chicago
Cubs, drove in runs in 17 consecutive games. Chances are no one
thought much about it at the time, but nobody had produced such a
streak before Grimes did it and no one has done it since.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes was an unexceptional player. He had a relatively short
career, playing 432 games in five seasons after getting into one
game in 1920. The season in which he established the record was a
career year for him because he drove in 99 of his career 263 runs
batted in. But Grimes' record stands 78 years later. DiMaggio's
56-game hitting streak is only 59 years old.
</P>
<P>
   When Wilson knocked in what remains a major league-record 191
runs in 1930, he didn't threaten Grimes' record. Elias research
found that the longest stretch in which he drove in at least one
run was 11 games. The next season Gehrig drove in what continues to
be the American League record, 184 runs. His best streak: 10 games.
In 1937, Hank Greenberg drove in 183 runs. He knocked in runs in 11
successive games at one stretch.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Sammy Sosa drove in 299 runs for the Cubs the
previous two seasons, and each season his longest consecutive-game
RBI streak was 5. Five games (twice) was the limit, too, for Manny
Ramirez last year when he knocked in 165 runs for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   While Ramirez was unable to go beyond five in a row, Mike
Sweeney of Kansas City made it to 13 games in succession a year ago
Tuesday, tying the American League record set by Taffy Wright of
the Chicago White Sox in 1941, the year of DiMaggio's hitting
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza reached 13 last Friday night when he beat Atlanta with a
dramatic three-run home run in the eighth inning. A two-run home
run in the third inning the next day extended the catcher's streak
to 14, and in what appeared at the time could be his last at-bat of
the day, he reached 15 Sunday by lashing a home run in the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the streak ended as the Marlins shut out the Mets,
2-0, Monday night in Florida. Piazza batted in the first and third
innings with runners at first and second but hit a fly ball to
right field each time. In the eighth, he came close to hitting a
home run, but the ball landed at the base of the left-field fence
for a double.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's hitting streak is often cited as the record least
likely to be broken. But why has it received so much attention over
the years while Grimes and his record have been completely ignored?
Is Steve Hirdt right, that the identify of the player determines
the perceived importance of the record?
</P>
<P>
   A reasonable argument can be made that maintaining an RBI streak
is harder than running off a hitting streak. A batter needs no help
in building a hitting streak. A single here, a double there, and a
streak continues. To build an RBI streak, a player needs help. His
teammates have to get on base so he can drive them in. He can do it
himself occasionally with a home run, but no one has ever hit home
runs in 17 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Piazza's RBIs in the 15 games were critical to the
outcome. He won the Friday night game against Atlanta, he gave the
Mets the lead in six other games and he knocked in the tying run in
three games. The home run Piazza hit Sunday was his eighth in his
RBI streak and raised his RBI total in that span to 28.
</P>
<P>
   The streak has catapulted him to the front of the race for the
National League Most Valuable Player award. Although one view might
have it that Piazza has been the league's MVP the first half of the
season, some more cautious people like editors might want to slip
in the hedge word ``perhaps,'' leaving open the possibility that
someone else has been the MVP. It says here without equivocation
that if there were a half-season award, Piazza could step right up
and collect it.

JONES DELIVERS, BUT WENDELL AND METS' HITTERS DON'T 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Mets got six shutout innings from one struggling
pitcher. Another struggling pitcher followed by striking out the
side.
</P>
<P>
   It was not Bobby J. Jones or Dennis Cook who allowed the only
runs Monday night in a 2-0 loss to the Florida Marlins. Turk
Wendell, who has been one of the more reliable pitchers on the
staff, surrendered a two-run homer to Derrek Lee with one out in
the bottom of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza extended his hitting streak to 21 games, but his
streak of 15 games in a row with a run batted in ended. He had a
double in four times up but fell two RBIs shy of a 78-year-old
record held by Ray Grimes of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell (4-4) had been scored on only once in his last seven
appearances. But while he has had a fine season, he has been prone
to allowing home runs. Lee's homer was the fourth game-winning home
run Wendell has allowed this year. San Francisco's Jeff Kent,
Colorado's Bubba Carpenter and Los Angeles' Kevin Elster beat him
with homers in May.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' offense was shut out by three Marlins pitchers,
including the former Mets farmhand Jesus Sanchez, who worked eight
scoreless innings. Armando Almanza was the winning pitcher in
relief, retiring Todd Pratt and Melvin Mora with runners in scoring
position in the top of the ninth. The Mets were 0 for 11 with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Jones started the season miserably, and his overall numbers are
still smarting because of it. His 8.10 earned run average entering
the game was the highest among the pitchers who started National
League games Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones has been a much different pitcher since accepting a
10-day assignment to Class AAA Norfolk in the middle of June. He
started twice there, adjusted his delivery and came back with a
sharper curveball and a fastball with better downward movement.
</P>
<P>
   In three starts since returning, Jones has worked 20 innings,
allowing 16 hits and five runs while striking out 16 and walking
three. Monday night's start was his first since April _ also at Pro
Player Stadium against the Marlins _ in which he did not allow a
run.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was magnificent, overcoming an aggressive Marlins running
game that put runners in scoring position in the first, fourth,
fifth and sixth innings. The Marlins stole four bases, two by
Preston Wilson. He singled with two out in the fourth, then stole
second with Mike Lowell batting. But Jones dropped to a sidearm
delivery with two strikes, and Lowell bounced a breaking ball to
first for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Lee doubled off the left-field wall to open the fifth, then
advanced to second when Alex Gonzalez bunted for a single. Jones
tried to field the ball but slipped, and Gonzalez stole second. It
was a dangerous spot _ even with the Marlins' Nos. 8, 9 and 1
hitters coming up _ and Jones survived, striking out Paul Bako,
Sanchez and Luis Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza came up with runners at first and second and one out in
the first inning and in the third. Both at-bats had the same
result: a popout to short right field that advanced no runners.
Both times, Sanchez retired the next hitter, Todd Zeile, to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Though Piazza's RBI streak ended Monday night, he has
established one record with his torrid run production. During the
Mets' weekend split in a four-game series with the Atlanta Braves,
he set a Mets' record for runs batted in before the All-Star break.
Piazza has 71 RBIs, two more than Dave Kingman had at the break in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was not the only Met to squander a chance to drive in
runs. Robin Ventura doubled to lead off the second inning, but
Benny Agbayani popped up, Joe McEwing grounded out and Jones struck
out.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, after Sanchez hit Jones to start the inning, Mora
and Derek Bell struck out and Edgardo Alfonzo flied to left.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez lasted through the eighth, when he survived another Mets
charge. Piazza lofted a two-out double to the left-field warning
track, and Zeile was intentionally walked. Then Sanchez got Ventura
to fly to center, ending the inning.

MAYOR TAKES ISSUE WITH ISSUE OF HIS HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has become an almost weekly routine. Reporters
press Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for details on his cancer treatment
deliberations. The mayor, sometimes in an irritated voice, other
times in a stern but calm way, then tells them, in essence, to bug
off.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the matter flared yet again, prompted by a report in The
Daily News on Saturday, citing unnamed sources. The newspaper said
that Giuliani, who announced in April that he had a treatable form
of prostate cancer, had started a preliminary hormone therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a media, press-created craze,'' Giuliani said, staring
down from a City Hall Park stage toward the familiar pack of
reporters gathered for his daily news conference. ``The invasion of
my privacy, the invasion of my doctor's office, the almost-crazed
atmosphere that's created is not conducive to good medical
treatment, either for me or for anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The lashing was so intense that while the mayor did not confirm
or deny the news, no one asked a follow-up question. Instead, the
mayor indicated that he would disclose his decision only when it
meant he had to disrupt his work. And there are few hints that that
has happened yet, with Giuliani scheduled to rush Tuesday from a
late-morning inspection of the New York Harbor parade of tall ships
for Operation Sail 2000 to a Fourth of July parade on Staten
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm ready and I believe it is in my best interest to
announce something, I will,'' the mayor said Monday, before moving
to other topics. ``So far, nothing that I'm doing or not doing has
any impact on my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's approach to the news media regarding his prostate
cancer has been relatively consistent from the start. He was
praised in April for his immediate and forthright disclosure of the
diagnosis. But when it came to discussing details of the disease,
he has declined all questions other than to acknowledge about the
time he dropped out of the Senate race in May that choosing from
among the treatment options had been extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In the early-stage cancer that mayor has said he has, the most
frequent alternatives are surgery or radiation treatment, said Dr.
William G. Nelson, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore and an oncologist who has not been involved
in the mayor's care. The report that the mayor is undergoing
hormonal therapy with a drug called Lupron does not necessarily
mean he has made up his mind, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   By reducing the testosterone levels, Lupron merely slows cancer
growth and sometimes shrinks the prostate cancer tumor in
anticipation of a more intense treatment, Nelson said. It is more
frequently a precursor to radiation treatment than it is to
surgery, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that the mayor's reticence has led to friction
between Giuliani and the news media, several medical ethicists said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The public's expectation that certain elected officials will
divulge private and even non-life-threatening health matters dates
at least to 1965, when President Johnson, following gallbladder
surgery, proudly showed off his scar.
</P>
<P>
   During President Reagan's tenure, a small spot of cancer on his
nose inspired regular news updates with headlines like
``President's Nose `Terrific''' and ``Reagan's Nose Unbandaged.''
In New York, a similar type of cancer, considered rarely
life-threatening, was found on Mayor Edward Koch's nose in 1988,
again drawing a flurry of news reports.
</P>
<P>
   But three experts who have studied issues related to politicians
and their health said Monday that as far as they could determine,
the mayor appeared to be justified in declining to answer questions
about his treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Given that there are no signs that his condition or any possible
treatment is affecting his performance as mayor, he is not
currently obliged to discuss the matter further, said Dr. James F.
Toole, a professor of neurology at the Wake Forest University
School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C, and co-chairman of a
group that recently released a report titled ``Disability and U.S.
Presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been times when politicians have not been forthcoming
about the seriousness of their conditions. Paul E. Tsongas of
Massachusetts, a presidential candidate in 1992 who concealed that
he had had a recurrent cancer, died in 1997, as his first term
would have been ending. But Toole said that even if the mayor's
case was somewhat more severe than he had indicated, it would not
be relevant because he remained on the job and was not seeking a
new term or any other elected office.
</P>
<P>
   George J. Annas, chairman of the health law department at the
Boston University School of Public Health, and Dr. Joseph J. Fins,
director of medical ethics at the New York Weill Cornell Center,
said Monday that the mayor should be allowed to decide on his
treatment privately.
</P>
<P>
   But Annas said that the mayor's reaction to the news media's
questioning seemed somewhat naive, given an era of intense
fascination with politicians like Giuliani and the public's
heightened interest in matters related to health.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is mostly what you can kindly refer to as gossip,
voyeurism,'' Annas said. ``The public wants to know as much as it
can about celebrities, and he is a celebrity politician.''

PLANE TOWING AD BANNER CRASHES AT NEW JERSEY AIRPORT, KILLING
PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE STRUNSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pilot of a three-passenger single engine plane towing an
advertising banner was killed Monday in a crash at a municipal
airport near the Jersey Shore.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Robert Lewis, 44, of Omaha, Neb., was pronounced dead
at Kimball Medical Center in Lakewood, N.J., shortly after his
plane crashed at 12:30 p.m. on the runway at Lakewood Airport, said
Chief Michael Lynch of the Lakewood police.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, Jim Peters, said
initial reports indicated that there might have been a passenger,
but Lynch said the pilot was the only one on board.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash is under investigation by the National
Transportation Safety Board, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Sakowitz, the first assistant Ocean County prosecutor, said
he had been told that the plane was taking off when it crashed. The
plane, an Aeronca Champion single-engine propeller craft that seats
three, was used to tow the kinds of advertising banners seen along
beaches in New Jersey and elsewhere, Lynch said. Officials said
they did not know what the banner said.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said the airport, which is owned by Lakewood Township,
serves general aviation aircraft and does not have a control tower
to guide takeoffs and landings, so there were no recordings of
last-minute radio calls from the plane. Without a tower, the pilot
would have been taking off or landing under his own direction,
using visual sighting and general radio broadcasts to inform any
other aircraft in the area of his intent, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   The airport is about six miles west of the shore, and a company
known as O'Brien Aviation runs a banner towing operation from
there. O'Brien's telephone number is the same as the main number
for the airport; no one answered the telephone Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was registered to Aimada Corp. of Wilmington, Del.,
said Peters, the FAA spokesman. Another spokesman for the agency,
Roland Herwig, said Aimada had no outstanding violations or any
record of crashes or other significant incidents. Herwig said he
could not immediately provide information about the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that Monday's accident was the first fatal plane
crash at the airport that he could remember in his 31 years with
the department.  &QL;

CATHOLICS IN ESSEX COUNTY GET NEW SPIRITUAL LEADER  
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has chosen a son of Newark, N.J., and a
longtime educator to be the spiritual leader of Roman Catholics in
Essex County, N.J., the Archdiocese of Newark announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Arthur J. Serratelli, the rector of St. Andrew College
Seminary at Seton Hall University, was named regional bishop for
Essex County, one of four counties, along with Hudson, Bergen and
Union, that make up the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Serratelli, 55, was appointed to fill a vacancy created last
summer, when Auxiliary Bishop Nicholas A. DiMarzio was made bishop
of Camden, one of the state's five dioceses, with Trenton,
Metuchen, Paterson and the Newark archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   In his regional role, Serratelli is essentially the spiritual
and administrative head of the county's Roman Catholic parishes and
church programs, said Jim Goodness, a spokesman for the
archdiocese. He is also one of five auxiliary bishops in the
archdiocese who assist Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick, New
Jersey's highest Catholic official.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the regional bishops, a fifth auxiliary, Bishop Paul
Bootkoski, serves as vicar general and moderator of the diocesan
curia, handling the day-to-day affairs of the archdiocese. While
the regional bishops assist McCarrick, who turns 70 on Friday _
five years short of the mandatory retirement age for bishops _ they
do not form a line of succession, and a new archbishop will be
appointed by the pope regardless of geography.
</P>
<P>
   The new bishop grew up in Newark and attended Seton Hall Prep in
nearby West Orange. He then studied philosophy at Seton Hall
University in South Orange, before attending the Immaculate
Conception Seminary in Darlington, N.J.

REBUILDING GRADES OUT AS ALL A'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ When the Oakland Athletics stumbled through a
97-loss season and finished 25 games out of first in 1997, manager
Art Howe knew there had to be better days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Jason Giambi was developing into a nice player,
and that Ben Grieve kid showed some flashes after he was promoted
in September.
</P>
<P>
   When the A's lost 88 games and again finished last in '98, Howe
knew the team was getting closer. Grieve was the American League
Rookie of the Year. Two more youngsters brought up during the
season, shortstop Miguel Tejada and Eric Chavez, looked like
keepers.
</P>
<P>
   When the A's traded for Kevin Appier, Omar Olivares, Randy
Velarde and Jason Isringhausen in late July last season, Howe knew
his young team was ready to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still learning. We're still very young,'' Howe said.
``But we feel we're competitive now.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's indeed have taken the step from talented young team to
contending team. They were 46-34 before the first of a three-game
series against the Rangers last night, 1 1/2 games behind the
first-place Seattle Mariners in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   They led the wild-card standings by fourgames over the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone from a team that was rebuilding with a bunch of
young guys, to those young guys getting older and adding some
veterans to mix in with them, and then becoming a good team,'' said
Grieve, the starting left fielder and a former Arlington Martin
High School standout.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation from potential to results came when the A's
made their trades last season.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi had become one of the best sluggers in the league.
Grieve, Chavez and Tejada were coming on after slow starts. The A's
were a much-improved team from the 97- and 88-loss outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they were hovering around the .500 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a three-day period, general manager acquired Olivares
and Velarde from the Anaheim Angels, Appier from the Kansas City
Royals and Isringhausen from the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were an OK team in the first half, making our mistakes, but
then Billy Beane made those trades,'' Giambi said. ``Ever since we
picked those guys up, we turned the corner and became a good ball
club.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's were 52-50 when they made the final trade last season.
Since then, they are 81-59.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year when we made our trades, that's when we bridged the
gap,'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   The A's finished with 87 victories last season, and stayed
within six or seven games of the first-place Rangers for most of
the second half. They finished eight games out, but surprised most
people by finishing second.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they no longer are a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a year older, more experienced,'' Velarde said.
``There's no substitute for experience. It breeds confidence. It
gave us hope last year. It opened some eyes as to what we were
capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Howe, Giambi suffered through the lean seasons. But with
the talent the team already had on hand, Giambi figured this day
might come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been talking about trying to get to this point for a long
time,'' Giambi said. ``Billy Beane said when we get to the point
where we feel like we have a good team, we're going to try and get
some players and make this team better. That's what you have to do,
especially with the way we built this team with youth. You get your
young players, and you let them take their lumps. But then you say
OK, this is our core group, and you start pulling pieces together.
I think we did it at the right time. We knew what we had with
Grieve, with Chavez, with Tejada. Then we brought in Randy Velarde.
We starting pulling the pieces together.''
</P>
<P>
   The new players might prove to be the final pieces of the
puzzle, but only because a solid core already was in place.
</P>
<P>
   Entering last night's play, Giambi was batting .342 with 22
homers and 76 runs batted in, second in the league. Grieve was
hitting .303 with 15 homers and 62 RBI. Tejada had 13 homers and 60
RBI. Chavez has recovered from a slump to bat .277 with 12 homers
and 41 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of a few seasons ago now is being realized. The A's
no longer just hope to win. They expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice run last year, but there was some unfinished
business,'' Velarde said. ``That's our goal this year, is to bring
home a pennant.'' nn

FOR SOME BEACHGOERS, AN INVITATION TO TEMPT FATE
</HEADLINE>
  By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 7 p.m. last Wednesday, an hour after the
lifeguards had left their perches along Rockaway Beach in Queens
and whistled everyone out of the water, the Atlantic Ocean, wild
and menacing as it can be, was still too tempting for some to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   It was about the same time of night June 25 that a Manhattan
woman and her 6-year-old daughter drowned, several miles west on
that same beach, in an area near Far Rockaway that is so rough with
riptides that the lifeguards call it the ``death trap.'' Five days
later, an 11-year-old Queens boy drowned after swimming in an area
of Jamaica Bay where bathing is not allowed and lifeguards are
never stationed.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen others in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut
have drowned since Memorial Day, most after venturing into the
ocean, lakes or ponds when lifeguards were off duty or after
swimming into areas that were off limits.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the drownings nor the posted bans on swimming
without a lifeguard stopped a handful of people from taking an
evening swim Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After the lifeguards disappeared from sight, a few swimmers made
their way to the water's edge, then splashed and bobbed in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, as the sun was setting and there was almost no
one left on the beach but a few scattered fishermen and a batch of
seagulls, a couple from Flushing waded into the ocean and swam out
about 30 feet from the shore, staying in the water for about 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman came out of the water, she said she found the
beach too crowded during peak hours and was desperate for a swim
that night. ``I don't know if it's safe or not,'' she said. ``But
I'm not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent drownings underscore a dark but seemingly inevitable
side to summer: Some people tempt fate in the water, whether
unwittingly taking risks or brazenly defying the rules, and lose
their lives every year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of deaths may ebb and flow, parks departments may
strengthen their patrols, hire more lifeguards _ although New York
City has struggled with a shortage _ or post more warning signs
around their beaches in response to a drowning. But as officials
face the grim possibility of more drownings, they say the ocean
cannot be locked up or the seduction of the water stamped out.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Beach in Nassau County, N.Y., where the three miles of
beach is easily accessible from a boardwalk, like Rockaway and
Coney Island, three people drowned last year while swimming after
the lifeguards were off duty, and three weeks ago, 15 minutes after
lifeguards left at 6 p.m., a 12-year-old boy from Brooklyn was lost
in the water and drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Nyman, city manager of Long Beach, said there are one or
two drownings on the beach every year, typically when the
lifeguards, who work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., are off duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the U.S. Army couldn't keep people off our
beaches at night,'' Nyman said. ``I wish there was a way we could
close our water.''
</P>
<P>
   While many people heed the warning signs, those who take the
risks think, ``It won't happen to me,'' said a Rockaway Beach
lifeguard, Omar Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, more drownings occur on ocean beaches, like Rockaway,
which stretches seven miles along the eastern edge of the city, and
Coney Island, which has many entrances along the street that make
the water easily accessible. But rivers, lakes and basins beckon
thrill seekers and people escaping the heat or the crowds of the
guarded beaches. In Connecticut, several drownings have occurred
this year in rivers and ponds.
</P>
<P>
   In the city last year, three people drowned off city beaches,
two when there were no lifeguards on duty. Both drowned in the
morning, before lifeguards went on duty at 10, one at Coney Island
and the other at Orchard Beach in the Bronx, said officials from
the City Parks and Recreation Department. The department is in
charge of safety on the city's 12 miles of public beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Orchard Beach was the scene of another fatal
accident when a teenager jumped off his boat for a swim, 200 feet
offshore, and drowned.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Rockaway drownings, the Parks Department has
extended beach patrols to 8:30 p.m. from 6 p.m. Rangers in
four-wheel drive vehicles roll across the sand at Brighton Beach,
Coney Island and Rockaway Beach to order defiant bathers to leave
the water. The patrols were not deployed to Orchard Beach, parks
officials said, because the Police Department covers that area.
</P>
<P>
   Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner, said that rule-breaking
in city pools and beaches ``is an issue we've been plagued with for
years,'' but that he is aware that the evening patrols, which were
begun this year, can do only so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do what you can to prevent tragedies,'' he said, ``But
unfortunately, people simply motivated by the desire to cool off
can jeopardize their lives. It's very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to see on Wednesday night that Rockaway, because of
its expanse and easy access, is a difficult beach to patrol. The
rangers rode up to a group of five girls celebrating graduation
three times before they finally left. When the couple from Flushing
was bobbing in the water, the rangers' vehicle was crawling along
the eastern end of the beach, miles away.
</P>
<P>
   At Brighton Beach on Saturday night, between 7 and 8, the beach
was still packed, and the water filled with dozens of swimmers.
They had been chased out by lifeguards or told to leave by the park
patrol, but they had simply waited until the lifeguards and rangers
were out of sight and had returned to the water.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Santana and her three children, who live in Manhattan,
ventured to the beach by subway to have dinner and take an evening
swim. It was about 7:30, and Santana kept an eye on her children,
especially her 9-year-old son, Edwin Espinosa. ``I like the waves
and I go far,'' Edwin said as he rushed back into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's dangerous,'' Santana said. ``But they like to
play. And I watch to make sure they don't go too far.''
</P>
<P>
   She turned to look at the water, spotted her son, and screamed,
``Edwin!''
</P>
<P>
   He turned to look at her and paddled back toward the shore.

COLUMN: A TEA PARTY LIKE BOSTON'S, OVER WINE?
</HEADLINE>
 By JOHN TIERNEY   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As we celebrate our independence from one form of
tyranny, many New Yorkers may be consorting with a new foreign
menace. They may be drinking out-of-state wine.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them won't even know the danger in their glasses. They
haven't heard of the arguments over New York's liquor laws that are
set to begin this month in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
Vintners in California and Virginia have joined with consumers in
New York in a suit seeking to overturn the law prohibiting
out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   This menace is tricky to understand. There are whole states,
even apparently functioning ones like Connecticut, that blithely
allow their citizens to order wine directly through catalogs and
the Internet. There are even some New York legislators who tried to
win this same right by passing a bill in 1995, but it was vetoed by
Governor Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was not swayed by arguments from consumers desiring
wines not available in stores. He was not moved by traditional
Republican arguments on the benefits of free trade. Pataki was not
even persuaded by the many small wineries in New York state that
favored opening the border. Although they could legally ship to
customers within New York, they were shut out of larger markets in
states allowing shipments only from states with reciprocal open
borders.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was concerned instead with the licensed cartel of
wholesale distributors and their unionized drivers with a monopoly
on out-of-state wines. ``A significant increase in mail-order
wines,'' Pataki warned, ``could, in turn, lead to a decrease in
sales for New York liquor stores and their distributors.''
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale distributors insist that they're not merely
concerned with profits. ``Direct shipping is a Pandora's Box to
under-age access,'' declares the Americans for Responsible Alcohol
Access, a national advocacy group financed largely by alcohol
wholesalers and retailers seeking to preserve the exclusive
distribution systems in New York and 29 other states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the group arranged a press conference on ``cyberbooze''
at which Dennis C. Vacco, then the New York state attorney general,
announced a sting operation in which teen-age children of his staff
members had successfully ordered wine from California over the
Internet. Vacco, however, was not able to point to any minors in
New York state who had ever ordered wine on the Internet without
the assistance of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you believe that teen-agers across New York are scheming
to order cases of merlot, it's not clear how much good is being
accomplished by the current prohibition against interstate
shipments. As long as it's legal to order from wineries in the
state, teen-agers could presumably get just as drunk on merlot from
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the law argue that New York is justified in
discriminating against out-of-state wineries because they're harder
to police. ``New York can take away the license of a winery in the
state that sells to minors,'' said C. Boyden Gray, a former White
House counsel, who represents wine wholesalers. ``It doesn't have
jurisdiction over one in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-state vintners say the best way to stop minors from
ordering wine is for New York to pass a law, as other states have,
requiring all shipments of alcohol to carry a warning label and all
shippers to obtain a signature from an adult before releasing the
package.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York's law protects wholesalers, not minors,'' said
Deborah Simpson, a senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, a
public-interest law firm in Washington that filed the suit seeking
to overturn New York's law as an unconstitutional infringement on
interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law preserves a monopoly that collects 18 to 25 cents of
every dollar spent on a bottle of wine,'' Simpson said. ``It's even
illegal to send an out-of-state price list into New York, which
means that an out-of-state winery is violating the law if it
maintains a Web site with its prices. This is allowing the
protectionist policies of the 18th century to rule 21st-century
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet wine merchants have managed to ship to New York by
making arrangements with licensed wholesalers, but the process can
be cumbersome, and it adds what is essentially a tax to the
transaction. Pataki may be worried about depriving the wholesalers
of their cut, but a surcharge on imported beverages can lead to
other sorts of local happiness, as another sovereign named George
discovered at the Boston Tea Party.

EDITORIAL: MEXICO'S DEMOCRATIC BREAKTHROUGH
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 4:
</P>
<P>
   Never before in the memory of living Mexicans has presidential
power passed peacefully to an opposition party. But just such a
transition is now under way, following the decisive victory of
Vicente Fox and his center-right National Action Party, or PAN, in
Sunday's Mexican elections. It is a great advance for democracy in
Latin America's second-largest country and Washington's
second-biggest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico began prying lose the authoritarian grip of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, more than a decade ago,
as its citizens came into contact with the democratic currents
sweeping Latin America and the world. Initial electoral challenges
were repulsed by intimidation and fraud, or bought off with
patronage. But opposition parties persisted, and during the
six-year term of President Ernesto Zedillo important reforms opened
up the electoral system. Statehouses fell to opposition governors.
Three years ago the combined opposition won a congressional
majority. That allowed scrutiny of the federal budget and cabinet
ministers. But Mexico's constitution concentrates power in the
presidency. Its passage into opposition hands is a transforming
event in the political life of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's transition toward a modern democracy also has
significance for the United States. No major policy differences
divide Fox's PAN from the long-ruling PRI. But the inauguration of
democratic competition at every level of Mexican politics can have
a salutary effect on a wide range of issues. It can provide a check
on official corruption in Mexico and mitigate the feelings of
political and economic powerlessness that have driven so many
Mexicans to emigrate illegally to the United States. Some officials
in Washington may miss the predictability of permanent rule by the
PRI. But wiser heads will see the positive potential in this week's
change.
</P>
<P>
   Besides winning the presidency, the PAN will also be the largest
party in the Congress. But to command a majority, it will have to
make deals with other political groups. This need for a broadly
based government should prove healthy, encouraging the PAN to reach
out to members of the center-left opposition as well as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic intellectuals formed the PAN more than 60 years ago to
fight the secularism and land reform programs of Mexico's
post-revolutionary governments. More recently, the PAN has evolved
into a moderate pro-business party, well represented by Fox, a
former chief executive of Coca-Cola in Mexico. In building his
victory margin, Fox attracted considerable support from
left-of-center voters, many of whom felt that ending the PRI's
enduring grip on the presidency was the most important issue in
this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, associated with so many electoral manipulations in the
past, behaved wisely and responsibly in defeat. Its candidate,
Francisco Labastida, conceded early and gracefully, getting the
lengthy five-month transition period off to a firm start. The PRI's
constructive new attitude owes much to Zedillo's enlightened
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo correctly understood that the only way to restore public
confidence in elections was to create an independent electoral
institute to supervise campaigning, balloting and the tallying of
votes. Without that crucial reform, this year's generally clean
campaign and Sunday's reliable count might not have been possible.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will not take office until Dec. 1. Past presidential
transitions have been marred by economic turmoil. In 1994, the
administration of Carlos Salinas failed to coordinate its financial
policies with Zedillo's incoming team, badly undermining
international confidence in the peso. The result was a painful
recession, which cost Mexicans dearly. Zedillo should draw the
appropriate lesson from that experience. Having given Mexico its
cleanest election ever, he can make a further contribution by
working closely with Fox and his advisers through the crucial
months ahead.  &QL;

56-YEAR-OLD TEXAN CYCLING AROUND STATE TO CELEBRATE BEATING CANCER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Every few minutes, Jarrett ``Buddy'' Boren drinks a
50-50 mixture of mouthwash and water to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   The back of his mouth and saliva glands were so badly burned
during radiation treatment for cancer six years ago that he must
use the concoction to keep his mouth moist enough to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Boren can no longer swallow dry foods like potato chips, and,
because his taste buds were scorched during the treatment, most of
what he ingests has no flavor at all to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss having a Coke and a Baby Ruth,'' said Boren, 56. ``But
there are a lot of people who have it worse than I do. At least I'm
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   And kicking.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today in Gainesville, Boren begins a 3,500-mile bicycle
trek around the state in celebration of his will to live and the
sixth anniversary of his victorious fight against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas native and resident hopes his ``Ride for Life'' tour
will raise money for the Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at
Children's Medical Center of Dallas. Most of all, he wants to
encourage those with cancer to keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scary thing when the doctor tells you you have a 20
percent chance of living,'' Boren said. ``But that doesn't mean you
are not going to make it. Your decision not to give up is very
important to your survival. If you give up, it'll get you.''
</P>
<P>
   Boren has always dreamed big and fought the odds. He founded the
Grand Prix of Dallas, a now-defunct Sports Car Club of America
Trans-Am street race that he struggled to keep alive from 1988 to
1996. He has since retired, but he's still making big plans.
\Nsubheds:AN INSPIRATIONAL RIDE From Gainesville, Boren will head
west at about 2:30 p.m. today, outlining the Texas border as
closely as he can. His route will take him through Wichita Falls,
Dalhart, El Paso, Laredo, Brownsville, Marshall and back to his
starting point.
</P>
<P>
   Boren will camp in desolate areas when there aren't any hotels.
He hopes to ride 50 to 70 miles a day and complete the trip in
about 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Boren's mother, 83-year-old Oney Boren, said she is a bit
nervous for her son, but happy for him as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that if anything happened to him, I would come get
him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature will top 100 degrees at times, but Boren said he
prefers sweltering in the sun to dealing with the heavy winds of
spring and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trip, Boren will pass out yellow flyers detailing
his experience with cancer. He also will try to give speeches and
tour hospitals along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Boren will be riding a 24-gear Trek bicycle and is taking four
saddlebags filled with essentials: camping stove, cellphone, tent,
spare tires, thermometer, first-aid and shaving kits, clothes, maps
and sunblock. All this and two bottles of mouthwash, with more in
the mail to motels he will stay in and friends along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Boren plans to check in with friends every evening to update
them on his condition and whereabouts, which they will post on a
Web site, www.therideforlife.com.
</P>
<P>
   The total bill for the trip is approximately $10,000. Boren's
picking up most of the tab with help from a few sponsors, including
Bicycles Plus of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's soft-spoken and very humble,'' Bicycles Plus owner Marsha
Gorczyca said of Boren. ``He's not going to let anything stop him
in life. I wanted to help him out because he's a courageous guy
with a lot of guts and a lot to say to those have been struggling
like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Boren knows the trip won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, cancer survivor Lance Armstrong rode 2,255 miles
to win the 1999 Tour de France. Armstrong is currently second at
this year's Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he went through is an inspiration, and his winning
attitude certainly lent itself to what I'm trying to do,'' Boren
said. ``I want to make people realize that they can win, whether
it's the Tour de France or going back to work.''  &LR; subheds:AN
INSPIRATIONAL FIGHT Boren's road to recovery has been a long one.
</P>
<P>
   He first noticed a problem when he felt a lump the size of an
egg in his right shoulder in March 1994. He thought it was a
swollen gland, but his doctor told him it was cancer. The disease,
called squamous cell carcinoma, had started in Boren's nose and
spread to his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   That May, Boren had 36 cancerous tumors in his shoulder removed
and, shortly thereafter, he began radiation treatment for his nose,
throat and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Boren lost 50 pounds in a six-month period after being put on a
liquid diet, reducing his already slender 5-foot-11 frame to a bony
shell of 118 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It slowly just takes you down,'' Boren said. ``A lot of times
people will confuse the cure with the disease. The radiation makes
you feel so bad that you think you are dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Boren continued running the Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible because he was trying to work out of his bed
and it kept getting worse,'' said Boren's longtime friend, Alan
Garonzik of Argyle.''He just tried to keep a sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Boren's mother and a few close friends took care of him during
his recovery. A father of two, Boren and his wife had divorced in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Since his recovery, Boren has counseled 12 of his friends and
acquaintances with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would call me up and say, `I have just been diagnosed
with cancer, what do I do?' '' Boren said.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Morrison of Arlington was one such friend. Boren knew
Morrison, co-founder of Reher-Morrison Racing Engine in Arlington,
from his days with the Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt particularly close since I could tell him from my
standpoint what he could and couldn't expect,'' Boren said. ``The
radiation deals with people differently. He didn't have any
problems eating, but a year after his radiation, it came back and
he died. I couldn't believe it, because he was doing so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Boren said Morrison's death in December, 1998, helped motivate
him to do something extraordinary for cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished I could talk to more people and tell them not to give
up because you just have to fight,'' Boren said.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, he hopes, will do that.
</P>
<P>
   Boren's not sure why he chose a bike, only that he thought it
would attract more attention than, say, a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to think of a way to get my point across,''
Boren said. ``I wasn't sure if 3,500 miles was even possible, or 10
miles.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Boren began training along city streets in Dallas for
the ride. It was the first time he had ridden a bike in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sore,'' Boren said of his first few days of training.
``Finally after riding a couple of hundred miles it was OK, so I
said I'm going to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   By June, Boren was occasionally riding 70 miles a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do it this year,'' Boren said. ``I'm not getting any
younger. I felt like it was now or never.'' nn

EDITORIAL: THE HIGHEST HONOR
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 4:
</P>
<P>
   In late June 1776, British ships from Halifax appeared off Sandy
Hook, N.J., just beyond the Narrows from the tip of Manhattan. The
ships' masts resembled ``a wood of pine trees trimmed,'' one
observer wrote. Soon British soldiers had landed on Staten Island
and their flotilla was anchored offshore. On July 9, a Tuesday,
Gen. George Washington mustered his troops in New York City for the
reading, ``with an audible voice,'' of the Declaration of
Independence, which had been signed five days earlier. The purpose
was to inform each soldier gathered there that ``he is now in the
service of a State, possessed of sufficient power to reward his
merit, and advance him to the highest Honors of a free Country.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a martial cast to that last phrase, naturally. The
highest honors, given the context, were military honors, the reward
of courage and sacrifice in defense of the world's newest state.
Yet in a sense the highest honor of a free country is really
freedom itself. It is hard to recapture the turmoil in the colonies
during the months leading up to the Declaration of Independence,
the sense of upheaval and exhaustion. What Washington's soldiers
heard that day _ the fresh sound of those now-familiar phrases _
was the news of their collective freedom. Perhaps they also hoped
for the return of mundane times in which to savor it.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been sharp in those soldiers' minds just what they
were suddenly independent from, for it was visible across the bay,
symbolized by that forest of British spars near Staten Island. It
was visible, too, in the streets of Manhattan, in an equestrian
statue of George III that was overturned on Bowling Green that
night. But for most Americans now, it takes a conscious act of
memory and imagination to sense our independence, to become aware
of our collective freedom. It has been a long time since there were
hostile warships in New York Harbor, a long time since the
independence of this nation was seriously at risk, the way it was
in its first days.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have often noted that the most ringing phrases in the
Declaration of Independence _ the assertion of self-evident truths
_ are really philosophical propositions rather than actual
descriptions of the human condition in late-18th-century America.
But over time the proposition that all men are created equal has
become, fitfully, a more and more accurate account of what life
really looks like in America. The meaning of that phrase has been
extended to include those whom it implicitly excluded,
linguistically and politically, when it was first written.
</P>
<P>
   The unintended irony of American history is that every group
that comes to the equality of collective freedom for the first
time, whether emancipated slaves or enfranchised women or newly
arrived immigrants, has reinstructed the rest of us in its value.
They remind us of the stirring that Washington's soldiers would
have felt as the declaration was read aloud to them in the streets
of Manhattan. They remind us also that the highest honor of this
free country is just what it has always been, a freedom to be
shared equally, without prejudice.
