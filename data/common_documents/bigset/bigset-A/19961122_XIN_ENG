<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Economy Functioning Well: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's economy is
functioning well and it is not only well poised to achieve the 5.5
percent growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) but also
exceed it, Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here this afternoon, the
minister said that both export earnings and import bills in the
first months of the current 1996-1997 fiscal beginning on July 1
grew 9.5 percent and 8.3 percent respectively over the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal.
</P>
<P>
Revenue collection in the first 4 months till October was TK
37.716 billion (879.2 million US dollars), which is 98 percent of
the target and 10 percent higher than that of the same period of
the previous fiscal, he said, noting that the revenue collection
suffered a bit in July and August because of the delay in budget
presentation.
</P>
<P>
Kibria said in the course of the next two years, "We are
hopeful of achieving a GDP growth rate of seven percent once the
current year's target was fulfilled. But such growth would depend
on some factors such as investment, both domestic and external,
and the carrying out of the reform program, he added.
</P>
<P>
If the present trend continued and external conditions remained
unaffected, it is quite likely that the target would be exceeded,
he asserted.

<HEADLINE> Panel Chief: Chemicals Might Be to Blame for Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The chairwoman of a U.S.
Federal panel investigating the illnesses of veterans of the 1991
Gulf War said that chemical weapons and other chemical agents
might be to blame for Gulf War illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times today quoted the panel chief, Eula Bingham,
as saying that it was too early to rule out Iraqi chemical or
biological weapons as the cause of many of the illnesses of the
veterans, given how little was known about the weapons' long-term
health effects.
</P>
<P>
The remarks by Dr. Bingham, chairwoman of the Persian Gulf
Expert Scientific Committee of the Department of Veterans Affairs,
reflect the sharp disagreements among scientists and physicians
over the cause of the ailments reported by thousands of Gulf War
veterans, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Government studies published last week said that Gulf War
veterans were not dying or falling serious ill at unusual rates,
while a White House panel suggested last month that battlefield
stress was probably the cause of many of veterans' ailments.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of the veterans reported that they have health
problems after returning to home, including gastrointestinal
ailments, chronic fatigue and joint aches.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bingham, a toxicologist, said that her panel found that
Gulf War veterans were falling ill with those sorts of ailments at
unusually high rates. This might be explained by exposure to low
levels of chemical weapons and other chemical agents.
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty clear that the veterans who were in the Gulf
have a whole series of symptoms that other veterans don't," said
Dr. Bingham.
</P>
<P>
Veterans leaders have also rejected the idea that stress is
responsible for the health problems.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said recently that thousands of American troops
might have been exposed to nerve gas and other chemical weapons as
the U.S. troops exploded some Iraqi weapons dumps in March 1991.
The dumps stored chemical weapons, but the Americans did not
know that.
</P>
<P>
Bingham's panel members said the recent revelations raised
the possibility that those agents might be responsible for some
of the health problems.

LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to send a
photo-reconnaissance plane to eastern Zaire later today to assess
the refugee crisis there, according to Britain's Ministry of
Defense (MoD).
</P>
<P>
A MoD spokesman announced here today that a 50-man team and
three Hercules transport planes would accompany the Canberra
reconnaissance plane, which is expected to take off from a British
air base at Akrotiri in Cyprus later today.
</P>
<P>
"A Canberra PR9 should fly to Africa today and begin its
operations on Friday. We are just waiting on a decision on where
the plane will land," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The Canberra PR9 uses high-quality optical cameras so you need
a support party on the ground to process the film," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Hercules transport planes are equipped with mobile
photographic cabins enabling the crew to process and enhance
photographs in the field.
</P>
<P>
The British government decided to send a reconnaissance team to
eastern Zaire after several countries were reconsidering the need
for multinational military intervention in Zaire as half a million
Rwandan refugees have returned home.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Zambia's New Govt Faces Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has been re-elected in the general elections held on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The major challenge facing Chiluba and his new government is to
resuscitate the country's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Zambia was in deep economic crisis with
consumer prices soaring and inflation shooting up. Zambians were
angered and wanted a change.
</P>
<P>
Under that circumstances Chiluba defeated former President
Kenneth Kaunda in the first multi-party elections held in 1991.
</P>
<P>
After taking power, Chiluba pursued a very different economic
policy from that of Kaunda. His government adopted the policy of
market economy, embarked on privatization of the parastatal
enterprises, created conducive investment environment, repealed
foreign exchange restrictions, price control, allowed free
movement of capital, profits and goods.
</P>
<P>
Some achievements have been made as a result of the reforms.
Inflation rate has dropped to about 50 percent from nearly 300
percent five years ago. Non-traditional exports were increased to
216 million U.S. Dollars in 1995, up from 124 million U.S.
Dollars in 1993. The non-traditional export value is expected to
reach 250 million U.S. Dollars this year. Today, consumer goods
is abundant and shop-goers have no longer to be in long queues.
Large quantity of foreign investments have flown into Zambia.
</P>
<P>
However, fundamental changes have not yet been realised in the
economic structure. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been
falling in successive years and the country is still burdened
with nearly seven billion U.S. Dollars of foreign debt, with each
Zambian indebted with 800 Dollars. Privatization has led to
higher unemployment. And the removal of the government subsidies
have caused widespread poverty and rising crime rate. Statistics
shows that per capita income has decreased to 250 U.S. Dollars,
down from 400 U.S. Dollars a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
Copper production is the mainstay of the Zambian economy,
earning 80 percent of the country's foreign exchange. However,
due to falling prices in the international market, outdated
technology and equipment, lack of investments and mismanagement,
the annual copper output was reduced to about 300,000 tons from
the peak of 700,000 tons in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba's government will continue its liberalisation and
privatisation programs and try to complete the privatization
process in 1998, with privatization of the Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM) in particular, to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of ZCCM privatisation program will be
completed by the end of next year by transferring 80 percent of
of the stocks into private hands. And the government will dispose
its own shares at the second stage which is to be completed in
the first half of 1998. The sale of ZCCM has already attracted
the interest of major mining companies worldwide with about 40 of
them bidding for some mines.
</P>
<P>
Considering all these efforts, Zambia's economy is expected to
improve gradually in the near future.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Ebola Patient Gets Rid of Deadly Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's first Ebola
patient's problem is no longer the deadly virus, but the damage it
had done to her body's functions, Gauteng Provincial Director for
Aids and Communicable Diseases, Liz Floyd, said today.
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Lahana, a 46-year-old nurse working for a private
clinic in Johannesburg, contracted the deadly virus while nursing
an infected doctor from Gabon late last month.
</P>
<P>
She fell ill with early symptoms and was admitted to hospital
on November 6, and was diagnosed last weekend as having been
infected with Ebola.
</P>
<P>
Lahana is being treated in isolation in the Intensive Care
Unit at the Johannesburg Hospital, but she is still in a critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
Floyd said the human body usually produced enough antibodies
to annihilate the virus in 21 days. And Lahana's body was
creating antibodies which are fighting the virus.
</P>
<P>
However, Floyd could not give a prognosis for Lahana because
while the virus is under attack, she is struggling for her life.
</P>
<P>
Lahana is still on a dialysis machine, a ventilator and other
life-maintaining equipment. But the progress of his recovery
can not be measured daily.
</P>
<P>
A total of 37 people are under daily observation and more
than 200 have been placed under routine monitoring to prevent an
possible Ebola outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The two people, kept under close observation at Rietfontein
Hospital in Johannesburg on Wednesday after showing possible
symptoms of Ebola, were discharged on Thursday after positive
confirmation that they were not infected with the virus.

<HEADLINE> Mazu Islanders Rely On Floating Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A floating market is bringing
the necessities of daily life to thousands of families on the Mazu
Islands, which are just off the coast of east China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
Most days, when sea conditions permit, a flotilla of up to 30
boats heads to Mazu from Huangqi Town in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Anchored off the coast, the vessels provide a floating market
place with pork, fresh vegetables, cooking oil and other daily
necessities.
</P>
<P>
The unofficial trade is so vital for Mazu Islands, which is
still under the control of Taiwan authorities, that local
residents, both civil and military, purchase 85 percent of their
daily needs from the Chinese mainland merchant boats.
</P>
<P>
On their return journey to Fujian, the traders often return
with light industrial goods, chemicals and garment supplies bought
from businesspeople of Mazu islands.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, some 300 residents at Huangqi town
are involved in the trade, and their sales income stand at some 60
million Renminbi yuan every year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, a number of Taiwan-funded businesses have been
opened in Huangqi town and other cities in Fujian province, thanks
partly to efforts by local traders from Huangqi.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental trade between Taiwan, including its adjacent
islands, and the Chinese mainland is growing, despite the fact
that Taiwan authorities still refuse direct official contact with
the Mainland.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Demands Reconsideration of UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi said today that Ethiopia could withdraw from
sending troops if the United Nations Security Council failed to
revise its resolution that neglected the need to separate Rwandan
militants from bona fide refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman from the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry,
the remark was made by Meles when he was meeting the visiting
Secretary of State in the Canadian Ministry of External
Relations, Chrisiane Stewart.
</P>
<P>
Meles said the U.N. Security Council should revise its
decision that confines the mission of the intended multi-national
intervention force to only humanitarian mandate.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. should endorse the resolution of the Nairobi
summit and the declaration of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU).
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that unless the intended multi-national force
is entitled to separate militants from genuine refugees, the
deployment of troops would not bring about positive changes in
the Great Lakes Region.
</P>
<P>
Meles also stressed the need to give due attention to the
resettlement and rehabilitation of Rwandan refugees returning
home from the troubled eastern Zaire.

LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Department of
Agriculture has confirmed four new cases of BSE or mad cow disease
were discovered in Ireland, bringing the total BSE cases to 54 so
far this year, according to a report carried in today's Irish
Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The new cases have been found in herds in Cos Galway, Meath,
Tiperary and Co Cork, which has the highest infection rate in the
country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
All the animals involved in this latest round of BSE cases
would be destroyed and investigations have already started into
what other herds the animals may have come from and what they have
been fed.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that the rising number of BSE cases in the
Irish national herd may be related to continuing use of
contaminated animal feed made from meat and bonemeal.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government have imposed some strict regulations in an
attempt to prevent any more cases of the disease in the national
herd of seven million animals.

LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The fire-damaged Channel tunnel
reopened for limited business today and operators Eurotunnel said
they hoped to start gradually reintroducing a full service over
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Two freight trains used the undersea link to travel from
Britain to Europe earlier this morning before a single freight
train traveled in the opposite direction.
</P>

However, Eurostar passenger services and car shuttle services

The 51-km tunnel had been closed since a fire on a truck
transporter train badly damaged a section of track and cables on

optimistic that Eurostar passenger trains, Le Shutttle car
transporters and Le Shuttle freight services could start soon.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Welcomes Chinese Involvement in Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government
reiterated today that it welcomes the involvement of Chinese
companies in its national housing program despite complaints from
some Nigerian engineers.
</P>
<P>
"China has to supply housing to the world's biggest population
and has some experience for Nigeria to learn in this regard,"
Minister of Works and Housing Major General Abdulkarim Adisa said
in a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
As China is building residential houses in a cost-effective
way, "the involvement of the Chinese company is expected to
reduce the cost of housing construction in Nigeria," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Under Nigeria's national housing program, which was introduced
in 1994, a total of 121,000 housing units will be built
throughout the country, particularly for low-income public
servants. Up to date, the Federal Housing Authority, which is in
charge of the program, has built only 3,270 houses.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the ministry signed a memorandum of understanding
with the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation,
inviting Chinese partners to involve in the program.
</P>
<P>
According to the reliable sources, the Chinese company will
help build about 20,000 of the housing units in the West African
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the invitation of the Chinese company has brought the
ministry under the fire of Nigerian engineers.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the signing of the memorandum, the Nigeria
Society of Engineers presented a letter to the Head of State,
General Sani Abacha, complaining the invitation of the Chinese
company is breaking the government promise to patronize Nigerian
engineers and contractors with projects.
</P>
<P>
But Nigerian engineers "are saying on their own," said the
minister, adding that instead of complaining, "they should come up
to do something."

<HEADLINE> US Government Looses Restrictions on Banks' Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. government is loosing
restrictions on the services of the nations' commercial banks but
the move is strongly opposed by some congressional members and
other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued on
Wednesday a package of rules that would allow national banks to
apply for expand powers to underwrite and sell securities and
insurance, according to reports of major U.S. newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The banks will be also allowed to sell other market products
not yet tested by the banks including data processing and
real-estate sales.
</P>
<P>
The rule, which was first proposed two years ago, will take
effect on January 1 of 1997.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Eugene A. Ludwig portrayed the
move as one that would ease the sort of diversification needed to
preserve the soundness of the banking system at a time U.S. banks
find their deposit gathering and lending businesses eroding.
</P>
<P>
It will be a major deregulation on the commercial banks'
services since the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law aiming
at restricting banks' securities activities, was adopted in 1930s.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congress has made numerous attempts in recent years to
reform the Glass-Steagall Act but such efforts have stalled so
far.
</P>
<P>
The package is supported by U.S. commercial banks but strongly
opposed by other financial institutions especially the groups of
insurance-industry.
</P>
<P>
The move also faces bipartisan opposition in the U.S. Congress.
Alfonse M. D'Amato, Chairman of Senate Banking Committee said that
he was "deeply troubled and concerned" over the action and the
Congress must not forget the lessons of the saving and loan crisis
occurred before.

<HEADLINE> 3 Palestinian Children Killed by Left-Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Three Palestinian children
were killed and two others wounded today by an Israeli army
left-over grenade in the West Bank, according to an Israel
Television report.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred when the Palestinian children
accidentally detonated the grenade, they came upon, while
playing in the field just outside the West Bank town of Jenin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, also in the West Bank, a Palestinian man was shot
and wounded at a checkpoint in the Ramallah bypass road by an
Israeli soldier.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the soldier opened fired and shot in the leg of
the man, when he tried to fled the roadblock, after ignoring
order by the soldier to stop and be checked.
</P>
<P>
The man was transferred to the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem,
where doctors said that he was in a "stable condition" after
receiving emergent medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Identifications of the Palestinian man and children are so far
unclear, while Israel Television said that the Israeli army is
conducting investigations on these two cases.

<HEADLINE> UK Abortion Rate Rises on Contraception Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Abortions carried out in
England and Wales rose by 6.7 percent to 42,990 in the first
quarter of the year, taking the rate to 3.3 per thousand women,
the highest for five years, according to official figures released
today.
</P>
<P>
The rise coincides with a scare about some types of
contraceptive pill last October when the government's Committee on
the Safety of Medicines warned that new research showed some
low-dose contraceptives could increase the risk of potentially
fatal thrombosis.
</P>
<P>
Many women stopped taking the contraceptive pill since then,
but experts said that the risk was very low and lower than the
risk of blood clots with pregnancy, and women risked their health
more by going off the pills than they would have by taking them.
</P>
<P>
Although the abortion rate was the highest since the first
quarter of 1991, experts said that it was too soon to say whether
it was a trend or a blip.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Continue Support for Angolan Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUNDA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
in a message to the Angolan people yesterday, has pledged to
continue the U.S. government's support for the peace process in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The massage, sent on the occasion of the second anniversary of
the signing of Lusaka peace agreement, said that the Lusaka peace
agreement, signed by the Angolan government and the UNITA in
November 1994, has brought about peace to the Angolan people and
that the U.S. government will always be on the side of the
Angolan people in their struggle for peace.
</P>
<P>
But the message noted that the arrival of lasting peace in
Angola depends on the Angolan people themselves.
</P>
<P>
The massage called for early realization of peace in Angola to
create conditons for foreign aid for the national reconstruction
of Angola.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that on the second anniversary of the peace
agreement,
</P>
<P>
U.N.Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali also sent a letter
to Angola, calling on the Angolan government and the UNITA to
complete the peace process on schedule.

<HEADLINE> US Senator Proposes Clinton Hosting Israel-Syria Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator Arlen Specter
proposed today U.S. President Bill Clinton hosting a summit
between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad next week.
</P>
<P>
Specter, who is currently mediating the Israeli-Syrian
relations, made the announcement after he held talks this morning
with Netanyahu, whom he briefed about the results of his
Wednesday visit to Damascus.
</P>
<P>
He said he would made the proposal to President Clinton after
he returns to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"My sense of the situation is that the next step is up to the
United States, and that President Clinton should invite both
Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Assad to the Oval Office
to continue the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Netanyahu, Specter quoted Syrian
President Assad as saying that there was no escalation of
hostility on the Israeli-Syrian border. Assad also reassured
Israel that the recent Syrian military exercises were only
routine.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reiterated that Israel was not interested in
confrontation with Syria and he hoped the two sides would resume
peace talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Specter, who visited Syrian capital Damascus late Wednesday
after meeting with Netanyahu, held talks with President Assad
and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara to discuss the
Israeli-Syrian tension.
</P>
<P>
Specter relayed to Assad a calming message from Netanyahu,
who called for the resumption of peace talks. Netanyahu's
message was apparently aimed at allaying Syria's concerns caused
by the strong warnings issued by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai warned that if Syria used non-conventional weapons
against Israel, then plans for a devastating attack on Syria
which could topple the Assad regime would be implemented.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Mordechai also accused
Syria of developing a particularly lethal type of nerve gas with
Russia's help, and vowed to retaliate severely if such a weapon
was turned on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Specter tried several weeks ago to mediate between Israel and
Syria after a military tension appeared along the border
following Syria's deployment of troops near the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast
War. He also conveyed a similar message to Assad from Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials acknowledged that political differences
between Israel and Syria made it impossible now to hold a
meeting between the envoys of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. officials do not think that the Israeli-Syrian
talks, suspended since last March, could be resumed until
January 1997 at earliest.

<HEADLINE> Canada Supports EU Complaint against U.S. Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada will support the
European Union (EU) in its World Trade Organization panel
complaint against the U.S. Helms-Burton Act, the government said
today.
</P>
<P>
At EU's request, the WTO agreed on Wednesday to hold a panel
hearing on the U.S. act.
</P>
<P>
"Through Helms-Burton, the United States is taking unilateral
action against companies that are doing lawful business with
Cuba," said Art Eggleton, Minister for International Trade of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Opposing the act in concert with the EU and other major trade
partners sends a strong message that the international community
does not accept Helms-Burton," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO, Canada, as a third party in the EU case, will
have the right to make written and oral submissions to the WTO
panel. The panel must reflect these submissions in its report.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to straggle Cuba, the United States passed the
so-called "Helms-Burton Act" last spring.
</P>
<P>
The act allows U.S. citizens to sue in U.S. courts foreign
companies deemed to be "trafficking" in property expropriated from
them by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
Since its very birth, the act has been denounced by the
international community, especially Canada and the EU. In July,
U.S. President Bill Clinton was forced to suspend this right to
sue for six months.
</P>
<P>
However, the threat of suing still hangs over the "trafficking"
companies. In addition, executives of these companies, along with
their spouses and children, are being denied entry to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
To counteract the U.S. act, Canada decided last June to amend
its Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act (FEMA), which allows
Canadians facing claims from Americans under the Helms-Burton to
seek recourse in Canadian courts.
</P>
<P>
FEMA also makes clear that no Helms-Burton judgement will be
recognized or enforced in any manner in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian parliament has passed the amendments, which will
soon enter into force.
</P>
<P>
For the past several months, Canada has held consultations with
the U.S. under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
It has also pursued the issue in international bodies such as
the United Nations, the Organization of American States and the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.

LUANDA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Airline and airport managers
of the 12-member South African Development Community (SADC)
opened a two-day meeting here today to discuss ways to liberalise
their aviation sector and to establish a regional management.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting of the two-day SADC Civil Aviation
Conference, delegates also called for stepping up regional
cooperation in the sector so that SADC can be in a better
position to compete with European and American airlines.
</P>
<P>
They noted that SADC member states are facing mounting
challenges and competitions from the western aviation companies
which are stepping up their business expansion in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Angolan Vice-Minister of Communication Licinio
Tavare said that Luanda is eager to expand cooperative ties with
other SADC members in the aviation sector, noting that his
ministry had signed bilateral aviation agreements with Namibia,
Zimbabwe and South Africa.
</P>

The conference is scheduled to end on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: No Progress in Israeli-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat today accused Israel of stalling the talks on Hebron
Israeli troop redeployment, while a Palestinian minister warned
of renewed violence against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Gaza, Arafat denounced
Israel for delaying the implementation of signed agreements,
especially on its troop redeployment from the West Bank city of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"Regretful there is a deliberate filibuster from the Israeli
part in current negotiations for the accurate and sincere
implementation of what have been agreed upon," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the negotiations were still stumbling because,
in every new session of negotiation, the Israeli side always
came out with new demands and conditions.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed
talks on the long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment from
Hebron. Israel Radio quoted Israeli officials as saying that
Israel was not proposing a summit between its Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The officials said such a summit could only take place when
the gap between the two sides were narrowed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu met with Foreign Minister David Levy to discuss the
latest developments concerning the Hebron talks, including the
possibility of holding a Netanyahu-Arafat summit.
</P>
<P>
Etan Ben-Tsur, director-general of the Foreign Ministry, today
 held talks with Palestinian negotiator Hasan Asfour to explore
ways of enhancing mutual cooperation to break the deadlock in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held in the West Bank city of Ramallah,
Palestinian Authority Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo
strongly attacked Israel for not seeking for a compromise either
on Hebron talks or other issues.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Palestinian side was ready for a
confrontation with Israel if the situation continued.
</P>
<P>
After showing a video clip in which two Israeli boder
policemen physically abusing several Palestinian workers caught
for illegal entry, Rabbo said the PA will demand the creation of
a joint Israeli-Palestinian Conscious Court for trying all
criminals.
</P>
<P>
The two Israeli policemen were remanded today in custody for
six days by the Magistrate Court in Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The winner of
Swaziland's "Woman of Africa 1995", Miss Ntombi Mngomezulu, was
arrested today for alleged possession of one kg of cocaine,
Swaziland police said today.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian man and a Swazi taxi driver were arrested after
Mngomezulu collected a drug parcel from a post office in Manzini,
the second large city of Swaziland, reported the South African
Press Association.
</P>
<P>
She was the second Swazi woman arrested for drug-related
crimes in the past week. Earlier on Monday, the 23-year-old
daughter of a Swaziland regional police commander, Zandi Malinga,
was arrested for alleged possession of 1.5 kg of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Mngomezulu has therefore lost her qualification to compete
in this year's "Woman of Africa" contest.
</P>
<P>
And first offenders of drug abuse could be sentenced to 15
years' imprisonment or a 4000 U.S. Dollar fine.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Toyota Motor Corporate
Services of North America announced today that its North American
vehicle production in 1996 has exceeded 650,000 vehicles, up more
than 6 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
As of the first of November, Toyota produced 659,324 vehicles
in North America. Thus far in 1996, more than six out of every
ten Toyotas sold in America were built in America.
</P>
<P>
U.S. parts manufacturers continue to benefit from Toyota's
increased local production. Toyota has purchased a record 6.47
billion U.S. dollars in auto parts from 496 U.S. suppliers this
past fiscal year, exceeding the projected amount one year earlier
than expected. Of the total, 1.47 billion U.S. dollars was
exported for production of Toyota vehicles in Japan, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
Toyota announced its global business plan in June 1995. The
plan includes a target North American production capacity of 1.1
million vehicles annually by 1998.
</P>
<P>
Toyota is currently the fourth largest manufacturer of vehicles
in America with investment in U.S. manufacturing, sales, research
and development and parts distribution exceeding 5.8 billion U.S.
dollars to date.
</P>
<P>
Toyota's direct U.S. employment exceeds 19,000 and will grow as
its new plants in Gibson County, Indiana and Putnam County, West
Virginia begin hiring in 1997.

PARIS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- France today deployed 1,500
troops in the capital of the Central African Republic, Bangui, "to

A company of French troops has been dispatched from Chad to the

which has been troubled by a small-scale mutiny for one week.
</P>
<P>
About 50 mutinous soldiers in the military barracks of Kassai
in northwest of Bangui and about 300 others in a northwest
district near the River Oubangui of the capital are confronting
government troops and have taken some paramilitary policemen
hostage.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny began last Friday when a policeman was killed in a
shoot-out between police and a former army officer who escaped
from prison during an earlier mutiny in May.
</P>
<P>
Bangui was reportedly calm today and no looting or attacks
against civilians and foreigners took place.

<HEADLINE> TV Plays A Major Role in Promoting UN, UN Chief </HEADLINE>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Television has played a
major role in opening the United Nations to the world, in
enhancing its transparency, in carrying its message to all
peoples, U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the U.N. World Television Forum,
Boutros-Ghali said that television can serve as a privileged link
between the United Nations and the people's of world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the images carried by television affects the work
of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the impact of television images,
especially current affairs and news programs have a considerable
bearing on public opinion. And today, the weight of public opinion
is a recognized influence in policy-making," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of access to information, he said that the
revolution in telecommunications is a global phenomenon. Instant
access to a range of information has created a potential for
learning undreamt of a generation ago. Enormous new opportunities
now exist for governments, businesses, interest groups and
individual citizens. Valuable new tools are now available for
challenging ignorance and prejudice, and for enhancing
international understanding, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, it is essential that information not flow in one
direction only. Especially through satellite technology,
television programs are seen in the homes of developing countries,
carrying images of a lifestyle that few, even in the wealthier
countries can hope to attain.
</P>
<P>
"Only with a true globalization of information can there be the
beginnings of a cross-fertilization of sensitivities and
understanding of the other," he said.
</P>
<P>
Razail Ismail, president of the current U.N. General Assembly,
said that in the age of information, the exchange of views should
be based on a firm understanding of universal values predicated on
pluralism. Not only are these values inviolable, but they apply
equally to the private and commercial sectors, as they do to
nations, governments and individuals.
</P>
<P>
The two-day U.N. World Television Forum has been jointly
organized by the U.N. Department of Public Information, Italian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Radiotelevisione Italiana.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi today stressed the "holy right" of resistance against
Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi made the call in a message addressed to the Lebanese
people marking the country's Independence Day. The message was
aired through radio and television at 7:30 p.m. (17:30 GMT), on
the eve of Lebanon's 53th anniversary of independence.
</P>
<P>
"To liberate our occupied land in south Lebanon and Western
Beqaa is our holy right," the Lebanese head of state
underlined.
</P>
<P>
He repeated Lebanon's firm stand on coordination with Syria in
the two countries' peace negotiations with Israel, which have
been deadlocked since earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"An interlock of the Lebanese and Syrian tracks in the
peace process is the guarantee for a victory of our right
to retrieve our land in south Lebanon and Western Beqaa and
in (Syria's) Golan, and a victory of the peace itself,"
Hrawi said.
</P>
<P>
"A frozen state of the peace process is not in the
interest of Lebanon, nor in the interest of the region, nor
in the interest of the peace itself," the president added.
</P>
<P>
"Never agree to the continuity of occupation and never
agree to surrender," the Lebanese leader declared.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Jewish state to return to "serious negotiations"
in order to reach peace based on international resolutions, first
of which is U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, and the
principle of exchanging land for peace.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has no other choice but to give up its intransigence
and to return to serious negotiations," the president
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 19 people were
killed, 82 others injured and 15 more missing in a massive
explosion at a shoe store in San Juan, Puerto Rico this morning.
</P>
<P>
The explosion at 8:35 a.m. (1235 GMT) in a shoe store shattered
a six-story building, ripping a 15-meter-wide hole up the side of
the building in a busy shopping area of the Puerto Rican capital,
reports from San Juan said.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of police, civil defense workers, firefighters and
volunteers were working to help the injured and searching for
anyone buried under the ruins of the building.
</P>
<P>
Students in the nearby La Milagrosa Catholic school, which was
damaged by the explosion, were evacuated without any injuries.
</P>
<P>
The dead were laid out with sheets over their bodies on the
pavement and many of the injured were taken into the chapel at the
school, where they were served with first aid before they could be
taken to hospitals. Helicopters were used to airlift the most
seriously injured to the Centro Medico Hospital, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Pedro Toledo was quoted as saying a natural gas
leak may have been the cause of the blast at the Humberto Vidal
shoe store in Rio Piedras, a residential and shopping district in
San Juan.
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said utility employees were working on a gas
main outside the building and store employees were inside at the
time of the blast.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister for
Health Zakia Meghji said today the family planning should be a
step to promote health care for women and children in sustaining
economic development in the country.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the launching of a five-year family
planning strategic plan by a non-govervmental organization (NGO),
the Marie Stopes Tanzania, in Dar es salaam.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of family planning should not be left to women
alone. Couples should discuss positively together and support
each other in deciding the number of children they need," she
noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is however not possible for the government to achieve its
set objectives alone. In recognition of this, it has set as one
of its major strategies, to increase the participation of
non-governmental organizations and the private sector," she said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Chairperson of Marie Stopes Tanzania board of
Directors, Naomi Katunzi, said that during the five years the

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President P. W. Botha has denied any involvement in the 1988
Khotso House bombing, but promised to cooperate with the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).
</P>
<P>
This was revealed today by TRC Chairman Archbishop Desmond
Tutu at a press conference after a two-hour meeting with Botha in
George, Western Cape Province.
</P>
<P>
Tutu said Botha had made no concessions or dramatic
revelations and continued to disagree with the establishment of
the TRC.
</P>
<P>
Khotso House was the former headquarters of the South African
Council of Churches in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as a breakthrough, Tutu said it
signaled a softening in Botha's stance on the TRC.
</P>
<P>
Botha told Tutu during their talks that allegations of his
involvement in the bombing were based on untested and
unsubstantiated hearsay.
</P>
<P>
In October, former National Police Chief Johan van der Merwe
told the TRC that Botha had authorized the Khotso House bombing.
</P>
<P>
Van der Merwe said he believed Botha might also have been
behind the murder of several anti-apartheid activists in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement presented to Tutu, Botha said he is
willing to cooperate with the TRC in its investigations and will
do all in his power to persuade former cabinet colleagues to do
likewise.

<P>
LAGOS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank
(ADB) has approved a 2.8 million U.S. Dollar loan to Nigeria for
the development of its bitumen resources, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Minister of Solid Minerals Development, Alhaji
Ali, announced this at the corner-stone laying ceremony for the
office complex of the bitumen project in Akure, capital of the
Ondo State in southwestern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Ondo project is the the first step taken by Nigeria to
develop the bitumen belt extending 120 kilometers from Ogun
through Ondo to Edo states in the southwestern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The authorities estimate that the belt contains a reserve
equivalent to 150 billion barrels of crude oil in an area of
6,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The belt has been divided into 15 prospecting blocks, each of
300 square kilometers for possible leasing to private investors.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria currently consumes 150,000 metric tonnes of bitumen a
year, mainly for road construction and maintenance. It relies on
heavy crude oil import from Venezuela for the production of
bitumen.

one month, a U.N. spokeswoman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the noon briefing, Spokeswoman Silvana Foa said

three men accused of trying to assassinate Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak On June 26, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The mandatory sanctions include ban on international fights by
Sudan Airways and other Sudanese government aircraft and closing

<HEADLINE> Israeli Legislator Lashes out Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli legislator said
today that the presence of Jewish settlements in Hebron would
cripple efforts in finalizing a deal on the Israeli redeployment
in the West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
The presence of 450 Jewish settlers among 200,000 Palestinians
in Hebron presents a major obstacle in the way of reaching an
agreement, Salah Tarif, a member of the Israeli Knesset
(parliament) from the opposition Labour Party, told reporters
after meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa here.
</P>
<P>
The settlers should be removed from Palestinian territories, he
said, adding that this should have been done years ago,
particularly when a Jewish extremist killed 29 Palestinian
worshipers and wounded many others at the Ibrahimi Mosque in
Hebron in February 1994, he added.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations on the Israeli army's redeployment in Hebron had gone
into a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Tarif, also Chairman of the Knesset's Committee of the
Interior, said he categorically opposes the government's decision
on expanding Jewish settlements in the Palestinian self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai recently gave final
approval for the construction of 1,200 housing units in the
settlement of Emmanuel in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Emmanuel projects are the first in the settlements to be
initiated by the current Israeli government, which has earlier
approved the plans to build some 2,000 units in Matityah/Kiryat
Safer.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his hope Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
would gear his policies towards the realization of peace and an
agreement would be reached on the Israeli redeployment in Hebron
during the upcoming meeting between Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a senior Israeli government source
said Wednesday that Israel does not oppose such a meeting to
advance the negotiations on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should hand over the civilian
powers to the Palestinian Authority after the redeployment, while
maintaining security control over the Jewish quarter surrounded by
Palestinian residents.
</P>
<P>
Israel's demand on its troop's right of conducting hot pursuit
of suspected Palestinian extremists in the PA-controlled areas
remains the central dispute blocking the final agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron talks, which resumed after the late September
bloodshed, have failed to produce results so far despite the
intensive negotiations and the U.S. mediation.

<HEADLINE> Police Get Blame For Racial Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A deep cultural divide between
whites and Asians was a major cause to a weekend of rioting in
Bradford, England, an inquiry concluded.
</P>
<P>
Tension and lawlessness were said to have been fueled by
"arrogance and ignorance" shown by the mainly white police force
in dealing with trouble in the Kashmiri community in Bradford.
</P>
<P>
The report into the riots of June l995, which cost 1.2 million
U.S. dollars in damage and manpower, said policing policy was
"fundamentally flawed," but cleared police of racism.
</P>
<P>
The report blamed "heavy-handed" officers armed with new style
batons, who made no attempt to communicate with local people.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry was set up by local organizations, police and
voluntary groups. The inquiry team published its findings here
today.
</P>
<P>
The report described how trouble began in the Manningham
district when two policemen confronted noisy youths playing
football. Crowds built up in the street and later serious
disturbances unfolded with petrol bombs being hurled, shops looted
and cars set on fire.
</P>
<P>
The report said most troublemakers were males in their teens or
twenties. The victims were mostly white, including all 10 members
of the public to be attacked.
</P>
<P>
Among six causes listed in the report were ethnic conflicts,
racial discrimination in the labor market, criminal behavior by
boys and young men, and policing problems.
</P>
<P>
The two officers initially involved were said to have "misread
the behavior" of most of the residents.

Cisneros said today that he has been exploring potential
successors as he nears an announcement on his own future.
</P>
<P>
He said he had yet to decide whether to remain at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development for President
Clinton's second term, and was weighing personal financial
questions that raised doubts about remaining in government.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said he had had conversations with several
mayors mentioned as possible successors.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was "exploring interest levels" in the HUD
post.
</P>
<P>
Six members of Clinton's 14-member Cabinet already have told
the White House they are leaving.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conference with reporters today, Cisneros said
he had two college-age daughters and had to weigh his financial
needs and potential private-sector salaries against continued
government service.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police: Children Killed by Old Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Police said
that the explosion that killed three Palestinian children and
wounded several others in the West Bank today was caused by
an old land mine.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, Palestinian security
forces and the Israeli army are looking into the blast which took
place in the village of Ansur near Jenin.
</P>
<P>
The village is currently under the Israeli army control,

Earlier today, initial report said that the three Palestinian
children were killed by an Israeli army left-over grenade in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>

accidentally detonated the grenade they came across while
playing in the field just outside of the West Bank town of
Jenin.
</P>

<P>
HONG KONG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police and
forensic pathologists are working to ensure a speedy and proper
identification of the charred bodies collected from the horrifying
fire in a commercial building Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 21-hour fire in the 16-story Garley Building which was put
out Thursday afternoon, left 39 dead and 81 injured. It was the
worst fire in Hong Kong in the past century.
</P>
<P>
Among the 33 bodies and a bag of suspected human remains sent
to a public mortuary, six have been partially identified based on
identity documents or personal belongings found on them.
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Lo Yik-kee said the identification process was
complicated and time consuming, but it would be pursued properly
and actively.
</P>
<P>
Police have received 34 missing person reports believed to be
connected with the fire.
</P>
<P>
A special investigation team with 70 officers has been set up
to investigate the circumstances of the incident, conduct
associated inquiries and process the death inquiry on behalf of
the coroner.
</P>
<P>
Forensic Pathologist Mong Hoi-keung said that up to 15:00
Friday, 21 bodies had been preliminary examined and the
preliminary post-mortem work was expected to be completed today.

<HEADLINE> Conflicting Reports Over Withdrawal of Missiles from Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Belarussian official
said today that the last batch of former Soviet strategic nuclear
missiles deployed on its territory have been returned to Russia.
</P>
<P>
But the command of Russia's Strategic Missile Forces denied the
withdrawal had finished and said the process is expected to be
completed by the end of the year, Russia's official Itar-Tass news
agency quoted a spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian presidential aide Vladimir Zametalin told foreign
news reporters, "The missiles have all gone."
</P>
<P>
He said they had been removed "recently" in line with the 1992
Lisbon Protocol, which settled the fate of missiles left outside
Russia when the former Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, last week, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko
admitted in a speech to the Russian State Duma (lower house) that
there were still over a dozen Soviet SS-20 missiles still in
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
He warned that he might suspend the withdrawal of the remaining
nuclear missiles to Russia if the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) refused to provide guarantees that no nuclear
weapons would be deployed on the territory of prospective East
European members.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the completion of the transfer, Belarus could
demand guarantees from the West that such weapons would not be
deployed close to its border, Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
His opinion was backed by Russian Duma Deputy Speaker Alexander
Shokhin, who told reporters that there should be no haste in the
nuclear withdrawal from Belarus.
</P>
<P>
"This issue should be synchronized with NATO expansion or with
the answer to the continuing question -- will nuclear weapons be
deployed on the territory of new NATO members," Shokhin said.
</P>
<P>
Belarus is the last former Soviet republic to remove the
missiles, following Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> Cult Leader Given 3 Years in Prison in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Jacques Mazier, former
president of the cult group of Eglise de Scientologie in Lyon,
central France, was given three years of jail by a court in the city
today for "swindling" and "involuntary homicide."
</P>
<P>
Mazier, sued for being responsible for the death of a cult
member, was also ordered to pay 500,000 francs (100,000 U.S.
dollars) in fine and was deprived of his civic and civil rights and
right to have family for five years, as well as exclusion from
public marches for five years, by the Correctional Tribunal of Lyon.
</P>
<P>
The judgement was harder than a proposal given by the attorney
general who suggested a three-year jail sentence and 500,000 francs
of fine only.
</P>
<P>
The court declared innocent two other national leaders of Eglise
de Scientologie, Danielle Gounord and Jean-Paul Chapellet, who were
accused of complicity in swindling, and were proposed to be given
two years in jail and 100,000 francs (20,000 dollars) of fine by the
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 15 cult members were given suspended sentences from
eight months to two years in jail for swindling, attempt in
swindling or complicity, while five others were declared innocent by
the court.
</P>
<P>
The Eglise de Scientologie was also accused of exercising mind
control and indoctrination during an earlier trial from September 30
to October 8.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers for the cult members accused the trial as
"inquisition."

<HEADLINE> Big Rise in Non-OPEC Offshore Oil Production Expected: IEA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Offshore oil production by
non-OPEC countries is expected to increase by 37 percent between
1995 and 2000, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a
study published today.
</P>
<P>
A revolution in offshore oil technology and practices over the
past 10 years has fundamentally changed the medium-term outlook
for the world oil market, the study, "Global Offshore Oil
Prospects to 2000," says.
</P>
<P>
Earlier predictions said oil production of non-OPEC
countries would decline, making the swelling global oil market
increasingly dependent on several Middle East oil producing
countries.
</P>
<P>
But now, the IEA said that total offshore oil production by
non-members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) cartel will grow by 5.2 million barrels per day from the
present 14.1 million to 19.3 million barrels by 2000.
</P>
<P>
This would represent 80 percent of the total increase of oil
production by non-OPEC countries from 1995 to 2000, since on-shore
oil production will increase by only 1.1 million barrels per day
to 29.4 million barrels by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that offshore oil production by OPEC
countries in 2000 will stand at 8.2 million barrels per day, 1.2
million barrels more per day than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The IEA Director Robert Priddle hailed the new offshore surge
as a good thing because many OPEC countries are situated in what
he called "politically unstable areas."
</P>
<P>
The Gulf of Mexico in North America is expected to become one
of the largest offshore oil fields comparable to the North Sea,
while offshore oil production in South America, West Africa and
other areas will also increase, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The share of North Sea oil, which now accounts for 68 percent
of non-OPEC offshore oil production, is expected to fall to 32.26
percent by 2000, the study forecast.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the share of offshore production in North America in
non-OPEC areas is expected to rise from the present 18.73 percent
to 30.50 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The share of South America will rise from the present 4.11
percent to 14.57 percent, West Africa from 6.71 percent to 9.66
percent, and the rest from 2.34 percent to 13.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
David Knapp, principal administrator of oil supply analysis of
the IEA, said that offshore oil production costs could further
drop by 40 percent in the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Belgian PM Backs Deputy in Paedophile Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene on Thursday defended his deputy who is facing
allegations of paedophilia, but was accused by the opposition of
putting the survival of his government before morality.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene rejected opposition calls for Elio Di Rupo to step down
and said the deputy prime minister "retains my confidence."
</P>
<P>
But Patrick Dewael, parliamentary leader of the opposition
Flemish Liberal Party said, "You are afraid Di Rupo's stepping
down could spell the end of the government."
</P>
<P>
Dehaene Wednesday canceled a visit to Slovakia and Austria at
the last minute to appear in parliament to defend Di Rupo who is
alleged to have had sex with under-age boys.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has demanded that Di Rupo step down, saying he
no longer has the political integrity and moral authority required
of a deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene said it would be premature to decide Di Rupo's
political fate while investigations were going on and said Di Rupo
had personally assured him of his innocence.
</P>
<P>
If Di Rupo stepped down, Dehaene's center-left coalition would
hang in the balance, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Parliament voted 103-20 to accept the recommendation of a
special parliamentary commission not to send Di Rupo to court.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member commission ruled that there was not enough
evidence to lift Di Rupo's parliamentary immunity and asked the
Belgian supreme court, the Cour de Cassation, to probe further
into the allegations and submit a report by December 9.
</P>
<P>
Coalition members said di Rupo should remain in his post at
least until the end of the supreme court investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels public prosecutor filed the suit after a man
reportedly claimed that he had sex with Di Rupo in 1989 when he
was 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
The coalition insists that the case is not strong enough to
warrant the lifting of immunity.

<HEADLINE> 6.2 Million Mobile Phone Users Signed Up In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics from
China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications show that the
country had signed up 6.2 million mobile phone users by the end of
October, ranking China as one of the world's leading markets for
cellular telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the first analog cellular phone system set up in
Guangzhou in 1987, China's mobile telecommunications industry has
established the world's largest 900 MHz analog cellular phone
network, and maintained a yearly growth rate of 150 percent in the
subscription, according to "People's Posts and Telecommunications
News."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's 15 provincial-level GSM (global service
for mobile communication) networks were connected together on
January 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
So far, the GSM service is available in 170 cities and 350
counties across the country, and the national roaming function
will be added by next January.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts estimate there will be more than 10 million
mobile phone users in 1997, extending the GSM coverage to all the
super-highways and most transport trunks, scenic spots and
townships. Based on the predictions for 1997, the subscription
list will be doubled by the year 2000, hitting a total of 20
million users.

<HEADLINE> HK Insurance Industry Records 12 Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's insurance
industry grew by 12 percent in 1995 in terms of premium income,
with long term business contributed most to the overall growth.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics on the insurance market
released today, the total income of general business and long term
business amounted to 43.8 billion HK dollars (5.62 billion US
dollars) in 1995 which represented about four percent of the Hong
Kong Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the growth of gross premiums, net premiums rose
by a relatively higher rate of seven percent to 13.3 billion HK
dollars (1.71 billion US dollars) in 1995. This can be explained
by the increase of retention ratio from 63 percent in 1994 to 66
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The release said that this is the third consecutive year for
the general insurance industry to enjoy profits.
</P>
<P>
The release said that by October 31 this year, there are 221
authorized insurers in Hong Kong, of which 158 are general
insurers, 44 long term insurers and 19 composite insurers. As
regards insurance intermediaries, there are 311 insurance brokers
and 31,088 insurance agents.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hopes Bonn-Tehran Crisis Settled Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran today expressed the hope
that the Bonn-Tehran crisis would be soon eased so that bilateral
cooperation can continue.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said that he would
soon respond to German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl's message on
the crisis and expressed hope that the dispute would soon be
settled.
</P>
<P>
He called on the German government to adopt necessary measures
in this regard before it is too late.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian and German people were willing to be sincere
and cooperative with each other, he said, recalling the historical
ties of friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's message was conveyed by German Ambassador Horst Beshma
to Morteza Sarmadi, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister in
Communication, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kohl expressed his concern and anxiety about the latest
development in the bilateral ties, saying that he was very
worried that the Germany-Iran relations might be harmed.
</P>
<P>
However, he made it clear that "We have no intention to
increase the escalation of the current crisis."
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the Bonn-Tehran relations came after the German
Federal Prosecutor charged the Islamic regime, including Iran's
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, President Rafsanjani and information
minister and foreign minister, accountable for the Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
Former leader of Iran's outlawed Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) Sadeq Sharafkandi and three of his companions were
killed by unidentified persons at the Mykonos restaurant in
Berlin on September 17, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Germany accused the Iranian government of being involved in the
case. But Tehran denied such an allegation.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, Iranian students marched on the street
and staged several anti-German demonstrations, throwing tomatoes,
eggs and rocks at the German Embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Iranian parliament members signed a letter and
urged the Foreign Ministry to degrade the diplomatic ties and
economic relations with its largest trade partner of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a large number of worshipers at Friday prayer
sermons on campus of Tehran University today, Rafsanjani noted
that the recent events affecting Tehran-Bonn ties are the result
of U.S. and Israeli machinations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the measures taken by the German judicial
system are "historically unjustifiable," and is a clear indication
that "Satanic elements" are at work to wreck the understanding
and cooperation between Iran and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that Iran has, however, not yet found any
firm indication that the German government agrees with the
stance of the judiciary and there are proofs that many
government members are unwilling to see any strain in
Tehran-Bonn ties.
</P>
<P>
"There are clear signs in Germany's foreign policy calling
for friendship between Iran and Germany but the German
judiciary, either consciously or unconsciously has fallen under
outside influence especially that of the U.S. and the Zionist
regime," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani recalled that in a recent interview with a
German Magazine, in response to a question on what he would
do if was to be accused by the German court, he had
replied that there is a proverb in Iran that says "if an
insane were to throw a rock into a well, even a hundred
wise men would be incapable of taking it out."
</P>
<P>
He added that he was willing to see Germans pay attention
to the proverb, but the Iranian officials still believe that
the German government and its judicial system should be dealt
with separately.

<P>
LANZHOU, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A 2,200-kilometer highway mail
route linking Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province, with Urumqi,
the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest
China, has just opened.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a mail transport team was organized by the
Lanzhou Postal Bureau to carry mails via the highway, so that more
than 650 mail bags are now shipped to Urumqi each day, and could
reach as high as 1,500 bags when business picks up.
</P>
<P>
The small volume of mail carried between the two cities
previously caused an excessive amount of Xinjiang's mail to pile
up in Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
Travel time for cars on the new highway round trip is eight
days. This longest Grade-One mail highway in the northwestern part
of China is a piece of good news to the people of Xinjiang who
look forward to their messages from outside.

<P>
PARIS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Three hundred Burundian refugees
who returned home from Zaire were massacred in October in a church
in the troubled province of Cibitoke, west of the country, the
Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted a spokesman of the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) as saying in Geneva
today.
</P>
<P>
"Three hundred people were killed on October 22 in the church

</P>
<P>
She said that so far it was not known who was responsible for

out between Zairean government forces and the Banyamulenge Tutsi
rebels last month.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said that 50,000 Burundian refugees have returned
home over the past one month and 30,000 of them were staying in
Cibitoke, a battlefield between the Tutsi-led Burundian government
forces and Hutu rebels over the past three years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Work With Thailand on Drug Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. drug control
officer said here today that his country will continue to support
and cooperate with Thailand in drug control.
</P>
<P>
Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the U.S. Office of National
Drug Control Policy, said U.S.-Thai counter-drug partnership has
been good in such fields as investigations of heroin trafficking
organizations, anti-smuggling projects, crop eradication efforts,
demand reduction programs and anti-crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey, the top adviser to the U.S. president on drug
control policy, is on a short visit to Thailand to boost U.S.-Thai
cooperation in stemming the flow of heroin into the world's
illicit drug market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the American Chamber of Commerce in Thailand today,
McCaffrey said 61 percent of the world's opium crops are harvested
in Southeast Asia, adding that Myanmar is the major opium producer
in the region, accounting for 84 percent of the region's
production.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Myanmar's opium production could generate 213
tons of heroin, 56 percent of the global production potential.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan is another large opium producer, capable of
providing 140 tons of opium, according to McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
He said domestic efforts by each country cannot address what is
fundamentally a global problem fueled by powerful criminal
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"All our countries are affected by the drug problem in one way
or another, and more international cooperation is needed in
combating drug abuse and reducing drug demand," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Earliest Book of Wood Type Printing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have announced
that a Buddhist scripture unearthed in northwest China is the
earlist book in the world produced with lettering typefaces carved
in wood.
</P>
<P>
They say the discovery advances the birth of wood-typeface
letter printing on earth by more than 100 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist scripture, discovered in 1991 in a local pagoda in
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, consisted of nine parts with a
total of some 100,000 characters.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists at the local Archaeology Institute said that the
scripture written in the language of the Western Xia dynasty,
characters of one of ethnic groups in China, was published in the
late 12th century.
</P>
<P>
They confirmed it as the earliest one of its kind, based on a
study of its composition, printing, coloring, as well as the form
of the printed characters.
</P>
<P>
The traditional conclusion has been that printing type made of
wood was invented by Wang Zhen during the Yuan dynasty
(1271-1368). However, the newly-discovered scripture has upgraded
the birth of such printing methods to more than one hundred years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Archaeology experts said that the scripture will contribute to
the study of history and the technique of Chinese printing,
especially typeface printing.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Per Capita GDP Up Immensely By 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is expected to
generate 250 billion US dollars in GDP annually by 2010 and have a
per capita GDP of about 18,000 US dollars, nearly nine times the
national average, according to an urban development program.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is the country's economic powerhouse and has had
high-speed economic growth in the past five years, with an annual
growth rate reaching 13 percent. In 1995, it had more than 30
billion US dollars in GDP, with per capita GDP surpassing 2,200 US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the country's drive to open wider to outside and its
favorable location, Shanghai's golden period of economic growth
will last for a long time, according to Vice-Mayor Zhao Qizheng.
</P>
<P>
One of the central government's major policies is to turn
Shanghai into an international economic, financial and trade
center as soon as possible, Zhao noted. In order to do so, it will
speed up infrastructure construction, increase reforms by turning
state-owned enterprises into companies, and improve its market
systems.
</P>
<P>
It will develop a multi-function market system for currency,
foreign exchange, contracts and real estate, and greater effort
will be put into expanding property rights to increase the city's
influence in economic development in the Yangtze River valley and
in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The city will help the Pudong New Area promote economic
development and speed up industrial restructuring and improve
resource allocations.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will open wider to the outside world, increase use of
overseas investments, allow foreign-funded banks to get involved
in RMB business and foreign-funded companies to handle exports,
and encourage overseas investors to build non-banking financial
institutions in the city.

HONG KONG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Just 22 hours after putting
out a Yau Ma Tei commercial building blaze which killed 39 people,
Hong Kong firemen had to combat another fire, which at the end
almost destroyed the top floor of an industrial building here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at the elevator lobby on the 14th and top

With the use of six jets and two turnable ladders and
mobilization of 30 breathing apparatus teams, firemen managed to
extinguish the blaze at 16:30.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people in the building at the time of fire were
evacuated and no one got injured. Workers inside the building
complained that they were not warned of the danger at the time of
fire.
</P>
<P>
A fire which broke out Wednesday afternoon in the 16-storey
Garley Building on Nathan Road was so fierce that firemen failed
to put it out until Thursday afternoon. The fire which the local
press described as the worst ever in Hong Kong in the past
century, killed 39 people including a senior fireman and injured
81. Some of the injured are still in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
And identification of the 33 charred bodies found on the badly
damaged floors and investigation for the cause of the fire are
still going on.
</P>
<P>
Sparks produced during welding work in an elevator shaft of the
building was believed to have fallen on flammable items at the
bottom of the shaft and a fire started. Flames quickly rose along
the shaft to the upper floors, where they turned into an inferno
which caused most of the deaths, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The two fires have aroused great concern among local residents
over the safety of the many old buildings in Hong Kong. Newspapers
carried front-page editorials and articles and TV stations offered
special programs in the past days, calling for urgent and solid
steps to improve the situation of these buildings.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Party Leader Vows to Erase VIP Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Nawaz Sharif, chairman of
the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz group) (PML-N), today vowed to
erase every mark of VIP culture in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a group of Pakistani intellectuals in Lahore,
capital of Punjab province, Sharif said that the elimination of
VIP culture would form the basis of his manifesto for the coming
February 3 polls next year.
</P>
<P>
PML-N was the major rival to the former Pakistani government
led by Benazir Bhutto and is a potential ruling party in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
After the dismissal of Benazir's government by President Farooq
Leghari on November 5, the caretaker government introduced a
series of rules to eliminate the VIP culture, which was a major
step of the anti-corruption campaign in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that on the basis of the PML-N manifesto, his party
would stir up a democratic uprising and obtain people's mandate in
the February polls.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had directed PML-N central and provincial
boards to nominate such candidates who ensure implementation of
the PML-N manifesto which would be reflective of the people's
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
"In the eyes of the state of Pakistan and its government, every
citizen should have equal rights," he said, adding that on the
basis of this, the PML-N manifesto would allow no special
privileges for any group of people.
</P>
<P>
He said his manifesto would not allow duty free cars to anybody
nor special treatment facility in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In the coming times, steps would have to be taken not for the
provision of facilities for those who already have them in plenty
but for those who have nothing but miseries and worries, he added.

<HEADLINE> Large Swarm of Red Locusts Arrives in S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A red locust swarm
numbering several millions is taking a breather near Pretoria
after a long trek from Mozambique, the Department of Agriculture
said today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy-director of Resource Conservation of the Agriculture
Department, Thys Heyns, said that he had just received a call
from a man in Annlin, north of Pretoria, who reported the locusts
are devouring his garden.
</P>
<P>
The swarm hatched in Mozambique, from where it travelled
through Malawi, Namibia, Botswana, before coming into South
Africa, said the Department.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, chemicals sprayed from aircraft have killed about
three-quarters of the swarm at a holiday resort near the Bon
Accord Dam in Northern Province.
</P>
<P>
The spraying had to be limited as part of the locusts were too
close to residential areas, therefore, the remaining locusts
travelled southward on to Annlin, said Heyns.
</P>
<P>
He said the insects are not dangerous and don't usually devour
whole gardens. They ate mostly patches of grass and tree leaves.
</P>
<P>
Heyns said he had never in his 11-year involvement
in locust control seen a swarm so large, and it was the first time
since the 1940s red locusts were found in these parts of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Double-digit Growth Expected for Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- China's international tourism
arrivals and tourism foreign exchange receipts are expected to
witness a double-digit growth this year, a tourism official said
today.
</P>
<P>
The official at China National Tourism Administration in
Beijing said that overseas tourist arrivals are expected to grow
by over 10 percent, while foreign exchange receipts should
increase by about 15 percent to reach 10 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, China received 37.8
million overseas tourists, and earned 7.2 billion US dollars from
tourism, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
An improved air traffic network is seen as a strong support to
the country's international tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, there were 852 Chinese passenger
aircraft flying on 797 domestic and international air routes,
linking China with 53 cities in 33 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
China's tourism industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors
of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the country had established 9,598 tourist
enterprises and administrative organs employing 1.1 million
people. In addition, the industry had also indirectly created jobs
for about 5.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
Tourism development has also become a means to help boost the
economy of economically-poor areas, since many of the areas are
rich in tourism resources. Early figures show that over three
million people in the country's most backward regions have
somewhat improved their living standards by developing tourism.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Women over 35 have a much lower
chance of conceiving through in-vitro fertilization (IVF), The
Lancet medical journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
Success rates for IVF plummet as women get older because of
time's effects on the egg and the womb, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A study of 37,000 cycles of IVF treatment carried out in
Britain from 1991 to 1994 showed that success rates were highest
for women aged 30 and under.
</P>
<P>
The overall success rate per IVF treatment was 14 percent but
women aged 30 enjoyed the highest rate of 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the age of 35 the rate falls to 14 percent but then drops
steeply to seven percent at 40 and only two percent at 45. The
success rate for women at 25 was 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said older women could significantly improve their
chances by using a donated egg although there was still a downward
trend in success rates among women over 30 using donated eggs.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend shows that the womb becomes increasingly
unreceptive with age.
</P>
<P>
Women who had been pregnant before, especially those who had
had a previous child by IVF, had a greater chance, scientists
say.

<HEADLINE> Prostate Cancer Gene Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A gene that predisposes men to
prostate cancer, the most prevalent cancer in the United States,
has been located for the first time, said a study published in
today's edition of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
The gene, HPC-1 (hereditary prostate cancer 1), is situated on
chromosome 1, one of the bundles of genetic material found in
cells, said the journal, marking the first proof that genes
conferring hereditary predisposition to prostate cancer exist.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the U.S. National Center for Human Genome
Research, Johns Hopkins University and Umea University in Sweden,
announced the location of the first major gene that predisposes
men to prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said they discovered the gene location through an
international study involving 91 U.S. and Swedish families. All
the families had at least three close relatives who had suffered
from prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
Locating a gene is the first step toward identifying it. Once
the HPC-1 gene is identified, researchers are expected to make
clear how the gene's mutations can predispose families to getting
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
In the future, combining genetic susceptibility testing with
testing for prostate-specific antigens and other early detection
measures "will be potentially of value in preventing deaths from
this common disorder," said Francis Collins, director of the
genome research center.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng met in Beijing
today with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, whom
he described as "an old friend".
</P>
<P>
Li said he was "deeply impressed" by his own visit to Mexico a
year ago and was happy to see Zedillo in Beijing, noting that
Zedillo's visit is a big event in bilateral relations and will
push the two countries' friendly ties forward.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said that President Zedillo, who is leading
a group of 30 enterpreneurs on this visit, had fruitful talks with
President Jiang Zemin this morning, and the two presidents reached
an extensive consensus.
</P>
<P>
There is still great potential for mutually-beneficial
cooperation between the two countries, Li said, and China and
Mexico should keep exploring new ways of expanding economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Mexican business people accompanying Zedillo
on the visit have held talks with their Chinese counterparts,
which the premier said is very important for the two sides to
increase mutual understanding and promote bilateral economic and
trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said he was pleased to meet with Premier Li, and that
Li's visit to Mexico last year played an important role in
advancing bilateral relations. He said he and Jiang had
wide-ranging discussions on bilateral ties and other issues of
common concern, and that the two sides take the position on
international affairs, that every country has the right to
national independence, and that no country has the right to
interfere into others' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries have had sound cooperation in
the economy and trade, and have especially made progress since
Chinese enterpreneurs accompanied Premier Li on his Mexico visit.
</P>
<P>
It is important that close links between Mexican and Chinese
business people would be established to enhance bilateral economic
and trade cooperation, Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
After listening to Zedillo's briefing on Mexico's domestic
situation, Li said that the Mexican government and people have
made remarkable progress in overcoming a financial crisis and
re-establishing social stability.
</P>
<P>
Li also praised the great efforts made by the Mexican
government in its independent foreign policy and in safeguarding
state sovereignty and in playing a positive role in international
and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li said that he visited some Latin American nations over the
past two years and was impressed by their abundant natural
resources and hard-working people. It can be predicted that the
Latin American countries will play an increasingly important role
on the international arena in the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li's wife Zhu Lin also held a meeting with the first lady of
Mexico, Nilda Patricia Velasco De Zedillo, today.

District head, Cheng Yin, says that his district has built
various training centers to improve residents' cultural life, and
has opened 185 family schools and has taught over 200,000 parents
how to take care of their children in a healthy way.
</P>
<P>
The district government has put 15 million yuan into improving
the local theaters, libraries and children's palaces, he said, and
there are 15 art troupes and dance groups which give performances
in workshops, schools and residents' homes.
</P>
<P>
Harmonious interpersonal relations increase the sense of
safety, the official said. On one street with 13,000 households,
the number of robbery has gone down every year for eight years,
with nine cases in 1994, five in 1995, and three in 1996.
</P>
<P>
With the market economy, new interpersonal relations of
harmony, unity, and helping each other have been formed in many
communities in China's big cities, sociologist Pan Yongkang said.
</P>
<P>
The concept of love of humanity can be traced back to ancient
times in China, he said. However, with rapid economic development,
some people have begun to indulge themselves in economic
pleasures, and the idea of taking pleasure in helping other people
is threatened by egoism.
</P>
<P>
Improved housing has also made people feel estranged and
lonely, he said, and as a result, residents now find themselves in
need of more harmonious neighborhood relations.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs launched a campaign in 1986 to
initiate community services in urban areas, to find new
interpersonal communications among residents, and Heping district
became a model.
</P>
<P>
All of China's cities, including big ones, such as Beijing,
Shanghai, Shenyang, Xi'an, and Wuhan, have started a period of
learning from Heping district, with many densely populated urban
districts setting up their own volunteers groups.

<HEADLINE> Spotlighting Outstanding Communities In China  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- "Devote your money, your
energy and your thoughts to a harmonious community," is a saying
that residents of Heping District in north China's biggest port
city hear often, urging them to build an outstanding community.
</P>
<P>
On one street corner there, one recent Sunday, a crowd of
people was standing in front of long tables covered with white
plastic sheets, waiting their turn. "It's not for distributing
food, but a table set up by local volunteers," one by-stander told
the reporter.
</P>
<P>
For eight years, district government officials and thousands of
young people and retired workers have set up service desks on
street corners to offer help to local people on weekends or
holidays, a local resident noted.
</P>
<P>
A month ago, the 10-square-km city district was given the title
of "national outstanding community" by the central government for
the great effort at promoting cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
The district is in the downtown area of Tianjin and is one of
the city's oldest, with interesting buildings from the colonial
period 50 years ago, and has become a pace-setter nation-wide for
outstanding communities.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 14 residents on Chaoyang Street volunteered to take
care of the elderly and offered to help needy people, and the
city's first volunteers group was formed, and now, on the
district's 12 streets there are 256 volunteers organizations with
500,000 participants, forming a neighbourhood service
network.

BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing held a meeting with former Icelandic Foreign Minister Jon
Hannebalsson at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here today.
</P>
<P>
They conversed in a warm and friendly atmosphere on China's
reform and economic development, regional and international issues
of shared concern.
</P>

There are many five-story red-brick complexes built around a
garden, and a prominent wooden plaque hangs at the entrance of
each building, telling just which services the families in the
building provide, such as hair cuts, medical help, teaching and
repairs.
</P>
<P>
"People in this building who encounter difficulties can get all
kinds of help without even leaving the building," said Sheng
Zhimin, 66, head of a neighbourhood committee, pointing out that
over 80 percent of the buildings and houses in the district have
such services.
</P>
<P>
The district's barbers have been informed that retired people
cannot afford a modern barber, so they've provided free haircuts
for 6,000 elderly citizens.
</P>
<P>
"When I lost my job and was unable to make ends meet, the
women's federation in the neighbourhood lent a hand and helped me
find a new job," one woman told the reporter.
</P>
<P>
With the reform and opening up policies and the establishment
of a socialist market economy, unemployment is no longer a
stranger to Chinese workers, who have become a new group of needy
people.
</P>
<P>
The women's federations of Heping district have helped most
out-of-work women find new jobs in the service sector. "Selfless
devotion is meaningful," Dong Haoran, party secretary of the
Heping district committee, said when speaking of devotion in the
backdrop of socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Devotion should be realistic and within one's power, he said,
adding that voluntary services should not be done by just a few
model workers.
</P>
<P>
One volunteer has offered free services for his neighbours and
repaired at least 100 electrical appliances in a year, but had to
stop the repair work when he ran out of money to pay for
expensive. Dong encouraged him to collect some money, to cover his
expenses to be able to continue his service.

<HEADLINE> China to Join International Efforts in Combating Drug Menace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor and
Secretary-General of the State Council Luo Gan said here today
that his country hopes to enhance its cooperation with the
international world in combating the drug menace.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement during a meeting with Giorgio Giacomelli,
executive director of United Nations Drug Control Program
(UNDCP). The director is in China to attend the Second Expert
Meeting on Amphetamine-Type Stimulants by UNDCP to be held in
Shanghai on November 25.
</P>
<P>
Luo said drugs have become an international disaster, harming
human society. It is humanity's responsibility to diminish the
damage made to countries, economies and political development by
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have been the victim of drugs in history, he
recalled, referring to the "Opium Wars" in the last century. Ever
since then, he said, China has been fighting unrelentlessly
against drugs.
</P>
<P>
"It is our long-held stand to combat drugs", the state
councillor said. He also briefed the guests on China's efforts in
fighting drugs, saying that the Chinese government attaches great
importance to the task, and has always supported UNDCP's work in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to cooperate all the more with the international
world in this field, he added.
</P>
<P>
Giacomelli spoke highly of China's major role in combating
drugs. He said China is the earliest, and best partner in carrying
out UNDCP's programs, setting a good example for other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the reason Shanghai was chosen as the venue of the
Second Expert Meeting was because it was the place where the 1909
International Opium Commission was held.
</P>
<P>
And now the world is once again faced with the challenge of
amphetamine-type drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai meeting is not merely a technical gathering, but
an international meeting aimed at solving drug problems
confronting human beings in the coming century. Meanwhile, he
added, the meeting is also a preparation for the UN Assembly
special session on drugs in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Giacomelli arrived in Beijing Thursday for a six-day stay in
China at the invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Public
Security.

<HEADLINE> Agreement Signed to End Conflict in Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko and Parliament Speaker Semyon Sharetsky signed an
agreement today under Russia's auspices to end their political
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached after 10 hours of difficult
negotiations, was mediated by Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Parliament Speakers Yegor Stroyev and Russian
Communist Party leader Gennady Seleznyov.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Belarus will hold a referendum on November
24 as scheduled, but the results on the constitutional issues will
be "of recommendatory nature."
</P>
<P>
The agreement also holds that the impeachment procedures
against Lukashenko, proposed by 75 deputies of the 199-seat
Belarussian parliament, will be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Both Lukashenko and Sharetsky said that the agreement was
achieved through the mediation of the three Russian leaders, who
arrived in Minsk overnight to help resolve the political crisis in
Belarus, Russia's closest ally within the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
Sharetsky stressed that the negotiations could not have been so
successful without the participation of Russian leaders, adding
that "there are no winners: only common sense has triumphed."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told reporters that he had not taken part in such
difficult negotiations for the past 15 years, saying that "this is
a very important step: the confrontation has actually been
stopped."
</P>
<P>
The months of confrontation between Lukashenko and the
parliament was caused by constitutional amendments proposed by
Lukashenko and expected to be decided at the forthcoming national
referendum.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional amendments, which were allegedly to be
planned to enlarge power of the head of state, have been opposed
by a great number of parliament deputies who urged to impeach
Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
The newly reached agreement, to be endorsed today by the
parliament, says that the final version of the Constitution will
be worked out by a Constitutional Assembly, made up of 50 deputies
of the parliament and 50 representatives of the president, to be
convened within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
The assembly will be chaired by Lukashenko and the new
Constitution will be drawn up on the basis of either of the draft
versions -- one proposed by the president and another submitted by
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Assembly is expected to adopt the new
constitution within three months.

<HEADLINE> APEC Reviews Economic, Technical Cooperation Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Committee of the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum submitted here
today to APEC ministers a report that gave an overall review of
the economic and technical cooperation programs within the 18 APEC
member economies.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "The State of Economic and Technical Cooperation in
APEC", the report was intended as an integrated policy management
tool for APEC senior officials who are working in partnership with
the business and private sectors to provide strategic focus to
APEC's work in this area.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first comprehensive, policy-oriented overview of
APEC's wide-ranging programs of economic and technical
cooperation", said Federico Macaranas, the 1996 chair of the APEC
Senior Officials Meeting.
</P>
<P>
The document, which was prepared under the auspices of the
Economic Committee by representatives of all 18 member economies,
clarified how the various forms of economic and technical
cooperation, the nature of the work, the benefits that flow from
it, the issues it is addressing and the scopes for strengthening
it.
</P>
<P>
The Osaka Action Agenda passed last year by leaders of APEC
members established the goals for economic and technical
cooperation in APEC as being "to support sustainable growth and
equitable development in the Asia Pacific region while reducing
economic disparities among APEC economies and improving economic
and social well-being".
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has been pushing forward the theme as the host
of the ongoing Eighth APEC Ministerial Meeting and the coming
Fourth Informal APEC Leadership Conference. Economic and technical
cooperation is one of the three main components of the Manila
Action Plan for 1996 APEC that is being discussed by APEC
ministers.
</P>
<P>
By relating APEC's economic and technical cooperation
activities to the sources of growth, Chairman John Curtis of the
Economic Committee said the Economic Committee's report shows how
these activities would contribute to sustainable growth and
equitable development in the Asia Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: APEC Ministers Adopt Manila Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth Ministerial Meeting
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) today adopted the
Manila Action Plan for APEC for endorsement by the leaders at
their informal meeting next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Federico Macaranas told a
press briefing here this afternoon that the action plan represents
the first step toward the achievement of APEC's goal of free trade
and investment in the region by 2010 for developed members and
2020 for developing members.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the action plan, the members are making rapid
progress through concrete measures and time-bound schedules of
achieving their goal of free trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plan represents a significant first step in
implementing the APEC members' efforts of sustaining their dynamic
economies.
</P>
<P>
However, Macaranas said, "The action plans of members have only
assured us of progress over the next several years. They have to
be progressively improved upon and refined, in order that the goal
of open free trade and investment can be achieved."
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan for APEC is an integration and
summarization of the individual and collective plans for trade and
investment liberalization and facilitation, and economic and
technical cooperation among its members.
</P>
<P>
The action plan will be finally approved by APEC leaders when
they meet in Subic, 80 kilometers north of Manila, on November 25.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the ministers decided to end the moratorium
on the admission of new members by adopting a procedure to resolve
the APEC membership issue.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino disclosed
that when the APEC foreign and trade ministers meet in Vancouver,
Canada, for the Ninth APEC Ministerial Meeting in 1997, they would
formally adopt the criteria for new membership.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, during the 10th ministerial meeting in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, the new APEC members will be announced, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, 11 countries including Russia, Vietnam, Mongolia,
India, Panama and Peru have reportedly applied for the membership.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches during the day, the ministers made their
suggestions and appeals for concrete actions to achieve the APEC
goal of trade and investment liberalization.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the importance of enhancing economic and
technical cooperation among the APEC members.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting opened here this morning to make final
preparations for the informal APEC leadership conference.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the ministers will adopt a draft
declaration on an APEC framework for strengthening economic
cooperation and development Saturday.
</P>
<P>
AT the end of their meeting, the ministers will issue a joint
statement and hold a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are also expected to discuss an information
technology agreement proposed by the United States, which stands
for zero tariff on computer and computer-related products by 2000.
</P>
<P>
A proposed APEC business visa, which would give businessmen
free access within the Asia Pacific region, is among other issues
to be discussed by the ministers.
</P>
<P>
APEC was formed in 1989 in response to increasing calls for
closer economic cooperation through increased trade and investment
flows among the economies in the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
It now groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico,
New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Chinese Taipei,
Thailand, Singapore and the United States.

</P>
<P>
Jiang praised the Mexican Government and the Mexican people for
their remarkable achievements in national development, and the
growing role the country is playing in international and regional
affairs.
</P>
<P>
While Sino-Mexican relations have undergone further development
since Zedillo became president, Jiang said, the two countries
still have much potential and broad prospects in their friendly
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The sustained and healthy growth of China's economy, and the
revitalization of Mexico's economy, offer good opportunities for
the expansion of economic and trade ties, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China and Mexico enjoy sound political ties, and the
constant high-level exchanges have enhanced their mutual

region with the greatest potential for development in the 21st
century.
</P>

that China and Mexico work together to build long-term and stable
ties of friendly cooperation."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang expressed his appreciation for
Mexico's support to China on the issues of Taiwan and Tibet, and
China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and for the
positive endeavor made by President Zedillo and the Mexican
Government in advancing bilateral relations.

they hold similar positions and back each other.

<HEADLINE> India Works out Package to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
worked out a package to boost the tourism industry in the country
and to increase foreign exchange earnings from this sector,
official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The package urges the state governments to offer tax holidays
to all types for new tourism ventures. It also proposes subsidies
up to 40 percent of the total cost to house owners interested in
converting them into paying-guest accommodations.
</P>
<P>
The government said that since tourism projects relating to
development of hotels, restaurants, airport and air services are
all capital intensive areas, the effective interest rate on loans
taken from the financial institutions should not exceed 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
The government will provide a capital subsidy of 25 percent of
the total project cost to heritage hotels, which may be completely
exempted from expenditure tax, according to the package.

<HEADLINE> APEC Economies Develop at Moderating, Healthy Paces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The 18 member economies of the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum are developing at
moderating but robust healthy paces with many members having
falling inflation and less budget deficit pressures.
</P>
<P>
The APEC economies are, in general, in robust health, with
output estimated to grow about 4 percent on average in 1996,
according to "1996 APEC Economic Outlook" released here today by
the Economic Committee of the APEC.
</P>
<P>
"The fastest growing economies are experiencing a moderation of
growth, while the slowest growing economies have seen significant
recoveries", the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the fastest growing economies, including Chile, South
Korea, Malaysia and China, are projected to avoid overheating as
growth slows to more sustainable levels, the report said. In some
other economies, growth is picking up, most notably in Japan and
the Philippines, and particularly in Mexico, which is recovering
from a recession brought on by its liquidity crisis.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the moderating tendencies have generally
kept inflationary pressures in check.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation is falling in a number of economies, most
dramatically in China and Mexico. Inflation has edged upward
slightly in only a few economies, but does not appear to be
increasing significantly in any APEC economy", the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, monetary policies across the region
have recently presented a mixed picture. Although inflationary
pressures are not intensifying at present, the persistence of
strong growth in APEC member economies is shifting the balance of
their macroeconomic risks from recession to inflation.
</P>
<P>
The report said prudent fiscal policies have no doubt
contributed to solid growth and low inflation in APEC. Australia,
Canada, Papua New Guinea and the United States have undertaken
significant fiscal consolidation measures while most other
economies are running budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
It said capital inflows and large current account deficits
still remain a concern in some Southeast Asian economies.
Indonesia has a smaller deficit but a larger stock of foreign
debt. Capital inflows into Thailand have consisted of largely
short-term debt flows.
</P>
<P>
"Despite these external imbalances, however, these economies
are not experiencing significant increase in inflationary
pressures at present. In Malaysia, for example, inflation remained
under 4 percent alongside substantial capital inflows", the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that export growth in economies like
Mexico and the Philippines has remained strong around 20 percent
while some developing APEC members have experienced a fall in
export growth.
</P>
<P>
"This highlights the dependence of many, if not all, APEC
members, on external economic factors. The factors, including
excess supplies for some electronic goods and appreciating real
exchange rates, are likely to be temporary, and growth is likely
to remain strong in most of these economies", the report said.

<HEADLINE> APEC to End Moratorium on Admission of New Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) will end its moratorium on the admission of new
members by adopting a procedure to resolve the APEC membership
issue.
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Severino, Philippine foreign affairs undersecretary,
said at a press briefing here today that APEC ministers can be
expected to formally adopt the criteria for membership when they
meet in Vancouver, Canada, for the Ninth APEC Ministerial Meeting
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A three-year moratorium on the acceptance of new members was
imposed in 1994 to allow the APEC to concentrate on deepening its
members' commitment to the objectives of the forum in transforming
the Asia-Pacific into a dynamic region through a free and open
market economy.
</P>
<P>
The APEC's long-term goal of free and open trade and
investment is to be realized by the year 2010 for developed
economies and 2020 for developing ones.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, during the Tenth APEC Ministerial Meeting in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, new APEC members will be announced in accordance
with the criteria to be adopted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
And, finally, the new members will be able to participate in
the APEC meetings in New Zealand in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Economies which have expressed their intent to join the APEC
are India, Macao, Mongolia, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, Colombia, Sri
Lanka, Vietnam, Panama and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The APEC now groups 18 member economies and they are Australia,
Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand and
the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- About 60,000 Kenyans died of
Aids from January last year to June this year with a daily
average of 111 people killed by the killer disease, according to
a Daily Nation report today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Assistant Minister for Health Basil Criticos
as saying yesterday in parliament that this is just a third of
the estimated number of suspected Aids patients in the country.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that his government could not consider allowing
mercy killing "to give Aids sufferers a dignified death" as
suggested by a member of parliament unless the law is changed.
</P>
<P>
On September 24, the Regional Director of the Aids Control and
Prevention Project said that more than 1.7 million people may be
infected with the Aids virus by the end of the year in the east
African country with a population of 28 million.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 World Population Data Sheet has ranked Kenya among
the 30 countries whose future population projections will be
affected adversely by the Hiv/Aids scourge.
</P>
<P>
According to the data released by the National Aids and
Sexually-Transmitted Disease Control Program of Kenya, more
Hiv-infected Kenyans now live in the rural areas than in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
Kipkalya Kones, Minister in the Office of the President, has
appealed that the anti-Aids campaign should not be concentrated
in urban areas at the expense of the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Family Health Regional Director Geoffrey Sikipa said that most
Aids victims are aged between 15 and 19 years.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the spread of the deadly disease among young
people to the high rate unemployment of the youth.

set up a new independent audit commission for banks on the lines
of comptroller and auditor general to tackle fraud in nationalized
banks.
</P>

<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
left the Central Clinical Hospital this morning for the Barvikha
sanatorium in Moscow suburbs, said his press office.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who underwent an open-heart surgery on November 5 at
the Cardiology Center, is expected to spend two or three weeks in
Barvikha to recover from the by-pass procedure.
</P>
<P>
Experts here were quoted by press reports as saying earlier
that the 65-year-old Russian president will be able to resume work
in full before the New Year.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who was re-elected to another four-year term last
summer, said on September 5 that the doctors had told him he was
suffering from a heart disease and he had decided to have a
surgery to fully restore work ability.
</P>
<P>
Two months later, a seven-hour operation was performed on him
by a team led by Professor Renat Akchurin.
</P>
<P>
The so-called by-pass operation is designed to restore normal
blood supply to the heart muscle by creating an artificial by-pass
of the affected, usually clogged blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Yeltsin moved from the Cardiology Center to
the Central Clinical Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the presidential health center, Professor Sergei
Mironov, said today that Yeltsin was feeling normal and was
recovering as planned.

<P>
TOKYO, November 22 (Xinhua) -- All Nippon Airways (ANA) and
Nippon Yusen K.K. (NYK) have become the biggest stockholders in
Nippon Cargo Airlines (NCA) with a 14.07 percent stake each as
they recently bought outstanding shares from 10 nonlife insurance
firms, an NCA spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Previously, four companies -- ANA, NYK, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines
Ltd. and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. -- were the largest
shareholders with a 13.19 percent stake each.
</P>
<P>
The two companies have said that they will no longer guarantee
debts stemming from NCA's purchases of cargo airplanes.
</P>
<P>
At the end of September this year, the number of corporate
shareholders of NCA stood at more than 80.
</P>
<P>
The latest acquisition of NCA shares by ANA and NYK from the
nonlife insurers indicates the two big stockholders will lead the
management of the cargo airline.
</P>
<P>
NCA suffered due to the burst of the "bubble" economy in the
early 1990s but later recovered, with its unconsolidated pretax
profit for fiscal 1995 to last March hitting a record 4.3 billion
yen.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Stages Parade Marking Independence Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon staged a military
parade in central Beirut this morning to mark the country's 53rd
anniversary of independence from a French mandate.
</P>
<P>
President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri were standing on the platform when some
3,000 soldiers and 100 tanks, armored personal carriers and
artillery were passing by.
</P>
<P>
Twelve Bell military helicopters, which Lebanon bought from
Washington with a symbolic price of 100,000 dollars for each in
1995 to modernize its tiny air force, were roaring over the
parade ground.
</P>
<P>
Government ministers, religious leaders and foreign diplomats
also attended the Independence Day celebration on Museum Street
between eastern and western Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The most prominent figure in the ceremony was Lebanon's Army
Commander Major General Emile Lahoud, a British-trained officer
who was credited with reuniting the army after its disintegration
in the 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's military forces, comprising the 30,000-strong army
and 30,000 security forces, have now been reconstructed along
non-sectarian lines, and, backed by some 35,000 Syrian troops
stationed in Lebanon, safeguards the security and stability in
this country.
</P>
<P>
President Hrawi, in an address to the Lebanese people on the
eve of the Independence Day, repeated Lebanon's commitment to the
Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
In the address televised Thursday night, the president said
that "to liberate our occupied land in south Lebanon and Western
Beqaa is our holy right."
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Lebanon's stand for coordination with Syria in
peace negotiations with Israel, which have been deadlocked since
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"A frozen state of the peace process is not in the interest of
Lebanon, nor in the interest of the region, nor in the interest
of the peace itself," the president added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel has no other choice but to give up its
intransigence and to return to serious negotiations that would
lead to a peace based on international resolutions, notably
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, and the principle of
exchanging land for peace.

He said the security measures will be in force at least for one

Authorities feel it is prudent and appropriate to step up
security in Colombo and its suburbs in view of Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leader Velupillai Prabhakaran's birthday
which falls on November 26.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that recent history shows that it is the nature
of the LTTE to create mayhem during Prabhakaran's birthday which
comes also during the LTTE's "Heroes Week" from November 20 to 27.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to take any risk. We are well prepared to face
any situation," Dissanauake said.
</P>
<P>
He added that armed patrols will be deployed at various key
points in the city and almost all the government establishments
will be guarded more carefully during this week than on other

</P>
<P>
More manpower will be drawn to the city from other stations and
the army will assist police in the task. Patrol cars will be
deployed in the city round-the-clock, he said, adding that the

at all times, especially during this week when security is tight.

LAGOS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in leading Nigerian newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
the Guardian
</P>
<P>
-- There may be a radical shift in next year's 1997 budget from the

Nigerian government accepts a proposal by the Nigerian economic summit
group, which advocated priority attention for industrial areas where
Nigeria has comparative advantage and can compete favorably in the
world market.
</P>
<P>
New Nigerian
</P>
<P>
-- The National Electoral Commission of Nigeria has mapped out 989

<HEADLINE> Philippines, US Exchange Extradition Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Two treaties on extradition and
mutual legal assistance between the Philippines and the United
States became effective today following the exchange of
instruments on the ratification of the agreements between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon and US
Secretary of State Warren Christopher led the ceremony on the
exchange of instruments of ratification for the Philippines-US
extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties at the Philippine
International Convention Center in Manila.
</P>
<P>
With the exchange of instruments, the Philippines and the
United States reaffirmed their common goal of combating crime in
both countries.
</P>
<P>
"By bringing these two treaties into effect, we have forged two
new weapons in our armory for maintaining the rule of law, for
shielding the citizenry from crime, for punishing illegal
activity, and for preserving decent and law-abiding behavior in
both our countries," Siazon said during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said that the effectivity of the two
treaties comes at a time when criminal elements are likely to take
advantage of the increasing mobility in the region, brought about
by gradual removal of barriers to global trade and investments.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the Philippines and the United States started talks on
a mutual legal assistance treaty, which limits cooperation to the
exchange of information about criminal elements. Talks were later
expanded to include an extradition treaty.
</P>
<P>
Under the extradition treaty, persons suspected of committing
criminal offenses in either country can be extradited if the crime
is punishable by at least one year, except for political offenses.
</P>
<P>
A person can be immediately arrested and held without bail once
the courts decide that he can be extradited.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Strengthen Relations With Kazakhstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nategh Noori said here today Iran would improve ties with
the littoral countries of the Caspian Sea and with the Central
Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Noori, who ended a three-day visit to Kazakhstan today,
promised that Iran would make efforts to help resolve the internal
conflicts in Kazakhstan and Afghanistan and jointly develop and
protect the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference jointly held with Kazakh Senate Speaker
Omirbek Baigeldiyev, Noori said that Iran pursues a peaceful
diplomatic policy of non-interference with other countries'
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Iran and Kazakhstan, sharing many historic
origins, have great potentials for friendly cooperation in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Noori said that Iran has invited delegates from
both the Kazakh government and its political opposition to hold
peaceful negotiations in Iran.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the internal conflicts in Kazakhstan and
Afghanistan could only be resolved in peaceful ways.
</P>
<P>
Baigeldiyev said that the Kazakh-Iranian ties have seen rapid
developments in recent years and further cooperation between the
two countries would help economic development and political
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Kazakh president's visit to Iran in 1992 and
the Iranian president's visit to Kazakhstan in 1993 have
established solid basis for the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Kazakhstan could pump its oil to the
international market with Iran's help. He said both sides
discussed proposals of laying an oil pipeline from Turkmenistan to
southern Iran and shipping out Kazakhstan's oil by train.

<HEADLINE> Reason for ADF Rebels Invasion of Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan rebels of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) invaded Uganda's southwestern district of
Kasese last week because their training camps in Zaire were
attacked by Zairean Banyamulenge rebels, reported the local daily
the New Vision today.
</P>
<P>
A top Ugandan secuerity officer was quoted by the paper as
saying the Banyamulenge, a Rwandese Tutsi Tribe who lived in
Zaire for the last 200 years, early last week attacked the
predominantly Salaf Tabliq rebel camps in Rutsuru, about 20 miles
west of Lake Katwe.
</P>
<P>
''The Tabliqs fled northwards and immediately decided to
attack Kasese with the aim of capturing and controlling land as a
base. They feared to be overrun by the Banyamulenge,'' the
officer said.
</P>
<P>
In a few days of lightning attacks, the Zairean rebels, most
of whom are the Banyamulenge, seized several eastern Zaire towns
including Goma and Bukavu, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the threat of the Banyamulenge attacks could help
to throw back to Uganda the remaining Ugandan rebels still in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Zairean troops were responsible for
training the ADF-Tabliq rebels.

<HEADLINE> Israel Lobbying UN not to Use Term of Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel is lobbying UN
members in a bid to prevent the Palestinian Authority (PA) from
using the term of "independent state", Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the PA has been arguing the case of using the
phrase of Palestinian self-determination instead of statehood in
UN documents.
</P>
<P>
An Israel Radio reporter based in New York said that he had
obtained documents showing that the PA intended to introduce the
new terminology in the upcoming UN General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The reporter said that the documents, which would be
circulated prior to the debate in the UN Assembly, contained the
term of "independent state."
</P>
<P>
Israel is also contacting members of the European Union to
seek their support to thwart the Palestinian bid, citing that
using the new phrase would mean interference in the ongoing
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Palestinian independence is one of the leading
disputes between Israel and the PA.
</P>
<P>
Israel's hardline Likud government has flatly ruled out an
independent Palestinian state, while agreeing to grant the PA
broad self-rule.
</P>
<P>
The PA, however, insists on its right to establish an
independent state with east Jerusalem as its capital. PA
President Yasser Arafat has repeatedly said that he would soon
declare the Palestinian independence.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PA are expected to tackle the issue of
Palestinian independence in the final- status talks, which have
been delayed indefinitely since last May due to the current
deadlock in the talks on Hebron redeployment.

GUANGZHOU, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A loudspeaker used by Ma
Yangying, a technician in south China's Guangdong Province, has
become an indispensable part of the life of her fellow villagers.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Huangxi Village in Chonghua City know that they
will make profits as long as they follow Ma's instructions, given
over the loudspeaker, on what new crops to grow and how to grow
them.
</P>
<P>
There are now hundreds of farming technicians like Ma in the
provincial capital of Guangzhou who strive to promote new farming
techniques among the area's 1.8 million farmers. In the past five
years, the municipal government has spent nearly 100 million yuan
to set up a network for the technique.
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, the city has popularized 14 new
farming methods, ten new kinds of pesticides and three special
fertilizers. And at present, quality seeds are planted in 90
percent of the rice paddies, 95 percent of the vegetable fields
and 80 percent of the orchards.
</P>
<P>
Chonghua city was once the only under-developed mountainous
area in Guangzhou. Since the city began stressing new farming
techniques among farmers, the scientific and technological
progress has raised the economic growth by 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city is now listed among the top 500 cities in China.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Pudong New
Development Area, one of China's top foreign capital attractions,
has launched a special anti-corruption center to check the work
and life styles of party and government officials.
</P>
<P>
A hot line has been opened and the public is being invited to
send in written complaints or make personal calls to report on
misdeeds of officials in this 500 square kilometer area, notable
for its position as one of the vanguards in the country's economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of other moves aimed at increasing the
transparency of public administration and curbing corruption, the
Pudong Area introduced the new measure last week to improve
supervision over local party and government bodies, according to a
high-ranking official in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
"In three years, an efficient, clean, fair and high-quality
work style will be fostered in the party and government bodies of
Pudong," said Zhou Yuping, reiterating his promise made to the
public, in an interview with Xinhua. Zhou is chief of the Working
Committee of the CPC in the Pudong New Development Area.
</P>
<P>
According to the working procedures at the complaint center, a
complainant will receive a reply to any allegations within 15
days; and if the answer is unsatisfactory, another investigation
must be conducted with the result informed to the complainer in
seven days.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the involvement of overseas investors in the local
affairs, Zhou said all the overseas personnel working in the area
are also entitled to participate in anti-corruption measures.

The booklet is now available at nearly every high street
bookstore, and offers an exhaustive description on the working
procedures of official businesses of nearly 600 categories, and
tells where, when and who to find, as well as listing promises
from each department of good services.
</P>
<P>
This way the red-tape and corruption sometimes seen in other
parts of the country are hardly visible in Pudong Area, said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
An information center on medicines and medical equipment has
proved an effective way to crack down on "kickbacks" and
commission for purchasing personnel in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
And the creation of a trading center of architectural design
and construction has successfully put to a halt under-the-table
deals.
</P>
<P>
Today, "the biggest construction site in China" is both at full
steam and well regulated, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
All the measure are part of efforts to ensure the rapid and
healthy development of Pudong, with a sound administration system,

GUANGZHOU, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in south China's
Guangdong Province, one of the country's economic powerhouses,
are better educated than before, now that the province has
modernized its traditional agriculture practices.
</P>
<P>
In the villages and counties of Shenzhen, the first Special
Economic Zone in the country, peasants have easy access to a
variety of training classes.
</P>
<P>
One farmer said: "The training class I attended taught me how
to breed fish and shrimp. I have really made a fortune from this."
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted last year shows that 53.8 percent of the
province's rural labor force had received a junior middle school
education in 1995, a rise of 15.8 percent over the figure in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the phenomenon to the fact that the
development of modern agriculture also calls for improvements in
the quality of the farmers' lives.

that the man, Okecho, killed a male baboon on Wednesday for
destroying his maize and banana plantations.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 baboons converged at Okecho's compound in the evening
and ''mourned like human beings'' and carried away the corpse to an
unknown place.
</P>
<P>
They stormed Okecho's house that night, throwing the door open.
</P>
<P>
''We thought those were rebels but when we listened to the
noise they were making and the giggling, we concluded they were
baboons,'' a frightened neighbour said.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision reporter reaching the scene saw Okecho laying
in a pool of blood with large holes on the throat and chest where the
heart was pulled out. enditem

<HEADLINE> Joint Executive MBA Program To Be Launched In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Two business schools, one in
Hong Kong and the other in the United States, will join hands to
launch a Master of Business Administrative (MBA) program here for
Asian executives.
</P>
<P>
The program is to be offered in January 1998 by the School of
Business and Management of the Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology (HKUST) and J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management
of Northwestern University. The two cooperators today signed a
Memorandum of Understanding on the initiative on the Hong Kong
campus.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Donald P. Jacobs, Dean of the Kellogg School, said at the
signing ceremony: "We are delighted to establish a partnership
with the HKUST, a young but fast-growing university, to train
world-class business leaders and global managers for Asia." It is
the first time his business school has established partnerships in
Asia. He believed that executives will benefit from this kind of
unique cross-cultural experience as the global marketplace rapidly
evolves.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Yuk-Shee Chan, Dean of the local business school
expressed his wishes to turn Hong Kong into the center of a most
dynamic learning platform for Asian managers through concerted
efforts with his American counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The two-year program, to be taught by faculties from the two
business schools, will enroll senior executives sponsored by their
companies.
</P>
<P>
Kellogg has been known in the United States for its top-ranking
executive MBA program, while the business school of the HKUST is
one of the youngest in the world, with a history of merely five
years.
</P>
<P>
Yet the latter is innovative in teaching and ambitious to
become one of the top business schools in Asia. It has been
active in developing exchange programs with a dozen competitive
business schools in North America, Europe and Asia.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: China to Stabilize Cotton Supply Under Output Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- China's cotton output is
expected to fall this year, but experts say the country will still
see a balance between supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
With less acreage planted and harsh weather conditions, this
year's cotton output is estimated at 3.8 million tons, down from
last year's 4.76 million, the State Statistics Bureau has
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the planting area of cotton was 12 percent
lower than last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the lower production will not cause a serious supply
shortage, as China has sufficient carryover stock from 1995-1996
and domestic demand is likely to slow down, explained an official
from the All-China Supply and Marketing Cooperation,
</P>
<P>
"The country's stock of 1.3 million tons is enough to make up
for the drop in output," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the abundant supply to the increase of
output and import in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Customs show that China imported a total of
740,000 tons of cotton last year, and another 430,000 tons during
the January-August period this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, experts noted, struggling cotton textile companies
will use less cotton.

<HEADLINE> Some Turkish Hotels Fail Fire Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Tourism Ministry
has concluded that 22 tourist hotels in Laleli district of
Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, had insufficient fire prevention
measures, the local newspaper Daily News reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the Tozbey Hotel in Laleli district suffered a
deadly fire due to an electrical fault, with 14 Ukrainians and
three Russians killed and 41 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The police said that the cause of the fire was neglect,
inadequate fire exits, the lack of fire extinguishers and fire
alarms, hotel staff uneducated in fire procedures and the
insufficiency of the ventilation system.
</P>
<P>
The disaster prompted government officials to probe into the
cases of 22 hotels run with certificates from the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The research showed that in 18 of the hotels fire instructions
were not put up where they should be, while 11 hotels did not
take any measures against fire and 15 failed to check their fire
equipment periodically.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, it was revealed that 11 hotels had not installed
the required fire warning alarm.
</P>
<P>
One hotel did not have a fire escape, while it was impossible
to reach the fire escape in another one.
</P>
<P>
The revelation showed that four hotels did not have exit doors
to the fire escape on every floor, while in nine hotels the fire
escape did not provide easy evacuation since they did not reach
the ground.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Tourism Ministry said that in the initial
stage they would observe 560 hotels, 120 of which have
certificates from the ministry, and would stop the activities of
those who were insufficient with respect to fire
precautions.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: China to Stabilize Cotton Supply Under Output Fall (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's cotton textile industry, as a traditional backbone
industry for the country, consumes four million tons of cotton
each year.
</P>
<P>
But the formerly flourishing industry has been barely hanging
on in recent years, due to decreasing exports and a steady slump
in the domestic market. Statistics show that in 1995, ten out of
15 varieties of cotton textile products suffered from an
oversupply of stock.
</P>
<P>
The widespread use of chemical fibers also undermines cotton
production demand; more than 20 percent of raw materials for the
cotton textile industry is now chemical fibers.
</P>
<P>
Though experts agreed that China will not see panic purchasing
of cotton next year, they warned that as cotton is a staple
product of great importance to the country's economy, the drop in
output must be corrected.
</P>
<P>
And as an industry responsible for the livelihood of tens of
millions of cotton farmers and 15 million cotton textile workers,
cotton production has long being on China's priority list. To
arouse farmers' enthusiasm toward cotton production, the country
has repeatedly raised the cotton purchase price.
</P>
<P>
The current price is nearly the same as that on the
international market, at 14,000 yuan per ton, rising from 1992's
6,600 yuan per ton.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the decreasing output of cotton, the Ministry of
Agriculture has urged local governments to spread the use of
advanced techniques to ensure the 1997 cotton output at 4.5
million tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one thousand people
were made homeless and destitute and several others killed in
heavy rains which battered Saudi Arabian western Red Sea coastal
city of Jeddah in the past week, according to press reports
reached here today.
</P>
<P>
Rains continued to lash the Western Province for the seventh
consecutive day till Thursday, dumping 150 millimeters of water
and causing serious damage to the eastern and southern parts of
Jeddah, Saudi English daily Arab News reported.
</P>
<P>
It said major streets and intersections in certain parts of
Jeddah were flooded creating a scene of stranded and even
broken-down vehicles and people wading through ankle-deep or
knee-deep water.
</P>
<P>
A man and a woman died and four others were hospitalized when
a bridge collapsed in Leith region after heavy rains swept the
eastern coast of the Red Sea last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two more people were killed in the rains two days later and 12
others were admitted to the emergency room of a hospital in the
region where the most heavy rains were reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, scores of cattle were lost in the region with one
estimate putting the number at 1000 head.
</P>
<P>
Civil defense officials have set up three emergency camps in
Jeddah to shelter more than 800 people made destitute by the
week-long spell of rains.
</P>
<P>
"We are providing more than 800 people with shelter, food and
medical assistance, and social services," Muhammad Dewim
Al-Gethmani who was leading rescue operations in Jeddah was
quoted as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I would estimate that more than 100 houses are inundated by
the flood water," said a resident whose house was also flooded.
</P>
<P>
Many elementary, intermediate and secondary schools for boys
were closed while several schools had reported damage to their
buildings, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Municipality officials warned the public of the dangers of
electric shocks from uprooted electricity pole and loose wires
and emphasized the need for extreme caution.
</P>
<P>
Many employees reported to their jobs late. "We had to drive
for an hour and half to make it to the office," from where the
distance to his residence usually needs 30 minutes, a company
employee was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Meteorology and Environmental Protection Administration
have announced that the weather for the next few days would be
cloudy throughout central parts of the Kingdom with possibility
of rain accompanied by thunder.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Couples Face Separation at Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- For years a married couple
shared the same office at Beijing's tax bureau. Now they have been
separated, not by any marital disharmony, but by a rule outlawing
relatives working side by side.
</P>
<P>
In a move to instill public trust and confidence into the
civil service, officials in China's capital have launched the
first wave of measures to show the door to spouses or other close
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Now instead of journeying together to work each day, tax
worker Mrs Wang has to bid farewell to her husband, as they head
off in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
Despite their good working abilities, only one of them will be
allowed to remain in the office of the Beijing Tax Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Officials confirmed that marriage was the only reason for their
"relentless" separation.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing's tax bureaus, 431 pairs have had to separate just
because they are close family members. One of each pair must find
another post outside the tax office.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Personnel Bureau official Jiang Xueqing said tax
bureaus in Beijing are conducting the pilot work in accordance
with a provisional regulation, issued by the Ministry of Personnel
last year. It calls for the withdrawal of civil servants who work
at the same work units.
</P>
<P>
There have been strong criticism from the public of
"father-and-son bureaus", "husband-and-wife sections", and
phenomena like sons driving for fathers, grandsons pouring
drinking water for grandfathers, and children working next to
their mothers.
</P>
<P>
The pilot work has affected the interests of many people, but
Jiang said that in this way officials will find it difficult to
find convenient posts for their family members or relatives, and
the withdrawal mechanism will help officials win more trust from
the public.
</P>
<P>
With the successful experience in the tax bureaus, the
withdrawal mechanism among civil servants in other departments
will be carried out in a larger scale around the city next year,
Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Firm Takes Over Zanzibar Power Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The power supply from
Tanzania's mainland to Zanzibar is expected to be switched off
early next year after 16 years services.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, the isles will rely
on a South Africa company, Electorgen Limited.
</P>
<P>
The Move is said to be aimed at making Zanzaibar self reliant
in electricity.
</P>
<P>
The Principal Secretay to the Zanzibar Ministry for Water,
Construction and Energy, Mohamed Salim, told reporters in the
town of Zanzibar on Thursday that Electrogen will ultimately
supply the isles with 110 megawatts through gas powered
generators in three phases.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will be of 35 megawatts to be followed with
another 35 megawatts after a year and 40 megawatts later.
</P>
<P>
Electrogen will also be responsible for power supply in
Zanzibar's sister Island of Pemba.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar has a little more than 25,000 consumers,
of whom about 20,000 are in the main Island of Unguja.
</P>
<P>
At present, Zanzibar's requirements for power stand at
a little more than 15 megawatts. enditem

HARARE, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The commonwealth ministerial
action group (CMAG) on Thursday welcomed the release of three
Nigerian human rights activists, but criticised the Nigerian
government for denying the group access to meet detained
opposition leader Moshood Abiola.
</P>

</P>
<P>
He said, ''we welcome the releases announced yesterday of three
detained persons, who had been detained without trial and who were

<HEADLINE> Southern African Police Should Be More Efficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 22 (Xinhua) -- There is need to establish an
efficient police training program and develop strategies to combat
the rise in sophisticated methods used by criminals in Africa, a
visiting police chief said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Southern African Regional Police Chiefs Cooperation
(SARPCCO) Training Committee and Swaziland's Assistant Commissioner
Isaac Magagula said crime in the region had become sophisticated and
there was now need to revise and produce new effective training
methods.
</P>
<P>
''We believe strongly in regional training because today's
criminal know no boundaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Magagula was a delegate at a three-day SARPCCO seminar whose theme
was ''the role of the training manager -- responsibilities,
experiences and competencies to be effective trainers''.
</P>
<P>
He, however, declined to disclose issues discussed, but said there
was now need to draft a regional training strategy for consideration
by the police chiefs at their next meeting scheduled for February in
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
He said the seminar was held to clarify the roles and
responsibilities of regional police training managers and enable them
to develop and enhance the capabilities and skills of trainers
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
''Without training, no policing strategies can succeed. We are
more enlightened that training is an ongoing process that need to be
scrutinised from time to time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
British High Commissioner to Zimbabwe Martin Williams, who
officially closed the seminar, said as police forces adapted to the
changing policing environments, training approaches should be
competency-based to enable police officers to gain a range of skills
to handle any situation. enditem

<HEADLINE> Kohl Tells Iran He Is Concerned About Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
told Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani today that he was
concerned about the recent deterioration in relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a two-page letter to Rafsanjani, Kohl said: "It is in the
interest of our two peoples that a further deterioration of the
currently tense relations with Iran be avoided."
</P>
<P>
Kohl wrote: "I would thus ask you to use your entire influence
to avoid a further increase in tensions."
</P>
<P>
Kohl assured Rafsanjani that the terrorism trial in Berlin was
not "a political trial", but a criminal trial. He said German
courts were independent and that the government had absolutely no
control over, or involvement in, the terrorism charges taking
place in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Germany have become strained since
German prosecutors demanded life sentences for an Iranian and a
Lebanese on trial for the 1992 killing of three Kurdish
dissidents in Berlin. Prosecutors last week accused Tehran of
ordering the murders.
</P>
<P>
The accusations provoked outrage in Iran. Protesters have
rallied outside the German embassy in Tehran, pelting the
compound with eggs and tomatoes and calling for the death of the
prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> Airlines to Recruit Record Number of Pilot Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese airlines plan to
recruit 645 students next year to train as pilots, the highest
number in recent years.
</P>
<P>
About 500 of the trainees will be high school graduates, and
the rest will have recently finished college. The majority will
major in airline piloting, and will graduate with a bachelor's
degree in engineering.
</P>
<P>
Ma Shengyu, an official with the Civil Aviation Administration
of China, said that the planned number of recruits is based on the
airlines' estimated demand for new pilots over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
With China's rapidly growing airline industry, its carriers
have a great demand for additional pilots; recruitment each year
has been around 600.
</P>
<P>
China Southern Airlines will remain the largest recruiter with
150 students, followed by Air China, the flag carrier, with
100.
</P>
<P>
China Southern will send its recruits to Beijing University of
Aeronautics and Astronautics for theoretical study, and to its
flight training base in Australia for training. All of the other
carriers will send their students to the China Aviation Flight
College in Guanghan, Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Thirty recruitment centers will be set up across China, which
will select students from about 70 cities.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf, the defending
champion and No. 1 seed, defeated Olympic gold medalist Lindsay
Davenport on Thursday night to move into the semifinals of the
season-ending WTA Championships.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the opening ball toss, Graf outlasted the
teenager 6-4, 7-6 (13-11). The match was much closer than the
score showed.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who has won 101 singles titles in her career, dashed the
youngerster's dream of beating Graf for the second straight
time. Davenport won their last clash in Los Angeles in August.
</P>
<P>
Though Graf took the first set at 6-4, she had felt much
pressure from her hard-hitting opponent.
</P>
<P>
Davenport once led 5-2 in the second set. Her nerves and
unforced errors cost her advantage while Graf recovered back to
finally seal the tiebreaker at 13-11.
</P>
<P>
Graf lost her serve four times, but she always managed to come
up with most of the key points.
</P>
<P>
The winner of Sunday's unique best-of-five-sets final will
collect 500,000 U.S. dollars, with the runner-up getting 250,000.

</P>
<P>
No one was hurt by the snake.

Such a case is rare in Macao as the tiny peninsula is densely

<HEADLINE> China Making Great Efforts to Achieve APEC Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi said here today that the
Chinese government always supports and actively participates in
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) process of trade and
investment liberalization and facilitation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Eighth APEC Ministerial Meeting which opened
today at the Philippine International Convention Center, she said
that the Osaka Action Agenda endorsed last year reflects the
members' political will and commitment toward achieving APEC's
long-term goal of free and open trade and investment in the region
by 2010 for industrialized economies and 2020 for developing
economies.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the objective, Wu said, the Chinese government "has
taken concrete steps" to implement the down payment announced by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Osaka, Japan last year.
</P>
<P>
China lowered tariffs on some 5,000 products by a big margin of
36 percent on April 1 this year; reduced non-tariff measures
concerning over 170 items; allowed foreign capital participation
in Sino-foreign joint venture trading companies in designated
areas on a trial basis and realized convertibility of the Renminbi
currency under current account, she added.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China is now "studying the possibility of
permitting foreign banks to engage in Renminbi currency business".
On the other hand, in light of its level of economic development
and the process of reform and opening-up, China has formulated its
Individual Action Plan and has made unremitting efforts in
participating the process of trade and investment liberalization
and facilitation in APEC.
</P>
<P>
"It is well known that the principle of non-discrimination is
the bedrock of the multilateral trading system as well as the
basis of APEC's continued existence and development, hence must be
observed in the APEC liberalization process", she said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said it is particularly relevant to reiterate this principle
today as the APEC process of trade and investment liberalization
has proceeded to the stage of concrete implementation.
</P>
<P>
"Any action on the pretext of domestic legislation or other
excuses to negate or weaken this principle will run counter to the
spirit of community initiated by APEC and undermine the healthy
development of the APEC process, therefore must be corrected", she
said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the principle of comparability, she said,
voluntarism and non-binding is the feature of all APEC activities,
and all APEC members should do "what they can within their
capabilities".
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, China has to closely watch whether (APEC) members
have implemented the principle of standstill contained in the
Osaka Action Agenda while drafting and implementing their
Individual Action Plans, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Individual Action Plans, however beautifully phrased, will not
carry much practical significance if some members continue to come
up with new protectionist legislation or measures while advocating
trade and investment liberalization", Wu added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Renovates Religious Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Renovation of religious sites
has been an important part of the rapid urban construction in
China's leading industrial and commercial city.
</P>
<P>
Work recently began on the East Shanghai Christian Church, the
largest church built since 1949. The church has a seating capacity
of 1,800.
</P>
<P>
And reconstruction of another church in the city has also been
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has accelerated its drive for urban construction since
the beginning of the 1990s. Throughout the campaign, local
authorities have been successful in their efforts to protect the
legitimate rights and interests of religious people and their
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Town God's Temple, which has been used for other
purposes for nearly 30 years, now has been returned to the hands
of religious groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, authorities have also listed the improvement of
religious sites into their plan for reform of old urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has five religions, including Buddhism, Taoism,
Islam, Catholicism and Christianity. By the end of 1995, the city
had more than 200 religious centers and more than 800,000
religious followers.
</P>
<P>
At present, Shanghai has nine municipal-level religious
organizations, five religious schools and two religious research
and publishing institutions.
</P>
<P>
Each year, Shanghai's religious sites receive 600,000 to
700,000 overseas followers.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong University's
Faculty of Medicine is to run a three-week intensive practical and
lecture course on molecular embryology and transgenic technology,
to meet the increasing demand both in Hong Kong and China.
</P>
<P>
For the basic sciences, this technology has led to an explosion
of new knowledge and understanding of how genes work, of how
embryos develop, of the mechanisms of tumor formation in cancer
and of the underlying causes of inherited disease.
</P>
<P>
In biotechnology, the applications of transgenic technology are
multidisciplinary, of far-reaching significance and have been used
for many fields. They are used, for example, for the development
of new and innovative approaches in medicine, for gene transfer in
treating inherited and acquired diseases, for the use of farm
animals as bioreactors of therapeutic compounds and in
agricultural sciences, for breeding and for engineering disease
resistance in plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
The course slated to start on Sunday is the first of its kind
in Asia, and will provide the unique opportunity to learn the
theory and practice of transgenic technology from an international
team of instructors, the best in the field.

<TEXT>
<P>
In China, "re-education through labor" differs from
"reform-through-labor," which is a means of punishment and
rehabilitation for sentenced criminals.
</P>
<P>
"People subjected to re-education through labor are by no means
criminals, just as the reform centers are not prisons," said Yang.
</P>
<P>
He added that people undergoing re-education through labor
enjoy many of the same legal rights as ordinary Chinese citizens,
though they are under close supervision and must work in reform
centers.
</P>
<P>
There are neither armed guards nor electrified wires and
watchtowers at the Shandong No. 1 Reform Center. Unlike prisoners
who shave heads and wear uniforms, inmates here have crew-cut
haircuts and are well-dressed.
</P>
<P>
Though not allowed to have any cash, they can use coupons to
buy additional dishes at meals, or to purchase goods from small
stores within the center.
</P>
<P>
Usually, the monthly consumption volume for a brigade of nearly
800 inmates goes above 30,000 yuan (about 3,500 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, inmates at the reform center have the
right to communicate freely, and their letters and phone calls are
not monitored.
</P>
<P>
There are several sound-proof phone booths in the reform
center. "Some inmates from better-off families frequently came
here to phone home," a fee collector said.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that there is no limit to the number of visits from
family members that an inmate may have at the center, and married
inmates are permitted conjugal visits with their wives lasting
several days.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we built a three-storey hotel for the inmates'
visitors, which has special rooms for couples," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a first-class couple's room, which is furnished with leather
sofas and a Simmons bed, an inmate from Qingdao, a coastal city in
eastern Shandong, was watching TV with his wife.
</P>
<P>
"I got married in July, 1995 at the reform center," said the
28-year-old man. "My wife visited almost once a month, and each
time I got the permission to stay with her for three to five
days."

<P>
JINAN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- When he was sentenced to two
years of re-education through labor for pandering prostitution,
Wang Dawei, a former ballroom manager, was afraid.
</P>
<P>
"I was terribly scared because all the terrible scenes of life
in prison, which I had seen on movies and television, came to my
mind," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
But his attitude changed after a five-month term at the No.1
Reform Center in east China's Shandong Province, which houses over
2,000 people undergoing re-education through labor.
</P>
<P>
"Policemen here are kind, and the atmosphere is light and
easy. We have a rich and orderly life, just like studying in a
school," he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
The practice of re-education through labor began in China in
1957, in accordance with laws enacted by the National People's
Congress, China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
With a maximum term of three years, it is not a criminal
penalty, but the most serious administrative punishment, on those
who have committed minor offenses or caused social problems.
</P>
<P>
China now has 240 reform centers that hold nearly 160,000
inmates.
</P>
<P>
Most of the inmates have been accused of disrupting the social
order by stealing, cheating, gambling, and gang fighting, while
the rest have participated in other illicit behaviors, such as
repeated prostitution and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Yang Hongsen, head of the Shandong No. 1 Reform Center, said
that most inmates there had been idlers who hated to work before
they went to the center.
</P>
<P>
"To help them to change, we manage them in a paramilitary way,
and try to foster their ability to support themselves through
labor and vocational education," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his fellow inmates are paid to work six hours a day,
five days a week. The vocational education they receive includes
some of the most popular skills in China today, such as computer
operation, cooking, and driving.
</P>
<P>
"We also have at least three hours of other classes every day,
which cover general education in law, social ethics, and current
affairs," Wang said.

BANGKOK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's caretaker Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) informal leadership meeting to be held in the
Philippines, it is learned here today.
</P>
<P>
He will fly to Manila on Sunday and attend the meeting the next
day in Subic Bay and fly back on the same day to greet U.S.
President Bill Clinton, who plans to pay a one-day state visit to
Thailand, from Monday night to Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Banharn is going to represent Thailand at the APEC meeting
because the new prime minister, to be nominated by the
newly-elected House of Representatives and to be approved by the
king, will not have been ready to take office by the time.
</P>
<P>
The New Aspiration Party won the right to form a new government

<HEADLINE> Potential for Domestic Steel Market Huge: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indian economy possesses
substantial potential for the development of the home market for
steel, said a survey recently conducted in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid expansion of infrastructural facilities is an imperative
for this acceleration to materialize. Concern for distributive
justice would require bridging the glaring deficiencies in the
level of development of the country's rural areas, which would in
turn boost the level of rural steel demand from the currently
abysmally low levels," the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The macro-economic dimensions of the Indian economy, thus,
possess substantial potential for absorbing considerably higher
levels of steel consumption before approaching the level of the
developed world.
</P>
<P>
A country, in the stage of development like India, will
continue to consume steel mostly for construction and as an input
into the engineering industry, the survey further said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, given the historically low export base of India's
steel industry, the country has a considerable potential of
expanding export volumes. India can regularly participate in the
world steel market and supply part of the structural deficit of
steel in other developing countries, particularly those in the
Indian ocean region where it enjoys distinct freight advantage.

<P>
HEFEI, November 22 (Xinhua) -- An ancient tomb containing a
large number of cultural relics was recently discovered in Chaohu,
in east China's Anhui Province, during the construction of a
factory.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, 9.2 meters long and seven meters wide, is comprised
of two parts: one for items buried with the dead, and another for
the coffin, in which skeletal remains were found.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists with the provincial archaeology institute said
that the tomb was that of a senior official of the Western Han
Dynasty (206 BC-24).
</P>
<P>
Among the unearthed items were 400 pieces of wooden
lacquerware, including household utensils, a Chinese chess board
and a musical instrument stand.

Archaeologists said that the 70 bronze pieces were intact and
had not rusted.
</P>
<P>
They added that these newly-excavated items would benefit the
study of the history and culture of the Han dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Ramos on Major Tasks of On-going APEC Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said here today that working out the Manila Action Plan,
strengthening economic and technical cooperation and engaging the
private sector in the APEC process are three major tasks of the
ongoing APEC meetings.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the Eighth Ministerial Meeting of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), President Ramos
said: "The first task we set out to do was to prepare the ground
for implementing our agenda of free and open trade and investment
in the Asia-Pacific."
</P>
<P>
"At Osaka last November we completed the commitment-making
phase -- of setting out vision, goals and agenda. And now we move
into the action phase -- of carrying out our individual and
collective initiatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Manila Action Plan will not be "the last word"
on the individual and collective action plans.
</P>
<P>
The action plans will be revised, improved and expanded in the
next few years, Ramos added.
</P>
<P>
He added that through the Manila Action Plan "we begin a
process of continuous and progressive trade and investment
liberalization and facilitation -- a process starting in January
1997 that will continue into the next century" until the APEC
goals of free and open trade and investment are fully achieved.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan for the APEC will be an integration and
summarization of the individual and collective plans for trade and
investment liberalization and facilitation and economic and
technical cooperation among its members.
</P>
<P>
APEC members agreed that they would work toward free trade and
investment in the region, with developed members achieving the
goal of free and open trade and investment no later than 2010 and
developing economies no later than 2020.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Ramos described strengthening economic and
technical cooperation as the second major task for the ongoing
APEC meetings.
</P>
<P>
"Here in the Philippines..., we will gear economic and
technical cooperation specifically to remove structural
impediments that prevent national esaid.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that to engage the private sector as a full member
in the APEC process is the third task for the ministers and APEC
leaders.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the whole object of APEC plans is to make it
possible for Asia-Pacific businessmen to continue doing what comes
naturally to them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Greater participation of business in the APEC process will make
the APEC official trade and investment agenda more relevant to the
needs, wants and hopes of Asia Pacific business people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Eighth Ministerial Meeting of the APEC is making final
preparations for the informal APEC leadership conference scheduled
to take place in Subic on November 25 in Subic.
</P>
<P>
The APEC was formed in 1989 in response to increasing calls for
closer economic cooperation through increased trade and investment
flows among the economies in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Its 18 members include Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Malaysia,
Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore,
Chinese Taipei, Thailand and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China County Becomes Ginseng Production Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Jingyu County in northeast
China's Jilin Province is known to many as "The American Ginseng
Production Base of China."
</P>
<P>
The acreage of ginseng in the county has reached 570,000 sq m,
which account for 23 percent of the country's total and 40 percent
of the entire area of Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the county produces more than 20 tons of dehydrated
American ginseng, over 50 tons of ginseng stems and leaves, and
5,000 kilograms of ginseng seeds.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the county made production records by turning out 2.34
kilograms of ginseng and 237 grams of ginseng seeds per sq m.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the county has also developed more than 20
types of ginseng products and established a medicine production
factory.
</P>
<P>
Jingyu plans to expand its ginseng growing areas to one million
sq m by the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> Fourteen Die in Central American Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen people have been
killed by the tropical storm "Marcos" as it lashed through Central
America, Nicaraguan authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
The storm and the flooding it brought killed five Nicaraguans,
six Hondurans, two Guatemalans and one Costa Rican. It left a
trail of destruction as it passed through the region.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports say it left hundreds of Nicaraguan families
stranded in the northern and western part of the country and about
40,000 Hondurans homeless.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the municipalities on the Atlantic coastline of
Honduras are flooded after water overflowed the banks of the Ulua
and Chamelecon Rivers. Airport authorities closed air traffic.
</P>
<P>
Jose Santos Ortez Pena, commissioner of Honduras' National
Emergency Committee, said the situation is critical for the
country since millions of dollars in losses have been reported in
agriculture and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists predicted possible landslides and enormous
flooding in the areas most affected by the rains.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran government asked its citizens and the
international community for help because nearly the entire
northern part of the country has become a huge lake after 14 days
of continual rainfall.
</P>
<P>
According to a forecast by the U.S. National Meteorology
Center, the 13th tropical depression in the Caribbean had turned
into tropical storm Marcos and was threatening to become a
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
The storm is now heading towards Jamaica at nine kph and
weather forecasters predict that it will pass over the Caribbean
islands, Jamaica, Cuba and Puerto Rico on Saturday.

</P>
<P>
No trading on the DSE took place Thursday and the trading floor

fearing further violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi government is planning to set up a
"national stock exchange (NSE)" here in the capital to provide

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Concerned About Peruvian Plane Acquisitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadoran government
expressed serious concern about the recent acquisition of 12
modern Russian combat planes by Peru just on the eve of the formal
peace negotiations by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of Mig-29 combat planes and the technical
sophistication of the aircraft surpasses by a wide margin the
Peruvian purpose of substituting obsolete air force units or those
lost during the 1995 conflict, the Ecuadoran Foreign Ministry said
in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The communique said this would mean that Peru starts an arms
race with its neighbor, an action that would bring dire
consequences for the region.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian decision contrasts with the determination shown by
Ecuador to strengthen bilateral relations and goes against the
commitments made by both countries in Brasilia in October 1995 to
prevent the risks of an arms race that would imperil the peace
process, the document stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador and Peru, sharing some 1,600 kilometers of borderline,
have long been on odds over their borders. Both countries used to
be colonies of Spain which often altered the borderlines of the
districts for the sake of administration, unwittingly planting a
seed of discord for the two neighbors which won independence from
Spanish colonization in the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
After independence, they had made several attempts to resolve
their border dispute. But all the efforts proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
In 1941, a war broke out between them and ended in defeat of
Ecuador. The decades-long border quiet was shattered again by a
renewed armed border clash in early 1995 which killed hundreds of
lives.
</P>
<P>
With the intervention of the international community, the two
countries signed a truce in Brazil's capital Brasilia in February
1995.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier, Speakers Arrive in Minsk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Parliament Speakers, Yegor Stroyev and Gennady
Seleznyov, arrived in Minsk overnight to mediate the political
crisis in Belarus, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Soon after their arrival, Chernomyrdin was expected to meet
with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko in his residence,
while Stroyev and Seleznyov -- with Belarus parliament chief
Semyon Sharetsky in the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
After the separate meetings, all the five leaders were expected
to hold a joint meeting to discuss how to calm down the building
political crisis in the country, the closest neighbour for Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leaders' Minsk tour has been caused by the
political crisis in the former Soviet republic, where the
president and the parliament have diametrically opposite ideas
about the constitutional amendments to be decided at a nationwide
referendum scheduled for November 24.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has opposed the constitutional amendments,
proposed by Lukashenko, which would enlarge the power of the head
of state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier Thursday in the regional center of Brest,
Lukashenko reiterated that any scrapping of the coming referendum
is out of question.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his opposition insists on scrapping at least
constitutional questions from the referendum. Only under this
condition, they may agree to cancel the impeachement procedure
initiated against Lukashenko.

<HEADLINE> Vranitzky: EMU Should Cover Employment, Taxation Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Federal Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky suggested today that the European Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) should be extended to cover employment and
taxation strategies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the second International Financial and Economic
Forum, Vranitzky said the problem of employment must be as
seriously tackled as that of price stabilization.
</P>
<P>
As a whole, the EMU has a positive impact on the labor market
of the European Union, but there exists the danger of competing in
lowering tax rates, he observed.
</P>
<P>
Low taxation would tend to cause a reduction in expenditures
for research and development, basic infrastructure, education and
social spending, which would in turn result in a higher rate of
unemployment, Vranitzky said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the high unemployment rate in Europe resulted from
structural reasons, he proposed to adopt a strategy to sharpen the
competitive edge of Europe while not hindering its economic and
social progress at the same time.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Jacques Santer, speaking at the
one-day forum designed to make preparations for the December 13-14
conference of the EC in Dublin, stressed that sustained stability
in EMU member countries is the foundation of the Euro, the
would-be single currency in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the EC's full support for a stability plan.
</P>
<P>
Santer emphasized that there should not be any change in the
timetable and conditions for the EMU.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the EC's eastward expansion, the EC president
suggested a stable Russia is vital to the stability in Europe,
saying that Moscow must not be isolated.

<HEADLINE> India to Oppose Educative Talks on Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the forthcoming WTO ministerial meeting in Singapore, he
said, India would resist all efforts to bring in this topic with
the support of developing countries, even if developed countries
resort to arm twisting on other fronts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some developed countries proposed that a global
agreement be signed on investment with developing countries and
they sought to set the "educative process" into motion by
discussing the proposal.
</P>
<P>
India is of the opinion that the time is not ripe for
initiating discussion on this issue, which should be first studied
from the perspective of the "host countries" or importers of
investment, the same official said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the trade and development aspects of the proposed
agreement should be first discussed at the U.N. Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
This argument is pertinent since the recent UNCTAD 9th
conference in South Africa mandated the organization to study all
aspects of investment flows, including the fallout of a
multilateral agreement on this discipline, the official said.
</P>
<P>
There is no need for discussing the issue at several fora and,
therefore, it should be kept out of the WTO, the official
declared.

MINSK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- President Alexander Lukashenko
and the parliament leaders reached a compromise on Friday, evading
a serious political crisis between them over the president-called
referendum, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the result of the planned referendum,

only instead of being enforceable, the report added.
</P>

The two sides also compromised to hold a constitutional
assembly so as to adopt a new basic law.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko had recently called for a referendum to extend his
term for more than two years and widen his powers over all
institutions, which had brought fierce opposition as well as
impeachment appeal from the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The compromise deal was an outcome of the mediation of a
high-level Russian delegation led by Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and two Russian parliament speakers, which arrived in

<HEADLINE> China Objects to Imposition of Uniformity on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that uniformity must
not be imposed as the 18 economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) proceed to implement individual trade
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the Eighth APEC Ministerial Meeting which
opened here this morning, Qian said the APEC has made some
positive progress in trade and investment liberalization this year
with the submission by the 18 APEC members of their Individual
Action Plans (IAP).
</P>
<P>
However, he said, owing to differences in their specific
conditions, starting points and abilities to endure market
openness, it is only natural that their IAPs are varied from one
another.
</P>
<P>
"We must not press ahead in lock-step without differentiating
the specific conditions or areas, still less must we apply here
the principle of reciprocity as applied in negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the IAP of each member should be formulated in
accordance with the two different timetables worked out at the
Bogor meeting in Indonesia and the basic principles set at the
Osaka meeting in Japan, particularly the principle of voluntarism.
</P>
<P>
At the Bogor meeting, the APEC economies agreed to achieve the
goal of free trade and investment in the region with two
timetables: the year 2010 for developed members and 2020 for
developing members.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, uniformity must not be imposed as members
proceed to implement individual liberalization," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the APEC region is quite diversified so it will
be unfeasible in theory and harmful in practice to the economy of
certain members if liberalization is advanced with only one speed
and one modality."
</P>
<P>
Qian said the APEC follows a flexible and graduated approach
which means that common goals are defined collectively and member
economies work toward them in light of their specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
The approach is based on voluntary actions and also features
well coordinated collective actions, he said. It strives to seek
common interests while paying full respect to individual interests
of different members and it is open to economies both from within
and without the region.
</P>
<P>
"This approach, apparently slow in producing progress, has been
proven highly effective," he said, adding that "From the road APEC
has traversed so far, we may conclude that its remarkable
achievement is to a large extent attributable to its adherence to
these principles."
</P>
<P>
Qian said that since the Osaka meeting, the economic
development of the Asia-Pacific region as a whole has managed to
maintain a sound momentum. Economic growth this year is expected
to be around 4 percent for the whole region and 6.4 percent for
East and Southeast Asia, both noticeably higher than the world
average.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Prime Minister Leaves for APEC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien left today for the annual summit of Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum (APEC), which starts this weekend at the
Philippine capital of Manila.
</P>
<P>
"I will review progress with my fellow APEC leaders and discuss
further actions we can take to improve access to markets and to
support further economic growth," he said before departing from
the western coastal city of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, APEC members are expected to present their
individual plans of action, which provide details on each member's
current trade and investment regimes as well as specific measures
for further liberalization.
</P>
<P>
"APEC is central to creating jobs and growth in Canada,"
Chretien said while announcing his trip to Manila last week.
</P>
<P>
Four of Canada's top 10 export markets are APEC members,
government figures show.
</P>
<P>
APEC economies now absorb half of Canada's total exports to
markets outside the United States, and its exports to Asia Pacific
increased by 32 percent to nearly 20 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region has also become an increasingly
important source of foreign direct investment and new technology
for Canada, the government said.
</P>
<P>
"It's vital that Canada ... should maintain the momentum for
trade liberalization," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
Canada takes over APEC chair following the Manila meeting, and
the government is billing 1997 as the year of Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"Our priority will be to help move APEC further along toward
the goal of achieving free and open trade and investment in the
region for developed countries by 2010 and for developing
countries by 2020," he noted.

<HEADLINE> UNIDO Appeals to Germany to Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) Mauricio
Campos today appealed to Germany to abandon its plan to quit the
organization.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued this evening, Campos said Germany had
made great contributions to this international industrial
development agency, and the UNIDO hoped Germany would remain in
the organization.
</P>
<P>
He said Germany's plan to withdraw contradicted its recent
declaration to support the industrial development of other
countries, and would be disappointing to developing countries
which hoped to get support from the UNIDO.
</P>
<P>
Germany planned to pull out of UNIDO because of deep budget
cuts in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
German Development Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger said on
Thursday that shortfalls in his 1997 budget had forced him to opt
for withdrawal, the first time Bonn would quit a U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's annual contribution to UNIDO is 17 million marks (about
11.3 million U.S. dollars.)
</P>
<P>
It was learned that Spranger's withdrawal plan would be
announced by the end of this year and would go into effect the
same time next year.

<HEADLINE> Cuba, U.S. to Examine Immigration Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Cuba and the United States will
determine before the year's end when to meet to assess progress of
the 1994 and 1995 immigration accords, the Cuban Foreign Ministry
said today.
</P>
<P>
"There is always the possibility of different interpretations
about certain aspects, and these meetings are made, precisely, to
see if there is a consensus," the Cuban Foreign Ministry
spokesman, Miguel Alfonso, said.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was signed in September 1994 by the two countries
to stem the flow of Cubans seeking refuge in the United States. It
provided a commitment by the U.S. to grant visas for the migration
of a minimum of 20,000 Cubans annually.
</P>
<P>
In return, Cuba reintroduced border restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Cubans left the country during a period when
travel restrictions were suspended, but the majority of these were
detained by the U.S. authorities and transported to camps in
Guantanamo and the Panama Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
In May 1995 a further immigration accord was signed, stating
that all Cuban refugees intercepted at sea by the U.S. would
thenceforth be repatriated. And the United States agreed to grant
visas to the majority of about 20,000 Cuban refugees detained at
Guantanamo.
</P>
<P>
Asked about U.S. violations to the treaties as the U.S. refused
to repatriate a plane hijacker and an illegal emigrant who had
committed murder, Alfonso said all these problems would be
discussed through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
"It has been decided that all the questions related to these
aspects will be solved through diplomatic channels and not
publicly", he explained.

<HEADLINE> APEC Sculpture Garden Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today unveiled the APEC Sculpture Garden, one of the host
economy's projects to further deepen the spirit of community among
the members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
The unveiling ceremony was held at the quadrangle of the
Philippine International Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
China's donation is a sculpture featuring a child cradled in a
circle which symbolizes "Unity, Peace and Future".
</P>
<P>
Christina Ortega, chief coordinator for APEC'96 special
projects, said the APEC Sculpture Garden will permanently exhibit
the contemporary sculpture pieces from each of the 18 member
economies.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of the sculptures will affirm that art is a
timeless bridge that unites visions," Ortega said. "These are
landmarks that commemorate the spirit of friendship and community
which APEC hopes to achieve."
</P>
<P>
She said that with this year's APEC theme Deepening the Spirit
of Community, the art garden will serve as a commemoration not
only of the Philippines' hosting of the APEC meetings but also the
cooperation shared within the region.
</P>
<P>
The sculpture pieces, which are donations from the APEC member
economies, are made of a variety of materials like stone, steel,
brass, bronze, concrete and wood.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and senior officials attending the eighth APEC
ministerial meeting attended the unveiling ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian International Reserves Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's international
reserves in October dropped by 56 million U.S. dollars to 57.325
billion dollars, as compared with the figure in September, the
Central Bank of Brazil said today.
</P>
<P>
Brazil spent 8.268 billion dollars from January to October
this year to pay interest on its debts to international creditors.
</P>
<P>
Altamir Lopes, head of the bank's economic department, said the
Brazilian government expects the deficit in its current account to
be around three percent at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
That "will evidently depend on the behavior of the balance of
foreign trade," said Lopes.
</P>
<P>
From January to October this year 59.44 billion dollars have
drifted into Brazil, a 10.3 percent increase compared to what was
received in all of 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investments in Brazil during the same period
reached 6.75 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> WWF Calls for Action to Save Sumatra Tiger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) has called for immediate action to save the rare Sumatra
tiger from extinction, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ron Lilley, WWF coordinator on species in Indonesia, said here
Thursday the Sumatra tiger would go down the extinction path in
less than 50 years unless something is done to conserve them.
</P>
<P>
The Sumatra tiger is the only remaining tiger species in
Indonesia. the Bali tiger disappeared in the 1940s and the Java
tiger vanished in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
At present, the population of tigers in the world is estimated
at 7,200. Out of them, there are 4,600 tigers in Bangladesh, 1,850
in Indochina, 210 in Siberia and 50 in South China.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, there are only 500 remaining Sumatra tigers, and
their numbers are declining because their habitat is shrinking and
because of illegal poaching and hunting, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If it's not conserved, let's say it will disappear within 50
years, maybe faster," he said at a presentation about the fate of
the Sumatra tiger.
</P>
<P>
Lilley said the population growth forced conversion of the
tigers' habitat from forest into human settlement areas in Sumatra
has made the task of saving the tigers much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Illegal hunting is also a serious problem and trade in tiger
flesh and its parts is a lucrative business, he said.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Cotton Production Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 21 (Xinhua ) -- Argentina's cotton
production this year increased by 20 percent over last year to
420,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Cotton exports also rose by 33 percent and amounted to 300,000
tons with half sold to Brazil, the Argentine Cotton Chamber said.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributed to enlargement in the
cotton-growing field and a decrease in internal consumption.
</P>
<P>
Farmers grew cotton in larger areas encouraged by better prices
and dry weather that prevented the cultivation of wheat and other
crops.

<HEADLINE> Bill on Income Tax Rates Passed in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Polish House of
Representatives averted a possible resignation of the coaltion
government on Thursday by passing a bill setting income tax rates
for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, to be signed by President Aleksander
Kwasniewski, tax rates for the year will be set at three levels,
20 percent, 32 percent and 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed by 260 votes in favor, 135 against and with
31 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
A similar bill on tax rates for 1997 proposed by the Polish
government failed to get through the parliament on October 24.
</P>
<P>
The government threatened to resign after the parliament
introduced a bill, also on October 24, which divided the income
tax rates into four levels: 17 percent, 20 percent, 33 percent and
45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Polish Senate adopted a revised bill on income taxation on
November 15, the same as the one passed by the House of

<HEADLINE> Black Men Voters Increase in 1996 Election: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Black male voter turnout
increased dramatically in the 1996 election in the United States,
probably in large part because of the Million Man March in October
1995, the National Political Congress of Black Women said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The group estimated that 1.7 million more black men voted in
1996, almost a 53 percent turnout increase from the 1992
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
A study by the group showed a 9.3 percent drop in voter turnout
among black women. It also found a 14.2 percent drop among white
women at the polls and a fall of 9.3 percent among white men.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, black voters increased to 10 percent of the
turnout this year, compared with 8 percent in 1992. Both black men
and women are overwhelmingly Democratic. The black vote went 84
percent for President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The study was based on data from the Census Bureau, the
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate and the Voter
News Service, a partnership of The Associated Press and five TV
networks.
</P>
<P>
The overall turnout at the polls was down sharply. A projection
by the Voter News Service suggested that only 49 percent of the
voting age population cast ballots -- the lowest in 72 years.
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Scruggs, executive director of the Black Leadership
Forum, said the Million Man March and the adoption of its themes by
churches and social organizations may have sparked the increase in
black male turnout.
</P>
<P>
"One of the things about the black male vote is that it was
really very low in 1992," Scruggs said. "So there was room for
growth."

<HEADLINE> Protesters Extend Blockade of Roads in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- French truck drivers today
extended their blockade of main highways across France on the
fourth consecutive day of "Snail Operation" protest for higher
pay, shorter work week and earlier retirement.
</P>
<P>
Traffic was seriously disrupted in nearly all regions of France
except the Paris area, while the bosses of trucking companies and
the truckers began negotiations this afternoon at the Ministry of
Transport.
</P>
<P>
By the evening, blockades were lifted in the Nord-Pas-de Calais
but maintained by truckers in the southeast regions, including
Rhone-Alpes, Bourgogne and Auvergne.
</P>
<P>
Truckers in Haute-Normandie, northern France, demonstrated by
setting up filter glass blockades on the roads and launching
"Snail Operation" on the access highways to the city Rouen, by
driving at extremely slow speed to block the traffic.
</P>
<P>
The access highways to the central city of Lyon were also
blocked today, and truckers had blocked accesses to gas stations
of the Shell and Total oil sellers in many places since the early
morning.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the southern Bouches-du-Rhone near Marseille
was no better, and hundreds of roads outside the southeastern city
of Bordeaux remained blocked throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
The economic loss inflicted by the protest is estimated at tens
of millions of francs.
</P>
<P>
Clashes occurred between striking truckers and non-striking
ones who tried to force their way through the blockades in
Saone-et-Loire, and one striking trucker was slightly injured in
the clash.
</P>
<P>
The National Federation of Truck Drivers announced that if
nothing came out of Thursday's negotiations with the bosses, it
would launch a protest in the Paris region.

VIENNA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- An Austrian Foreign Ministry
official today criticized the United States for vetoing a
resolution recommending incumbent United Nations Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a second term.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Die Presse, an Austrian daily, Foreign

huge debts to the U.N., to assume such an extreme attitude toward
Boutros-Ghali?
</P>
<P>
She added that Washington's accusation against the U.N. chief
of failing to push forward reform within the U.N. was also
"groundless."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the United States, a permanent member of the
U.N. Security Council, cast a negative vote during a secret ballot
on a draft resolution recommending Boutros-Ghali for a second
term.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan and Iran will seek
a compromise on the Caspian Sea issue to pave the way for a joint
agreement on development and boundaries of the sea by the five
littoral nations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries would move closer on the Caspian issue, said
Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev while meeting with the
visiting Iranian Parliament Speaker, Ali Noori, here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the five nations around the Caspian Sea --
Iran, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia -- held
talks on the sea issue at Turkmen Capital Ashkhabad between
November 11-12. Different opinions were expressed on the future
status of the sea.
</P>
<P>
Some countries including Iran proposed dividing the sea into
two parts -- each country holding the area within 45 sea miles of
the coast,and the other part shared by all.
</P>
<P>
In Kazakhstan's opinion, the five countries should designate
ownership of the seabed, but share the whole water area.
</P>
<P>
At the Kazakhstan-Iran meeting, the two leaders also agreed to
develop all-round bilateral cooperation, especially in the fields
of politics and economy.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nepal, India to Finalize Joint Hydro Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India have agreed
to finalize the detailed project report for a joint large scale
hydro project on the Mahakali border river between the two
countries as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued Thursday simultaneously in Kathmandu
and New Delhi said the two countries agreed that the detailed
project report (DPR) for Pancheshwar project, located on Nepal's
western border river with India, should be finalized
expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique came out after a three-day visit to India
by Nepali Water Resources Minister Pashupati Shumsher Rana who
held talks with his Indian counterpart Janeshwar Mishra and other
senior officials during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The Pancheshwar multipurpose hydro project, about 450 km west
of Kathmandu, is a centerpiece of the Nepal-India treaty on the
integrated development of the Mahakali river, which was signed
last February and ratified by the Nepali parliament in September.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier technical report on the project
prepared by the Nepali side, the 10 billion US dollar project
would include a 315-meter-high dam and generate over
6,000-megawatt electricity after its full completion.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indian government, paying more attention to the
irrigation function of the project, has proposed a 280-meter-high
dam and a much lower generating capacity between 2,000 and 4,000
megawatt for the Pancheshwar project, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique also said the two governments agreed to
form a joint Mahakali River Commission as stipulated in the
Mahakali Treaty to monitor the development of the border river.
</P>
<P>
The two side also agreed to constitute a joint team to study
the possibility of navigation on three major rivers flowing from
Nepal to India, it added.

<HEADLINE> Special Fund to Help Teachers in Poor Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A special fund to aid
financially-strapped teachers in poor areas was set up here on
Thursday, today's "People's Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The fund, established by the Chinese Foundation of Prizes for
Secondary, Primary and Nursery Teachers (FPSPNT), is designed to
subsidize teachers working in poverty-stricken areas across the
country, and also to supplement educational development in those
areas.
</P>
<P>
Qian Zhengying, vice-chairperson of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and
FPSPNT director of the board, said that in addition to improving
the quality of teachers in these areas, efforts should be made to
solve problems faced by teachers.
</P>
<P>
China has promised that by the year 2000, it will basically
popularize nine-year compulsory education and eliminate illiteracy
among people born after 1949. Difficulties are evident in rural
areas, especially the remote regions inhabited by 20 percent of
China's 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
Guidelines drafted for the new fund, which has received
donations of 4.5 million yuan (about 542,000 U.S. dollars),
stipulate that a reward system should be established for teachers
in remote and poor regions, excellent teachers should be organized
to give lectures in poor rural areas, and training should be
provided to teachers from poverty-stricken areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin today hosted a meeting of the Consultative Council on
the political crisis in neighboring Belarus, and on the Chechen
issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first of the Consultative Council since it was
set up on October 21, was attended by Federal Council Chairman
Yegor Stroyev, State Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznev, presidential
chief of staff Anatoly Chubais, members of the council, Security
Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin and the Moscow Mayor .
</P>
<P>
Seleznev told reporters that the meeting discussed the draft
agreement between the federal government and rebel Chechnya and
the scheduled Chechen elections on January 27 next year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that all Chechen citizens, including those
in other parts of Russia, could take part in the elections,
Seleznev said.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the meeting only exchanged views and did not
make decisions.
</P>
<P>
The Consultative Council, formed by the prime minister, the
presidential chief of staff and the two speakers of the
parliament's two houses, was created to strengthen cooperation
between executive and legislative bodies in decision-making.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile other reports said Chernomyrdin was to meet Belarus
President Alexander Lukashenko in a last-minute mediation bid to
resolve his row with parliament over a planned referendum aimed at
increasing his powers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Annual Inflation Predicted at 6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's annual inflation
is expected to be 6 to 6.5 percent in 1996, the Central Bureau of
Statistics (BPS) said.
</P>
<P>
"If we can control food prices for the rest of the year, I
think inflation will be between 6 percent to 6.5 percent this
year," BPS head Sugito told local press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's year-on-year inflation as measured by the consumer
price index (CPI) in October stood at 6.56 percent, compared with
6.79 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Month-on-month inflation in October was 0.41 percent, compared
with a decline of 0.04 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in 1995 was 8.6 percent with cumulative inflation for
the first ten months of this year at 5.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said most of the pickup in the inflation rate
since 1995 has been caused by rapidly rising food prices,
particularly rice, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Food accounts for 38 percent of the CPI basket last year and
rice makes up a large proportion of that.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Delays Capobianco Drugs Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur
Athletic Federation (IAAF) acceded to legal pressure on Thursday
and delayed the arbitration hearing for the drugs case of
Australian sprinter Dean Capobianco.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration panel of the IAAF was due to discuss the case
on November 24 but bowed to the requests from the lawyers of both
parties to postpone the hearing to a date which has yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
Capobianco tested positive for the steroid stanozolol, the
drug used by Ben Johnson at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, at a meeting
in the Dutch town of Hengelo last May.
</P>
<P>
He escaped a four-year ban when his national governing body
Athletics Australia cleared him on the grounds that the testing
procedures had been seriously flawed.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF opposed that decision but Capobianco was allowed to
compete at the Atlanta Olympics after their legal advisors said
the federation could be sued successfully in a civil court.
</P>
<P>
The hearing of Italian high jumper Antonella Bevilacqua, who
was also permitted to take part in the Olympics after the Italian
panel judged that her two positive tests for the stimulant
ephedrine in May were an accident, will go ahead as planned on
November 25.

</P>
<P>
The number of workers participating in the program stands at

country's work in insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
The province's total premium collected from old-age insurance
reached 16 billion yuan (about two billion US dollars). 14.5
billion yuan have been used.

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministerial Meeting Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth Ministerial Meeting
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) opened here this
morning to make final preparations for the informal APEC
leadership conference scheduled for November 25 in Subic.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day meeting, ministers from 18 APEC members will
discuss the draft Manila Action Plan for APEC, which was submitted
to them for further discussion by senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The draft Manila action plan will be finally approved by APEC
leaders when they meet in Subic, 80 kilometers north of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan for APEC is an integration and
summarization of the individual and collective plans for trade and
investment liberalization and facilitation, and economic and
technical cooperation among its members.
</P>
<P>
APEC members agreed that they would work toward free trade and
investment in the region, with developed members achieving the
goal of free and open trade and investment no later than 2010 and
developing economies no later than 2020.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the ministers will adopt a draft
declaration on an APEC framework for strengthening economic
cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their meeting, the ministers will issue a joint
statement and hold a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
As the senior officials meeting, which closed here Thursday,
made no decision on admission of new members, the ministers will
further discuss the membership issue.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are also expected to discuss an information
technology agreement proposed by the United States, which calls
for zero tariff on computer and computer-related products by 2000.
</P>
<P>
A proposed APEC business visa, which would give businessmen
free access within the Asia Pacific region, is among other issues
to be discussed by the ministers.
</P>
<P>
APEC was formed in 1989 in response to increasing calls for
closer economic cooperation through increased trade and investment
flows among the economies in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
It groups together Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Malaysia,
Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Chinese
Taipei, Thailand, Singapore and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Large Amount of Cocaine Seized in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian police agents
confiscated 786 kilograms of cocaine hidden in two vehicles and
arrested five foreigners allegedly linked to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
About 675 kilograms of the drug was found in an abandoned car
in the outlying Cumbres section in the southern part of the
capital. But no arrests were made there, Judicial Technical Police
(PTJ) Director Alejandro Moncada Luna said.
</P>
<P>
The PTG believes the cocaine found in the car is connected to a
large cocaine haul confiscated Tuesday in the Tocumen section in
Panama City outskirts.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the 786 kilogram haul was in a truck parked near an
apartment complex in a downtown area where the four foreigners
were arrested. The police source did not mention the nationality
of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
The car was abandoned by a group of people who fled in another
vehicle on noticing the surveillance of the police.
</P>
<P>
The car was allegedly rented by a Colombian national who was
being sought by police, the police director added.
</P>
<P>
The police said the confiscated cocaine was smuggled in from
Colombia, but did not indicate which drug cartels might have been
involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
A Colombian living near the site of the abandoned truck is
being questioned.

<HEADLINE> APEC Business Forum Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Five hundred business
executives from the Asia Pacific region gathered here today for
the first APEC Business forum, which the APEC members hope will
spur more dynamic linkages among the region's business sectors.
</P>
<P>
The business forum and the Eighth Ministerial meeting of the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), which also starts this
morning, are a run-up to the informal APEC leadership Conference
scheduled for November 25 in Subic, 80 kilometers north of Manila.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the forum, Philippine president
Fidel Ramos said that the objective of the forum is to "locate
business in its rightful place within the region--and that place
is shoulder-to-shoulder with our peoples and governments in the
pursuit of the vision we shall all share of the Asia-Pacific
Community."
</P>
<P>
"Before there was APEC, it was business--in the course of doing
business--which linked our various economies into what everyone
now calls a region," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was businessmen of the region who produced and sustained the
economic boom that APEC has now been established to promote, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This year marks an important advance for business
participation in the APEC process. This participation began with
the organization of the APEC Business Advisory Council--and it
will continue in the meeting between the business community and
the APEC leaders a few days from Now," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
APEC leaders are expected to meet the business executives on
November 24.
</P>
<P>
The APEC Business Forum was sponsored by the APEC Business
Advisory Council, which was created by APEC leaders to provide
insight and counsel on their APEC initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated in Manila in May 1996, each APEC member selected
three representatives to the council. It replaced the Pacific
Business Forum.
</P>
<P>
The APEC Business Forum will end on November 24. During the
three-day meeting, the delegates will discuss issues related to
trade, investment and finance.

WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros, today submitted his
resignation letter to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Cisneros said in the letter that he would have liked to have
remained but he has concluded that "I cannot ask to be considered
for service in the next four years."
</P>
<P>
He is the seventh of the 14 Cabinet members to indicate he
won't be staying for Clinton's second term. Clinton won the
presidential re-election on November 5.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's transition officials are sifting through the names of
possible replacements and said the president is expected to have
his new cabinet "ready to go to work" by Clinton's inauguration in
January.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Cisneros said in an interview that he was
leaving because he needed to seek a higher-paying job outside the
government. He has one daughter in college and another in law
school.
</P>
<P>
Cisneros said he informed Clinton of his decision, and the
president "understood the decision I have made."
</P>
<P>
"The president thanks Secretary Cisneros for the outstanding
work he's done at HUD and for being a good friend," said White
House spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Cisneros, 49, will stay as head of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) until the Inauguration Day.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Argues over Selling State Assets To Pay Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A special commission created
by the Costa Rican government has aroused strong controversy over
its recommendation to sell state assets to pay the internal debt.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member commission proposed that authorities sell
telecommunications, power plants, the national liquor
manufacturing plant, and three of the four state banks.
</P>
<P>
The commission is dominated by representatives of neo-liberal
economic sectors and is headed by former Central Bank president
Eduardo Lizano.
</P>
<P>
The country faces a growing internal debt of 700 billion colons
(approximately 3.225 billion U.S. dollars) that could reach a 1000
billion colons next year.
</P>
<P>
Six former presidents of the republic -- Mario Echandi, Jose
Joaquin Trejos, Rodrigo Carazo, Luis Alberto Monge, Oscar Arias,
and Rafael Angel Calderon -- got together two weeks ago and
published a document with several recommendations to solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
One of the proposals was the promulgation of a constitutional
reform to limit the public deficit to one percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP). The proposal to sell state assets was
opposed by former president Rodrigo Carazo.
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurial and political sectors have started a campaign
to sell the state assets, particularly those of the Costa Rican
Electricity Institute, which controls telecommunications and
energy in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
There is a strong movement of resistance to privatization led
by Carazo, who heads the Council for the Defense of
Constitutionality (CDI) which comprises representatives of diverse
sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
The other five former presidents back the idea of selling state
assets to pay the public debt.
</P>
<P>
The president of the National Association of Public Employees
(ANEP), Albino Vargas, one of the most well-known union leaders
in the country, rejected the sale of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of suggestion causes a radicalization of positions
in all the sectors involved in the problem, and of course, the
unions will not sit on their haunches," said Vargas.
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneurial chambers, however, are decidedly in favor
of the privatization.
</P>
<P>
President Jose Maria Figueres invited the former presidents to
discuss this issue in the house of the government.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Figurines Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have uncovered
more than 200 ancient Buddhist figurines found in a pit in
Qingzhou in east China's Shangdong Province, according to "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
Appraised by the country's leading experts last week, the cache
is exceptional in the number of figurines and the workmanship of
the sculptures.
</P>
<P>
"The finding is no doubt listed on top of this year's
archaeological discoveries," said Huang Jinglue, the country's
leading archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
The figurines were made from the 4th century to the 12th
century and were stored in the pit in the 12th century.
</P>
<P>
Made in different materials ranging from stone, clay, iron,
jade, wood and earth, the figurines were invariably beautifully
shaped and exquisitely rendered. Some were color-painted and
gilded.
</P>
<P>
The discovery will yield a load of information on chinese
ancient Buddhist art and the spread of Buddhist art and the spread
of Buddhism in Qingzhou, one of the Buddhist shrines in ancient
China.
</P>
<P>
Fa Xian, the first monk who went on a pilgrimage to India for
Buddhist scriptures lived in Qingzhou for a year in AD 412 to
lecture on Buddhism. The ruin of Longxing Monastery is one of the
best preserved Buddhist monasteries built before the Tang Dynasty
(618-907).
</P>
<P>
The pit was discovered when archaeologists began sorting out
the site of the Longxing Monastery Ruins in Qingzhou.

MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and parliament speakers, Yegor Stroyev and Gennady
Seleznyov, arrived in Minsk overnight to mediate the political
crisis in Belarus, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin is expected to meet with Belarus President
Alexander Lukashenko in his residence, while Stroyev and Seleznyov
meet Belarus parliament chief Semyon Sharetsky in the parliament
building.
</P>
<P>
After the separate meetings, all of them are expected to turn
up for a joint session to discuss how to ease the political crisis
in the country, Russia's closest neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The Belarus president and parliament have diametrically
opposite ideas about the constitutional amendments to be decided
at a nationwide referendum scheduled for November 24.
</P>
<P>
Parliament is opposed to the amendments proposed by Lukashenko,
which would enlarge the power of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier Thursday in the regional center of Brest,
Lukashenko reiterated that any scrapping of the referendum is out
of the question.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition insists on scrapping at least
constitutional questions from the referendum. Only under this
condition would they agree to cancel the impeachment procedure
initiated against Lukashenko.

<HEADLINE> Becker Beats Sampras in ATP Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Boris Becker beat top-ranked Pete
Sampras in straight sets at the ATP World Championship in Hanover,
Germany on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Before 15,000 screaming home fans, Becker won the cliff-hanger
battle 7-6 (12-10), 7-6 (7-4), beating Sampras for the second time
within a month in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"I had goose bumps, I was about to take off and fly into
Nirvana," Becker said. ``I was so emotional, my heart was pumping
so hard."
</P>
<P>
"It was the most amazing feeling I have ever had walking on a
tennis court."
</P>
<P>
"Walking out was like two heavyweights going at it. The
electricity and the atmosphere was awesome," Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
"`He is still the current and undisputed heavyweight champion
of the world, so for me it's always an honor to play him and to be
able to win," Becker said.
</P>
<P>
Becker, the defending champion who is No. 6 in the world,
advanced to the semifinals after bringing his record to 2-0.
Sampras, like Becker a two-time champion in the season-ending
event, dropped to 1-1 but remains alive.
</P>
<P>
He will need to beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov Friday to advance.
Kafelnikov, the French Open champion, won 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) over
Thomas Enqvist, a late replacement for Andre Agassi, who withdrew
from the event because of illness following his loss to Sampras
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dlrs 3.3 million tournament brings together the top eight
players in the world. Two men advance to the semifinals from each
of the two round-robin groups.
</P>
<P>
Becker's win delayed Sampras from becoming the fourth active
player to register 500 career match victories.
</P>
<P>
Becker beat the American in the final of the Eurocard Open last
month in Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, the U.S. Open champion, said it was tough to beat
Becker anywhere, let alone in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the new, Samurai-resembling hairstyle of Goran
Ivanisevic didn't help him against Michael Chang.
</P>
<P>
Chang rallied to outlast Ivanisevic 6-7 (10-8), 7-6 (7-5), 6-1,
but the match was irrelevant for the tournament. Ivanisevic was
already assured of a place in the semifinals, while Chang, last
year's runner-up, had lost both his first two matches and had no
chance of advancing.
</P>
<P>
Chang at least picked up dlrs 100,000 for his win, but he could
lose his No. 2 ranking at the end of the week. The other
semifinalist from that group will be known Friday, when Thomas
Muster plays Richard Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
Agassi was given a hefty fine by the ATP for skipping Monday's
draw and a mandatory round of interviews on the eve of the
tournament. Agassi was in town and practiced later that night.
</P>
<P>
The fine amounted to 5 percent of Agassi's prize money for the
year - about dlrs 50,000, one of the biggest fines in the history
of the ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
It was still less than what Agassi got for playing one match
here - dlrs 80,000.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Coalition Organizes Rally in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of supporters of
the opposition coalition Zajedno (Together) in Serbia rallied in
central Belgrade today to protest against the alleged rigging of
the second round of local elections held in Serbia on November 17.
</P>
<P>
Milan Komnenic, head of the executive board of the opposition
parliamentary Serbian Renewal Movement, urged the supporters to
protest peacefully against what he described as making them
impossible to exercise their free will, but incitement to violence
was often heard from the rally.
</P>
<P>
After some opposition leaders addressed the rally, the
supporters started moving towards the Serbian parliament in the
downtown.
</P>
<P>
The rally was addressed by one of the opposition leaders Zoran
Djindjic, who said that after the leftist coalition's landslide
victory on the Federal parliament, he was very concerned about the
opposition's political future, but now that the opposition had won
the desired number of votes in a number of municipalities, he felt
alive again.
</P>
<P>
The leftist coalition, comprising the Socialist Party of
Serbia, the Yugoslav Left and the Dew Democracy, has won an
absolute majority in the November 3 elections for the Yugoslav
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Djindjic denied the statement made by the opposition
coalition's leaders Wednesday that all opposition deputies to the
Serbian parliament had gone on a hunger strike. "This was the case
only with some members of the coalition's municipal boards," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At the rally, Djindjic invited the supporters, after a few
hours demonstration, to disperse in peace, which they did.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary returns of the local polls, the
opposition has won 79 seats in the Belgrade city assembly, and the
leftist coalition 23. Elections will be repeated in 24 polling
districts.
</P>
<P>
The official results of last Sunday's elections were supposed
to be announced Tuesday evening, but were postponed to a later
date, causing tension between the ruling party and the opposition.

<HEADLINE> US Weapons Being Unloaded For Bosnian Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Unloading of heavy weapons
intended for the Muslim-Croat federation army began today after
the special chartered ship American Condor docked at the Croatian
port of Ploce.
</P>
<P>
The 100-million dollar worth of American weaponry, including 45
M-60 tanks, 80 armored personnel carriers and 15 attack
helicopters, is part of the Washington-sponsored program to
upgrade the federation army.
</P>
<P>
The unloading, which had been delayed for weeks, came after the
Bosnian Muslims agreed the U.S. request to remove Hasan Cengic
from the post of deputy defense minister for his alleged
connections with Iran.
</P>
<P>
European countries fear that the program will make it difficult
to commit Bosnian parties to arms reduction, while the United
States argues that the federation army should be well-armed as a
counterweight to Serb forces in order that NATO-led peacekeeping
forces will leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Besides weapons, the United States has also sent to Bosnia more
than 160 American experts to carry out the training part of the
program, which will also involve military donations to some Middle
East countries.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony in Ploce, James Pardew, the U.S. special envoy in
charge of the "Train and Equip" program, handed over a list of
weapons and equipment to Federation Vice President Ejup Ganic.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Greater Protection of War Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese
representative to the U.N. today called for enforced
implementation of international humanitarian laws and legal
instruments in a bid to better protect victims of armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The representative, Gao Yanping, was speaking at a Legal
Committee meeting discussing the Status of the Protocols
Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions relating to the
protection of victims of armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government accepted the four major conventions soon
after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Gao
said. It has ever since implemented in good faith the relevant
obligations under the conventions. China acceded to the two
additional protocols on September 14, 1983.
</P>
<P>
"Every state has an unshirkable obligation to respect and
comply with the international humanitarian law and, especially,
protect the legitimate rights and interests of the victims of the
war and the civilians," she said.
</P>
<P>
Gao appealed to all the countries that have not yet acceded to
the four Geneva conventions of 1949 and its two Additional
Protocols to become States Parties to these instruments as early
as possible. The conventions have detailed statements regarding
the protection of the prisoners of wars, the wounded soldiers, and
the most vulnerable of the civilians, women and children, in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Gao also noted that the fundamental solution to the protection
of the victims and civilians in time of war lies in the efforts
made by each nation to forsake the use of, and threat to use,
armed force and seek peaceful solutions to the disputes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese representative spoke highly of the contributions
made by the Red Cross and the International Federation of the
Red Crescent Societies in carrying out their humanitarian tasks.
She said that more consideration should be given by the U.N.
committee to enabling the two organizations to further play
their role.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Ruling Party Claims Success at Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Ruling Socialist Party of
Serbia (SPS) leader for Belgrade Branislav Ivkovic said today that
the leftist coalition -- the SPS, the Yugoslav Left (JUL) and New
Democracy -- have won elections in three fourths of municipalities
in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"Local elections have absolutely confirmed the will of voters
in Serbia expressed at the November 3 elections for the Yugoslav
parliament," Ivkovic said.
</P>
<P>
On November 17, the run-off elections for local authorities
were held in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia. The opposition
coalition Zajedno (Together) claimed a landslide victory in
Belgrade and many other cities. Some opposition party leaders even
held a hunger strike Wednesday to protest against the ruling party
SPS for trying to retain power by force.
</P>
<P>
Ivkovic said the leaders of the Zajedno coalition, which is
comprised of the Democratic Party, the Serbian Renewal Movement
and the Civil Alliance of Serbia, were putting huge pressure on
both the voters and members of the electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Vojislav Seselj of the Serbian Radical
Movement, which is a non-allied opposition party, also condemned
today the coalition Zajedno for trying to provoke violence in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The radicals held rallies in Belgrade and other major cities in
Serbia in the past two days. At a press conference, Seselj called
on the people of Serbia to stay calm after the Zajedno leaders
threatened to protest in violent actions.
</P>
<P>
New Democracy spokeswoman Rebeka Srbinovic said her party
condemns in the strongest terms the conduct of some individuals
and parties who urge the taking of power by force and call for
terrorism, bombs and arms.

<HEADLINE> US Suspends Reconnaissance Flights Over Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States suspended
reconnaissance flights over eastern Zaire after Zairian rebels
fired at one of the planes, a Pentagon spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"There are no reconnaissance flights today. We are reassessing
the flights in the light of the incidents yesterday," Kenneth
Bacon told reporters at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The P-3 Orion reconnaissance aircraft was shot at Wednesday
when patroling over a crowd of about 10,000 people gathered in
Goma, capital of the northern province of Kivu, now under the
control of rebels.
</P>
<P>
Eleven crew members reported that they saw approximatedly eight
bursts, which appeared to be anti-aircraft rounds and not small
arms fire.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the plane was flying at 19,000 feet, too high to be
hit. But the type of the guns used wasn't clear, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I would expect flights to resume, but we don't know when,"
Bacon said, adding that the planes, once ordered to re-start the
reconnaissance mission, might fly even higher in the future to
avoid possible anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said 365 U.S. military personnel are now in place in
Central Africa, even though a formal decision has not yet been
made on moving forward with a multinational relief operation to
assist refugees.
</P>
<P>
The number is nearly half the 800 troops the United States had
said it is willing to contribute to such a humanitarian effort.

<HEADLINE> US Air Force Unveils 21st Century Strategic Vision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force today
published its long-term strategic plan for the next century with a
goal of playing the dominant role in space combat and delivering
the decisive force in a land war.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint, "Global Engagement: A Vision for the 21st
Century Air Force," was unveiled today by Gen. Ronald Fogelman,
the Air Force chief of staff, and Air Force Secretary Sheila
Widnall at a ceremony at the National Air and Space Museum to
commemorate the Air Force's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
According to Fogelman, the "global engagement" has six core
competencies. It will have air and space superiority, which will
help defense against ballistic and cruise missiles. And it will
have a global attack capability as it would be possible because
almost one-fourth of Air Force personnel are based overseas at any
given time.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force will also have a rapid global mobility, permitted
through logistical moves including airlifts and aerial refueling;
and have the precision engagement, which can be achieved through
high-technology tracking and weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
He said that information superiority will be another goal which
will be allowed in part via offensive and defensive computer
warfare and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles that can carry and
use weapons and surveillance gear.
</P>
<P>
The sixth goal is to achieve an agile combat support, which
includes rapid re-supplying of troop units and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Widnall called the new vision "a watershed event for the Air
Force."
</P>
<P>
"We are now transitioning from an air force into an air and
space force on an evolutionary path to a space and air force," the
Air Force said in the study.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: D'Estaing Triggers New Debate on Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Former French President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing has started a new debate on the monetary policy
followed by France and Germany to keep a strong franc-mark axis
for achieving the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
D'Estaing suggested Wednesday that the franc be devalued by
8-9 percent in its exchange with the Deutsche mark and the U.S.
dollar to stimulate domestic investment and employment, while the
final objective of realizing the EMU could be attained all the
same.
</P>
<P>
The French franc dropped in its exchange rate with the Deutsche
mark this afternoon in Paris, from 3.3845 francs early this
afternoon to 3.3880 francs at the end of the session, due to the
renewed debate over the franc policy and rumors about the
replacement of Alain Juppe from his prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion by d'Estaing was welcomed within 48 hours by
President of the French National Assembly Philippe Seguin, who
praised d'Estaing for "having directed the road" for France's
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Former Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, who recently sharply
criticized the economic and social policy of Prime Minister Juppe
and warned the latter of a "revolt" by the people of France, said
that he was "delighted to see these ideas go forward."
</P>
<P>
Both Seguin and Pasqua are prominent figures within the ruling
right majority who advocate "another policy" rather than the
present one of President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Juppe.
</P>
<P>
The debate has been started when the French unemployment rate
stands at 12.6 percent, the economic growth remains stagnant,
Euro-scepticism is on the rise, and there is a growing social
discontent about the socio-economic policy of the French
government.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion by d'Estaing and Seguin was immediately retorted
by a rare joint declaration by Juppe and his German counterpart,
Helmut Kohl, who said that "the present parity between the French
franc and the Deutsche mark corresponds to the whole of the
fundamental data of the two national economies."
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac, who is on a visit in Japan, did not
make any statement. But the prime minister's office said that
the Franco-German declaration was elaborated "in coordination with
him (Chirac) from Tokyo."
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Finances Jean Arthuis said that the proposal
by d'Estaing was technically unrealizable, politically
unthinkable, economically dangerous, and could jeopardize the
efforts being made by all European countries to attain the EMU.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Bank of France Jean-Claude Trichet said that
"nothing justifies a devaluation of the franc against the Deutsche
mark" and other major "credible" European currencies.
</P>
<P>
"The Bank of France will pursue, in the framework of the
European strategy of the president of the republic and the
government, and in conformity with the law, a policy of
credibility and monetary stability which has allowed the economy
to benefit from conditions of financing distinctly better than
ever before," he said.
</P>

Some economists said that if the franc was disconnected with
the mark, a wave of speculation could drastically devalue the
French currency and even kick it out of the European Monetary
System as the Italian lira.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Strengthened Disaster Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese representative
Yuan Shaofu today urged the international community to strengthen
relief assistance so as to address natural disasters and severe
humanitarian situation of armed conflicts in many regions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly on coordination of
humanitarian and disaster relief assistance, Yuan noted that
natural disasters and armed conflicts have resulted in a countless
loss of human lives and flow of refugees.
</P>
<P>
There have been repeated appeals to the international community
for emergency assistance. Humanitarian and disaster relief
assistance always remains in a difficult position of demand
exceeding supply. Available fund is very limited. The U.N.
Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA) is confronted with
extremely grave challenges, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under such situation, the UNDHA should continue to coordinate
the efforts of humanitarian and disaster relief agencies, promote
collaboration and cooperation among various agencies, bring into
full play the U.N. system's overall comparative advantage in
providing emergency relief, further strengthen the management of
the central emergency revolving fund and mobilize the developed
countries to make more contributions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that disaster relief assistance should be combined
with development assistance so as to help the governments of
disaster stricken countries to accelerate economic development,
raise the scientific and technical level, and strengthen the
capability of preventing and fighting disasters.
</P>
<P>
Though China has suffered extraordinarily serious floods this
year, it has responded to the U.N. inter-agency appeals and
relevant resolutions by providing disaster relief assistance and
aid to some countries, including the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea, Lebanon, Sierra Leone, Malawi, Zambia, Angola and
Rwanda, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation fully endorses and supports the UN's
efforts to provide special economic assistance to Mozambique,
Somalia, the Sudan, Burundi, Rwanda, Afghanistan and other
countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rebel Incursion of Uganda Put Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The rebel incursion of
southwestern Uganda from Zaire officially ended on November 19,
with the recapturing of Mpondwe border post taken by the Ugandan
rebels a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,500 rebels of the allied Democratic Forces /Army
(ADF/A) in three groups attacked Kasese, southwestern Uganda, on
November 13 and later occupied Mpondwe border post, Karambi
detachment and the 21 battalion in Bwera. All of them are in
Kasese district.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government army concentrated a large number of
troops and weapons at the border areas neighbouring Zaire and
serious battles were fought between November 14 and 17 when the
governmnent army was on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
During the battles, the government army recaptured all the
lost places, killed over 500 rebels and caputred 112 guns and
other weapons and ammunisions and over 30 prisoners of war. A
total of 33 soldiers of the government army were also killed, 59
wounded and a tank damaged.
</P>
<P>
The ADF/A rebels were purely Tabliqs (muslins) who were
fighting a Jihad to restore Islamic rule in Uganda because they
thought Uganda has a spoiled generation and they want to bring it
back to sanity.
</P>
<P>
Their political target is to instal Jamir Mukuru as president
of a Islamic state they are fighting for after ousting the
current Museveni government.
</P>
<P>
They were fighting under the command of Captain Mpoza, a
former government army assistant commander of the 31st battalion
at Kanyabutundu in Bwera, Kasese district.
</P>
<P>
Their military strategy is to capture western Uganda and use
it as a spring board to topple the current government of
Museveni.
</P>
<P>
About 13,000 of ADF/A rebels, most of whom were recruited from
southwestern Uganda this year, were alleged to receive training
at Buhira in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
At present, most of the rebels have been driven back to Zaire
and are expected to attack the Uganda border area again,
according to the local media.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has decided to send a delegation to Zaire to discuss a
possibility of flushing out ADF/A rebels.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, the Ugandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs
organized about 20 diplomats accredited here to tour Bwera town
and Mpondwe border post secured by governmnent army from the
rebels on November 19.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni visited Kasese district
today to assess the situation.

<HEADLINE> Ethics Panel On Gingrich to Stay Intact: Armey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A four-member House ethics
subcommittee responsible for deciding whether to charge Speaker
Newt Gingrich with rules violations should stay intact until its
work is done, House Majority Leader Dick Armey said today.
</P>
<P>
Armey said he wants to work out a bipartisan solution to the
composition of the parent ethics committee. The situation has
been complicated by the investigation of Gingrich and a six-year
term limit for those now on the panel.
</P>
<P>
Normally, Gingrich would choose Republican members of the
committee. But he has delegated that task to Armey to avoid an
obvious conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
The overall ethics committee is divided into two groups: the
four-member investigative panel that is working with an outside
counsel to investigate Gingrich, and six members who would
function as a jury if formal charges of rules violations are
lodged.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the four members of the investigative subcommittee
should continue their work until they come to a resolution," Armey
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said he will meet this week with Democratic leader Dick
Gephardt to agree "in a bipartisan fashion" on the panel's makeup.
</P>
<P>
Armey's spokeswoman, Michele Davis, said the majority leader
has not proposed any specific plan and hasn't decided whether he
favors replacing any current members.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 committee members, seven have served their six-year
tenures, including three on the investigative subcommittee. Armey
said the three nonetheless should remain.
</P>
<P>
The remaining four who also have served six years would
normally leave the committee, but the House could exempt them from
the limitation and let them stay on to decide the Gingrich case.
</P>
<P>
Any new appointees by Armey could lead to conflict-of-interest
allegations, since the majority leader is a close ally of the
speaker.
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee is expected to complete its investigation
before the new Congress convenes in January.

<HEADLINE> UK Car Output Surges to Record Level in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Car production in Britain
surged strongly last month to reach its highest October level in
the industry's history, according to figures released today by the
Office for National Statistic (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that October's car output jumped to 179,963, a
39.3 percent increase over the 129,192 achieved in the same month
last year.
</P>
<P>
Production of vehicles destined for the home market was up
almost 23 percent to 74,700, while output for export markets rose
54 percent to 105,192.
</P>
<P>
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said that the
production increases were spread broadly across the industry, from
major producers to small specialist companies, and that the rises
in part reflected stronger than expected markets in Continental
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Total production for the first 10 months of this year reached
1,407,515, a 10.2 percent year-on-year rise, underlining evidence
that the British motor industry is thriving.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, production of commercial vehicles also rose sharply
last month by 33.7 percent over last October to 22,909.
</P>
<P>
And again, the rise was export driven, with output for domestic
consumption down 4.5 percent and production for overseas markets
leaping 147 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Sends Message to Rafsanjani  (Part 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Observers here noted that Kohl's message is important, which
indicates that Bonn does not want to see the bilateral relations
to be harmed. This is a timely gesture to prevent the
Bonn-Tehran relations from leading to further crisis.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
Wednesday termed the United States and Israel as Iran's
principal enemies. He even did not mention the latest
development in its relations with Germany.
</P>
<P>
"All the enmity against Iran stems from them," he added, "any
enmity toward Iran from any government, group or person compared
with the U.S. and Israel is secondary."
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that Khamenei's statement would serve to
lessen the tension between Tehran and Bonn and reduce the number
of anti-German demonstrations across the nation.
</P>
<P>
An editor at government-owned evening daily Ettella'at said,
"From now on you will see the anti-Bonn slogans fade out. The
Leader has given a signal that the anti-American, anti-Israeli
course of the revolution should not be changed to an anti-German
course."
</P>
<P>
"We have imported something like 30 billion dollars from
Germany since the 1980s. This is not a country that we can do
without," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Half of our factories and workshops would be closed
down if we severed ties with Bonn."
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Iran would not take risk to sever its
ties with Germany. It would lose much more than Germany would if
they break the diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the crisis in the bilateral relations between Iran
and Germany would be soon getting cold. German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel had already made a response to his Iranian
counterpart, saying "Germany did not want its ties with Iran to
be marred."
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the bilateral relations came after the German
Federal Prosecutor charged the Islamic regime, including Iran's
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, President Rafsanjani and the
information minister and foreign minister, accountable for the
Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
Former leader of Iran's outlawed Kurdestan Democratic Party
(KDP) Sadeq Sharafkandi and three of his companions were killed
by unidentified persons at the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin on
September 17, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Mykonos case led to the crisis in relations between
Tehran and Bonn. Anti-German feelings in Iran have taken a new
turn, becoming highly sensitive and alarming.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, some 2,000 Iranians staged an anti-German
demonstration, throwing rotten tomatoes, eggs and stones at the
German Embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 parliament members signed a letter and urged
the Foreign Ministry to reduce the diplomatic ties and economic
relations with its No. 1 Western trading partner of Germany as a
protest against the German accusation.

<HEADLINE> US 30-Year Mortgage Rates Drops to 8-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-year, fixed-rate
mortgages in the U.S. averaged 7.53 percent this week, the lowest
in more than eight months, according to a national survey released
today by the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
It was the lowest level since the rates averaged 7.38 percent
on March 7. Rates had averaged 8.34 percent as recently as on
September 5.
</P>
<P>
The rates was 7.03 percent last January, the lowest this year,
resulting in a strong recovery of the U.S. housing market in the
first half of this year. But the housing market was cooling down
in recent months although the rates have been declining since last
June.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the slow-down resulted from a slow pace of
the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages in the U.S. were as high
as 9.15 percent in January of 1995.
</P>
<P>
On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking for
an average initial rate of 5.48 percent, down from 5.52 percent
last week.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for those refinancing
mortgages, averaged 7.06 percent this week, down from 7.11 percent
a week earlier.
