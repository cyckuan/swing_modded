WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of killings in Los
Angeles during the first two months of the year has increased,
although overall violent crime is dropping in the second largest
city in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Homicides increased nearly 30 percent in Los Angeles in the

<P>
Statistics show there were 140 homicides in Los Angeles through

<P>
Los Angeles reported a 6.6 percent decrease for the first six
months of 1995, according to FBI statistics, the latest national
figures available.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is pursuing an anti-crime initiative that includes
tougher curfew enforcement, expansion of the city's after-school
youth programs and coordination of city and country anti-gang
agencies, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al
Hariri today denied any fear of his country over an international
anti-terrorism summit, which both countries will not attend.
</P>
<P>
The summit is to be held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of
Sharm el Sheikh Wednesday.

attend any conference held for supporting this process."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "the Syrian officials do not worry about
the summit at Sharm el Sheikh and they have announced their

NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Culture and
Social Affair Nyiva Mwendwa said here today that she will direct
her ministry to translate the video cassettes on the Fourth World
Women Conference into Kiswahili language.
</P>
<P>
Minister Nyiva Mwendwa made the statement at a tea-party
prepared by the Chinese Ambassador Chen Pingchu in the Chinese
embassy in honour of Kenyan women representatives to review the
UN women conference held in Beijing last October.
</P>
<P>
At the tea-party, Chinese Ambassador Chen Pingchu gave Nyiva
Mwendwa two cassettes on the conference in English. The minister
said many Kenyan women don't understand English, so it is very
important to translate the cassettes into the national language
of Kiswahili and broadcast them on the government owned
television station.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Kenyan women representatives watched the
video cassettes. They said the video gave them very good memory
in Beijing since most of the tea-party representatives had
attended the women conference.
</P>
<P>
Kenya sent over 400 women delegates to the Fourth World Women
Conference in Beijing.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Electric Light
and Power Authority today urged peasants to keep an eye on people
engaged in pylon larceny in their respective localities.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Afework Shiferaw and Tesfaye Delesa,
heads of the authority's electric line division.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted Afework Shiferaw and Tesfaye
Delasa as saying pylon-thievery is common in the rural parts of
the country and the government spent about 12600 U.S.Dollars in
hard currency on a single pylon.
</P>
<P>
The authority today began a four-day field work at Salo Gora,
near Addis Ababa to replace four pylons broken down by thieves on
Sunday with temporary wood towers.
</P>
<P>
The two heads said the electric line breakage at Salo Gora
would not cause any serious power failure in the capital except
occassional black-outs.
</P>
<P>
They said the stolen pylons are often used for metal works
which include among others beds, winder and door frames as well
as car roof rack.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred of the 12,000 pylons erected across the country
are out of use because of larceny.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese General: Foiled Coup Attempt Had Foreign Backing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Sudanese
Armed Forces said here today that preliminary investigations into
a defunct coup attempt had a foreign backing.
</P>
<P>
General Mohamed Abdul Qadir, the spokesman, said that
motives of the coup attempt were partisan and communal with "a
foreign dimension," adding that the objective was to disrupt
national elections and democratic process.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese general pointed out that those involved in the
coup attempt were five junior officers led by one colonel, three
senior officers as well as a few non-commissioned officers and
men. He did not specify which foreign power was behind the failed
coup.
</P>
<P>
He termed the attempt as an isolated incident, saying that the
mere fact that the participants were only a few people indicated
that the Armed Forces as a whole stood united behind the
government. He revealed that the Sudanese security authorities had
been monitoring the meetings and movements of the officers
involved for a fairly long time.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman further stated that the participants in the
attempt had been arrested, but he did not confirm the arrest of
its leader, Colonel Awad al Karim Awad al Naqar.
</P>
<P>
The operation of rounding up the coup participants was carried
out Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, and the accused Colonel
was engaged in the Staff and Commanders College, after serving in
the military intelligence branch.

<HEADLINE> UK Publishes White Paper on Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind reiterated today that his government was totally opposed
to a "monolithic, centralized, federalist Europe" and that the
European Union should respect each member state's national
identity.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind published a white paper on Europe today which expounded
his government's position on the EU's intergovernmental conference
to be held in Turin, Italy, this month.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary told parliament that Britain might push
for a re-write of the Maastricht Treaty as the original purpose of
its provisions had been changed.
</P>
<P>
He argued, "We do not believe that rules should be changed to
make it easier to override national concerns in areas of
particular sensitivity."
</P>
<P>
He indicated that powers of the European Parliament and the
European Court of Justice at the expense of national parliaments
and governments should be curbed.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind also said that foreign and defense policy must remain
under national control.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor's shadow foreign secretary Robin Cook said
that his party welcomed the positive tone of the white paper and
endorsed it in areas such as defense, security and the enlargement
of the EU.
</P>
<P>
But he argued that the white paper had nothing to offer on
employment, the Social Chapter and significantly, the single
European currency.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the white paper would be debated and put to
vote in the House of Commons on March 21.

<HEADLINE> UK Factory Gate Inflation Hits Lowest for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Factory gate price inflation in
Britain fell to its lowest rate for a year last month, as
industry's raw material costs continued to decline, helped by a
fall in fuel and electricity prices.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office (CSO) said Monday that the
annual rate of producer price inflation fell from 3.8 percent to
3.7 percent in February, the lowest rate for a year.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate for core companies, those outside the
volatile food, drink, petrol and tobacco fell from 3.6 to 3.5
percent last month, the lowest annual rate since January last
year.
</P>
<P>
Producers' input prices, the cost of materials and fuels
purchased by manufacturers, rose 3 percent in the 12 months to
February, compared with 3.9 percent in January and a peak of 12.1
percent in January last year. This is the lowest annual increase
since June 1994.
</P>
<P>
A large fall in the price of electricity to industrial
consumers and lower prices for crude oil meant that input prices
unadjusted for seasonal factors fell 0.9 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
After adjustment for these seasonal factors, input prices
declined by 0.3 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
The figures, which reflect the current slowdown in British
manufacturing, provided further evidence that inflationary
pressures in industry remain under control as manufacturers are
forced to slash prices to clear stocks of unsold goods.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the data vindicated the decision by Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, to cut interest rates by a quarter of a
point to 6 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
But some City economists believe that factory gate prices could
start to accelerate later this year, as manufacturers finally
clear stock and as other European economies pick up.
</P>
<P>
They fear that stronger economic activity might fuel large
rises in the cost of raw materials, which might then feed through
into higher output prices.

<HEADLINE> UK Factory Output Up in Jan., Prospects Still Gloomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Factory output in Britain
recovered slightly in January after the big fall suffered in
December, but the longer-term picture for manufacturers is still
gloomy, official figures released Monday showed.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent
in January, due largely to increased production of textiles,
leather, clothing and food, drink and tobacco, the Central
Statistical Office (CSO) said.
</P>
<P>
But Manufacturing output in the three months to January was 0.6
percent lower than in the previous three months, with declines
across most sectors. This was the second successive fall and the
biggest since August 1993.
</P>
<P>
The CSO data showed that in January total industrial
production, which comprises manufacturing output and the output of
the energy extraction and supply industries, fell by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the three months to January, industrial production was
unchanged compared with the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
The CSO believes that factory output is now stagnating, with
the long-term trend pointing to a zero annual growth rate, the
weakest trend growth rate since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The subdued figures provided further evidence that
manufacturers continued to run down stocks of finished goods built
up in the second half of last year rather than increasing
production.
</P>
<P>
Some City economists believe that output will recover in the
second half of this year, as stock correction comes to an end and
demand picks up.
</P>
<P>
City analysts said the downbeat message from industry
vindicated last Friday's quarter-point cut in base rates. Any
improvement would depend on the gloom lifting in Britain's main
European markets and on stronger consumer demand at home, they
added.

JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- After weeks of bargains, three
rightwing parties -- Likud, Tsomet and Geshe -- have joined hands
today in order to contest in the general elections due to take
place on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The deal, signed at a ceremony in Knesset (parliament) this
afternoon, is expected to be approved by the Likud central
committee next week.
</P>
<P>
Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that it was the
first time since 1977 that the entire nationalist camp was
united behind a single manifesto.
</P>
<P>
David Levy, who left Likud only to rejoin with his newly
formed Geshe Party, said it was the first step toward a
real unity.
</P>
<P>
The impasse was finally broken when Netanyahu personally
mediated between Tsomet leader Rafael Eitan and Levy. He convinced
Eitan to drop his opposition to Levy's nomination as acting prime
minister, should the Likud win the elections.
</P>
<P>
In return, Eitan was assured that Tsomet would receive
preferential treatment in appointments to Knesset committees.
</P>
<P>
Likud Member of Knesset Ariel Sharon, who brokered the deal,
said that the united ticket would help create the momentum to
replace the Labor-led government with a much better one.

WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today signed legislation toughening sanctions against Cuba for
the downing of two U.S. planes piloted by Cuban exiles last month.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told a White House ceremony, "It sends a strong message
to the Cuban government we will not tolerate attacks on United

</P>
<P>
The two planes piloted by Cuban exiles were shot down by the

</P>
<P>
Clinton claimed that the planes "posed no threat to Cuba's
security." He condemned Cuba for "a brutal and cruel act."
</P>
<P>
The bill, signed by Clinton today, is formally called the Cuban
Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act aiming to choke off foreign
investment in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"It will strengthen the embargo in a way that advances the

unified message from the United States to Havana that the yearning
of the Cuban people for freedom must not be denied."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said, "We will stand with those both inside and
outside Cuba who are working for a peaceful transition to freedom
and democracy."
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, the president was surrounded by
members of Congress and relatives of the four pilots who died when
their planes were shot down.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the bill as Cuban-American voters streamed to
the polls in Florida's presidential primary.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Towards Borderless Asia and Beyond (By Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- With a rapid economic growth over
the past two decades, Asian countries have enhanced their economic
cooperation in efforts towards a borderless Asia and beyond.
</P>
<P>
To enhance their economic integration, governments and
corporations in Asia are engaging in tri-and quadrilateral trade
and investment among specific regions in groupings known as growth
triangles and polygons.
</P>
<P>
In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today,
the three most prominent groupings are the Southern Growth
Triangle, the Northern Growth Triangle and the Bimp-Eaga.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Growth Triangle is also known as Sijori
(Singapore-Johor-Riau) and the Northern Growth Triangle covers
Malaysia's four northern states, Thailand's five southern
provinces and north Sumatra in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Bimp-Eaga includes Brunei-Durassalam, Indonesia's Sulawesi
and Irian Java, Malaysia's Sabah and the Philippines' Mindanao
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Other upcoming areas involve the southern provinces of China in
cooperation with ASEAN states and the emerging nations of Vietnam,
Cambodia and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a regional forum on management, President Mitsuo
Sato of the Asian Development Bank, said today that the Asia and
Pacific region has a great potential for greater economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation in Asia will become an important driving
force for accelerating intra-regional trade and investment and
maintain the region's economic dynamism, he added.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the emergence of growth triangles as a form
of regional cooperation is likely to be one of the most
significant and visible economic development in Asia in the 1990s
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the success of regional cooperation in
Asia can not be taken for granted and there are major challenges
to sustain and further promote regional and subregional
cooperation in Asia.
</P>
<P>
First, he said, the Asian and Pacific region comprises many
economies at different stages of development. There are wide
disparities in the levels of income, scales of economic and social
organization and market size.
</P>
<P>
Second, he said, regional cooperation requires strong political
will and a sustained commitment from all the participating
governments.
</P>
<P>
There continues to be a need to implement appropriate policies
relating to tariffs, employment regulations, foreign investment
and foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he added, effective regional and subregional
cooperation requires a strong partnership of the public and
private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The launching of three ASEAN growth areas has further spurred
intra-ASEAN trade.
</P>
<P>
Intra-ASEAN trade rose from 79.1 billion US dollars in 1993 to
117 billion US dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Intra-ASEAN exports reached 81.1 billion US dollars in the
first half of 1995, up 22.7 percent from the same period of 1994.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Absorb More Foreign Direct  Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment
(FDI) in developing countries has more than tripled in the past
five years with the East Asia and Pacific region leading the pack,
the World Bank said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Debt Tables 1996 -- External Finance for
Developing Countries -- released by the World Bank, in 1995 alone
FDI flows to developing countries increased by 13 percent to a
record 90 billion U.S. dollars, becoming the single largest source
of developing financing. Sixty percent of these flows, or some 54
billion dollars, went to East Asia. China received 38 billion
dollars in FDI, while Malaysia followed at almost 6 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign direct investment has surged in East Asia thanks to
rising opportunities, low risks, and a take-off in flows from
overseas Chinese and Korean investors, which accounted for more
than half the total in 1994," said Michael Walton, chief economist
for the World Bank's East Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
For developing countries as a whole, aggregate net resource
flows rose by 11.5 percent to a record 231 billion dollars. East
Asia and Pacific again ranked first with a 27 percent increase in
1995, hitting 108.3 billion dollars, or 47 percent of aggregate
flows to low- and middle-income countries.
</P>
<P>
Private capital flows slowed overall last year, growing at 5
percent as compared to a three-fold increase between 1990 and
1993. They accounted for 72 percent of total resource flows to
developing countries, but stayed at a steady 91 percent in East
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown was mainly attributed to a drop in portfolio
flows, from 84 billion dollars in 1993 to 56 billion dollars last
year, caused by the sharp fall in equity flows, from 46 billion
dollars in 1993 to 22 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Still, the World Bank report predicted, the long-term prospects
for sustained private flows remain bright.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Bulgarian, Romanian Foreign Ministers to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Greece,
Bulgaria and Romania will meet at the weekend in Sofia to discuss
issues concerning the foreign policy of the three Balkan
countries, Bulgaria's Deputy Premier Dontso Konakchev announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day Balkan business conference which opened
Monday in the norther Greek city of Salonika, Konakchev said the
meeting between the three ministers was a continuation of similar
talks that took place in Ioannina, northern Greece, last August.
</P>
<P>
In addition to foreign policy issues, the three will discuss
security and cooperation in the Balkan region, Konakchev said.
</P>
<P>
Konakchev described Greek-Bulgarian relations as
"traditionally good," expressing optimism that there would be
even further improvement.
</P>
<P>
"It is the right time to lay the foundations for a more
dynamic development of relations between the two countries,"
Konakchev said.

<HEADLINE> Stronger Ozone Decline Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) today reported continuing stronger ozone
decline so far this year over the northern mid- and
polar-latitudes, following record low ozone values during the 1995
winter-spring over Siberia and most of the region.
</P>
<P>
The ozone deficiencies, with monthly mean of 20 to 30 percent,
were registered in a few days in mid-January, in mid-February and
continuing until the first 10 days of March.
</P>
<P>
"Extremely low ozone values for a few days exceeding an
unprecedented deficiency of 45 percent for the northern latitudes
were observed," said Dr. Rumen D. Bojkov, Special Advisor to the
WMO secretary-general for ozone and global environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
The lowest ozone values ever reported by the WMO Global Ozone
Observing System stations in the region -- from Greenland-Northern
Atlantic-Scandinavia to the western part of the Russian Arctic --
were for the first time a few units below 200 m atm cm (ozone
unit).
</P>
<P>
During the first three months of the winter-spring season
(December-January-February), the average ozone amount in the
region was about 10 percent below the long-term (1957-1979) mean,
short of 250 m atm cm.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, over North America and the North Pacific,
the ozone values are a few percent less than the long-term
normals. Over the Canadian Sub-Arctic and Eastern Siberia, the
ozone values were only slightly below the normal at 460-500 m atm
cm.
</P>
<P>
Besides meteorological elements, the WMO in particular blamed
increasing satratospheric concentrations of man-made by-products
of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) for the severe ozone destruction
over the northern mid- and polar-latitudes.
</P>
<P>
"One could expect even stronger ozone declines in the coming
years with increasing chlorine and bromine concentrations. In
contrast with Antarctica, these events over the Arctic are lasting
for weeks but not for months," Dr. Bojkov was quoted as saying in
a WMO press release.
</P>
<P>
During the 1995 spring, the ozone hole over the Antarctic area
exceeded 20 million square kilometers at its maximum spread for
over 40 days. The ozone hole appeared again in August and ended in
early December, lasting for an unprecedented long time.
</P>
<P>
Given proper measures taken to reduce the use of ozone
depleting chemicals, said the WMO, not until the second half of the
21st century could one expect the disappearance of the
Antarctic-spring ozone hole phenomena.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer is the protective shield which absorbs and
blocks out most of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation (UV-B) from the
Earth. Its depletion could lead to an increase in UV-B, which
could harm humans, plants and animals and possibly affect
agricultural production and the marine food chain.

<HEADLINE> Germany Calls on Parties to Re-invigorate Cyprus Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A two-member German Foreign
Ministry delegation left here today after a two-day fact-finding
mission which was described by a German official as "not
disappointed."
</P>
<P>
Speaking before departure, Wolfgang Ischinger, Political
Director at the German Foreign Ministry, called on the European
Union (EU) and the parties on the island to seize every
opportunity to re-invigorate the peace process on Cyprus, which
has been divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion.
</P>
<P>
Ischinger, who was accompanied by Friedrich Groning, head of
the Cyprus Desk, arrived in Cyprus Monday to convey to President
Glafcos Clerides a letter by German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel, described by Nicosia as a "very good message."
</P>
<P>
Ischinger said that during their stay they had the opportunity
to meet with representatives from both sides of the divided
island, including President Clerides and Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides.
</P>
<P>
The German official also said that he is leaving "Cyprus with
the conviction that we, I mean the EU and the parties on the
island, must seize every opportunity to re-invigorate the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
"The reason why I came to Cyprus was to find out to what
extend a new opportunity to move forward will be created through
the membership prospective that Cyprus will have with the EU in
the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, on return to Bonn they will report
to the German government for the result of their meetings and will
be discussing their impressions with other EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on German officials' visit, government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides said today that the German government has
repeated its wish to contribute along with other European
countries to the efforts toward a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"We think that the visit had positive results in the sense
that the two German officials were briefed in depth on our
positions regarding a solution and mostly our intentions and
wishes to solve the Cyprus problem and see the unification of the
island as soon as possible," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that German officials' fact-finding
mission in Cyprus was part of the international peace efforts
aimed at seeking a solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> S.African Survivors Relate Massacre Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Two survivors of South
Africa's Kwamakutha massacre in 1987 related chilling accounts
today during the murder trial of the country's former defence
minister Magnus Malan.
</P>
<P>
In the Durban Supreme Court, Malan and his co-accused are
facing 13 counts of murder arising from the massacre of 13 people
in Kwazulu/Natal Province nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen people died on the night of January 21, 1987 when
gunmen, armed with ak-47 rifles, attacked the Kwamakhutha home of
United Democratic Front Leader Victor Ntuli. The victims included
four women and six children, of whom five were under the age of
ten.
</P>
<P>
One of the survivors, Siwela Tusini, 29, described how she and
her husband had lain on the floor while gunmen killed five of
their six children in an adjoining section of their partitioned
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
Anna Khumalo, 34, told the court she cowered in a cupboard and
heard people being shot dead in another section of the house.
</P>
<P>
Khumalo and her four-year-old were knocked into the cupboard
by a victim who was shot dead in attempt to flee.
</P>
<P>
After the attackers left, Khumala and her child remained
hidden in the cupboard until dawn, when the sound of a neighbour
cinvinced her it was safe to come out.
</P>
<P>
Khumalo said most of those present at the massacre scene were
members of the same congregation of the apostolic church and had
attended choir practice on the night of the attack.
</P>
<P>
However, Malan and his co-accused, pleaded not guilty at
yesterday's court appearance.

<HEADLINE> US '95 Current Account Deficit, 2nd Worst in History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. current account
deficit in the broadest measure of U.S. foreign trade amounted to
152.92 billion dollars last year, the second worst performance in
history.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the improvement in its trade balance in the last
quarter of 1995, the 1.1 percent rise from a 1994 deficit of 151.2
billion dollars in the current account deficit reflected a huge
jump in the imbalance in goods and the second straight annual
deficit in investment flows.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for the October-December quarter showed a sharp
22.8 percent improvement, narrowing to 31.07 billion dollars from
a third quarter deficit of 40.25 billion dollars. The fourth
quarter deficit was the lowest quarterly imbalance since a 30.3
billion dollars was recorded in the third quarter of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The small increase in 1995 marked the fourth straight year the
deficit has climbed up, despite the slowing pace of the increase.
</P>
<P>
The current account is considered the broadest gauge of
America's trade performance because it measures not only trade in
goods and services, reflected in the government's monthly report,
but also investment flows and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Before 1982, the United States ran perennial surpluses in its
current account as its earnings on service trade, such as tourism
and consultant fees, were enough to wipe out the deficit in
merchandise trade.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the United States was transformed from the
world's largest creditor nation to the largest debtor country. It
means that foreigners now own more in U.S. assets than Americans
own abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the investment flows also turned negative for the
first time in 1994, subtracting 9.27 billion dollars from the
current account. The investment deficit rose another 23 percent in
1995 to 11.4 billion dollars. Market analysts believed that with
the level of foreign holdings in the United States, that
investment figure could keep the track to worsen in coming years.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the rise in the investment deficit, the
merchandise deficit was up 5 percent to a record 174.47 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Offsetting those deficit increases, America's surplus in
service trade such as tourism rose to 63.05 billion dollars, also
representing an all-time high. The final category, which includes
U.S. foreign aid payments, dropped 15.8 percent to 30.10 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Rainfall Becomes Less Predictable in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Seasonal rains are becoming less
predictable in Indonesia, a weather expert said at an
international symposium on equatorial atmosphere observation held
recently in Bandung, capital of West Java.
</P>
<P>
The expert, Zadrach L. Dupe, said Indonesia now has more
rainfall in the dry season than it used to, while it gets less
rain in the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
The changes may have a great impact on the planting seasons and
affect fisheries and plantations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Years of research on rainfall patterns in Indonesia show that
while the average yearly rainfall in the country has not changed,
the dry season now experiences more rain than before.
</P>
<P>
Dupe urged experts to study the effects of the changing weather
patterns in the country and make recommendations to help farmers.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Egypt at Odds over Anti-Terror Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Egypt today failed
to resolve their differences over an anti-terrorism mechanism to
be set up at Wednesday's Sharm el-Sheikh summit in Egypt, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting this afternoon in Jerusalem, Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres and Asama al-Baz, director of the Egyptian
Presidential Office for Political Affairs, failed to narrow
differences on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from some 31 countries are to attend the
one-day Sharm el-Sheikh anti-terrorism summit, including
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes in the aftermath of the recent wave of Hamas
suicide bombing attacks in Israel in the past two weeks, which
killed 58 people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, following reports of food shortage in the Gaza
Strip, Israel today decided to let emergency supplies into the
area from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Several dozens of trucks with flour and other food products
crossed in to alleviate the situation, which stems from the
Israeli closure imposed since the February 25 Hamas suicide bus
bombing in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The permission was also given to the Palestinians for imports
of medicines from Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat today condemned the Israeli closure,
saying it is inhumane and intended to put pressure on the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Under the slogan "no to closure, yes to peace," thousands of
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip today participated
in Fatah-organized demonstrations against the closure.

<HEADLINE> Top Cypriot Official Expresses Reservations Over  US Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting speaker of the Cyprus
House of Representatives Alexis Galanos today expressed
reservations on a U.S. initiative that 1996 would be the year of
settlement of the 22-year-old Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "If any initiative aims at pressuring the Cypriot
government side, the message is that the margins for concessions
have been exhausted."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a 45-minute meeting with Greek
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, Galanos said, "The Americans
describe 1996 as the year of the Cyprus solution, but we have
reservations because this year the American presidential elections
will take place, and consequently we do not know to what degree
this inititative is influenced by those elections."
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the reservations to the fact that "there has
never been the political will on the part of Ankara; nor has
Turkey made any proposal for a solution of the Cyprus issue."
</P>
<P>
He accused Turkey of "squandering away the time in order to
consolidate the faits accomplis," adding that there had also never
been essential pressure on Turkey to truly lay the groundwork in
the direction of a just and viable solution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Things had not changed to "a degree that such an initiative
should be expected, for the foundations of a solution to exist,"
the top Cypriot official claimed.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, given the developments and Cyprus'
course with respect to the European Union, the settlement of the
Yugoslav issue and the more general matter of security ranging
from the Balkans and former Yugoslavia to the Middle East,
"perhaps indeed there is at this time a new role being undertaken
by the United States, the political will for an effort to be made
for solving the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Galanos told reporters the Cypriot government did not know what
such an initiative would involve, but "what we do know is that the
initiative will be founded on data and documents received by the
Americans from Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides as well as
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash."
</P>
<P>
"The Americans will try to find some common ground on which
they will found general principles covered under the security
umbrella," Galanos said, adding that the U.S. could also place the
issue of demilitarization, on which the Greek Cypriot side
insisted, and the issue of guarantees, of a multinational force
that would replace the foreign troops in Cyprus, as well as the
human rights matter, on the negotiations table.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas today held discussions with two former chief justices to
seek jurisdiction to solve the country's prolonged political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the president, the two former
chief justices were Badrul Haider Chowdhury and Habibur Rahman.
</P>
<P>
The president discussed with them constitutional and legal
procedures regarding the formation of a neutral caretaker
government for resolving the two-year-old political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The former chief justices put forward their views and
suggestions on solutions to the crisis "within the legal
framework," the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Requested by both the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party and
the opposition, President Biswas held separate talks with leaders
of the two sides in his initiative for dialogues to resolving the
country's crisis.
</P>
<P>
Both sides voiced their willingness for the dialogue, but they
stood pat on their previous positions. The ruling party said "no"
to the opposition's demand for the cancellation of the February 15
parliamentary elections which were won by the ruling party with
all opposition parties boycotting.
</P>
<P>
But the president said he would make all his efforts to mediate
and help solve the country's crisis.

MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A State Duma delegation said today
that 90 prisoners of war (POWs) in Bamut, Chechnya, are facing
death at the hands of Chechen rebels, according to reports

<HEADLINE> US Attitude towards Sinn Fein Changes: Adams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams
admitted today that the U.S. government has changed its attitude
towards him and his party since the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
shattered its 17-month cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Dublin, the leader of the IRA's
political wing is flying to the U.S. for St Patrick's Day
(Ireland's national day) celebrations on March 15.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Adams said that last year he was invited
to the celebrations in the U.S. There was a cessation of violence,
and this year there is not, he said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, though U.S. President Bill Clinton has authorized
a visa to Adams, the Sinn Fein leader has been forbidden to raise
funds for his party during his trip in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Adams has not been invited to the St Patrick's Day
celebrations in the White House this year, but Ulster Unionist
Party leader David Trimble will be a guest there.
</P>
<P>
Since the IRA plotted its first bomb explosion in east London
on February 9, Clinton has time and again urged the IRA and Sinn
Fein to restore the cease-fire and stressed that the Northern
Ireland peace process should go ahead.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Refugee Issue No Longer Bilateral: Nepali FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Prakash
Chandra Lahani today said the Bhutanese refugee problem is no
longer a bilateral issue between Bhutan and Nepal but a tripartite
one involving India.
</P>
<P>
He said it was time for the world community to give attention
to the Bhutanese refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
Lahani said those living in refugee camps in eastern Nepal were
all Bhutanese citizens and they should be allowed to return to
their homeland with dignity.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been staying in Nepal
since the Bhutanese authorities began to expel those with the
Nepalese origin six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has asked India, which handles Bhutan's foreign affairs,
to help solve the refugee problem. But India has maintained that
the problem is a bilateral issue between Nepal and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
In the last two months, Indian police intercepted three groups
of Bhutanese refugees at the Nepal-India border when the refugees
crossed the border on a peace march to Bhutan via India.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Involvement In Turkey's Political Assassinations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran has denied the reports that
its diplomats in Turkey were involved in the 1990 assassination of
Turkey's named secularist journalist Cetin Emec, saying the
accusation was "unfounded and disgusting."
</P>
<P>
Annoyed by the reports following the capture of a suspected
murderer last week in Istanbul, Iranian ambassador Muhammed Riza
Bagiri told a press conference here today that they were
"astonished by the recent anti-Iran propaganda in Turkish press."
</P>
<P>
Most leading newspapers here in the past two days have claimed
that the suspect, Irfan Cagrici, went to Iran twice for training
and killed in 1990 the outspoken supporter of secular system Cetin
Emec, then editor-in-chief of daily Hurriyet, with the help of
some Iranian diplomats based in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian ambassador said relations between Turkey and his
country were developing positively and the accusation were
apparently made by "the circles who were against the development."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Iranian diplomats in Turkey have never been
involved in illegal activities under the umbrella of diplomatic
immunity.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul police Monday announced the capture of Cagrici, the
"brain" of Turkey's Islamist radicals believed to be involved in
a series of political murders, bomb attacks and kidnapings.
</P>
<P>
Local media said the breakthrough would bring to light many
unsolved cases concerning the Islamist radicals in Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Foreign Investment to Upsurge in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- In the first two months of 1996,
about 300 million US dollars in portfolio investments came into
the Philippines, almost doubling the amount of investment inflows
in the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that the foreign investment inflows will
continue to come into the Philippines for most of 1996 as a result
of the shift of capital inflows from developed countries into
developing counties like the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A senior economist at the Philippine Central Bank said that
even for the whole of 1996, the foreign investments are expected
to double the amount of 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest date from the Philippine Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), foreign capital infusions into the
country during the first 11 months of 1995 hit 22.2 billion pesos
(890 million US dollars), representing a 95.9 percent leap from
the 11.33 billion pesos (452 million US dollars) recorded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
There was a brief setback of capital inflow in the first months
of 1995 because of the impact of the Mexican crisis. But after the
congressional election in May, foreign investment in the
Philippines began to pick up.
</P>
<P>
The trend kept going up especially after continued improvement
of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
With lower inflation rates, interest rates were naturally on
the low side. Banks and other lending institutions would rather
lend their funds to borrowers, offering these at lower return
rates.
</P>
<P>
In return, lower lending rates attract and encourage
investment, both domestic and foreign.
</P>
<P>
The favorable business climate was further beefed up by the
government's efforts to eliminate barriers and restrictions in the
entry of foreign capitals. The amendments to the Foreign
Investment Act further boosted foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
This coupled with the liberalization of the banking industry.
The entry of 10 big foreign banks encouraged more foreigners to
set up shops and factories in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Further more, investment accords reached between the
Philippines and other countries boosted overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Official Interviewed By CNN Journalist (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reply to a question about whether negotiations between ARATS
and the Straits Exchange Foundation will resume in the near
future, Tang said that the purpose of his trip to Taipei last May
was to hold the second round of Wang-Koo Talks. It had been two
years since the mainland put forth this proposal, and until last
May, the Taiwan side had to agree that he and his counterpart make
arrangements for the second round of Wang-Koo Talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Taiwan authorities had to agree to hold the
talks, he said, but they went to the United States in an attempt
to create "two Chinas", obstructing the holding of the talks.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks will require a good political atmosphere,
which is to say, the Taiwan authorities should return to the "one
China" principle and not try to create "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
As for a timetable for reunification of the motherland, Tang
said that it needs a process. In the coming five years, China will
regain sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao in accordance with the
principle of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Laws, he
noted, adding that the Taiwan question will then be placed
prominently in front of all Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the present "election" in Taiwan, Tang said: "We
are willing to see the people of Taiwan enjoy what they think
their democratic rights according to their own choice. But no
matter what the outcome of the 'election', the status of Taiwan as
part of China cannot change," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that the Taiwan authorities will return to
the "one China" principle and conduct economic exchanges and
cooperation in various fields and even political negotiations with
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
This will be beneficial to the settlement of the Taiwan
question and also to peace and stability in Asia-Pacific region
and the rest of the world, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges Parliament to Ratify CE Basic Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today urged the parliament to ratify "without delay" the four
basic Council of Europe (CE) conventions signed by Russia, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Europe will not be fully-fledged without Russia and Russia
cannot remain outside the European unity," Yeltsin told the
parliament's permanent delegation to the CE Parliamentary Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it had not been easy for Russia to join the CE.
"Russia has won the right to be a member of the Council of Europe
by the level of its democratization...by its serious efforts to
promote human rights and the freedom of economic reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed the hope that the Russian parliament
would ratify the four basic CE conventions on human rights, ethnic
minorities, local self-rule and the prevention of torture.
</P>
<P>
The CE admitted Russia in January.

When asked what measures should be taken to end tensions
between the two sides of the straits, he replied that the
mainland's attitude is very clear and requires the Taiwan
authorities to return to the "one China" principle and not try to
create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Only by doing so, can ARATS and the Straits Exchange Foundation
have a favorable atmosphere for negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that in 1991 an official from the Taiwan Affairs
Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
delivered an important speech in which he proposed that issues of
common concern be discussed and that issues that Taiwan is
concerned about under the "one China" principle be discussed as
well.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, on January 30 of last year, President Jiang
Zemin reiterated this proposal in an important speech, and added
that, "As far as I know, the issues that Taiwan is concerned about
include so-called international living space, but the Taiwan side
has refused or delayed negotiations, and has tried to create "two
Chinas" worldwide."
</P>
<P>
As to whether some US congressmen are trying to get Lee to
visit the US again this year, he said that this will by no means
be beneficial to the improvement of relations across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan question is the most important question in
Sino-U.S. relations, he said, expressing hope that the United
States will adhere to the three joint communiques signed by the
two countries, strictly abiding by the "one China" principle and
the principle that Taiwan is a part of China, and that it will not
develop official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that China's affairs should be solved by the
Chinese people themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to US interference in China's internal affairs
in any way or for any reason," he said.

</P>
<P>
The two agreements, one on avoidance of double taxation and the

<HEADLINE> IRA Claims Responsibility for 3rd Bomb Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
announced today that it had plotted the bomb explosion in London
on the early morning of March 9, reported BBC TV this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The IRA said in a statement that the Semtex bomb planted in a
litter bin outside a cemetery close to a building of the Defense
Ministry in west London "was one of ours."
</P>
<P>
This was the third bomb explosion plotted by the IRA since the
republican paramilitary group declared an end to its 17-month
cease-fire on February 9.
</P>
<P>
It was very lucky that no one was hurt in the latest explosion.
In the first two explosions, three were killed, including one IRA
member, and more than 100 wounded.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The principle of peaceful
reunification of the motherland remains unchanged and safeguarding
state sovereignty and territorial integrity is of paramount
importance, said Tang Shubei, vice-president of the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The remark came during an interview last week by columnist
Thomas L. Friedman and by Patrick E. Tyler chief reporter of the
Beijing Bureau of the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the past several years have witnessed
considerable developments in relations across the Taiwan
Straits. "Since 1993 when the Wang-Koo Talks were held in
Singapore, we have been preparing for the second round of talks so
as to further develop relations across the straits."
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he said, last June, Lee Teng-hui paid a
so-called private visit to the United States and delivered a
political speech, making the steady development of relations
across the straits impossible and damaging the political
atmosphere of talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is true that recently the Taiwan
authorities assumed the posture of relaxation. "However, they
still tried to create 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan' in
the international arena while purchasing arms," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"China hopes for peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question
because people across the straits are brothers. If Taiwan becomes
independent and foreign forces interfere in China's internal
affairs, China will use any means, including military action, to
safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang explained that Taiwan has been part of China since ancient
times by referring to many historical events. "This fact will
never be allowed to change," he stressed.

<P>
Tang said that during Lee's trip to the US last year, he made a
political speech saying that "China has already separated", that
"there is no Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan and there are 'two
Chinas' in the world".
</P>
<P>
Lee said he hopes that the "Republic of China" will be
recognized internationally and that he was willing to spend one
billion US dollars to get Taiwan into the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tang pointed out, the UN has already recognized the
People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative
of China and Lee's advocating the creation of "two Chinas" in the
UN demonstrates that he does not want reunification, but "Taiwan
independence" and "two Chinas".
</P>
<P>
Tang said that, "It is our hope that the Taiwan authorities
will practically, and not verbally, stick to the 'one China'
principle, and not create 'two Chinas' and not attempt to join the
UN and other international organizations that only sovereign
states can join."
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on Lee's recent remarks on holding
peaceful talks, Tang pointed out that, on January 30 of last year,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin made a very important proposal that,
as a first step, the two sides across the Taiwan Straits hold
talks on formally ending the state of hostility in accordance with
the "one China" principle and reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Lee, however, came up with some impractical reasons for
refusing Jiang's proposal, and then paid a visit to the United
States and tried his best to advertise the "two Chinas" and "one
China, one Taiwan" ideas.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Tang said, some leaders of the Taiwan authorities
have created tensions across the Taiwan Straits, and the key to
ending the tension is in whether the Taiwan authorities will
really return to the "one-China" position.
</P>
<P>
Only by doing so, he said is it possible to hold talks to end
the state of hostility.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether it is possible to have exchanges or hold
talks at a third location, Tang said that the proposal for the
exchange of visits by the leaders of the two sides was put forward
by President Jiang Zemin last January. Unless Lee Teng-hui and the
Taiwan authorities return to the "one-China" principle, the
exchange of visits has no practical meaning at present.

<HEADLINE> OIC AMG Meeting on Bosnia Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A two-day meeting organized by
an OIC'S aid agency on Bosnia ended here today with the adoption
of a declaration calling for international efforts towards the
rehabilitation of the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by the Assistance Mobilization Group
(AMG) of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) reviewed the
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
It agreed that the AMG had an important contribution to make to
the effective implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The AMG meeting was attended by representatives from Malaysia,
Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Kuwait, Jordan, Guinea, Morocco, Pakistan,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Bosnia Herzegovina and the OIC.
</P>
<P>
It reaffirmed its complete solidarity with the government and
people of Bosnia-Herzegovina in their efforts to establish a just
peace and to safeguard security, sovereignty, political
independence and territorial integrity of their multi-ethnic,
multi-religious and multi-cultural country, said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
It urged OIC member states as well as the international
community to actively contribute towards the rehabilitation and
reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
It emphasized the importance of developing public and private
sector partnership with Bosnia-Herzegovina in economic,
commercial, financial, technical, cultural and other areas so as
to strengthen bilateral ties of friendship and cooperation, the
declaration added.
</P>
<P>
The declaration promised full support for the action of
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the International Court of Justice against
former Yugoslavia for violating the Genocide Convention and
emphasized importance it attached to the work of the International
War Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The meeting emphasized that credible deterrence capability of
the armed forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina was an essential element in
establishing a military balance for ensuring a stable regional
security environment.
</P>
<P>
It reaffirmed that OIC states, individually and collectively,
will contribute to international efforts in implementing the Peace
Agreement and to bring about the desired military balance and
stability in the region, while maintaining their own capacity to
provide the necessary assistance within the framework of the
Dayton Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We have entered the second phase of assistance to
Bosnia-Herzegovina and we would seek assistance to the country
both individually and collectively," said Pakistan Foreign Office
Secretary Najmuddin Sheikh after the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Federation Police Enter Sarajevo Suburb of Ilidza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Muslim-Croat federation police
today entered Ilidza, the fourth of five Serb-held Sarajevo
suburbs to be handed over to federation control under the Bosnia
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The federation police, comprising 51 Muslims, 26 Serbs and 13
Croats and reflecting the pre-war ethnic makeup, entered the
lawless and deserted district this morning, followed by hundreds
of Muslims who were driven out of the sector by Serbs nearly four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Ilidza, the most populous of the five affected suburbs, used to
have 200,000 Serb residents. Now only about 2,000 elderly people
remain in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The mass exodus of Serbs was a heavy blow to the peace
agreement, which was signed in Paris last December and aims to
recreate a multi-ethnic Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Sarajevo said Serb police on Monday set fire to
the police station, fired pistols and hurled hand grenades. Many
houses in Ilidza have also been looted and burned, watched by
troops of NATO's peace Implementation Force (IFOR) whose mandate
did not encourage them to intervene.
</P>
<P>
To avoid a repetition of such incidents in Grbavica, the fifth
and last Serb sector to be transferred to Muslim-Croat control on
March 19, IFOR said it would step up its presence and patrols in
the district.

CAIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros Ghali arrived here today to take part in the international
anti-terrorism conference due to be held in the Egyptian Red Sea
resort of Sharm al Sheikh Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an arrival statement at the Cairo airport, Ghali said the

foremost among which is to contain and confront terrorism on the
regional and international levels, as well as to support peace in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
On the role of the United Nations at the Sharm al Sheikh
summit, Ghali said the international organization is only a
"means" which is used by the member states for serving the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Regarding terrorism, Ghali said the U.N. General Assembly
previously issued a number of resolutions regarding international
terrorism and is ready, if authorized, to adopt necessary measures
to lay down a framework for countering terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question on Iraq's negotiations with the U.N.,
Ghali said talks are currently under way in New York on the
implementation of resolution 986 on "oil for food" and the partial
lifting of the sanctions against Iraq. He pointed out that these
negotiations might last a few more weeks, expressing hope that
they attain the cherished success.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary General is scheduled to proceed to Sharm al
Sheikh later in the day to participate in the peacemakers
conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
Conditions in China at the turn of the century have become a
hot topic at the CPPCC session.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC National Committee Vice-chairwoman Qian Zhengying said
development of socialist culture and ideology is the key to
achieving national prosperity and stability in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Confronted with a multitude of ideologies, Chinese people's
spirit of cohesiveness, self-confidence, self-reliance and
diligence should be expanded to build a wealthy, democratic,
civilized and modern socialist China, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC members from scientific circles said that, in the
country's long-range scientific development program, emphasis
should be put on comparisons between the status of science and
technology in China and that in other countries, in addition to
comparisons with the past.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhensheng, vice-chairman of the China Association for
Science and Technology, called for enriching Chinese people with
scientific knowledge as a bulwark against superstition and
ignorance.
</P>
<P>
Hearing speeches by CPPCC members, government ministers said
that suggestions put forward by the CPPCC members are more
valuable this year than those last year.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the suggestions have come out of
thorough-going investigations and studies.
</P>
<P>
Since the Third Session of the CPPCC National Committee last
year, CPPCC members have conducted thorough research on some key
issues relating to the country's economic and ideological
developments, and other hot topics, such as narrowing regional
disparities, investing more in agriculture, saving limited
resources, employment, social welfare, farmers' burdens, and a
change of the economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC members seem to be happy and proud that Hong Kong and
Macao are coming back to the motherland and that China is moving
along a socialist road with growing prosperity.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Austria's new government -- the
fifth formed by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky -- was sworn into
office at the presidential palace Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Twelve ministers of the previous government remain in the new
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The new government has slimmed down to 14 ministries, two less
than the former government, in an effort to tighten government
spending.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Economy and Communications has been
merged with the Ministry of Scientific Research and the Arts, and
the Ministry of Youth and Family has been combined with the
Ministry of Environment.
</P>
<P>
Four state secretary posts have been reduced to two.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky took 83 days to form the new cabinet after he
received official authorization from President Thomas Klestil.
</P>
<P>
Klestil wished the new cabinet success at the swearing-in
ceremony, but it faces tough tasks ahead. Even as they arrived for

<HEADLINE> ARATS Official Interviewed By CNN Journalist (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has always
pursued a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question, but does not
rule out the use of force, said Tang Shubei, vice-president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).
</P>
<P>
the remark came during an interview by Andrea Koppel, CNN
bureau chief in Beijing, last week.
</P>
<P>
Tang explained that last May he went to Taibei to hold the
second round of Wang-Koo talks and reached an agreement with the
Taiwan side.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, it was unfortunate that Lee Teng-hui visited the
United States and created the "two Chinas" and "one China, one
Taiwan" ideas, resulting in tensions across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"As always, we hope for a settlement of the Taiwan question by
peaceful means, but we cannot tolerate Taiwan's practice of "two
Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan", Tang emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"All our actions are meant precisely to show the determination
and ability of the Chinese government and people to safeguard
state sovereignty and territorial integrity," he added.
</P>
<P>
There are two necessary conditions for peaceful settlement of
the Taiwan question, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
First, that Taiwan refrain from independence and separation;
and second, that foreign governments not interfere in China's
internal affairs and allow the Chinese people to settle the
question on their own, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed the hope that foreign governments will stick to
the "one China" principle and not interfere in the country's
internal affairs, and that, "the Taiwan authorities will return to
the 'one China' position. Only by doing so, is it possible to
settle the Taiwan question by peaceful means".

ISLAMABAD, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
allocated three billion rupees (about 85 million US dollars) for
the renovation of the Karakorum Highway in the country's northern
areas, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over a special session at the Pakistan National
Highway Authority (NHA) headquarters, NHA Chairman Shahid Aziz
Siddiqui said the project would be a milestone in the uplifting of
the country's economy.
</P>

Pakistan, China, Kazakhstan and Kirgizstan.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government is giving top priority to the
renovation of the Karakorum Highway, the official stressed.

He said Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto called for an
early start of the trade-traffic among the four countries, which,
he said, would lay strong economic foundations for Pakistan.

The Karakorum Highway, built by Chinese engineers and workers
from 1966 to 1978, mainly passes through mountainous areas with
complicated geological structure. The highway needs repairing
because of landslides and other problems.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Monopolizes World Arms Market, Article Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- An article in today's Minju
Choson newspaper has accused the United States of monopolizing the
global arms market and damaging world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The article said that to maintain their arms production and
profits, imperialist powers are competing for a bigger share of
the arms market, which has shrunk with the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Among the imperialists, the U.S. attaches the most importance
to the arms market in order to strengthen its military control
over other countries and realize its desire to dominate the world,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
It said the U.S. supplies weapons to some countries under the
pretense of military "assistance". On the pretext that this has
upset the military balance, the U.S. then provides weapons to
other countries, thus aggravating the military confrontation
between these countries and destabilizing the situation.
</P>
<P>
Later, on the grounds of "avoiding disputes", the U.S. carries
out direct military intervention, trying to exert its influence on
these countries, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. earned more than 8 billion dollars in profits from
arms sales each year, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the U.S. exported as much as 33.2 billion dollars
worth of military supplies in 1993, accounting for 73 percent of
the total volume of world trade in military supplies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A project to build a railway
ferry on the Bohai Sea connecting two emerging economic
powerhouses is urged to be incorporated into China's Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The proposed railway ferry is to run from Dalian, a port city
in Liaoning province, northeast China, to Yantai, another port
city in Shandong province, east China.
</P>
<P>
It will cut down to 10 percent of their present distance of
1,700-plus km through railway on land.
</P>
<P>
Both cities are rising economic centers on the Bohai Bay rim.
</P>
<P>
The project is suggested in the No.1 proposal put forward by 11
members of China's top advisory body having its annual session
here.
</P>
<P>
The railway ferry will ease the long-standing railway transport
bottleneck from northeast China to east China, according to these
members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
They suggest the project be included in China's Ninth Five-Year
Plan, the outline of which is being examined by the country's top
legislature, the National People's Congress, which is also in
session here.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the ministries of railways and communications
and the State Planning Commission (SPC) have held discussions with
the proponents of the project, briefing them on plans under
deliberation for the project.
</P>
<P>
Li Duanshen, director of SPC's energy and transportation
department, said the commission is planning to include the ferry
project in the Ninth Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to build a 2,200-km-long
transport passage along the coastline from Harbin, capital city of
northeast China's Heilongjiang province, to an undecided location
in east China's Jiangsu province, Li told them. The project is
expected to cost 30 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A part of the project, the railway ferry from Dalian to Yantai,
requires an investment of 3.3 billion yuan, according to the
director.
</P>
<P>
He said building of the ferry should be planned as part of the
transport passage along the coastline.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today signed a decree cutting staff numbers in several government
departments, including the Foreign Ministry and his own Committee
on Information Policy, the Presidential Press Service said.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, a limit of 2,762 employees has been set for
the Foreign Ministry's central staff. It is unclear how many
people will have to leave the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Information Policy Committee will have a
maximum of 102 employees, while the State Committee for Military
and Technical Policy will have 207 staffers at the most.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in the Kremlin this morning with the Russian
parliament's permanent delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of
the Council of Europe, Yeltsin said that "...the Foreign Ministry
will coordinate all of Russia's moves in the world arena."
</P>
<P>
He admitted that "there is some lack of coordination in
pursuing a single foreign policy," which resulted in the removal
of former Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev at the beginning of this
year.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has called on
African governments to draw plans designed to eradicate
poverty and promote sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Science, Technology and Higher
Education, Jackson Makweta, made the call in Arusha on Monday
when opening a five-day workshop on "Prevention and Management of
University Crisis under Changing Socio-Economic and Political
Environment".
</P>
<P>
The minister cited growing debts and poverty as Africa's main
challenges.

</P>
<P>
"Unless a way is found to ease Africa's debt burden, the
continent shall remain poor," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Makweta said other causes of the crisis included declining
productivity, poor technology, diseases, drought, falling prices

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were
killed and four others wounded today in a fierce fighting between
two factions, both loyal to Somali warlord General Mohamed Farah
Aidid, at the green line dividing the war torn city.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness said the shootout began when a truck from North
Mogadishu, loaded with wheat flour, was trying to cross the
Ali-Kamin Junction to South Mogadishu, in an attempt to escape
the tax charges imposed by General Aidid's Militia
Administration.
</P>
<P>
South Mogadishu has been under the control of General Aidid
against the city's northern part under his arch rival Ali Mahdi
Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Some militiamen from General Aidid's government were
accompanying the food transporting vehicle at the time in order
to save it from paying the tax fare, said the eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
The quarrel provoked the use of anti-aircraft missiles, heavy
and small machine guns, and rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
Four donkeys at a nearby well were killed and a stock of grass
reserve burned to ashes. Neighboring markets were also affected
by the shootout which brought nearby stalls and shops to an
immediate close.
</P>
<P>
Ali-Kamin junction was closed as well with the tax collection
operation hindered for more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
Clan elders and senior officials from Aidid's government
rushed to the area of the incident after the heavy shootout
ceased. However, the situation remains tense in the area although
the warring militiamen have been separated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, North Mogadishu militiamen supporting Ali Mahdi
Mohamed are spotted taking defensive positions along the green
line in case the fighting spreads to the area uner their control.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in four days that factions of General
Aidid have fought among themselves over one another's particular
interests.
</P>
<P>
Four days ago, they fought over the control of the dusty
airfield of K-50, killing four people and injuring seven others.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Radio South Mogadishu of General Aidid
continues to be out of air for a seventh day.
</P>
<P>
This took place after a dispute had erupted between Abdi Haji
Gobdon, Director General of Aidid's Information Ministry, and
Elmi Kulan Gedi, a close relative of Aidid.
</P>
<P>
According to some radio broadcasters, Gedi is trying to seize
the control of the radio station, while Gobdon holds a
considerable number of militiamen around the radio station.
</P>
<P>
They said Aidid himself is supporting Gedi and wants Gobdon to
shift responsibility to Gedi.
</P>
<P>
The radio has a revenue from its advertisement programs which
is said to be the root cause of the dispute between Gobdon and
Gedi.
</P>
<P>
The radio station which was neutralized by the U.S. and U.N.
forces on June 12, 1993 was later rehabilitated by General Aidid.

old image and become Asia's best airline by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The airline has posted an accumulated loss of 10.7 billion

He said the money would ensure the success of a
three-billion-US-dollar medium-term re-fleeting program, which is
supported by the US Export-Import Bank and financial houses in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Garcia said PAL was investing a total of four billion US
dollars for its modernization program, which involves the
acquisition of some 36 new aircraft. The airline now has 47
aircraft.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's IC Industry Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the leading industrial
city of China, manufactured silicon chips totalling more than 60
million sq cm in 1995, 50 times that of 1991.
</P>
<P>
The journal "People's Posts and Telecommunications" said that
in the meantime the city made more than 38 million IC (integrated
circuit) chips, which is a four-fold increase over the beginning
of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Silicon Material Plant, China's biggest silicon
product supplier, doubled both its output of single-crystal
silicon and silicon chips last year. The plant plans to
manufacture 35 tons of single-crystal silicon this year, and
export more than 10,000 chips every month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city's circuit design capability has been
greatly improved, along with the Canada-based Northern Telecom
(NT)'s deepening involvement in this field. Building an advanced
electronics laboratory and an IC test workshop there, a joint
venture involving NT investment will develop into China's largest
IC designer with sales volume reaching 200 million US
dollars-worth by the year 2000, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Belling Microelectronics Co., Ltd, a Sino-Belgian
joint venture, generated 24.8 million IC chips, as well as sales
worth 426 million yuan, last year. The venture has imported the
production technology of 1.2 micron large-scale ICs, aiming at
further strengthening its leading position on China's booming IC
market.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the US and European IC giants, Japan's
Matsushita will open a joint venture specializing in
semi-conductors in the IC processing zone this year.

<HEADLINE> Legislative Powers to Promote Economic Progress in SEZs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Empowering Shantou and Zhuhai
with legislative powers will promote reform and opening-up and
economic progress in the two special economic zones (SEZs), said
Liang Guangda, and Wu Bo, officials from the two cities today.
</P>
<P>
The NPC annual session distributed a draft bill today, on
authorizing the people's congresses and their standing committees
of Shantou and Zhuhai the powers for local legislature, and their
city governments to issue government regulations.
</P>
<P>
If they are granted the powers, China's five SEZs namely
Shenzhen, Hainan, Xiamen, Shantou and Zhuhai, which were
designated as the SEZs during the early days of China's opening to
the outside world 18 years ago, will all enjoy legislative powers.
</P>
<P>
The move embodies China's determination to adhere to the policy
of reform and opening to the outside world, said Liang Guangda,
party secretary of the Communist Party Zhuhai City Committee and
Wu Bo, director of the Standing Committee of the Shantou People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Over the past dozen years, the two official said, both cities
have accumulated a lot of experience along with its economic
development. The experience, if incorporated in the form of laws
and regulations, will promote its economic growth along a correct
road and avoid some errors and mistakes.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, they said, laws and regulations are badly
needed to guide their international exchanges and help improve the
investment environment of the two cities.
</P>
<P>
The two officials noted that their SEZs are not contented with
the preferential policies given by the state but will tap
advantages as the country's first cities in establishing market
economic structure and cities with rapid economic development to
go on experimenting with reform and opening-up in an effort to
bring about new advantages.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, Laos to Join ASEAN in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia and Laos are to formally
join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1997,
ASEAN Secretary-General Dato Ajit Singh said at a business forum
here today.
</P>
<P>
With the entry of the two states, the ASEAN market will grow
from 320 million consumers at present to 334 million, said Singh.
</P>
<P>
He said that an expanded ASEAN would "generate a huge amount of
business and investment opportunities," and spawn more
sub-regional growth areas, which serve as building blocks for
regional-wide cooperation and integration.
</P>
<P>
However, Singh said Cambodia and Laos might delay their full
economic integration until they have built enough economic muscle
to join the grouping's robust member-economies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said an immediate participation of Cambodia and Laos
in the ASEAN Free Trade Area could trigger adverse economic shocks
because of their current economic structure,
</P>
<P>
They said ASEAN granted Vietnam, which was formally admitted
into the ASEAN last July, three years to prepare for tariff cuts
and the removal of trade barriers.

<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
require international hotel chains operating in the country to
hire locals for managerial positions, the Ministry of Tourism,
Post and Telecommunications said today.
</P>
<P>
A number of leading hotel chains have established
Indonesia-based firms, including Sheraton, Hilton, Holiday Inn and
Southern Pacific, to operate their hotels in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data of the ministry, most of the
hotels are owned by local companies.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it has trained manpower to fill hotel
managerial positions now occupied by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned hotel management firm, PT Hotel Indonesia
International and Natour, currently hires locals for general
managers at 17 hotels.
</P>
<P>
The government estimated that more than 900,000 employees would
be needed in tourism-related businesses, especially in the hotel
industry, in the current five-year development plan ending March
1999.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Funds Should be Sought for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Overseas funds can be a major
booster for agriculture and more efforts should be made to attract
overseas funds for this sector.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made by Zhang Yunfeng, a Hong Kong member of
China's top advisory body, the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, in session here since
March 3.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech in farming will bring high economic efficiency, but
introduction of hi-tech requires large amount of funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that domestic investors, especially financial
institutions, tend to put their capital in industrial and
commercial projects for quick and high returns.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, there are many overseas investors who are
enthusiastic about investing in farming projects in China, which
so far has drawn in billions of US dollars of overseas
investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
To attract more overseas investment for the farming sector,
Zhang put forward a series of proposals, such as granting
preferential policies for hi-tech farming projects, and for
overseas businesses investing in production bases for farm produce
and deep processing projects.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that hi-tech farming zones be established in east
China's Fujian province and south China's Hainan province, as
bases to spread advanced farming techniques across the nation.

<HEADLINE> More State-Owned Enterprises to Be Turned into Profitable  Conglomerates (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to official statistics, 800 out of China's 370,000
state-owned industrial enterprises, own 63 percent of the total
assets and produce 70 percent of the sales income and 74 percent
of the pre-tax profits. These enterprises dominate such sectors as
in communications, telecommunications, petrochemicals, energy and
raw materials.
</P>
<P>
To give still bigger scope to their roles in economic growth,
the Chinese government decided to allow 56 enterprise groups to
pilot China's reform, authorizing them with more decision-making
powers in drafting economic plans, financing, and export and
import business.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the State Council announced that China will
give priority to 1,000 leading state-owned enterprises while
setting others free.
</P>
<P>
Unlike in the previous conferences, NPC deputies present at
this year's session stressed the proper new-scale performance
brought by merger into joint stock partnership, and re-organizing
or by making optimal use of the existing facilities instead of
extending investment scale.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based Pacific Machine-Electronics Co. Ltd, a
business group established on the basis of 33 textile
machine-building enterprises is a typical example in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Before the business group was set up, 20 out of 33 enterprises
were in the red, and 11 products were more or less similar in
varieties and style. The new business group helped build 13
factories with distinctive features each with proper scale in
production.
</P>
<P>
Since the group was set up, it has concentrated on
technological upgrading and transformation, turning loss-making
enterprises into a profitable business group.
</P>
<P>
The plan for establishing large enterprise groups to bring
loss-making enterprises into profitable conglomerates has been
accepted by most businessmen present at the current session.
</P>
<P>
However, some also warned China has to overcome a series of
issues in economic set-up such as separation of power among
different localities, departments and trades and good economic
returns cannot be achieved within a short period of time.

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry Makes Progress in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's Eighth Five-Year Plan
period (1991-1995) saw the fastest development of animal husbandry
in the history of Inner Mongolia, a major pastoral area in north
China.
</P>
<P>
The total number of livestock in the region set a record of 60
million head. It leads the country in the total supply of fur,
wool and hides, and per capita output of grain and livestock.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the region provides neighboring cities and
provinces with three million head of cattle, sheep and pig
annually.
</P>
<P>
A local official attributed the rapid development to large
scale of grassland capital construction over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
To date, 90 percent of herdsmen have said goodbye to the
centuries-old nomadic life. Their average per capita income rose
to 1,870 yuan last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to build a
number of conglomerates with competitive edge in the international
market with the policy of optimizing bigger and superior
enterprises and letting free small ones from its loss-making state
sector.
</P>
<P>
This is a consensus reached by entrepreneurs, economists and
officials present at the on-going session of the National People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex, the fifth largest Chinese
industrial enterprise, plans to become one of the world's 500
industrial giants in five years with 15 billion US dollars in
sales volume and 20 tons of steel output, said Wang Peizhou,
general manager of the complex.
</P>
<P>
The Northeast Pharmaceutical Group, the country's largest
pharmaceutical enterprise, pledges itself to push its annual sales
volume from the current two billion yuan to 10 billion yuan with
350 million US dollars in export volume, said Wu Tingbao, general
manager.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, is expected to
have three to four large conglomerates with 100 billion yuan in
annual sales volume each and another 15 industrial enterprises
with 10 billion yuan in annual sales volume.
</P>
<P>
North China's Hebei Province and Jiangsu, an economic giant in
east China, will build five to ten business giants each with ten
billion yuan in sales volume by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Huang Da, a professor of economics, emphasized the urgency of
such strategic transformation. He said a number of small
enterprises were built soon after New China was founded in 1949.
These enterprises, he said, played a positive role in the
construction of China's industrial system.
</P>
<P>
However, the enterprises, which are small in scale and
technologically out-dated, cannot survive the market competition,
he said. The re-organizing and retooling of enterprise groups will
serve to enhance the competitiveness of the major industrial
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In China, large business giants are vital to national economy
and their role has been emphasized by Chinese leaders on many
occasions. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist Party
of China Central Committee, said in a recent meeting that "a
country's economic development, industrialization and the
improvement of equality in its economy hinge largely on these
major enterprises and their groups."

<HEADLINE> Iran's President Criticized by Press on Rushdie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani was criticized here today by an opposition daily for
his decision of dropping death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a
British writer accused of insulting Islam in his novel.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Jomhuri Eslami said in a commentary that Rushdie
still has to face death sentence because "no one has the right to
change divine command."
</P>
<P>
"It is the responsibility of all Moslems to kill anyone who
would insult the Blessed Progeny of Prophet Muhammad, the Holy
Koran and Islamic sanctities," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani said at Monday's press conference that the
Rushdie issue was not really important.
</P>
<P>
"This decree issued by Imam [Khomeini] can be found in all the
books on Islamic law for the past 1000 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue of Islamic law accepted by most Islamic
jurists. It was not essentially an executive issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini
issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on the
British author for his insult on Islam in his novel "The
Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
The paper criticized foreign reporters attended the press
conference for "being hopeful that the tone of the decree by His
Eminence Imam would be changed."
</P>
<P>
It warned that death sentence is the punishment for anyone who
insults Islamic sanctities.
</P>
<P>
"This punishment has to be done regardless of time, place
and individuals involved. The decree is not a governmental or
personal decree and hence cannot be changed to adjust to new
political conditions," it added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Press Express Support for Boycotting Anti-Terrorism Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese press today expressed
their support for the government's decision to boycott the
international anti-terrorism summit to be held in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon officially announced Monday that it will boycott the
anti-terrorism summit to be held int he Egyptian Red Sea resort of
Sharm el Sheikh Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Defending the government position, the largest-circulated local
daily An-Nahar pointed out that a comprehensive and just peace
in the region is based on the U.N. resolutions concerned, the land
for peace formula and withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the
Arab lands it occupied with military forces.
</P>
<P>
The paper said as the summit is not expected to distinguish
between terrorism and national resistance against Israel in the
occupied lands, there is no need to hold such a conference.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian daily As-Safir quoted "ministerial sources" as
saying that Lebanon and Syria's boycott of the summit also showed
a position refusing to encourage others to have an effect on
Israeli policies and Israeli internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
London-based Arabic daily Al-Hayat stressed that the Lebanese
decision on boycotting the summit came after a series of
consultations at the highest level between Washington, Beirut and
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese officials held that negative influence of the
participation in the summit would be far more than the boycott,
since the Lebanese voice could be hardly heard in the summit and
that the summit could result in an international support for
Israel which is still occupying south Lebanon and western Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
Another Beirut daily Ad-Diyar noted that Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad has been reiterating that he will not meet with Shimon
Peres before a tangible progress is achieved in the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Alias Hrawi Monday called for a "summit
especially to support the peace process and push forward all
tracks, instead of rallying international energies on a subject"
on which every party has a different concept.

Kumaratunga Monday ordered Bank of Ceylon's main branch and a
branch of the National Savings Bank to be reopened in the northern
city of Jaffna as soon as possible, official sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The government has improved the infrastructure and common
amenities in the north of the country and is encouraging displaced
people to return to their homes, said Housing, Construction and
Public Utilities Minister N. S. De Silva.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is now in a position to settle any

</P>

Government troops mounted military attacks on Tamil rebel bases
in the northern Jaffna peninsula last November and December, and
recaptured Jaffna city, the stronghold of Tamil rebels.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Appeal for Research on Technology Development Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Two members of China's top
advisory body called for research into a development strategy for
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in a written speech submitted to the ongoing
session of the National Committee of Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) by He Zuoxiu, an academician of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Gong Yuzhi, a professor of
the Party School of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The proposal says,"The government should work out a strategy
for development in science and technology, taking into
consideration the country's natural conditions, distribution of
resources, environment, population, national strength in science
and technology, and the international situation."
</P>
<P>
"Such a strategy aims to ensure a sustainable economic
development through advances in science and technology," it says.
</P>
<P>
The proponents cite agriculture as an example.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture has remained the weakest sector in China. Drip
irrigation saves water, helps raise yield by 30-40 percent, and is
very adaptable in the dry northern China areas.
</P>
<P>
The technology needs the support of plastic processing industry
and computer technology. That requires government coordination
among different sectors, the scholars say in their proposal.
</P>
<P>
While China's population is concentrated in the southeastern
areas, most of its natural resources are found in its central and
western regions. "China should consider developing technologies
for heavy-load and high-speed transport between the country's
eastern and western parts," the proposal says.
</P>
<P>
Advances in science and technology and their application
require the joint efforts of many departments and industries. That
is where government coordination is needed and why a national
strategy is required, the proposal says.

</P>
<P>
He urged the hospitals to arrange more health-care assistants
to do jobs such as chaperones and clerical duties so that more
nurses could be deployed to other clinical jobs.
</P>
<P>
There are now 18,000 nurses working in 39 public hospitals in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the English daily Hongkong Standard, a recent
survey of 521 nurses and 84 doctors also indicated that public
hospital medical staff and nurses felt there was a serious
shortage of nurses.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 percent of the nurses questioned in the survey
said that the shortage was so serious that they had considered
changing jobs.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by the University of Hong Kong noted that
the shortage was mainly due to harsh working conditions, irregular
working hours and the unpleasant nature of the job.

<HEADLINE> Divorce Database Urged to Be Set up in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers and scholars in Hong
Kong are urging judiciary to help create a database on divorce
trends, South China Morning Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that some lawyers and scholars are worrying
about a sharp increase in marital rifts and they want to discover
the most common reasons for breakups and details of settlements
reached.
</P>
<P>
There were 10,292 divorces in Hong Kong last year, compared
with 5,047 in 1985 and 3,120 in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong University law lecturer Athena Liu Nga-chee has asked
the Judiciary to record details of divorce applications,
including grounds for divorce and the number of children involved.
</P>
<P>
She said that some kind of research program will be conducted
to collect data so as to know why the divorce is on the increase.
</P>
<P>
Sharon Ser, chairman of the Family Law Association, called for
a properly organized database for the family court.
</P>
<P>
She said that it is important in terms of understanding the
development of society as a whole, what changes are happening in
divorce cases.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Cardio- and cerebro-vascular
diseases have become the top killer in Macao, causing more than 63
percent of all deaths in Macao last year.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that among the 1,351 deaths recorded in
Macao in 1995, 854 were the result of cardio-cerebro-vascular
diseases.
</P>
<P>
They included diseases of the circulatory system, which killed
527 people, heart problems, of which 158 people died, and
cerebro-vascular illness, whose death totaled 169, according to
the statistics.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 302 people died of malignant tumors.
</P>
<P>
A local health official said that those figures were normal for
an advanced society because cardio- and cerebro-vascular diseases
are not only related to age, but also related to life style and
food structure.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that in an underdeveloped society,
malnutrition and infectious diseases instead would be the most
dangerous killer.

<P>
NANNING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Research on the history and
social development of China's largest ethnic minority group, the
Zhuang, has made significant progress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 16 million Zhuang people, accounting for 90
percent of the country's total minority population. South China's
Guangxi Province alone is inhabited by about 15 million Zhuang
people.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Guangxi Ethnic Research Institute, which was
established in 1963, have collected 1,000 old books about the
group's writings, literature, arts, history, religion, and
inscriptions.
</P>
<P>
Based on these books and a great deal of research, the
institute has published a number of dictionaries on Zhuang
culture, medicines, poetry, customs, and 2.3 million characters of
academic works about their social development and race relations
with other ethnic groups in China.
</P>
<P>
The research has also attracted many foreign scholars from
Thailand, Japan, the United States, France, and Australia. Chinese
researchers and foreign scholars have had a series of academic
exchanges and joint-publication programs.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui's "Democracy" Ploy Refuted (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After people backed by financial groups or those who are
financial magnates themselves are elected they spare no effort to
seek a payback, which is usually several times the amount they
have paid to get elected, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
They usually engage in real estate, project engineering, public
bidding for projects and so on, so as to get back what they have
paid for the election and more.
</P>
<P>
In the real estate market they use their positions to learn
about urban plans, buy land and then sell it back for a profit.
</P>
<P>
They also secretly provide investors who have special
relationships with them with information about the base prices for
the bidding for public projects, which enables the investors to
win the biddings at prices closest to the base prices.
</P>
<P>
The article says that some of the politicians having
connections with gangsters use them to scare off rivals from
lucrative projects. They also use their positions to become
involved in illegal entertainment businesses and gambling.
</P>
<P>
Those "representatives of the public will" who are elected
through illegal means are usually inefficient, and many "bills"
concerning the public are delayed.
</P>
<P>
Quarreling and fighting on the floor of the Taiwan "parliament"
are common, the article says.
</P>
<P>
In November 1990 a brawl in Taiwan's "Legislative Yuan" caused
over 360,000 Taiwan dollar-worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
In June 1993, more than 2,500 children took part in a painting
contest in Taipei connected with TV programs, and Lee Teng-hui's
grandson drew a picture of the fighting in the "Legislative Yuan".
</P>
<P>
In May 1994, at the meeting-place for the "third amendment to
the constitution" which was supposed to "complete the foundation
for democracy", representatives from the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) threw paper funeral ornaments, set off fireworks,
threw eggs, and smashed desks and chairs. Representatives from the
Kuomintang (KMT) rushed up to the speaker's rostrum to fight with
the DPP representatives.
</P>
<P>
Such "Taiwan democracy" is regarded with scorn by the foreign
media.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, we can see that today's Taiwan, in the name of
democracy, is practicing a political system backed by money,
underworld societies and privileges, which is hated bitterly by
the Taiwan people" the article says.
</P>
<P>
Experiences have proved that votes can better reveal the
electors' will in the education-developed areas where Lee
Teng-hui was attacked most violently, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
In the third elections for the "Legislative Yuan" at the end of
1995, the KMT, which lost in big cities like Taipei, won 46
percent of the votes and 51 percent of the seats with the help of
money and underworld gangs in places outside big cities, because
of the disproportion of population and seats between these areas.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that more and more people in Taiwan, especially
middle class people, intellectuals and young people in the cities,
have come to view Lee Teng-hui as an "obstacle to democracy"
instead of a "fighter for democracy", which is an inevitable
outcome of Lee's "democracy" ploy, the article said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The elections in Taiwan are not
"free elections" and they are controlled by money and underworld
gangs to a great extent, according to a signed article published
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has a long history of election bribery," the article by
Huang Jiashu says, "but it has been increasingly rampant since Lee
Teng-hui took office."
</P>
<P>
In the election for "legislators" in December 1992 each vote
was worth 5,000 Taiwan dollars in Taipei City, and the pay for
electoral agents ranged as high as several million Taiwan
dollars. In some counties and cities in the province the lowest
amount a candidate spent was 100 million Taiwan dollars. In some
electorates the amount surpassed 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Between the end of 1993 and March 1994, runners for township
heads, and members of county and city "councils" unscrupulously
purchased votes overtly, which caused much discontent among the
people on the island. The authorities were forced to investigate
3,090 cases of bribery. A total of 919 suspects were sent to court
and 578 were convicted. Over 280 of those convicted were
"prominent officials" of the county and city "councils". Of the
Taoyuan "County Council" 54 of the 60 "councillors", the majority
of whom are Kuomintang members, were taken to court.
</P>
<P>
To assuage the public discontent, the Kuomintang relocated 16
party chiefs in 21 counties and cities, and punished 628 party
members. "But that was just cosmetic," the article says.
</P>
<P>
In the third "Legislative Yuan" election in December 1995 the
Kuomintang obtained a total of 85 seats, and 23 of the nominees
had over 100 million Taiwan dollars-worth of personal property
each. The number of "billionaire legislators" under the banner of
the Kuomintang accounts for more than one fourth of its total
seats.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 23 billionaires, many others are "invisible
magnates" representing interests of the major consortiums, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
In addition, in recent years the number of underworld societies
has grown rapidly to more than 1,200, with a total membership of
over 10,000, according to 1994 statistics. They set up companies
as "fronts" and put up their own candidates for election. This
gives gangsters control of distribution of Taiwan's political and
economic resources, the article says.
</P>
<P>
In the election for township heads, and members of city and
county "councils" in January 1994, 146 election-related cases of
violence occured, including firearm assaults, threats and
extortion. Some 204 candidates asked the police for protection,
and about 300 of the 858 elected "county and city council members"
have criminal records, the article says.

President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres as
an injection of political tonic to regain strength," it said.
</P>
<P>
The official English daily Tehran Times said in its editorial
that the summit will not achieve any result because it will not
deal with the root cause of the problem, the violation of the
rights of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jomhuri Eslami, a right-wing radical daily, said in its
editorial that "the summit was a hasty move meant to boost the

The daily attacked Egypt for sponsoring the summit, saying
that Egypt "committed the greatest treason ever since the signing
of the infamous Camp David Accord."

<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio today also attacked U.S. and Israel
as "top terrorist" states that are behind tomorrow's
anti-terrorism summit.
</P>
<P>
"Even some Western analysts believe that the U.S. and Israel
are among the main supporters of terrorists in the world," the
Radio said.
</P>
<P>
In two separate commentaries this morning, the radio attacked
the participants at the summit, especially Israel, Egypt and
Algeria, saying that all three countries were responsible "for
the deaths of tens of thousands of people."
</P>
<P>
Another commentary charged that the issue of terrorism, like
human rights, was an "ambiguous" one which was exploited by the
U.S. and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Macao's "Bridge" Role Should Be Better Tapped: Advisor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese mainland should tap
Macao's role of "bridging" with overseas in the course of
implementing its medium- and long-term development program, a
member of the advisory Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) from Macao said here today.
</P>
<P>
He Dingyi said in a written speech that Macao is a free port
with a history of more than 400 years, adding that it was a trade
center that linked Asia with Europe and Latin America in history.

<P>
She cited Macao as having its special advantages in foreign
trade, such as being a free port, broad connections with other
parts of the world, a favorable geographical location and long

</P>
<P>
"In this regard, Macao can play a role as a 'window' and
'bridge'," she said, explaining that many European and Latin
American countries intend to enter the Chinese market and the
Asian market at large using Macao as a bridge.
</P>
<P>
She said the mainland, meanwhile, can use Macao as a
springboard to open up the international market, especially the
European market.
</P>
<P>
Macao can make it easier for the Chinese mainland to have
better access to world economic and trade information, she said,
adding that Macao has the sole information center set up by the
European Union in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Chinese mainland can also boost its tourism
through Macao, which can also help train the economic managerial
personnel, She said.

<TEXT>
<P>
About 90 percent of manufacturing businesses in Hong Kong has
been transferred to the interior areas. In the Pearl River Delta,
three to four million laborers are working in Hong Kong-funded
firms.
</P>
<P>
Cheap labor has reduced cost considerably, therefore products
from Hong Kong-funded enterprises become much more competitive on
international market. Each year, Hong Kong investors are believed
to save 200 billion Hong Kong dollars in wage expenditures,
according to Gao.
</P>
<P>
China is turning its planned economy into a socialist market
economy, and switching the economic growth mode from being
extensive to being intensive.
</P>
<P>
"The changes will not only promote economic growth in China's
interior areas remarkably, but increase economic and trade
cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong to a higher level,"
Gao Shangquan said.
</P>
<P>
Dong Fureng, vice-chairman of the Financial and Economic
Committee of the NPC, said that for some time in the coming years,
the development of labor-intensive industries will remain the
major trend in some parts of the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the industrial structure in being readjusted, and
some labor-intensive businesses are being transferred to the
China's interior areas and other Southeast Asian areas.
</P>
<P>
With regard to securities trading, Dong said Hong Kong is being
challenged by Singapore, Malaysia and other Asian countries. In
the mainland, security securities will undergo tremendous
expansion in the coming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"If the two can support each other in financial and securities
business with coordinated operation, Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center will be much fortified," Dong said.
</P>
<P>
Mun Kin-chok, a senior scholar in the Chinese University of
Hong Kong, expressed his belief that "China's strategic decision
to step up development in its mid-western areas will bring about
new opportunities for Hong Kong business people."
</P>
<P>
The overall economic strength in the mid-western areas is not
strong at present. However, he expressed the hope that the areas
bear marked development potentials with abundant resources and
cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, many Hong Kong-funded enterprises flocked in
the Pearl River Delta, but with less preferencies granted and
rising labor cost, Hong Kong business people tend to move their
enterprises to the country's mid-western areas.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The sustained, rapid and sound
economic growth in China's interior areas in the coming 15 years
is believed to provide still broader space and markets for
business people in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's policy of "one country, two
systems", Hong Kong, after its return to the motherland in 1997,
will still a free port and independent tariff zone, and its status
as an international trade, financial and shipping center will
remain unchanged, according to Chen Ziying, deputy director of the
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest advantage for Hong Kong's present and future
development lies in that it is backed up by the vast and
prospering interior areas covering 9.6 million sq km," Chen said
at the on-going session of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade volume of the mainland exceeded 280 billion US
dollars last year, and the figure is expected to turn 400 billion
US dollars by the year 2000. Chen noted that Hong Kong has become
the biggest trade partner with the Chinese mainland, and total
trade volume between the two increased by 40 fold over that 15
year ago.
</P>
<P>
"In this sense, Hong Kong will be able to rake in higher
profits from transit trade," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Along with the improvement of investment environment in the
mainland, some leading industries and areas need more overseas
funds. Hong Kong can help raise funds for the interior areas by
making use of its status as an international financial center, and
its financial might will, in turn, be strengthened, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Gao Shangquan, vice-chairman of the Chinese Society for
Research on the Restructuring of the Economic System, also share
the view that the mainland's medium- and long-range development
will ensure long-range prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The mainland and Hong Kong have forged close and supplementary
ties, with Hong Kong as an international financial, trade and
shipping center, and the rapid economic and trade growth of the
mainland and its demands for large amounts of funds," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Since China's reform and opening to the outside, business

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Officials Launch Study Boom (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chen Rufang, a 40-year-old
government official in east China's Zhejiang Province, gets up at
6:30 AM every morning and begins reading English for half an hour
before breakfast.
</P>
<P>
He watches the news program of the China Central Television
from 7:00 to 7:30 PM. Then he reviews what he learns during the
day until midnight.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a deputy director of the Hangzhou City Foreign Trade and
Economic Commission, is now studying for a master's degree in
economic management in Zhejiang University in this capital of
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Many officials throughout Zhejiang are now involved in a study
boom, according to Wang Le, deputy chief of the Education Section
of the Organization Department of the Zhejiang Provincial
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that in 1995 some 59 of the several hundred Party and
government officials at and above county magistrate level were
chosen through exams to study full-time for the master's degree in
economic management and administration at Zhejiang and Hangzhou
universities.
</P>
<P>
He said, "But the number of officials such as Chen Rufang
leaving their posts to study full-time is small. While working as
usual, thousands of others at various levels are taking
correspondence courses from universities and colleagues or
teaching themselves in their spare time."
</P>
<P>
They are learning a whole range of subjects, such as English,
computer science, management of human resources, political
theories, administrative laws and regulations, statistics,
financial management, public relations, macro-economics, Western
economics, securities, investment, international finance and
international trade.
</P>
<P>
Chen Rufang said: "We are the oldest students at Zhejiang
University, and are recognized as the most diligent. Almost every
day we go to bed after midnight. The university students in their
early 20s don't understand why we are studying so hard."
</P>
<P>
Wang Tingge, an official studying economic management at
Hangzhou University, said: "A few years ago, when a foreign
businessman asked how many local enterprises had obtained ISO9000
certificates, I did not understand what he meant. After lots of
such experiences I have come to realize that to be a qualified
leading official during the current new period I must lose no time
and spare no efforts to acquire new knowledge."

<P>
BANGKOK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign businessmen including
Thai entrepreneurs have paid less interest to invest in the
infrastructure projects in Vietnam, according to a report issued
by Krung Thai Bank here today.
</P>
<P>
Hanoi's policy to persuade foreign businessmen to invest in the
field of infrastructure reportedly failed due to the high cost of
the investment, the report was quoted by the Thai news agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The renovation of infrastructure in Vietnam requires a lot of
money because all systems would be reinstalled at the first stage,
particularly the improvement of ports to facilitate Vietnam's
international trading.
</P>
<P>
The port improvement was delayed due to the shortage of
facilities and some foreign companies had withdrawn their projects
in Vietnam because of the delay.

<HEADLINE> China Intensifies Compaign against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's procuratorial bodies
dealt seriously with corruption cases last year, according to a
report on the work of the Supreme People's Procutorate (SPP) read
today at the ongoing session of the Chinese legislature, the
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 procuratorial bodies investigated and dealt with 83,685
cases of graft, bribery, abuse of power for personal gains and
dereliction of duties, the report said.
</P>
<P>
SPP deputy procurator-general Liang Guoqing read the report on
behalf of Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the SPP. Zhang was
absent because of illness.
</P>
<P>
Investigation of corruption cases involving high-ranking
officials was regarded as crucial for the counry's anti-corruption
struggle, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 2,262 officials ranking at or above the county
magistrate level were investigated, an increase of 27.9 percent
over the previous year. They included former Beijing vice mayor
Wang Baosen, former vice-chairman of the Guangdong Provincial
People's Congress Ouyang De and five Taian City officials for
taking briberies.
</P>
<P>
Of bribery cases, 504 involved one million yuan or more each.
The most notorious was an illegal "fund raising" case in Wuxi city
of Jiangsu provinve involving 3.2 billion yuan with Deng Bin, a
woman, as its main culprit.
</P>
<P>
Last year, procuratorial bodies also investigated 3,992
law-enforcement persons for law violations themselves, an increase
of 39.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said continued combat against corruption and crimes
and enhanced supervision over law-enforcement is necessary to
safeguard political and social stability and realize the country's
medium- and long-term development programs.
</P>
<P>
The report said the public will be further mobilized to provide
information on corruptive officials, who will be punished
according to law no matter how high their ranks are.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorial bodies will continue to put emphasis on
investigating Communist Party and governmental officials,
law-enforcement officials and those in charge of state economic
affairs. Criminal cases involving officials ranking at or above
the county magistrate level will be handled more severely, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, procuratorial bodies intensified its fight against
severe crimes which endanger state security and social stability,
approving 620,000 arrests and transferring 590,000 to courts for
prosectution.
</P>
<P>
During their supervision over law-enforcement, procuratorial
bodies corrected more than 14,000 unlawful practices involved in
the investigative activities of public security organs, and
corrected more than 2,000 unlawful practices in judicial
activities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, procuratorial bodies dealt with some 5,000 cases
involving an infringement of citizen's democratic rights and
personal rights last year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Urged to Help Improve Shoe Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Shoe Association
has urged the government to take measures to improve the poor
performance of the local shoe industry.
</P>
<P>
The value of shoe exports in 1995 stood at 2.1 billion US
dollars, far below the estimated 2.4 billion dollars, while the
export growth was recorded at only 16 percent, lower than the
targeted 20 percent, Chairman of the Indonesian Shoe Association
Frans Hendrawan was quoted by Bisnis Indonesia here today as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government could favor the shoe industry
by scrapping the value-added tax (VAT) of 10 percent and other
levies burdening the industry.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as the domestic shoe industry still relies
heavily on imported raw materials, the VAT elimination will help
reduce such a dependence since it would promote the domestic raw
material industry.
</P>
<P>
The government has also been asked to assist business circles
in improving quality and productivity of workers in the shoe
industry.
</P>
<P>
Some obstructions are expected to hurt the national shoe
industry, such as slow unloading activities in local ports and
unsteady dispatching schedules. In addition, the shoe industry
has also to cope with legal and illegal levies, import duty on raw
materials, low productivity of human resources and the 10-percent
VAT.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Chambers of
Commerce and Trade (KADIN) has called for the inclusion of all
expenditures of state ministries in the state budget to avoid
government institutions imposing unnecessary levies.
</P>
<P>
This was voiced by KADIN member A. Baramuli in a recent
dialogue among KADIN members, representatives of 23 provincial
KADIN organizations, 70 business associations and several
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue was called to identify various sources of the
country's high cost economy.
</P>
<P>
Baramuli, a member of KADIN's Board of Patrons, called on the
government to consider the scrapping of the authorities of all
provincial offices of ministries and departments to impose levies,
saying that they often introduce unnecessary levies resulting in a
high cost economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Baramuli, the government also needs to establish a
corruption prevention agency with the task of monitoring civil

The UML Party presented a petition Monday to the king asking
for the special house session to table a no-confidence motion
against the present coalition government led by Nepali Congress
(NC) leader Sher Bahadur Deuba.
</P>
<P>
However, it is uncertain so far whether the no-confidence vote
could be passed as the UML Party, although the biggest party in
the Nepali parliament, only holds 88 seats in the 205-seat House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
It needs at least 103 votes to pass such a motion in the
parliament.

UML leaders said Monday that they would begin to lobby for
support from other parties in the parliament to oust the present
government as soon as the special house session was summoned.

<HEADLINE> Top Judge Reports On Crime Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Combating serious crimes and
corruption was the work focus of Chinese courts last year, said
China's top judge.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, reported
Chinese courts' work to the law-making National People's Congress
(NPC) in session here since March 5.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ren said, courts across the nation continued to
crack down on serious crimes with extra force and speed.
</P>
<P>
The crime-fighting campaign was directed mainly against murder,
robbery, rape, criminal gangs, drug trafficking, abduction and
trading of women and children, major larceny, the making and
trading of pornographic materials, corruption, and other felonies,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Amid a national anti-corruption drive, a total of 14,400
embezzlement and bribery cases each involving over 10,000 yuan
were handled last year. Of the cases, 296 involved over one
million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chinese courts handled a total of 496,000 criminal
cases, with over 545,000 defendants convicted, and 219,900
sentenced to over five years in prison, life imprisonment or
death, he said.
</P>
<P>
China made new progress in the protection of intellectual
property rights (IPR) in the past year, with judgement passed over
more than 1,500 cases.
</P>
<P>
Ren said Chinese courts gave equal treatment to domestic and
overseas litigants involved in IPR cases.
</P>
<P>
When handling cases involving foreign citizens, he said,
Chinese courts protect the legitimate rights and interests of both
domestic and overseas litigants by strictly following Chinese
laws, abiding by international conventions signed by or acceded to
by China, and referring to international practices.
</P>
<P>
Ren said Chinese courts protect the legitimate rights and
interests in the mainland of people in Hong Kong and Macao, and
those of people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Chinese courts handled more than 6,600 cases involving
foreign citizens, people from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and
maritime affairs.

KUNMING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Geologists in southwest China's
Yunnan Province have discovered 29 new mineral deposits over the
past five years, according to the provincial Geology and
Mineral Resources Bureau.
</P>
<P>
They have discovered large deposits of gold, silver and other
minerals in the Ailao Mountains, and in the southwestern and
northeastern parts of the province. Two deposits in these places have
been verified as super-large ones.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period (1996-2000) geological
surveys conducted in Yunnan will mainly focus on these areas,
according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, along
with Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and the Tibet Autonomous Region,
has worked out a special program to speed up development of a
mineral-bearing belt in northwest Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
The province has paid closer attention to geological surveys
over the past five years. To guarantee the survey work the
province earmarked twice as much as the average for other
provinces, autonomous regions or municipalities in the 1991-1995
period.
</P>
<P>
Last year the province produced 360,000 tons of non-ferrous
metals and six million tons of phosphate rock.

<HEADLINE> Pemba Students Ignore Govt Ultimatum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A two-month old boycott of
schools continued on the island of Pemba, in Zanzibar this week
defying an ultimatum issued by the isles Ministry of Education
urging students to return to school.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Pemba said today, some 5,000 secondary school
goers continued to boycott classes to demand the reinstatement of
337 students expelled from a college before the general elections
last year.
</P>
<P>
The isles Ministry of Education stated in its ultimatum that
students had five days to go back to school, at the expiry of
which they should consider themselves expelled.
</P>
<P>
Boycotting classes began earlier in January this year after
other avenues to bring back the expelled students failed,
including a high court ruling that the expelled students should
be allowed to come back.
</P>
<P>
Their effort ran foul of a disputed electoral regulation
requiring voters to show evidence of residence for some five
years at the place in which they wanted to register, which was
decried by all election observers.
</P>
<P>
Reports said many students did not report to schools on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted the Deputy Principal Secretary in Education
Ministry, Dr. Said Bilal as saying that anyone who had ignored
the ultimatum should count himself or herself out of school.

DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Business leaders in Bangladesh said
that they would take direct actions if the government and the
opposition could not settle their staggering political stalemate
within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The warning was sounded Monday at a meeting attended by
businessmen representing various trade associations and chamber
bodies.
</P>
<P>
No details about the nature and form of the action were spelled

business by opening shops and plying transports with whatever they
had after the deadline and the government would have to bear all
the responsibilities for any untoward incidents that might take
place.
</P>
<P>
Because of government-opposition disputes over a caretaker
government to supervise general elections and now over the
legitimacy of the ruling party-held February 15 national
elections, the mainstream opposition parties have called one
strike after another to fight against the government, paralyzing
normal economic and social life.

government to provide congenial atmosphere for smooth and
unhindered business activities," Salman F. Rahman, president of

general election under a neutral caretaker government immediately.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided that a high-level delegation of the
business community led by the FBCCI chief would meet with the
president today and apprise him of the decision.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 50 Abductees Rescued in Northern Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Fifty passengers abducted by the
Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels on Karuma-Pakwach road,
northern Uganda last Friday were rescued on Monday by the Uganda
People's Defense Forces (UPDF).
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said the captives were freed at
Koch Goma, 15 miles southwest of Gulu, over 300 kilometers north
of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted military sources in UPDF 4th division
headquarters as saying "our forces pursued the rebels who found
keeping the abductees a burden. They released them and we are
still pursuing them."
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a group of LRA rebels ambushed a 17-vehicle
convoy, 17 miles from Karuma bridge, killing 21 people, injuring
68 and abducting 50. About 242 passengers escaped unhurt. Eleven
vehicles, among them six buses, were burnt by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The military sources said a big force of UPDF has been
deployed in Nwoya and Kilak counties to pursue the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Christian fundamentalist rebels have killed more than 180
civilians in the past week. Eighty-eight people were killed last
Monday in a battle between the army and rebels near Gulu.

<HEADLINE> Owens-Corning to Set Up Joint Venture in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Owens-Corning, an American
building materials manufacturer, has plans to set up a joint
venture in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu Province to produce
extruded polystyrene foam boards for heat insulation.
</P>
<P>
More than 15 million US dollars are expected to be invested in
the joint venture over the next three years, 51 percent of which
will come from the US side.
</P>
<P>
This is the first enterprise to produce the
insulating material in China. It is expected to produce
100,000 square meters of the building material annually, once it
begins operation in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Owens Corning previously set up three joint ventures in
China. Two of them, in Changchun, capital of northeast China's
Jilin Province, and in Guangzhou, capital of south Guangdong
Province, respectively, have begun operation. The third, in
Shanghai, is expected to complete construction by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
China has a lucrative market for new types of building
materials, something that attracted Owens-Corning to make a
long-term investment, said an executive with the company.
</P>
<P>
It has been learned that Owens-Corning will establish a
scientific research center in Shanghai, China's largest city, to
help China increase the use of new building materials.

<HEADLINE> Approval for Hashimoto Cabinet and Party Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Public approval rate for the
cabinet of Ryutaro Hashimoto has dropped sharply from where it was
two months ago when the prime minister took office, two major
Japanese dailies reported today.
</P>
<P>
An Asahi Shimbun survey showed that support for the Hashimoto
government fell 36 percentage points to 61 percent since January
while a Nihon Keizai Shimbun poll showed that 36.7 percent of the
respondents replied favorably as against the previous percentage
of 54.3.
</P>
<P>
Disapproval rate of the Hashimoto government has swelled in the
past two months. It rose from 20 percent to 43 percent on the
Asahi poll and from 21.7 percent to 40.2 percent on the Nihon
Keizai poll.
</P>
<P>
According to Nihon Keizai, Japan's leading economic daily, 48.4
percent of the respondents said that they, disturbed by the prime
minister's plan to use billions of taxpayers' money to help
liquidate the seven failed housing loan companies, thought
Hashimoto's "policies are bad."
</P>
<P>
However, 9.4 percent of the respondents said that they consider
the bailout plan "unavoidable" while 41.7 percent want a freeze on
the money earmarked for rescuing the moribund housing lenders.
</P>
<P>
Less than a quarter, or 23.5 percent, of the respondents want
to see the House of Representatives dissolved for a general
election while 71.1 percent said that they want the lawmakers to
pay attention instead to prosperity and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Of the respondents to the Asahi poll, 88 percent said debate
was not enough on the loan companies while 54 percent said that
they want the bailout money scratched from the fiscal 1996 draft
budget.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion polls showed that the approval for the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party was also affected.
</P>
<P>
Support for the party slipped from 36 percent to 24 percent on
the Asahi poll and it fell 2.6 percentage points to 39.2 percent
on the Nihon Keizai poll.
</P>
<P>
Asahi conducted its survey via telephone on March 10 and 11 and
obtained 1,143 valid responses from a list of 2,000 eligible
voters across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Nihon Keizai conducted its polling from March 8 to 10 and got
valid responses from 59.1 percent of the 3,000 polled by
telephone.

BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Habitats and traces of more than
20 kinds of rare animals under state protection, including brown
eared-pheasants and leopards, have re-emerged in the Beijing area
since 1987.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that now there are 10 to 20 leopards, some 100
jackals and wolves, as well as 50 lynxes living in Beijing's
forest areas, according to today's "Beijing Daily".
</P>
<P>
Beijing boasted rich animal resources in the past. There are
420 kinds of land vertebrates in the area, accounting for 19
percent of the country's total. These animals include more than 40
kinds of beasts, 340 kinds of birds, 20 kinds of reptiles and
about 10 kinds of amphibians. Of these animals, 65 kinds are under
state protection.
</P>
<P>
Since a law on animal protection was issued in 1989, rare birds
are seen again in urban areas and rare animals are found in
Beijing's hilly suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Market for Light-Duty Vehicles to Be Tighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The competition in China's
light-duty automobile market will become more intense this year,
with all the major automotive enterprises setting higher targets
for light vehicle output.
</P>
<P>
The China First Automobile Group, one of the country's biggest
vehicle makers, will manufacture 70,000 light trucks this year,
and the combined output for Beijing-based automobile plants will
stand at 60,000 trucks, according to today's "Economic Daily".
</P>
<P>
Another four mini-truck enterprises, including Blue
Arrow, also aim at an increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the Gold Cup Group, an affiliate of the
China First Automobile Group, will turn out more than 10,000 light
buses this year, as will Nanjing's Iveco, a Sino-Italian joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the big companies' expansion of production
will result in tougher competition, and the market share of
their smaller rivals could shrink sharply.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of competitors will continuously swell, with
more and more agricultural vehicle makers joining the market
this year, according to the paper.

BONN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The People's Construction Bank of
China, following the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Detains Substandard Overseas Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Port authorities in the
country's largest city detained 10 vessels from overseas, for
being too old or unsuitable for navigation.
</P>
<P>
The ship-owners were ordered to have the ships repaired before
they are allowed to leave port.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, ships of this kind have been frequenting ports
in the Asia-Pacific region, because of strict sanctions in
European and American ports.
</P>
<P>
The vessels could damage the port facilities or endanger the
lives of crew and passengers.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of last year, about 9,000 ships were
admitted into Shanghai Port, and the port authority checked 312 of
them. About 160 of these were re-checked.
</P>
<P>
One ship, the "Oriental Alpha", registered in Honduras, was
found to be in worse shape than what was described in its papers.
</P>
<P>
In January and February, three vessels were found to be unfit
for further navigation, if repairs were not done.
</P>
<P>
A Malaysian ship was forced to remain in the port for 14 days
before leaving, because its deck was rotted through.
</P>
<P>
Some overseas news organizations have said that shipping
companies should not allow substandard vessels to go to Shanghai,
and some international inspection groups have asked the port for
security inspection reports to be used as reference guides for
ships' classification.

He pointed out many countries could learn much from the easy
attitude of English players on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
"English football is going through a high at the
moment. Perhaps it is because the people involved are obviously
having fun," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said he was convinced that other countries would do
well to learn from the good English example.

<HEADLINE> Peru Aims to Slash Poverty by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Extreme poverty isn't a new
phenomenon in Peru, but the government aims to cut by half the 4.5
million or so people who suffer from it by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
This year, the government intends to allocate 40 per cent of
its budget in fighting this social disease and the spending per
head on poverty-fighting programs will amount to 176 U.S. dollars,
compared with only 12 dollars in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that half of the country's 24 million people live
in poverty while more than 20 percent, or 4.5 million, live in
extreme poverty, mainly in the rural sierra and jungle areas.
Some 1.2 million children suffer from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to reduce the number of people living in
extreme poverty by two million over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem stems from the deteriorating situation of
the economy in the 1980s, the subsequent economic reform program
set in train in 1990 and production problems in the agricultural
sector, says Presidency Minister Jaime Yoshiyama.
</P>
<P>
He recently stated that the 1997 budget for his portfolio will
give priority to infrastructure construction in zones of extreme
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The government will invest 5.5 billion sols (2.2 billion
U.S. dollars) this year in the plan for reducing poverty which
includes opening food kitchens to feed 1.6 million people,
providing loans to build houses for 50,000 people, building and
renovating 8,000 school rooms which will benefit 300,000 children
and distributing thousands of items of educational equipment such
as teaching materials and laboratory equipment.
</P>
<P>
The state also has plans to boost agriculture by offering land
to the private sector and recovering agricultural land. The
government is planning to build or improve 190 health centers and
160 clinics.
</P>
<P>
Employment is another priority. It's estimated that three
quartersof the economically active population in Peru is
underemployed and only 17 per cent are suitably employed.
</P>
<P>
A youth job program, the Juvenile Employment Program, backed by
the International Labor Organization, the U.N. and banking
orgnizations, plans to train and employ about 400,000 young
people, according to Labor Minister Sandro Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
However, with slowing economic growth -- estimated at just four
percent this year -- the plans mapped out in 1994, when economic
growth was, at 12.7 percent, the highest in Latin America, may be
difficult to achieve.

COLOMBO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has set
up a restricted security zone covering the coastal line around
Colombo, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The zone, extending between Mutwal Fishery Harbor and
Wellawatta Railway Station, has been established to counter any
possible seaborne threat to Colombo Harbor and vital installations
in the city.
</P>
<P>
No vessel or boat will be allowed to enter the zone without
prior approval of the Sri Lankan navy, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The navy will be patrolling the zone and deal with any vessel
or boat contravening the above instructions.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by problems between the
Sinhalese and Tamil -- the major ethnic groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which has been
fighting for a separate Tamil state since 1983, carried out
several devastating bomb blasts in Colombo in the past three
months while government troops mounted military attacks on LTTE
bases on the northern Jaffna Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
With reported LTTE's plans of more bombing attacks in Colombo,
government security forces have adopted stringent security
measures in the capital since late February, in particular its

did not approve of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
French foreign ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
the Iranian President's remarks represent "progress."

<P>
Western countries condemned Iran in the wake of a recent wave

it of supporting terrorists and sabotaging the peace process
between Israel and Palestine. The bomb attacks have killed 61
people in Israel since February 25.
</P>
<P>
The United States has sought to enlist its European Union
partners in an international drive to isolate Iran by cutting off
trade and other ties with it. But Europe has refused, saying it
did not want to break off scheduled "critical dialogue" with
Iran.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Local government officials have
called for special treatment to investment plans signed under
Growth Triangles in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Dubious regulations have effectively hampered the realization
of investment plans stipulated in Memorandum of Understandings
signed under the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle, said
Lundu Panjaitan, chairman of North Sumatra Investment Coordinating
Board in Medan, North Sumatra, recently, according to reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Panjaitan revealed that out of 45 MOUs signed under the IMT-GT
scheme, with total value of 7.4 trillion rupiah (3.21 billion US
dollars), only 10 investment agreements have secured business
permits and some 30 others are still at the proposal stage.
</P>
<P>
Investment regulations requiring foreign investors to team up
with Indonesian partners have also hampered the implementation of
investment agreements. And time-consuming bureaucracy has forced
foreign investors to delay the implementation of their projects.
</P>
<P>
On a separate occasion, East Kalimantan Governor M. Ardans said
the realization of economic cooperation signed among businessmen
participating in the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippine East
ASEAN Growth Area (BOMP-EAGA) has been very low.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 MOUs have been signed, but only one has
materialized.
</P>
<P>
Governor Ardans then called on local government institutions to
 provide businessmen with necessary facilities in order to create
a more conducive investment climate.

young people to the military, German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe
told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the reformed system, servicemen can continue their
professional training when serving in the military and get help
finding jobs on retirement.
</P>
<P>
To make the system work better, the military also plans to pay
tuitions for servicemen learning in colleges and let retired ones
stay in houses offered by the military at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe said the military will advertise recruitment in the media
to reach more young people.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 160,000 Germans refused to join the miliatry, a
record in the nation's history.

<HEADLINE> Wars Between Rival Biker Gangs Frighten Northern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 people have been
arrested following the airport shootouts between rival gangs of
bikers in Denmark and Norway on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police in Copenhagen say they arrested more than 30 people
after Hell's Angels bikers armed with sub-machine guns opened fire
on Bandidos gang members at the capital's airport, shooting one
man dead and injuring three others.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian police arrested more than 10 people after an almost
simultaneous gun battle at Oslo's international aiport, injuring
one person.
</P>
<P>
Both gangs were returning from weekend meetings in
Helsinki. The Hell's Angels and Bandidos, both headquartered in
the U.S., were founded in 1948 and in the 1960s respectively. Both
clubs have set up dozens of branches overseas.
</P>
<P>
Their northern Europe activities have attracted most attention
recently as the region has been the focus of the most strained
relations between the Hell's Angels and their younger challengers
Bandidos.
</P>
<P>
The shootouts are the latest incidents in an escalating feud
between the two gangs in Scandinavia. Tensions rose after a
shootout in the southern Swedish town of Helsingborg on March 5.
</P>
<P>
Most members of the two gangs are retired pilots. They commit
murder and other violent crimes and carry weapons illegally. They
are believed to be battling for a large share of the drug
trafficking, sex and illegal gambling markets.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the crimes committed by motorcycle clubs in
northern Europe are due to the region's proximity to eastern
Europe which suffers from poor legal systems for rampant crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to local police, more than half the members of the
motorcycle clubs in Sweden have criminal records. Branches of
Hells Angels and Bandidos in Sweden are believed to have links
with neo-Nazi organizations.

<HEADLINE> Thailand May Bring Shrimp Dispute with US to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will join other
countries to bring the dispute on shrimp exports to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) if its talks with the United States this
week fail to reach any agreement, a Thai Commerce Ministry
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the US last week listed 53 countries,
including Thailand, as using shrimp catching methods that reduce
the population of sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
According to Pracha Charutrakulchai, director general of the
Foreign Trade Department of the Thai Commerce Ministry, Thai
shrimp farmers are using turtle-friendly technology in compliance
with the international standards, although the technology may not
meet the US requirement.
</P>
<P>
The farmers catch shrimps in mud areas where no sea turtles
live, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the US insists on imposing import restrictions on Thai
shrimps, Thailand will join other countries to bring the case to
the dispute settlement body of the WTO, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The US has threatened to impose restrictions on shrimp imports
beginning May 1 unless Thailand can certify that its boats are
using turtle-friendly technology.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has sent a trade delegation to the US for
negotiations scheduled for March 14-16.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas will write to all political parties seeking their proposals
on the structure of a proposed caretaker government, sources close
to the president said here today.
</P>
<P>
"On receiving the proposals, the president may convene a
round-table discussion of all major parties in a bid to reach a
consensus formula on the non-party government to supervise future
general elections," the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The ruling and opposition leaders agreed to form a caretaker
government to hold the future elections when they met separately
with the president in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
However, the leaders failed to discuss the details of the
structure of the planned government, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition urged President Biswas to promulgate an
ordinance to form a neutral caretaker government for holding fresh
polls by May.
</P>
<P>
The government has refused the opposition's demand and insisted
that the caretaker government bill would have to be amended in the
parliament elected by last month's election, which was boycotted
by major opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, President Biswas,
whose post is largely honorable under the constitution, initiated
these talks trying to find a way to resolve this country's
two-year-old political crisis.

<P>
HANOI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has condemned the
U.S. embargo against Cuba as contravening international law and is
demanding the U.S. end its unilateral embargo, local press said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law, which aims at tightening U.S. embargo on
Cuba, was approved in both houses of the U.S. Congress last week
and will be signed by President Bill Clinton today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for Vietnam's Foreign Ministry described the
U.S. law as being contrary to international law and the trend
toward peace and cooperation for development.
</P>
<P>
"The act, which aims to strengthen embargo measures against
Cuba, is an imposition that causes more difficulties to the normal
lives of the Cuban people, hinders their economic development and
damages trade relations between many countries and Cuba," the
press quoted the spokesperson as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson stressed that in the spirit of the United
Nations' resolutions, Vietnam protests against the embargo and
demands that the United States end its unilateral embargo measures
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law has sparked protest among U.S. allies who
trade with Cuba and have investments on the island.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party Blamed for Blocking  Solution of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi opposition has accused
the ruling party of creating impediment to the solution of the
country's prolonged political crisis by planning to summon the
self-elected "illegal" parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published here today, Sheikh Hasina, president
of the largest opposition party -- the Awami (People's) League,
said that the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) "has set
precondition, trying to summon the so-called parliament of the
February 15 illegal election and thereby give legitimacy to
vote-stealing, which has created obstacle to the resolution of the
crisis."
</P>
<P>
The BNP along with some small parties and independent
candidates held the sixth parliamentary elections on February 15
despite violent boycott by all opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Requested by both the BNP and the opposition, President Abdur
Rahman Biswas held separate talks with the two sides during the
past two days in his initiative for dialogue to resolve the
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
During her meeting with the president Monday afternoon, Prime
Minister and BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia rejected the
opposition's proposal to cancel the February 15 election, saying
that she wants to have the non-party government bill passed by the
new parliament.
</P>
<P>
There was no election of February 15, Hasina said, adding that
"people rejected that farcical election and did not cast their
votes -- a fact reported by foreign and local newsmen, and voiced
by observers, political parties and people from all walks of
life."
</P>
<P>
"Cancellation of this farcical election and a fresh election to
the sixth parliament under a neutral non-party caretaker
government within 90 days is the demand of all," the opposition
leader stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the mainstream opposition parties also vowed to
continue their no-cooperation movement and said that they would
not compromise with the people's demand for resignation of the
prime minister and cancellation of the "farcical" February
election.

<HEADLINE> UN Survey Says 95 Percent of Rwandan Children Saw Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-five percent of
Rwandan children witnessed violence and killings during the
genocide of 1994, a U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) report says.
</P>
<P>
The survey, released today, said children were subjected to
"unprecedented levels of exposure to traumatic events."
</P>
<P>
The report highlighted the findings of a 1995 national baseline
trauma survey by UNICEF's Trauma Recovery Program which
interviewed more than 3,000 children aged between eight and 19.
</P>
<P>
The survey said more than one third of children interviewed had
seen other children take part in killings, 31 percent had
witnessed rapes, nearly 80 percent had lost family members during
the ethnic war between Tutsi and Hutu and more than one third had
witnessed the murder of family members. Almost all of the children
believed they would die during the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF survey concluded that there was no baseline in
modern history against which to compare the magnitude of traumatic
events these children witnessed during the three months genocide
in 1994, which killed more than half million people.

<HEADLINE> China To Reform Criminal Procedure Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A draft amendment to China's law
on criminal procedure was today submitted for examination by the
Chinese legislature, which has been in session here since March 5.
</P>
<P>
The amendment aims to ensure that the rights of citizens be not
infringed upon in criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
Gu Anran, director of the Legislative Affairs Work Committee
under the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
(NPC), made explanations on the draft.
</P>
<P>
China's law on criminal procedure has been in effect for 16
years, he said. The current amendment is to be made on the basis
of combining judicial practices and development for a modern legal
system.
</P>
<P>
Major points of the proposed amendments are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Replacing detention for investigations with custody of the
suspect, with the maximum period of custody set at 30 days.
</P>
<P>
-- Abolishing the system that allows procuratorates to grant
exemption from prosecution, and stipulating that no conviction be
made without court trials.
</P>
<P>
-- Attorneys for defendants will be allowed to counsel their
clients at the investigation stage.
</P>
<P>
-- Improving court trials by giving equal roles to the
prosecution and defence.
</P>
<P>
-- Restricting the scope of investigations by procuratorates,
which henceforward will mainly deal with cases involving
government functionaries' abuse of duties, and focus more efforts
on supervision of law enforcement. And
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing cooperation and supervision among public
security, procuratorial and judicial organs in criminal
procedures.

<HEADLINE> Honduran Investors to Defy U.S. Sanctions Bill On Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of Honduran
businessmen said today that they will defy the United States'
Helms-Burton Bill and continue to invest in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The group is led by Miguel Facusse, the richest industrialist
in Honduras and chairman of the Cressida S.A. Company which has
invested several million dollars in the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Facusse described the Helms-Burton Bill, which tightens
the U.S.'s 35-year-old economic embargo on Cuba in response to
Cuba's downing of two civilian U.S. planes, as "serious and
worrying" for international businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Facusse's brother, Adolfo, who chairs the Honduran Council of
Private Enterprises, said that the United States is not the world
police and has no right to tell businessmen where to invest and
where not to.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States should consider lifting the economic
embargo because investing in Cuba is not an international crime.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate voted 74-22 on March 6 to pass the Helms-Burton
Bill which codifies all existing embargo orders issued against
Cuba by the White House, effectively preventing Bill Clinton or
any future president from rescinding those orders without an act
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
The bill bans foreigners doing business with Cuba from doing
business with the U.S., denies U.S. visas to foreigners who profit
from property that was confiscated by the Castro administration.
</P>
<P>
It also allows U.S. nationals whose property was confiscated by
Cuba to seek in U.S. courts compensation from foreign nationals
who bought their property from the Cuban government.

The move is made as the country faces rising demand for telecom
services and increasing brain drain in the industry.

<P>
The stipulation of the draft law will also serve to build a
clear and honest government, safeguard social order and public
interests, protect the lawful rights of the citizens, promote the
healthy development of socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The plenum also heard a report Amendments (Draft) of the
Criminal Procedure Law by Gu Angran, director of the Legislative
Affairs Work Committee under the NPC Standing Committee. Over the
past 16 years since the law took effect, he said, China has scored
continued progress in the construction of socialist democracy and
legal system, gaining lots of experience in judicial work. With
the changes in social situation, however, some problems prop up,
which calls for additions and amendments to the law.
</P>
<P>
The tasks of criminal procedure stipulated in the law are to
"ensure that evidences of crime are correctly and timely given
testimony and criminals punished by applying laws correctly". "It
must also guarantee that "innocent people should not be prosecuted
under the criminal law" and "the personal, democratic and other
rights of citizens should be protected."
</P>
<P>
The plenary meeting also distributed the remarks in written
form by Cao Zhi, secretary general of the NPC Standing Committee,
on authorizing the people's congresses and their standing
committees of Shantou and Zhuhai the powers to draft local laws,
and their city governments to issue government regulations.
</P>
<P>
Once the draft bill is approved, the four SEZs established to
pioneer China's opening to the outside world will all enjoy
legislative rights. The move will serve to record the experiences
of the four SEZs in the forms of laws and further contribute to
China's future reform and opening-up drive.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition to Lobby for No-Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (UML) will start to lobby for a
no-confidence vote against the government once a special
parliament session is called, according to UML President Man Mohan
Adhikari.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party Monday presented a petition to King
Birendra asking him to summon the special house session to table a
no-confidence motion against the present coalition government
under Sher Bahadur Deuba.
</P>
<P>
An UML press statement issued later Monday clarified the
reasons for the no-confidence motion, accusing the government of
failing to solve the nation's pressing problems including
inflation, corruption and social instability.
</P>
<P>
The petition to the king was signed by 86 UML MPs of the
205-seat House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Under the Nepalese Constitution, the king should summon the
special house session if one-fourth of the House MPs ask for it.
</P>
<P>
However, the UML party, which holds 88 seats in the House,
still needs support from other parties to secure the no-confidence
vote against the three-party coalition government led by the
Nepali Congress (NC).
</P>
<P>
One UML leader said the National Democratic Party (RPP), second
ruling partner in the present government, had assured UML that it
would withdraw from the ruling coalition once the special house
session was called.
</P>
<P>
But UML President Adhikari said Monday that no other party had
promised to support his party and the UML Party would lobby for
the no-confidence vote as soon as the special session is
summoned.

<HEADLINE> Budget Deficit, Challenge To New Australian Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The expected hardship for the
new Australian government to honor its election promises
materialized as the treasurer revealed a budget deficit of 7.4
billion Australian dollars (5.62 billion US dollars) for the
1996-97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The figure fell into the higher end of market expectations,
which predicted a budget deficit between 3 and 9 billion
Australian dollars (2.3-6.8 billion US dollars) for the year.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello said that the coalition government
would tighten fiscal policy by four billion Australian dollars
(3.04 billion US dollars) in each of the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined that fiscal policy will play its part to
lessen pressure on interest rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
He tried to reassure the people against the risk of declining
incomes after the local stock market tumbled and long-term
interest rates soared Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian stock market saw its largest daily fall in four
years Monday after the Wall Street crashed last weekend. Bond
prices also dropped dramatically on the same day. Local analysts
were worried that rising long-term interest rates would boost cost
of home loans and commercial loans, eroding people's actual
incomes and hitting businesses.
</P>
<P>
Costello announced a war against inefficiency and waste in the
use of public funds.
</P>
<P>
"The days of sloth and waste are over," he said.
</P>
<P>
Low ratio of savings to incomes has been the cause of
Australia's increasing foreign debt and widening gap between
overseas payments and earnings. The blowout of budget deficit for
the public sector is certain to drain the limited pool of domestic
funds and push up the cost, or interest rates, of loans.
</P>
<P>
With the economy being expected to grow at a modest rate in the
next half of the fiscal year, the only practical way for the
coalition government to significantly narrow budget deficit is to
cut public expenditures. Curbing waste and inefficiency is
unlikely to produce enough public sector savings to offset the
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy is an investment in Australia's future. It will
enable Australia to sustain higher rates of growth in incomes and
employment without putting pressure on foreign debt and the
current account deficit," Costello said.
</P>
<P>
However, Minister for Finance John Fahey confessed that the
budget deficit figure posed a sterner-than-expected challenge to
him. While the Treasury is sharpening its knife against all public
sectors, his ministry will have to fund the coalition's spending
promises that amount to seven billion Australian dollars (5.3
billion US dollars) in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard announced today that he would be the
head of an Expenditure Review Committee of Cabinet to review
budgetary outlays. After the coalition victory in the March 2
election, he said that the new government would put a higher
priority on honoring its promises over achieving a balanced
budget.
</P>
<P>
The 1995-96 budget was 280 million Australian dollars (212.8
million US dollars) in deficit, rather than a surplus of 115
million Australian dollars (87.4 million US dollars) forecast.

<HEADLINE> 3 Bangladeshis Killed in Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 3 Bangladeshis were killed
and about 250 others injured in gunfight and violent clashes
Monday, the third day of the opposition-launched indefinite
non-cooperation movement across the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press here today, the fierce battle
between violent pickets and the ruling party supporters left 2
people dead and 100 other injured in Dhaka and 50 persons wounded
in the port city of Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
A ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporter was also
stabbed to death by opposition activists in Shahrasti in Chandpur,
a district several hundreds kilometers to the southeast of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
In other districts of the country, violent clashes left more
than 100 persons injured.
</P>
<P>
Sources concerned said that the opposition activists disrupted
inter-district rail-road communications, torched and shattered
windscreens of vehicles in different parts of the country. But air
traffic and river communications were reported almost normal.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties led by the Awami (People's)
League began their fresh round of non-cooperation movement last
Saturday in a bid to press their demand for cancellation of the
ruling party-held February 15 elections, resignation of the
"illegal" BNP government and holding fresh sixth parliamentary
elections under a neutral caretaker government.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Helps Its Poor Fight Drug Crop Plantation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Colombia is stepping
up its battle against widespread poverty which affects nearly one
in three of the population.
</P>
<P>
This year the country will dig deeper into state coffers and
seek loans from international development banks and aid agencies
to improve social welfare, education and medical care and create
jobs to stop impoverished peasants growing drug crops.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the government has carried out a national
development program called the Social Leap Plan which aims to
alleviate poverty which has gripped some 10 million of
Colombia's 33.9 million population and bridge the income gap
between urban and rural dwellers..
</P>
<P>
The Plan forecasts the creation of 550,000 jobs between 1994
and 1998 and says 225,000 new jobs were created in 1995 alone.
</P>
<P>
This year, Colombia is requesting a 94-million-dollar loan from
the Inter-American Development Bank to help finance its Social
Leap Plan and is also seeking 38 million dollars in loans from
other international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
State funds, delivered through a social solidarity system,
reached 1.7 million Colombians in 1995 in addition to the 225,000
jobs created and 166,000 housing subsidies handed out. Funds were
also used in social welfare projects such as education and medical
care.
</P>
<P>
Another 332 U.S. million dollars has been allocated this year to
improve the living conditions of the poorest Colombians.
</P>
<P>
But many peasants, battered by poverty, have no patience to wait
for the benefits of these government programs and have resorted to
growing lucrative illegal crops to earn money.
</P>
<P>
This year, the government will also grant 31 million dollars in
loans to 7,800 peasants as part of an alternative development plan
to incentivize them to switch from growing illegal crops to legal
ones.
</P>
<P>
Colombia is also trying to speed up economic growth. With its
Social Leap Plan well in operation, the economy grew by 5.3
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government has also planned job training programs
to better prepare its labor force for economic restructuring and
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 11 (Xinhua) - Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia today embarked on the road towards normalization of
bilateral relations by signing 10 memoranda on cooperation in oil,
transportation and consular affairs.
</P>
<P>
The memoranda cover the reopening of the Adriatic oil pipeline,
the Zagreb-Belgrade highway, railway traffic, air corridors and
telecommunication and the opening of consulates in Belgrade and
Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
The signing followed one-day talks between Croatian Foreign
Minister Mate Granic and his visiting Yugoslav counterpart, Milan
Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Milutinovic told reporters that the talks were
"meaningful" and had yielded "rich results." The next round of
talks should focus on "very subtle and important political
issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Granic said that before normalization of bilateral relations
could be reached, "there are still some open issues" to be
resolved, such as missing persons and rights of minorities in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our main goal is to reach an agreement on normalization as
soon as possible and, after that, to speed up negotiations on
other important topics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that Granic, who went to Belgrade in January,
will visit Yugoslavia again in April for further talks.

<HEADLINE> China's National Steel Products Wholesale Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Shenyang Steel Products
Market in this capital city of Liaoning Province has become the
country's first national steel products wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Internal Trade recently authorized the new
function of the market.
</P>
<P>
Steel products used to be subject to state allocations, but
started to enter the marketplace in 1987, after the country set up
seven regional markets.
</P>
<P>
One of the seven was the Shenyang market in the northeastern
part of China, where about 560 metallurgical enterprises have
opened sales offices.
</P>
<P>
So far, the market's transaction value has topped 18.5 billion
yuan, with 6.95 million tons of rolled steel sold.
</P>
<P>
The market now ranks first among the seven in terms of
transaction volume and value.
</P>
<P>
As the country's most important industrial base, Liaoning
Province has two giant iron and steel plants in Anshan and Benxi
cities. It produced 13 million tons of pig iron, 12.8 million tons
of steel, and about 10 million tons of rolled steel last year.

<HEADLINE> UN: Iraq's Blocking of Weapons Monitors Is Unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
condemned as "unacceptable" Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. weapons
monitors access to two sites in four days, council president
Legwaila Legwaila said here this evening.
</P>
<P>
After consultations with the Security Council, Legwaila told
reporters that although both incidents have been resolved, the
council remains extremely concerned about Iraq's behavior.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities refused a U.N. Special Committee arms
inspection team entry into an Irrigation Ministry building last
Friday. The standoff ended on Saturday. The second dispute took
place on Monday and was resolved 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
Though the two incidents have been resolved, the council wants
to make it clear that "Iraq is supposed to allow the Special
Commission and its inspection teams immediate, unconditional and
unrestricted access to any facilities, equipment, records and
means of transportation they wish to inspect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under Security Council resolutions, Iraq is bound to disclose
and destroy all materials and facilities relating to its nuclear,
chemical, biological and ballistic missile programs.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Commission is in charge of scrapping these
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Despite these incidents, the second round of talks between the
U.N. and Iraq on an oil-for-food plan started today. Legwaila
said that Iraq's blocking of U.N. Special Committee investigations
and the oil-for-food talks are separate issues.

<HEADLINE> Shantou and Zhuhai to Obtain Legislative Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Shantou and Zhuhai special
economic zones (SEZ) in Guangdong Province, south China, are
expected to be empowered with legislative powers at the current
Fourth Session of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
According to a draft bill of the NPC to be deliberated at the
session, the NPC, China's top legislature, will authorize the
people's congresses and their standing committees of Shantou and
Zhuhai the powers for local legislature, and their city
governments to issue government regulations.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee,
presented a written explanation on the draft bill to the meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
He said the 18th meeting of the NPC Standing Committee, which
had been held two weeks ago, came to the draft decision that
Shantou and Zhuhai cities are eligible for enacting their
respective local laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting suggested that the NPC authorize the local people's
congresses and their standing committees of the two cities the
powers to formulate local laws in accordance with specifications
in China's Constitution and other laws and administrative codes,
and empower the two city governments to issue administrative
regulations to be implemented in their respective SEZs.
</P>
<P>
Four cities of Shenzhen, Xiamen, Shantou and Zhuhai, which were
designated as the SEZs during the early days of China's opening to
the outside world 18 years ago, have been playing a leading role
in beefing up China's economic and trade contacts with abroad.
</P>
<P>
The SEZs of Shenzhen and Xiamen cities were granted with
legislative powers in 1992 and 1994, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The cities have accumulated a lot of experience along with
their economic development, and local legislative powers will help
incorporate such experience in the form of law and contribute to
the country's reform and opening-up, law experts say.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China is considering building a
nuclear power plant in the eastern province of Jiangsu, today's
overseas edition of the "People's Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Bashantou near Lianyungang City has the basic conditions for
constructing a nuclear power plant with four one-million-kw
generating units, experts believe.
</P>
<P>
The site also has the potential to accommodate another two
generating sets of the same capacity.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on March 5 experts examined and passed a
preliminary feasibility study report on building a nuclear power
plant in Jiangsu, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, a fast-growing coastal province, lacks
hydro-electricity and is mainly powered by coal. To ease the coal
transportation pressure and reduce pollution, the province is
eyeing clean nuclear electricity.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu is expected to have an installed capacity of 21 million
kw by 2000 and 39.2 million kw by 2010. In the coming five years
the province plans to increase its installed capacity by nine
million kw.

MOSCOW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The situation in the Chechen

<HEADLINE> NPC To Continue Strengthening Legislation, Supervision of Law Enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's legislature will continue
to speed up legislation and further strengthen and improve its
supervision over law enforcement, said Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC)
here today.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a report on the work of the NPC Standing Committee
at the ongoing Fourth Session of the Eighth NPC, Tian said the
main task of legislative work this year is to establish a legal
framework that suits a socialist market economy and to bolster
supervision over law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The number of laws has kept increasing but the implementation
of some of them has not been good enough, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
"Law implementation has remained a weak link in the judicial
sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-Year Plan starts in 1996, and reform in the next
few years is to concentrate on making a fundamental change in
China's economic system and economic growth mode, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Standing Committee of the NPC will strive to do a good job
in legislation and supervision over law enforcement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Withe the development of a socialist market economy,
legislation has entered a more demanding period," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee will work hard to fulfill law-making tasks
as defined in the Eighth NPC's five-year legislative plan, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said supervision over law enforcement will focus on laws on
a market economy, agriculture, science and education.
</P>
<P>
Tian said important achievements have been made and supervision
over law enforcement improved and strengthened since the Third
Session of the Eighth NPC, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, the NPC Standing Committee examined 28
draft laws and draft decisions on law-related matters, adopted 15
laws and law-related decisions, and approved 11 treaties,
conventions and agreements concluded with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Among the most important were the Commercial Bank Law,
Insurance Law, Negotiable Instruments Law and Physical Culture
Law.
</P>
<P>
On supervision over law enforcement, the Standing Committee's
six vice-chairpersons last year organized 17 teams to examine the
implementation of Agriculture Law, Environment Protection Law, Law
on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women, and the
Anti-Drug Decision, among others, Tian said.

WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- German Steffi Graf recovered
from her foot surgery to defeat Frenchwoman Julie Halard-Decugis
with straight sets in the third round of the Evert Cup women's
tennis in Indian Wells, California on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The world's top player eliminated the 10th-seeded Frenchwoman

</P>
<P>
Halard-Decugis who won two tournaments of the year in Hobart

<P>
In the second set, Halard-Decugis broke Graf's fourth game for
a 3-1 lead and held her own for 4-1.

VIENNA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Austria's two major parties, the
People's Party (OVP) and Social Democratic Party (SPO), today
signed an agreement on coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The 50-page document, which mapped out the job for the new

Chancellor Franz Vranitzky of SPO, Vice Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel of OVP and 17 other participants in the agreement talks.
</P>

The new coalition will have 14 ministers and two state

</P>
<P>
It will take the oath of office tomorrow before President of
the Republic Thomas Klestil and make a statement the following day.
</P>
<P>
Social-democratic leader Vranitzky was pleased with the accord,
a result of months of hard wrangling which ended last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two parties were forced into talks after the National
Council elections last December because neither of them won enough

<HEADLINE> Brazil Could Face Food Shortages in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazilians could face food
shortages this year as the production of rice, grain and corn is
expected to fall for the second year running.
</P>
<P>
The warning came from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics (IBGE) in its first national survey of agriculture,
which forecasts a fall of 13 percent in grain production this year
from 79.3 million tons to 68.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is facing serious problems in grain production partly
because of drought. Rice yields dropped 13.1 percent and soya bean
production by 15.06 percent in 1995, while the first corn harvest
fell by 14.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lower harvests could lead to shortages of meat, the
organization warned .
</P>
<P>
Experts say the drop in the rice harvest in the Rio Grande do
Sul state, one of the biggest rice-growing regions, was the result
of water shortages and delays in planting.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the soya bean harvest was due to three main
factors: the lack of rain, difficulties in obtaining loans and
problems with pest-control.

MOSCOW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today that Russia's opposition to NATO expansion
remained unchanged and it would take corresponding measures to
ensure its interests if NATO goes ahead expanding eastward.
</P>
<P>
Primakov told a press conference after meeting Hungarian
Foreign Minister Kovacs Laszlo that Russia is looking for a
solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass News Agency quoted Primakov as saying that one of
the criteria for a possible compromise would be for NATO not to
advance toward the Russian borders.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister rated the establishment of a new
continental security system as an outlet for the Russia-NATO
relationship in that the system would take into consideration
the anxieties of all sides.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian foreign minister said that Russia's position
would not change his country's intention to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
Hungary considers joining NATO as an integration with the
military alliance, but does not believe it would pose any military
threat to others.
</P>
<P>
Primakov and Laszlo also discussed trade issues during their
meeting. Russia enjoyed a one-billion-U.S.-dollar trade surplus in
1995.

<HEADLINE> Italian Footballers to Go On Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy's soccer players will go on
strike on Sunday for an alleged lack of response over their
demands from the country's soccer governing body, a footballers'
union said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Italian Soccer Players' Association (AIC) spokesman Nicola
Bosio said the AIC made the decision after a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The players had asked the Italian Football Association to
abolish the transfer fees for out-of-contract footballers at the
end of the season.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed concerns about the implications here of the
European court ruling to allow teams to field as many EU players
as they want.
</P>
<P>
AIC officials said they were fed up with a lack of response
from the Italian Football Association and met to decide that the
strike, suggested as early as last month, should go on.

<HEADLINE> Asprilla to Attend Hearing for Charges of Misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Colombian soccer star Faustino
Asprilla was requested on Monday to have a personal hearing for
two charges of misconduct by his England premier league club
Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla, 26, was caught by the Football Association in the
clashes with Manchester City's Keith Curle on February 24.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian star elbowed Curle in the face in retaliation to
be hauled back, and butted the Manchester skipper in a further
clash after the referee whistled the end of the 3-3 draw.
</P>
<P>
In the game, Asprilla scored his first for Newcastle in England
after his transfer from Parma on a club record of 7.5 million
pounds (some 11.25 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
For his actions in the pitch, Curle also faced one charge of
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
The hearing may be set in April when both Asprilla and Curle
will appear, said FA spokeswoman Claire Tomlinson.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla could be banned for a maximum of six games.

<HEADLINE> Otis Elevator Co. Expands Business in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Otis Elevator Company, the
world's No. one in the industry, has achieved great progress in
expanding its business in the Asian-Pacific region and sees China
as one of its largest market in the future.
</P>
<P>
The company achieved 5.3 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in
1995 and its Asia-Pacific share in the revenue exceeded 1.5
billion dollars, 28 percent of the total, announced the company's
president, Jean-pierre van Rooy, at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Eight out of the top 10 contracts awarded to the company last
year were in the Asian-Pacific region, totaling 178 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The Pacific Rim is undergoing the fastest period of economic
expansion in history, growing at five times the rate experienced
in the Western world during the Industrial Revolution," van Rooy
said, "Otis has invested heavily in Pacific Asia over the last 10
years, and as a result, is poised to take full advantage of this
economic shift."
</P>
<P>
The company, which had a mere 43 million dollars in revenue in
Asia-Pacific 25 years ago, planned to continue its dramatic
growth of business in the region, especially in China.
</P>
<P>
Starting with the first manufacturing joint venture in China --
China Tianjin Otis Elevator Company, Ltd.-- in 1984, the U.S.
company has established four major joint ventures in Tianjin,
Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai with branch offices in dozens of
major cities in the nation, employing more than 4,000 Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Otis installations can be found throughout the country -- in
high rise apartments and office blocks, hotels, hospitals,
factories and underground railway stations.
</P>
<P>
The company's president said that his company has kept very
good relations with its Chinese partners. Seeing that China will
rival Japan and North America as one of the world's largest
elevator markets, the company plans to have business ties with
more than 100 major cities in the Asian nation by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Headquartered in Connecticut, U.S., Otis has a strong presence
in the world. Its share of the global market for new equipment is
about 24 percent and for escalator and moving walkway, 23 percent.
In the service business, the company maintains nearly one million
units around the world.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the company's growth and investment strategy, van
Rooy said that it has three primary ingredients: Local companies
with national management and partners; decentralized management;
and technology leadership.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of the company's revenues were generated
outside the United States and about 61,000 of the company's
68,000 employees work abroad.

NEW YORK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks roared back
today, led by economically sensitive issues, as investors refused
to accept Friday's plunging as a real signal to sell.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 110.55 points at
5,581.00.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip gauge of Wall Street dropped 171.24 points to
5,470.45.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues led decliners by 7 to 4. Big Board volume
totaled 449.46 million shares, down sharply from Friday's 544.77
million shares, the fourth busiest day in history.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 3.01 to 342.75. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.52 to 640.02.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 15.10 to 1,078.83.
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose
3.34 to 561.50.
</P>
<P>
Economically sensitive stocks, those that tend to rise during
times of economic growth, were leading the market higher this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Computer stocks moved higher on a smattering of news from that
sector.
</P>
<P>
But banking issues were mostly lower, as investors are less
sure, since Friday, that the Federal Reserve will lower interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were also helped higher by bonds, which also recovered
from a 3-point plunge on Friday. The long bond's yielding was down
to 6.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
This week, analysts said, the market will continue to be
affected by technical conditions and a series of economic data,
including February wholesale price figures on Thursday, and
February consumer prices, industrial production and capacity
utilization, and consumer sentiment on Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Drill Deep Water Oil at Record Depth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Four U.S.-based oil companies
plan to drill a wildcat well in the Gulf of Mexico at a water
depth never before explored, The Wall Street Journal reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shell Oil Co., Amoco Corp, Mobil Corp. and Texaco Inc. will
drill the well to a world-record water depth of 7,625 feet in the
Alaminos Canyon area, about 200 miles southeast of Corpus Christi,
Texas, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Each will have 25 percent stake, with Shell, a major deep-water
play in the gulf, as operator, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
The drilling ship, Discoverer 534, have to undergo a major
upgrade to handle the job. It will be ready to move out of a dry
dock and into the gulf in late March, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The drilling of the well could take several months, and
confirmation of a discovery of oil or gas might not be made for
many more months beyond that.
</P>
<P>
It said that the companies will likely have to perform
extensive survey and drill several more wells before determining
what hydrocarbons, if any, can be recovered.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf of Mexico, the source of some 26 percent of U.S.
natural gas supplies, has yielded significant finds in recent
years, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> UN, Iraq Start Talks Despite Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The second round of talks
between the United Nations and Iraq on oil-for-food plan started
here today despite a U.N. arms inspection team being blocked twice
since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials briefed the Security Council today on the
incidents.
</P>
<P>
An arms inspection team under the U.N. Special Commission was
blocked from entering an underground site about 50 kilometers
southeast of Baghdad earlier Monday. Last Friday, the Iraqi
authorities refused access of a U.N. team to a building of the
Irrigation Ministry. The first issue was resolved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After consultations of the Security Council this morning,
current council president Legwaila Legwaila of Botswana said that
the standoff and the oil-for-food talks are "separate."
</P>
<P>
The talks are focusing on Security Council resolution 986
adopted last April, allowing Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars of oil
over six months to buy food, medicine and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation teams are headed by U.N. Under-Secretary-
General Hans Corell and Iraqi envoy Abdul Amir al-Anbari.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, including ban of
oil exports, after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks between U.N. and Iraq took place from
February 6 to 19.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Homes Sales Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new homes in U.S.
jumped 4.2 percent in January despite the blizzard and bitter cold
in some parts of the country, the Commerce Department reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department said that the sales of single-family
homes totaled 693,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, after
rising 0.5 percent to 665,000 in December.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the lower interest rate was the main reason
contributing to the increase in January. Thirty-year fixed-rate
mortgages averaged at 7.03 percent in the month, down from more
than 9 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The report combined the data for December and January which had
been delayed by the blizzard and partial government shutdown
earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
Until December, sales of new homes in U.S. had fallen for four
straight months as prospective home buyers worried about slow job
and income growth and high levels of debt, offsetting the
attractiveness of falling interest rates.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1995, sales were down 0.9 percent to 664,000, from
670,000 in 1994. It was the lowest level since 610,00 new home
were sold in 1992 as the economy was emerging from the recession.
</P>
<P>
But the sales of new homes in January were quite different in

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb, U.S. Officials Meet on Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister
Rajko Kasagic and visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
International Crime and Narcotics Robert Gelbard held talks today
on the peace accord implementation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
After the talks in Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in
northwestern Bosnia, Gelbard said he was pleased that Serb state
Republika Srpska had good relations and cooperation with the
International Police Force (IPTF) and NATO-led Implementation
Force (IFOR).
</P>
<P>
Gelbard, who is U.S. High Representative for the IPTF, told
reporters it was the position of the U.S. administration that each
side must unconditionally fulfill its obligations in keeping with
the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic said that the talks were mainly devoted to the
unfulfilled obligations relating to the release of prisoners of
war (POW).
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR officials, the three sides in Bosnia still
hold 220 POWS and 160 of them must be released unconditionally and
immediately.
</P>
<P>
"The deadline for the release of all POWS in Bosnia expired on
January 20, and all assumed obligations must be fulfilled," Tanjug
news agency quoted Kasagic as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic and Gelbard had also discussed economic issues,
including possibilities of providing aid to the Serb entity by the
United States and the international community.

<HEADLINE> GM Closes 15 Plants by Brake-making Workers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) --The week-long strike at two
General Motors Corp. (GM) brake plants forced the automaker giant
to suspend production in four more of its plants today, bringing
to a total of 15 idled by a shortage of auto parts.
</P>
<P>
Today's further shut-downs caused by the strike at two Dayton
plants has idled more than 49,000 workers at 13 of the GM's 29
North American assembly plants and two other parts plants.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 United Auto workers at two Delphi Chassis Systems
brake plants in Dayton went on strike from March 5 over safety and
job security issues. The plants supply brake systems and parts to
nearly all assembly plants of the GM, the U.S. largest auto-making
company.
</P>
<P>
Shut down today were the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn.;
truck plants at Pontiac, Mich., and Fort Wayne, Ind.; and a car
plant at Ste. Therese, Quebec of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Informal talks were held over the weekend, but no progress was
reported and no new negotiations were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
After the Dayton walkout is settled, workers at the Lordstown
assembly plant are reportedly prepared to hold their own strike,
also over safety and job security.

<HEADLINE> UK Takes New Steps to Stamp Out Jail Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Home Scretary Michael
Howard announced today that prisoners who are known or suspected
drug abusers would not allowed to have physical contacts with
visitors.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse in British jails has been growing rapidly and the
government would introduce a pilot scheme in nine jails as an
experiment of tackling the drug problem behind bars, the home
secretary said.
</P>
<P>
He said visits were the most common way of bringing drugs into
jail.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, from now on visitors would not be allowed to touch
the inmates or pass items to them. If it proved succeccful, he
warned, the pilot scheme might be extended.
</P>
<P>
In order to crack down on the growing crimes, the home
secretary announced on Sunday that his plans for longer jail terms
for recidivists would mean an increase in the number of prisoners,
hence more prisons may be needed.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that up to 20 percent of those repeatedly
convicted of violent or sexual offences committed a third rape or
serious assault once released, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to have minimum mandatory sentences for persistent
burglars and for traffickers in hard drugs then we will need an
increase in prison accomodation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the imposition of mandatory life sentences would mean
that offenders could not be released until they had been assessed
by the Parole Board which would decide whether they were still a
risk to the public.

<HEADLINE> Strikes Suspends Half of GM North American Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) --Two more General Motors (GM)
plants suspended their production today because a strike at two
brake-making factories at Dayton is choking off the supply of
basic auto parts.
</P>
<P>
In all, more than 60,000 workers in 17 of the GM's 29 assembly
plants in the North American region have been idled.
</P>
<P>
GM's assembly plants at Arlington, Texas, and Linden, N.J.,
halted production today, affecting about 4,000 additional workers.
</P>
<P>
They are the 16th and 17th North American assembly closed since
3,000 members of United Auto Workers (UAW) at Delphi Chassis,
Dayton walked off the job on March 5. GM also has been forced to
shut nine parts plants and limit production at 22 others.
</P>
<P>
No new talks were scheduled today after the week-end informal
fruitless negoations for the eight-day walkout at the two Delphi
Chassis Systems brake plants.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, there were indications that talks with the United
Auto Workers had stalled. No progress was reported over the
weekend and no new talks were scheduled, a GM spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
An additional 14 of GM's roughly 200 parts plants in North
America also have been affected, with some workers being sent home
but production continuing.
</P>
<P>
The GM union workers at the two Dayton plants which supply
brake systems and parts to nearly all of GM's assembly plants went
on strike over safety and job security. The key issue in the
dispute is outsourcing, the production of parts by outside plants
or companies. The union workers fear that it could permanently cut
jobs at the Dayton plants.
</P>
<P>
The union also complained about staffing levels it says has
caused overtime and prevented workers from completing safety
training. Dayton workers make an average of 69,000 dollars a year
in salary and overtime.
</P>
<P>
The Detroit News, quoting company sources, reported today that
as many as 27 of the 29 assembly plants could be shut down soon.
</P>
<P>
GM had an 82-day supply of cars at the end of February and a
79-day supply of trucks. Generally, a 60-day supply is considered
ideal.
</P>
<P>
However, it is believed GM could lose 250 million U.S. dollars
a week if all 29 North American assembly plants are forced to halt
production, said a New York-based financial analyst.

<HEADLINE> Buthelezi Denies Involvement In Kwamakutha Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi today dismissed
allegations that he was involved in the 1987 Kwamakutha massacre
as ''the biggest poppycock I've ever heard''.
</P>
<P>
Bbuthelezi made the remarks this afternoon after meeting
President Nelson Mandela at Mandela's official Cape Town
residence.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's former Defence Minister Magnus Malan and his 19
co-accused, including six IFP members, now faced murder charges
arising from the Kwamakutha massacre and charges of conspiracy to
murder members of political organisations in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen people were killed on January 21, 1987 when gunmen
attacked the home of the United Democratic Front leader Victor
Ntuli at Kwamakutha in Kwazulu/Natal Province. The victims
included four women and six children.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi's name appeared time and time again in the court
indictment, although State Prosecutor and Kwazulu/Natal
Atorney-General Tim Mcnally had not indicated whether Buthelezi
would be charged.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, the South African defence force
under the direction of Malan secretly trained 200 IFP members at
a remote camp in former South-West Africa.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution claimed that a group of IFP members carried
out the massacre after their training.
</P>
<P>
However, Buthelezi, who was chief minister and minister of
police in Kwazulu at the time, claimed that he had been in
possession of information that people were ''actually plotting my
murder and wanted to kill my cabinet colleagues''.

<HEADLINE> Polaroid Works on Digital Camera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Polaroid Corp., the leading
producer of instant photography equipment in the United States,
said Monday that it is planning to produce its digital camera,
which it says is priced less than those of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
The product represents the company's ambition to capture
the share of the emerging market, the Investor's Business Daily
reported today. The company wishes to offset part of its loss from
its selling of instant photography cameras.
</P>
<P>
The PDC-2000, similar to a compact 35mm "idiot camera",
will be in three models that give users a choice in storing the
images. Customers can select a model that stores either 40 images,
60 images, or a "direct connect" version that relies on a computer
for storage.
</P>
<P>
The PDC-2000 camera system has combined professional-quality
images with the ease-of-use features of a fully automatic
camera, according to a spokesman for the company.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that a "megapixel" sensor installed in the
camera allows the capturing of 24-bit color digital images that
can be transferred to any computer or printed at a resolution
level as high as 1,600 x 1,200 pixels.
</P>
<P>
Since PDC-2000 images aren't compressed, there isn't any loss
of image data or visual quality, the company said.

<P>
ARUSHA (TANZANIA), March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government has called on people in the country to witness the
signing into the establishment of the Secretariat of the East
African Co-operation (EAC) on March 14.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming signing ceremony, to be held at Shelkh Amri
Abeid Stadium in Arusha, will be attended by the heads of state

</P>
<P>

transport and communications, trade, immigration, security and
customs, harmonization of fiscal and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
The three countries will also cooperate in areas of Lake
Victoria environment and resources, and in three surviving
institutions of the East African Community - East African

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Demand "No To Closure, Yes To Peace" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- With the closure on the Gaza
Strip and West Bank already in place for two weeks, the
Palestinians are urgently calling for removal of the closure,
reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat condemned the
closure as inhumane and intended to put pressure on the
Palestinians. He made the comment today as the mainstream faction
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Fatah, organized
demonstrations in the Palestinian territories under the slogan "No
to the closure, yes to peace."
</P>
<P>
Food shortages have reportedly developed in the Gaza Strip as
a result of the closure imposed following the first Jerusalem
suicide bus bombing on February 25. Flour has been diverted from
UNRWA stores to ordinary shops. Bakers said they began rationing
pita bread at 25 per family per day, while rice and other grains
are also running short in shops. Perishables and dairy products
are dwindling, if available.
</P>
<P>
Tragedies occur. A two-month-old baby from Kalkilya, Shaker
Sharahni died on Saturday on his way to the hospital in Tulkarm,
15 kilometers away. His parents were stopped for 90 minutes at
the exit from Kalkilya and then 60 minutes at the entrance to
Tulkarm.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military authorities issued a statement expressing
"sorrow" for the infant's death, but insisted that ambulances
should be detained and checked because, in the past, they have
been used to transfer weapons.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Departs For Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
departed today for an anti-terrorism summit in Sharm el-Sheik,
Egypt, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Clinton issued a statement at the south
lawn of the White House, saying that "I am on my way to Sharm el
Sheikh for an unprecedented summit in support of peace in the
Middle East."
</P>
<P>
"America must continue to support those who seek peace and
America will continue to support those who seek peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The will of the people for peace is clearly greater than the
forces of division," Clinton said. "This summit of the peacemakers
can be an important step in the process for peace in the Middle
East."
</P>
<P>
The summit is co-hosted by Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and
President Clinton, and will be attended by leaders and
representatives from more than 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
Clinton condemned terrorist bombings in Israel that killed 61
people since February 25, and said he, along with the leaders of
Mideast nations, Russia, Europe and other countries, will find
ways to "combat those who seek to kill peace with violence."
</P>
<P>
After the summit, Clinton will go to Israel for an overnight
stop to demonstrate sympathy and solidarity with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"In this time of difficulty, in the battle against terror and
the struggle for peace, Israel is not alone," the president said.

<HEADLINE> Turks Mark Anniversary of Gazi Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Around 15,000 demonstrators today
marched to an Istanbul cemetery where some 30 people, killed one
year ago in a rioting in Gaziopsmanpasa neighborhood, were buried.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul police have clamped strict security around the
neighborhood and cordoned off the district, searching every vehicle
entering or leaving the troubled area.
</P>
<P>
But police restrained from entering the area and no violence
was reported during today's demonstration.
</P>
<P>
On the night of March 12 last year, a group of armed men
stormed an Alevi-frequented coffee house, killing one and wounded
10 others. Police reportedly watched the attack and did not
intervene.
</P>
<P>
Alevi inhabitants living in the shabby neighborhood took to the
street, building barricades and began rioting.
</P>
<P>
The killing of a young demonstrator by police sniper increased
the tension which led to the death of some 30 people in
Gaziopsmanpasa and neighboring districts.
</P>
<P>
Government sent troops to keep apart the angry demonstrators
from local police, who were accused as "fascists."
</P>
<P>
Local media portrayed the violence as "sectarian violence"
between Sunni and Alevi communities. But some analysts pointed
out that the rioting was in fact a result of the unfair social
system which barred not only the Alevis but also all the poor
population from their rights of living.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the trial of 20 police officers accused of
killing and wounding unarmed demonstrators has never been
concluded also remains as a source of resentment, said the
analysts.
